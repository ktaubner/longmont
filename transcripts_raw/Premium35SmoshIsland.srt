00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,600

Juniors can, like, you can be an 80 year old junior.

00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,760
No, Bowser, you would be,

38
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,760

00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,800

00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
Hold on.

75
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,760
Lady, lady.

76
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,760
Hey, can you suck my dick?

77
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,760
Lady, just shut up.

78
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:01,680
I'm on the not a spin mission in fucking Tony Hawk's Project 8.

79
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,680
I can't talk to you.

80
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,680
The way he comes up in your head.

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,680
You're like, "Hey, can you suck my stupid dick, you fucking bitch?"

82
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,680
I'm like, "I'm not a dick.

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,680
I'm a dick."

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,680
I'm like, "I'm not a dick.

85
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,600
The lady comes up to the register and you go, "Hey, can you suck my dick?"

86
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,600
Who was that?

87
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Did you hear that?

88
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
Did you hear that?

89
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,600
"Hey lady, suck my dick.

90
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,960
Come behind the counter and suck my dick."

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,080
What is that weird noise?

92
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,040
Nobody tell my manager about that noise.

93
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,720
He's afraid of ghosts.

94
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,400
My manager hates ghosts so much.

95
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,840
If anybody in this restaurant hears a weird voice, it's probably a ghost.

96
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,840
Don't tell my manager.

97
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,840
He'll get too scared.

98
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,640
"Hey, if anyone wants to suck this guy's dick, it'd be pretty awesome!"

99
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,440
*laughter*

100
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,040
"It'd actually be really cool if somebody wanted to put a hamburger in their mouth and then put his penis in between the buns!"

101
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,540
"I don't know, just an idea!"

102
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,440
"Hey, we're selling hot dogs today and by hot dogs I mean my penis!"

103
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,940
Who the hell said that?

104
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,640
"Who's a crabby?"

105
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,640
Woah! Who's this ghost?

106
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,340
Guys, I'm really scared right now.

107
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:00,340
Again, my manager is a shivering old lady.

108
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,840
Oh, my manager...

109
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,040

131
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,060
- You can do that if you want,

132
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,800
but you have to wait a while,

133
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,460
'cause I'm moving out slowly.

134
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,300

135
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,380

Me and Pat and Will and Simon were playing Val last night and we were all fucking around

145
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:45,620

146
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,620
high-pitched voice mod setting and they go

147
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,220
Leprechaun laughing

00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,860
Voice chat and I literally like since last night just all day today

150
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,080
Like I said, it's fun doing a very funny voice with your friends thinking about that laugh

151
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,780
Voice mod is I bought voice mod last night so I could do it. Damn you dropped the $5.99 on no

00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:39,020
And nobody could hear any of the footsteps or anything.

161
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,420
- I just destroyed the whole game.

162
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,140
- Yes.

163
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,500

Hey Pat, there's a video game behind you.

Ah, that's right.

182
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:29,100
That's a little tee up and a home run.

183
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,980
You guys think I'm going to be scared by Resident Evil 2, but you know what scares me more is

184
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,100
Resident Evil 45.

185
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,500
You're scared of listening.

186
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,700
Oh yeah, that's good.

187
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,700
I like that.

188
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:50,340
scared of listening to like music before bed. Do you get scared listening to music before

189
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:54,460
bed turn on a little swans and then bug out in your bed? No swans doesn't make me bug

190
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,660
out swans calms me down. Cameron gets scared of uh. I get scared of happy birthday reggae.

191
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:05,340
Cameron gets scared of happy birthday reggae yeah. Dude it's the funniest like. It's such

192
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,660
a funny song they have like a accountant so every time you just hear start like drumsticks

193
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:19,060
together and just be like oh no the worst round of the game I figured out how to I

194
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:25,900
figured out how to import sounds into voice mod last night so I oh well before

195
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:30,100
I did that I remembered you remembered pants on the ground from American Idol

196
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:36,900
oh yeah of course yeah so I typed it so we were playing we were playing around

197
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,980
and then I we're playing around were we were we ahead I don't remember I think

198
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:47,260
we're very slightly ahead I think we're up by like eight it was like seven five

199
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,220
or something no it wasn't even that bad it wasn't he was really close we could

200
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:58,420
have like they could have won but I typed in pants on the ground

201
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
Team surrender

202
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:22,980
Figured out how to import mp3s, so I made them wait I made Cameron Simon and will wait for like

203
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:29,640
15 minutes probably for me to download and then edit it in Premiere. So it's just the song

204
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,980
Then export it and then import it into voice mod and then I had it

205
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:41,020
I had it like keyed up on a button, but the to stop the button you have to press like

206
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:46,680
Three other buttons. So every time that I would try to stop it, I would end up like playing it again

207
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,860
So it's just be like pants on the ground pants on the pants on the ground

208
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,100
Like a DJ yeah

209
00:10:54,100 --> 00:11:00,620
And we played with this kid. Yeah, I should be a DJ. That would be a good career

210
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,140
I'm that kid we played with oh, yeah, there's a kid who's one you eats his grandma's ass

211
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,640
Yeah

212
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,860
So when we started the round I had I had pants on the ground playing and then I hit the voice thing and then I just

213
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
Said sorry my TV's on

214
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:17,980
Sorry, I'm watching a lot. I'm watching American Idol. Yeah

215
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:24,520
I'm watching the new episode of American Idol. Yeah, my DVR messed up and I only got about five seconds of this episode

216
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:31,420
So it's just gonna be on in the background of my voice chat for the whole game. Yeah, sorry. I can't I can't shut this up

217
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:35,720
Were you guys ever big America? Did you guys ever follow any reality show?

218
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:38,740
I did follow American Idol when I was in third grade

219
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,620
I know I've never followed one, but I've watched some I guess I never watched one like while I was on I

220
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:49,820
I remember my parents were so- they hated Clay Aiken, dude.

221
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,620
Oh dude, I loved Clay Aiken.

222
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,340
When I was six, I loved Clay Aiken.

223
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,260
Nah, they were pro-Rubin.

224
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,260
My parents were too.

225
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,260
They were so anti-Clay.

226
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,260
My parents were too and when Clay Aiken lost, I said, "What the heck?"

227
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,740
And my dad was like, "Nah, he was better."

228
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,740
And I said, "Shut up!"

229
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,740
And I got in a lot of trouble.

230
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:12,300
A lot of trouble for- Oh my god, you told your dad to shut up?

231
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,980
I told my dad to shut up.

232
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,980
I think I tried to punch him.

233
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,980
You tried to punch your dad?

234
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,980
I tried to punch my dad when I was six because Clay Aiken won.

235
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,980
Or Clay Aiken lost.

236
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,980
Damn, if I was him I would have just been like, "Oh, okay, I have a gay son."

237
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,980
Yeah.

238
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
My gay son gets mad.

239
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,980
He gets so mad about Clay Aiken losing, he attacks me.

240
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Yeah, I guess I watched like American Idol and then I watched...

241
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,980
But who's the real winner?

242
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,980
When's the last time you heard of Ruben?

243
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
Clay Aker is he alive?

244
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
Oh Ruben's dead isn't he?

245
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Yeah I think he died.

246
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
Dude I don't know what's going on

247
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,980
but I feel like everyone's dying lately.

248
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,980
It says here

249
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
What did he die from?

250
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,980
Did he die from being a humongous fat guy?

251
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:02,980
It says

252
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,980
um

253
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Fuck where'd that just go?

254
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Where'd what just go?

255
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,980
I've never seen this much white in your eyes.

256
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,380
I mean you were locked on.

257
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:21,500
It says that, okay it says here that Ruben is an American grilled sandwich composed of

258
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:29,540
- that's why my eyes were locked on because I was looking at his sandwich.

259
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,620
No Ruben Stutter is still alive.

260
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:32,620
He is?

261
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,620
Yeah.

262
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,620
Oh my dad must have confused him with Big Black.

263
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,620
*laughter*

264
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
I think my dad

265
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,620
I think my dad

266
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,620
I told him about American Idol and he was like "Yeah, Ruben died"

267
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:52,620
Your dad's fuckin' racist brain was just like "Oh, Big Black is dead, that must mean Ruben stuttered"

268
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,620
*laughter*

269
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,620
He must have died

270
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,620
at the same exact time

271
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:04,620
I don't know, actually a better version of that is that my dad thinks that's the same exact guy

272
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:11,460
He knows both of them. So your dad's like, so your dad finds out that Big Black

273
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:17,500
died and he's like what what do you mean Luther Vandross has been dead for years?

274
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:25,260
Yeah just him thinking that the guy from American Idol and the guy from Rob

275
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:32,340
Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory are the same dude. After American Idol you know the music career

276
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:36,880
didn't really work out he had to give it a job at a factory he's like he hears big

277
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,960
black died and he's like what do you mean the nutty professor is a fictional

278
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:51,400
character yeah yeah yeah yeah big black is dead which is sad I love to watch all

279
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,520
those old clips from Robin big where like every once in a while they just cut

280
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:00,200
to like them in the strip club yeah out of nowhere and it's just them groping

281
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:06,480
women for eight minutes in a 30-minute MTV show. It's good. Yeah, it's a great show.

282
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:12,880
It's the fantasy. What's that one he had like the the alter ego person Bobby Light.

283
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,840
His cousin drama. His cousin no his cousin drama produced. His cousin drama

284
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:24,760
is his alter ego. Yeah. No one, Rob Dyrdek's just like a schizophrenic and

285
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,720
And just everyone on that show is digitally placed in there.

286
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:37,080
The fact that that dude Drama is like a very successful owner of a brand is just insane,

287
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,080
dude.

288
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,760
Oh yeah, he's the young and reckless guy.

289
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Yeah, dude.

290
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:47,200
I mean, he is like the supreme Marfan Syndrome cousin, and he just sits there drooling in

291
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,240
the Fantasy Factory, walking around looking for a TV to watch.

292
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,780
Rob Dyrdek like found helped him found fucking young and reckless which is like

293
00:15:55,780 --> 00:16:00,000
a huge like PacSun brand yeah dude it's like one of the biggest PacSun brands I

294
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,800
think that I think the first one was rogue status if you remember that one no

295
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,920
I should go to rogue status was the one they had the shirt and it was the shirt

296
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,480
it was the all-over print but it was guns and then it was a rogue status dude

297
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,000
that shirt that shirt was fucking tight that way I had a truck fit shirt as a

298
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,720
kid nice yeah I got into because I was I was

299
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:24,440
so in a little way and that I was like I have to support him. I have to support

300
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:31,240
little Wayne. After Katrina, I had to go by TruckFit. I tried to, I tricked the

301
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:36,280
TruckFit social media manager in high school into thinking I did a

302
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:43,640
no-comply over the Carlsbad gap on Twitter. There's a, I can find it

303
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:48,040
somewhere, but there's like a very poor Photoshop of me doing a no-comply over

304
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,480
the Carlsbad gap and I said yo I just did this shit sponsor me and they said hold

305
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:00,600
on hit our DMS let me find let me find the exact thing it said cuz uh there

306
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,320
there was someone else in the replies it was just like yo this is obviously

307
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:11,200
photoshopped don't listen to him. Nah dude he did it yeah he landed it yeah I fucking landed that

308
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,960
shit dude you're a liar. No those pixels around the border cuz I'm going so fast

309
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
That's a blur line.

310
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,960
No, no.

311
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,460
Yeah, I'm actually bending reality.

312
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,960
Yeah, I look like a ghost because like...

313
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:28,320
That white outline around me and the skateboard, that's me breaking the sound barrier.

314
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,920
This was shot on VX.

315
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,200
This was shot on a VX1000, that's why.

316
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,600
Yeah, I shot this on a Motorola Crazer.

317
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,560
And so it kind of fucked up the picture a little.

318
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:43,160
I drew this with a crayon, so it's kind of bad quality.

319
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,160
It's a draw...

320
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,080
Yes, it's not a real photo. It's a drawing of something I actually did though.

321
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,360
Oh, you know what it is? Look, for example, here's another one from the time I was on the sun,

322
00:17:53,360 --> 00:18:02,080
and the sun had a big smiley face. It's a picture of me doing a methadare over El Toro.

323
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:06,000
That's what it is. Nothing you just said makes any sense to me.

324
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:13,600
Yeah. Patrick just rolled two dice that had random words on all the sides.

325
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:17,600
That's kind of embarrassing. I had my in high school.

326
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,600
I was doing a bikini slide on Mr. Monkey.

327
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,600
I was doing a Subway sandwich on Crap Mountain.

328
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,600
No.

329
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,600
You were.

330
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
You actually did do that.

331
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,600
That one didn't have to be photoshopped.

332
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,600
But my username was cuteboy69.

00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,100
It says, "Cuteboy69, A, send me pics or videos, where are you from?"

336
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:53,600

He was behind it.

00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,100
He was ready to pounce.

342
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
His baby was about to pounce on you.

343
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,100

358
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:23,100
The gay guy. Yeah, the gay guy. Have you guys seen roblox recently? They made all the middle the road

359
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,820
Have you guys seen it recently? Yeah, what are you? Dr. Disrespect? Am I right? Yeah

360
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,820
Yeah, I'm basically dr. Disrespect

361
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:35,340
No, they should have done went right when the miss doctor just mr. Disrespect

362
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:40,140
He had his medical license

363
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:44,620
Happen he's mr. Disrespect. No, we should have right when that happened

364
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,300
We should have done episode where we ended it like that or we put on a robot roblox

365
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,980
We could just do it this time and lie. Oh, yeah, we're gonna do that at the end of this episode guys

366
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:57,380
Yeah, we're just gonna do that weird thing. Yeah, keep keep looking out for it

367
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:01,580
Yeah, what does he say at the end of the episode?

368
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,580
It's crazy that in like 24 hours it devolved into this.

369
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:08,580
At the end of the video, it's him just going, "Fuck!" and then running away.

370
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,680
But like people, there's so much conjecture of people being like, "Oh my god, this is something like serious."

371
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,080
Like he like knows something and they're after him or some shit.

372
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,160
And it's just like, he's just like probably going to Facebook.

373
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,540
What?

374
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,080
Like he's probably just switching platforms.

375
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,080
Yeah, no, it was like...

376
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,460
And Twitch got tipped off to it.

377
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:34,060
Yeah, that's like the current and he got like the text. Yeah. Yeah, is that like he's been maybe thinking of switching to

378
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,220
the Facebook like gaming platform or YouTube and

379
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:44,020
Twitch just like got wind of it. They sent cops to his house. And yeah

380
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:50,440
His house. Yeah, that is the funniest shit of all time. Was it his house got shot with a BB gun?

381
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:55,260
No, it was a gun. Oh, it was a gun somebody. Yeah, somebody shot through his window

382
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:02,260
In the middle of him fucking playing a game and he's like what the fuck is that and then he's like you fuckers

383
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,780
My children are here

384
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:12,480
It's awesome. Did damn. Yeah, I'm sick. Yeah. Hey, man, you live by disrespect you die by disrespect

385
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,200
Yeah, you better be ready to get disrespected pal. Yeah, the ultimate disrespect to shoot a drive-by shooting that kills your toddler. I

386
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,300
Mean that's you know

387
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:25,420
Doesn't get more disrespectful than that. Exactly.

388
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:34,840
Exactly. Yeah, man. You're a doctor. You should be used to it. Hmm. Exactly. Yeah, you have a you see how many years of school

389
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,140
Did you do at the university?

390
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,780
I mean, I would have thought you was school

391
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:43,780
Did they not did you not have a class where they'd practice this where you practice?

392
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,180
I mean your gun shot through your window. Honestly, that's what college should be

393
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:52,000
College should not just be like watching movies and yeah

394
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,540
These movies should be like well we went to a very specific

395
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:03,940
College I see that I bet no, but I've been to two colleges and I think three I've been to three

396
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,420
I know more about

397
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:11,980
No, cuz you went to two fake colleges. I went to community colleges, which are more more fucking. Oh, I'm saying

398
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,980
I'm saying even Emerson college

399
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,460
Absolutely undeniably so but I mean like it's basically the same shit at like a state school

400
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,180
We're just everything is like reading a book and being like

401
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,060
Isn't this cool?

402
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,180
Like that. Yeah, exactly

403
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:35,020
But it should be you should there should you they should shoot bullets at your feet like Yosemite Sam and make you and they should

404
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,420
psychological

405
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Experiences that huh? Yeah strengthen you and harden your resolve teach you how to use a Vitamix

406
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:50,060
I just don't think it should be reading your professor should should go what the blazes every 20 minutes and start shooting at your foot

407
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
and your professors should

408
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,540
Be able to have sex with you with no

409
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:59,600
Consequences. Yeah, I mean if you want to have a consenting adult relationship

410
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,860
alright

411
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,860
R.I.P. Mary-Kate Letourneau

412
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:11,400
I'm just saying man. You should be able to you should be able to get you should be able to eat your professor's pussy

413
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,760
That's my boy the movie should be taught in all

414
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:18,320
Columns boy also should be taught in all colleges

415
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,740
Today did they eat the teacher's pussy and grandma's boy - no

416
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,800
It's just it's just a hilarious kind of comedy type film

417
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,980
You know what's crazy is like there

418
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,640
They'll they'll show you like those like movies like the black trommel that fight the tin drum the German movie from 19

419
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,960
Yeah, quiet. Just shut up

420
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Just shut the fuck up right now.

421
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:46,080
Just don't you dare say another fucking word after you say "debunchimal".

422
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,080
Shut the fuck up.

423
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,080
No, "deblechtrummel".

424
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,080
Shut up.

425
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,080
What about our German fans?

426
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,080
We don't have any.

427
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Yeah, we do.

428
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
Hey, you probably do.

429
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,080
The name of that movie is this noise you make when you see a freaking woman, man.

430
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,080
You go "deblechtrummel".

431
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:10,520
No, but in that movie, that movie's about like a guy, a kid who decides he doesn't want to

432
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:14,600
grow bigger than three, or older than he is at three years old.

433
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,280
Like he wants to like mature mentally but not grow any older at three.

434
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:25,280
And there's a scene of just like, he's like an 11 year old boy, the actor's an 11 year

435
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,640
old boy, but they had him like simulate eating pussy.

436
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,040
And they'll like, and that's like high art, but then that's my boy.

437
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:39,640
They have, they have like a, they put it in VR. They make you watch.

438
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,440
Yeah, it had green lines all over it like the Matrix.

439
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:48,040
That, that is no different from That's My Boy with Adam Sandler is what I'm trying to get at.

440
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,240
That's what I'm trying to say.

441
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,640
I think you're right. You should be able to watch Dirty Grandpa in class.

442
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:59,040
You, I don't give a shit about the Criterion Collection.

443
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,840
They should do it, you should be able to do a Marxist reading of Dirty Grandpa for a project.

444
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,320
I need a Marxist reading, I need a Marxist- oh they're fighting back there.

445
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,820
I need a Marxist reading of-

446
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
Oh they're fighting back there.

447
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,820
Yeah but you can actually see them now.

448
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,500
Arrrr they're fighting.

449
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,960
Arrrr they're fighting back there.

450
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,220
Last time I played Sea of Thieves, worst game of fucking all time dude.

451
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Yeah?

452
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:24,740
Yeah, the only funny thing to do in that game, which to me is the criteria for a game being

453
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,540
good, yeah is you just fuck it up.

454
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,900
I would be amazing at that game.

455
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:32,420
You honestly would, because you can just blow up your own ship.

456
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,420
Yeah, dude.

457
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,420
That's...

458
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,880
And just make everyone mad.

459
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
It's so fun.

460
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880
Yeah.

461
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,380
That's the only good part of it.

462
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:43,380
Anyway, today I installed a light fixture.

463
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,380
Nice.

464
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:46,380
And I've had like a headache ever since.

465
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,980
Like it ruined my day.

466
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:48,980
Nice.

467
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:49,980
Damn.

468
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,980
I've had a headache all day too.

469
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
We all have.

470
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,700
I understand why like electricians are all like...

471
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,280
Most paid of all time.

472
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:02,860
paid and also like total like huge like homophobes and racists because I was

473
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:10,360
doing it and I was like I just I was like I want that's the explanation for racism

474
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,760
and homophobia all the problems in the world they just have a headache them

475
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:19,440
headaches and they just they're kind of irritable you know look I'm sorry for

476
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:27,200
tooth at my 2003 comedy special in the intro I did do I did do blackface it was

477
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,480
because I had a headache. I had a headache. I had a real... it was almost a migraine. I

478
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,220
could be honest. Almost. I'm sorry. I'd like to apologize first off to the Laugh

479
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:45,880
Factory audience for my headache induced behavior. You know sometimes I mean I

480
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:51,360
actually suffer from migraines. I said some pretty nasty things. Well let's not even say I did. Let's say the

481
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,960
headache said some pretty nasty things. My headache said some pretty nasty things to some

482
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Afro-Americans.

483
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,960
Kramer saying that on Letterman.

484
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,960
Yeah.

485
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
Yeah.

486
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
But I do. I feel like

487
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
complete shit ever since then.

488
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,960
I was like, I want to break up.

489
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,960
I want to...

490
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
I was honestly sitting there and I was like,

491
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,960
"That's an awfully hot coffee pot.

492
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,960
What if I break it on the head of

493
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,960
Donald Trump?"

494
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I thought that for a minute.

495
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
I was like, "Oh, that's how Eminem does it.

496
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:28,320
angry all the time because he's an electrician. And then he accidentally

497
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,280
electrocutes himself, which when he electrocutes himself, that's why his hair

498
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:35,040
becomes yellow and he turns slim shady. How many times did you electrocute

499
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:42,760
yourself? Over a thousand times and now I have a power. Yeah, which power? Electricity.

500
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,520
X-ray vision. Hey, you're looking great today by the way. Have you been working

501
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:52,320
out? No. He's looking at your penos. He's looking at my penos? Has your penos your balls

502
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,320
and even your butthole been working out?

503
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,320
Cameron's been working out his penis.

504
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,320
You've been working out your butthole.

505
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
With dark experiences.

506
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
I have been.

507
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,320
He's putting his penis through a dark trial.

508
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,320
Actually my penis is going through

509
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,320
an extremely tough time right now.

510
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
Yeah, it's going through a rough patch.

511
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,320
Yeah, your penis is a rough patch.

512
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
That's all it is.

513
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,320
It's like a piece of sandpaper sitting on your

514
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,320
mom's pubis.

515
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,320
You have crystals instead of penis.

516
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:27,880
pal. Whoa! Nice. I'm gonna use my power on you. Yeah, just try it. Dude, I did. I'm gonna reflect

517
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:33,320
it back like a mirror made of glass. I have two mirrors. I have 7,000 mirrors. I live

518
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,720
in a hall of mirrors. Yeah, you do. Cameron has shadow powers, so you might want to watch

519
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,080
out. I have shadow powers. You might want to watch out, because I can basically control

520
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,120
an orb full of darkness that could come out and fly at you. Hey, do you guys want to see

521
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,920
me run across the world and back. No. Yeah, do you want to see me do it again? No, I didn't

522
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,800
want to see it the first time. Do you want to see me do it again and again? No. I'm still

523
00:29:53,800 --> 00:30:00,800
doing it. There you go. Oh, there's another one. Stop, dude. Oh, yesterday. It's distracting

524
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:08,120
me. It's too fast. Yeah, you're distracting all of us. A guy who does that trick to his

525
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,920
friend and he's like, "Want to see me do it again?" And then he's like, "Ahh! Ahh!" And

526
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:19,280
just suddenly a nail in the bottom of his foot. Or you want to see me run around the world

527
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,000
and then just suddenly there's a red splatter on the wall just to the side of him.

528
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,120
He ran two feet too far. Yeah.

529
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,080
You couldn't stop in time. Say it Patrick.

530
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
Sorry. No go ahead say it.

531
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,320
I was just going to say I left my laundry in the laundry. I left my laundry in the washing

532
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,920
machine for like 36 hours. So it smells good? Yeah it smells really good. It means it's really

533
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:49,160
clean. Yeah dude. I don't understand that. Why does water make it smell bad if you leave

534
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:54,000
it in there? I don't know. Can we get a scientist to explain this? Okay here, let me try to explain

535
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,440
this to the best of my ability. Okay break down the molecule science. Alright so what

536
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:05,380
lives in water? Uh your mom. Pee, no pee. No. A poop. No, water lives in pee. What lives

537
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:12,300
in water? Frog? Yes. So now you can understand why it might smell like that. Oh, there's

538
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:19,260
a big frog that makes it stinky. Oh, alright, now I'm understanding. And what does a frog

539
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:31,260
eat? A fly, okay? And when do flies fly around something? All the time. When it smells bad.

540
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,300
Oh, true. I learned that from Rishi Tripes.

541
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:37,260
If you think about it, so that's why water does what it does.

542
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,500
Because flies smell it?

543
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:42,060
Flies smell crap.

544
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:45,900
Flies can fly around crap, which is the water a frog lives in the water

545
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,060
than the frog and the fly and the clothes.

546
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,660
When a frog eats a crap...

547
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,340
You better watch out.

548
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,220
When a frog eats...

549
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,980
You better not cry.

550
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,500
Did you guys know that frogs' tongues don't shoot out?

551
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,800
Yeah.

552
00:31:58,800 --> 00:31:59,920
Pretty crazy.

553
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,620
It just looks like that.

554
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:07,620
that

555
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,980
don't leap. Did you guys know that elephants don't-

556
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:14,340
Did you know that if you kiss a frog it won't turn into a prince?

557
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,020
Yeah, you've tried. Yeah, you figured that out then.

558
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,540
Hey, oh, Patrick, Patrick, I know you went and tried that, but actually have you tried

559
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,540
fucking and sucking off the frog instead? Yeah, I hear that works.

560
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:26,340
Because I think that might work. No.

561
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:30,180
Go try it out, dude. I just burped. And it hurt.

562
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:33,140
I burped and it hurt. I burped and it hurt.

563
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,460
God, did you see that fucking, that picture of the guy-

564
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
I've seen every photo.

565
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:42,260
The one where it's like, "Diss for all my hippies and young rastas on the TL, dread that shit

566
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,260
up man."

567
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,460
Yeah, I did see that.

568
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,660
What is it?

569
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,820
It's just some like white kid with dreads.

570
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
It's you.

571
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
It is, it's Patrick.

572
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,820
No, dude, it looks, Caleb, Caleb, this is an alternate future of you.

573
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,820
Oh my god, dude.

574
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:59,180
I, I, growing up, so I went to, I went on a, a cruise.

575
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,940
If you got really into wearing pumas.

576
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,740
When my parents got divorced, I went on a cruise and uh.

577
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,340
The nice older man.

578
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,760
To the Bahamas with my daddy.

579
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,660
And when I got there I was like, "I'm gonna move here when I get older."

580
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,460
And then I just had this entire life planned out in my head and I was like, "I'm gonna

581
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,500
get big ass dreadlocks, I'm gonna put them up in a bun, I'm gonna wear like a cool drug

582
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:33,860
rug like Jamaican flag hoodie everywhere I go, and I'm gonna work playing steel drums

583
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:39,020
on the street and it's basically gonna be paradise.

584
00:33:39,020 --> 00:33:41,100
And then I started losing my hair and I gave up.

585
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,540
But until then, that was what I was working for.

586
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,220
You should grow out the hair.

587
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,140
You should have dreadlocks made out of two strands of hair.

588
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,100
Dreadlocks just with the long hairline.

589
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,900
Whatever grows out of your hair.

590
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Oh, like a tonsure?

591
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
Yeah, a tonsure.

592
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,380
Like not a tonsure, but also dreads?

593
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,380
Just dreads.

594
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,380
Dreads all around.

595
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,380
Dreads?

596
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:02,380
Yeah, but like a bowl in the middle.

597
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:03,380
Let me see if that exists.

598
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,700
Dude you could call yourself the higher friar.

599
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,540
Oh my god.

600
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,540
You gotta do it now.

601
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,540
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah.

602
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,620
You have like a monk's robe but it's a drug rug just brown all the way down.

603
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
There's a picture.

604
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,620
I can't even laugh at that.

605
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,580
There's a picture of a little kid.

606
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,660
Like the first google image result is a taunter with dreads.

607
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,860
That's so sick dude.

608
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:25,860
I'm gonna.

609
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,860
Damn.

610
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,860
I'm gonna get that.

611
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,860
I wish I looked like that.

612
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Damn.

613
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
You will.

614
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
It looks sick.

615
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,860
Uh oh.

616
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:37,500
This is a picture of a guy with a tonsture and then he's got a swastika drawn on his head.

617
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,020
Oh, come on, dude.

618
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,020
This guy is a freaking Nazi guy?

619
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,780
Come on, dude.

620
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
Wipe that off.

621
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,140
Wipe that off your head.

622
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,140
Shampoo.

623
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Use head and shoulders.

624
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:50,140
You know what?

625
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,140
That kind of reminds me of Adolf Hitler.

626
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,140
Yeah.

627
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:53,140
Yeah.

628
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,140
There's something about this.

629
00:34:54,140 --> 00:35:00,380
There's something about this funky S on this bathroom stall that reminds me of the Adolf

630
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,620
Hitler guy from movies.

631
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:05,940
Y'all this crazy multiplication sign is giving me some unsafe vibes.

632
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,220
Something about this, it's just reminding me so much of Adolf Hitler from Inglourious

633
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Bastards.

634
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,400
Whatever happened to that guy?

635
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,700
This crap is reminding me of the villain from Call of Duty 5.

636
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,700
I swear.

637
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Yeah.

638
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,620
Yeah, it's pretty much Hitler.

639
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:26,620
Yeah, pretty much.

640
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,860
Yeah, Patrick's pretty much Hitler.

641
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Yeah, I would agree with that.

642
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Not Hitler.

643
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,860
I would agree with that.

644
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:36,400
are I'm looking at you right now and if you did go Hitler stash which you could

645
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,020
if I did no I would love to do that you would look just like him there's a

646
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,880
patch right here let's do let's do our own Jojo rabbit and Patrick true Hitler

649
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,040
people but I'm kind of a crazy I'm kind of a crazy silly kind of Hitler character

650
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:06,500
like a silly Hitler yeah and I'm kind of like not normal but it's kind of fun

651
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,880
this movie's kind of gonna make you laugh but also kind of it makes you cry

652
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,040
a little bit kind of makes you think it's a new it's a new type of comedy I

653
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:21,200
love I love when I get in at all I love when I get we all have stupid voices and

654
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,000
I'm just thinking about Hitler yeah I'm just right I'm just like finally a movie

655
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,300
that makes me think about Hitler.

656
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,140
You know?

657
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,980
- That movie was not good. - It's a movie

658
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,340
that's making me reflect.

659
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,820
Like really just investigate,

660
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,460
how do I really feel about Hitler?

661
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,300
- Hey, here's my new movie.

662
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,140
- Hey, you know what?

663
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,140
He is kind of funny in this,

664
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,820
so maybe I was wrong all along.

665
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,780
- If that's really what he sounded and looked like,

666
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,500
you know, he doesn't seem like that bad of a guy.

667
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,320
- Yeah.

668
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,460
- Hi, it's me, it's me, Taka Watiti,

669
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,740
and this is my new movie,

670
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,460
Eagle versus Shark versus the Axis Powers.

671
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:51,700
(laughing)

672
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,900
- Yeah, he should just keep doing that.

673
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,060
where he just plays a silly version of a bad guy.

674
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:57,900
- Yeah.

675
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:58,740
- Yeah.

676
00:36:58,740 --> 00:36:59,740
- I'm Dylan Roof.

677
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,580
Nice to meet you.

678
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,100
(laughing)

679
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,700
- Yeah, it's me Dylan Roof and I got a funny haircut.

680
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,960
(laughing)

681
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,580
- Taika Waititi is absolutely flipping

682
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,180
the Dylan Roof character on his head.

683
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,420
(laughing)

684
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,180
- Oh, he doesn't do it.

685
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:19,380
- Just Taika Waititi with a blonde bowl cut.

686
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,620
(laughing)

687
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,660
- Going to chitch.

688
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,720
I'm going into this church real quick.

689
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,120
- Yeah.

690
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,660
Talk about Christchitch.

691
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:33,380
- My hometown.

692
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,920
- Yeah, basically we made that movie.

693
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,420
- Yeah, we made Jojo Rabbit.

694
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,240
We wrote it.

695
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,240
- Yeah, how about Jojo's Bizarre Rabbit?

696
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,860
- Hitler.

697
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,400
- Jojo's, how about Hitler Rabbit?

698
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,240
How about that?

699
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,240
And it's a big rabbit with that is Hitler.

700
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,240
Okay. Hitler da bunny.

701
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Hitler, yeah. There we go. Hitler da bunny.

702
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
Yeah. That's not bad.

703
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,240
What if instead of the Easter bunny it was Hitler?

704
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,240
And we got a chocolate Hitler for Easter.

705
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Wouldn't that suck, dude?

706
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
That'd be awful, dude.

707
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Just sitting at the bus stop getting pissed off at that thought.

708
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:24,080
That would suck so bad. Hey, come here. Hey you, what's your name?

709
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:30,320
Have you thought about this? What if instead of the Easter Bunny, we actually we had a Hitler instead? What the hell is that?

710
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
dude

711
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
I would

712
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,600
I would melt I would I would leave that my god chocolate Hitler in the Sun

713
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,920
I would let it melt and I would let it melt serious and you know, there would be people who would like it

714
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,920
You know there'll be people who would enjoy it.

715
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,920
Some sick fucking piece of crap

716
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,920
who thinks it's awesome.

717
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,920
Some piece of shit.

718
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,920
Some jerk would want us to celebrate it every year.

719
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,920
Yeah, just, uh, okay, if everybody could just go around the class and say their name, their age,

720
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,920
and one fun fact about themselves.

721
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,920
Uh, yes, my name's Caleb, I'm 23 years old,

722
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,920
and I just would hate it if we had Hitler instead of the Easter Bunny, I'd be so mad.

723
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,120
Yeah, and then when after everyone else gives their fun facts, and they're just like yeah

724
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:22,640
I I actually lived in France for five years and then at the end you're like wow interesting how nobody else said anything about

725
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:30,440
Truth in it and Hitler was instead the Easter Bunny instead of the Easter Bunny that a lot of the people in this class

726
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,720
Yeah might actually be okay with yeah seems like this get over here in the fucking mirror. Let's get over here

727
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,560
France for five years, okay

728
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,800
(laughter)

729
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,680
- Are we gonna talk about this in the class at all?

730
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:46,800
Are we gonna talk about it?

731
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,200
Hitler was the Easter Bunny in this class at all?

732
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,040
- This is, this is--

733
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:50,880
- I've done a lot of reading on the subject.

734
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,280
- This could be computer science, I'm just saying.

735
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,120
It could be--

736
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:57,720
- This class is about, this class is about gender.

737
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,560
This is about gender.

738
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,160
- This is math concepts. - Hitler was a boy?

739
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:04,580
- Okay, well, Hitler rounded up people regardless of gender.

740
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,420
And if you changed him--

741
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:07,520
- Yeah, which I honestly respect.

742
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:12,680
inclusive but honestly if like he was the Easter Bunny though like seriously we

743
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,320
should talk about it yeah okay okay if we can't talk about him as the Easter

744
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,280
Bunny can we at least admit that it wouldn't be all that awesome if he was a

745
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:25,600
tooth fairy can we at least admit that much because I here's one thing do you

746
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:29,160
want Hitler's freaking nasty little grubby hands under your pillow at night

747
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:34,640
and think about it where where where are those where are those coins coming from

748
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:42,640
Exactly. Whose coins are those? What kind of people's coins are those? I don't know, it's just a good question to ask.

749
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,640
Yeah, it's just something to think about.

750
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:49,640
It's something to think about. What about instead of your birthday every day you had to celebrate Hitler instead?

751
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:55,640
Wouldn't that be total crap on a stick? Wouldn't that be so shitty?

752
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,640
Oh my god. It would friggin suck.

753
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,240
You know guys, your silence is speaking volumes right now.

754
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,700
Everyone in this class who's just looking at me with really wide-eyed and red-faced and

755
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,000
not saying anything.

756
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,500
And I see, hey, Mr. Professor, I see you picking up your cell phone and trying to call someone

757
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,720
right now, alright?

758
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,320
Your silence is speaking volumes right now.

759
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,320
I hope that you are calling the Anne Frank Museum to make a donation right now.

760
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:28,840
I'll say this, I'm just gonna say this about it.

761
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:37,480
If we're gonna take down all these statues of Robert E. Lee and Colonel Mustard, we have

762
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,280
to take down the Hitler statue that's in my house.

763
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm just saying.

764
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:48,240
If we're gonna do all this, then I'm gonna need three or four volunteers, completely unpaid,

765
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,240
to help take down this 20-foot Hitler statue in my front lawn.

766
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,720
You guys need to get rid of all my dad's stuff.

767
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,720
Seriously.

768
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,720
I'm serious.

769
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:57,720
Yeah, seriously.

770
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,460
If we're gonna be taking down all these statues, can we at least fucking...

771
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:04,020
Can I get rid of my dad's crap?

772
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,520
Can we get rid of all my dad's weird crap that he has?

773
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:09,420
All my dad's weird Hitler crap that he has.

774
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,220
Yeah.

775
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,420
Man, we've been talking about Hitler for so long.

00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:16,420
Dude, I mean, it's the best.

Hitler being like I am a white Latino

789
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:32,820
That's literally that's literally a character in a Rob Zombie movie there's the he has a midget who speaks Spanish who dresses as Hitler and

790
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,820

Yes, Hitler's tick tocks are very funny, but we're not following anymore. Mm-hmm. I'm unfollowing Hitler today

797
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,780
Or cancel him.

798
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:13,780
Yeah.

799
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:14,780
Cancel Hitler.

800
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,260
Yeah, nowadays Hitler would probably be cancelled if you think about it.

00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,260
Yeah.

802
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,860

00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:42,020
be waiting for your Easter episode, okay? We're waiting on your Hitler condemnation and your

831
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:46,100
Biden endorsement. That's the two things we're waiting on. And we want them at the same time.

832
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:50,160
Same breath. If you do them at the same time, you're just going to be copying us because

833
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,700
we're also right now... Because we're also endorsing Adolf Hitler. Fuck Joe Biden. No,

834
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,700
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

835
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,700
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

836
00:45:56,700 --> 00:46:02,540
president. That's right. Yeah, we, uh, well, you know, we hate Hitler, but just as much

837
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:09,980
as we hate Hitler, we hate copycats too. I think maybe the funniest t-shirt that you

838
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:18,980
can wear is just a white t-shirt in Helvetica that says "I hate Adolf Hitler." Or like

839
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:24,620
it just says Hitler and has like the "no" sign. Just a red circle with a strikethrough.

840
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,620
Because you know people would get mad at that.

841
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:29,780
Yeah, which is that's what would be funny about it.

842
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:31,340
Like what is, what are you mad at?

843
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,620
Oh you're mad at me not liking Hitler?

844
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,620
Is that it?

845
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:35,620
Yeah.

846
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,880
Oh okay, you want me to wear my other shirt?

847
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:37,880
Is that it?

848
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,880
Let me, I have two drawers.

849
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:46,140
One, one all I hate Adolf Hitler, one all I love Adolf Hitler.

850
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,620
The other drawer is just an SS uniform.

851
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,620
It's a dress code.

852
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:54,980
Yeah, you do have that due to your Nazi ways.

853
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,500
Okay, let me flip this shirt inside out.

854
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,140
It's just a photo of Hitler with no X over it.

855
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:06,020
With a thumbs up emoji.

856
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,740
A face-apped smiling Hitler with a thumbs up emoji.

857
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:11,780
We gotta stop talking so much about Hitler.

858
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,780
I don't want...

859
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:15,860
Yeah, I don't want to give his name power.

860
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,820
I hear if you say someone's name a hundred times it brings them back to life from the

861
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,820
dead.

862
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:24,300
more than once I mean you have to say his name three times to bring him up but

863
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:28,340
then to get a say in your times again it's just like beetlejuice where you

864
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:31,060
have to say it three times for him or bloody Mary I was so terrified of

865
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,060
bloody Mary until yesterday yeah you told us about your bloody Mary

866
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:41,740
fear I'm afraid of the drink bloody Mary yeah I'm kind of dude I would never I've

867
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,340
never had one of those I don't think I ever will yeah it looks like tomato juice

868
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,500
No, I do it you know me you know how bad my fucking heartburn is like I don't wanna like

869
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:57,340
There do you guys have foods that like you don't like but you want to like so you eat anyway? Yeah? Yeah?

870
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,340
I'm like that is I don't like

871
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:02,420
That's most of my fucking diet basically like like

872
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:05,660
tomato juice in like a like a

873
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:08,260
What's it called a michelada? Oh?

874
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,980
Yeah

875
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,420
A Michelin tire?

876
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:13,940
A Michelin tire, the kind of tire...

877
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,100
No, it's like a beer with like tomato juice and like spices in it.

878
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,780
But because I just think it's cool, I'm like, "Yeah, I'll have one of those."

879
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,660
And then I drink it and I'm like, "This is the worst thing I've ever had."

880
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:25,860
Yeah, dude, it's fucking beer and tomato juice.

881
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:28,180
A Bloody Mary tastes like fucking shit.

882
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,660
You know in Canada they call them Caesars?

883
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:37,780
You know in Germany they called them Adolf Hitler's?

884
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:45,940
is the one thing we will change. We will change most things. We removed all the flags, we removed

885
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:53,300
all the statues. We have changed our theme song. We have changed. Yeah I love how Germans talk.

886
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,780
We have changed our theme song, we have changed everything else.

887
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:08,820
And then they had to change it. Now it's uh...

888
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:12,260
We have changed all the names of the highways.

889
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,380
We have changed everything. We now have a synthesizer

890
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:20,420
that plays our national anthem every two minutes.

891
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,940
But we will not change the fact that the Bloody Mary is called a Hitler.

892
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:28,420
Yeah, no, he does suck though.

893
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:32,100
Yeah. He sucks a penis, dude.

894
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,300
And we're not being... we're not joking when we say Hitler sucks.

895
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:42,740
are not you and Caleb and I are not joking about it when we say that me and

896
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:47,900
Cameron hate Hitler yeah I do too and Patrick I said a lot of jokes I want to

897
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,700

898
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:55,020

00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:59,020
say just makes me roll yeah and I just want to I just want to I just want to

900
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:02,060
put out there after Patrick said that that Patrick has a twin brother that

901
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:09,100
always tells the truth you said you said emo Phillips and that and then I was just

902
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:21,660
I in my head I was imagining no emo like all right emo Phillips literally Dylan

903
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:31,020
roof that is him a hundred percent oh I'm thinking they're not gonna replace

904
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:38,860
Have you seen him in UHF? Emo Phillips? Oh dude I've seen UHF like a hundred times. I think I've seen that movie more than any other movie.

905
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:44,860
Speaking of just like anti-semitism. Is there anti-semitism in UHF? No there was

906
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:56,420
anti-semitism in my uncle. I know I mean I know he was. Is Weird Al Jewish?

907
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:02,420
sure did yeah yeah his name is I thought he was a I thought he's a fake Jew no I

908
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:06,260
just want to just well I well he's a Christian now I don't know much yeah

909
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:09,980
just well just once it's still a little bit I just want to say Zemo Phillips

910
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:14,540
like the Nazi scientist Zemo from the Marvel Comics that's my parents that's

911
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:22,340
Cameron's pun of the day nice he's not Jewish he's lying that's a parody dude

912
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,340
He was doing his parody, his famous parody.

913
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:33,380
Um, what was I gonna- oh, so my uncle, like, he was obviously, like, doing it to get a rise out of me.

914
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:35,700
He was doing it to get a rise out of you?

915
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:41,860
He walked up to- while I was watching UHF and pointed at the screen at Weird Al and went,

916
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,060
"J-O-O" and then left the room.

917
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:54,500
I think about that every time I watch UHF now, so he did some fucking psychological warfare on me.

918
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:55,940
Yeah, dude, he wrecked your mind.

919
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,260
He wrecked my-- my uncle wrecked my mind.

920
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,620
No, he's not Jewish, dude.

921
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,220
He's not.

922
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,220
That makes that, like, a little bit funnier.

923
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:08,020
Yeah, dude, he's not Jewish at all.

924
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,980
He's fucking-- he just has an accordion.

925
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:14,740
He's just like-- he's just, like, kind of weird.

926
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,700
Yeah, he's kind of--

927
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,020
It's funny that he made that song, he did that song Pretty Fly for a Rabbi.

928
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,140
Wait, so Weird Al has not, never been Jewish?

929
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,780
No, he's not Jewish.

930
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,260
That's crazy.

931
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,060
He's never.

932
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,100
I just did a deep dive.

933
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,500
I thought he was Jewish the whole time.

934
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,700
No, dude, he wasn't Jewish.

935
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:38,740
That Pretty Fly for a Rabbi thing is way funnier now.

936
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:42,420
That he's just some guy who's like, "Yeah, I'll just do a whole song making fun of Jewish people."

937
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,100
Why not?

938
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,580
That's like if his parody of Bad by Michael Jackson.

939
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,260
He's never, never been Jewish.

940
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,580
Instead of fat, he made a song called Black.

941
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:56,420
It was like, "Yeah, I'm black. I'm black."

942
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,740
Are you-- wait.

943
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,020
He's not Jewish, dude. He's never been Jewish.

944
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:03,940
He's not Jewish. He's just got like a-- does he have like a Polish last name?

945
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,260
Seems like it.

946
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,500
His name is Weird Al. Is Weird a Polish name?

947
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:10,740
Yankovic.

948
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:13,460
Yeah, Weird is a Polish-- no, he plays pocas.

949
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:18,340
so I thought he was Polish. I don't know. I think he's just like a- His whole thing is polka, so.

950
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:22,340
He's really honestly kind of handsome. If he didn't have- Oh, Weird Al's hot! If he didn't have girl

951
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:29,140
hair. Weird Al was hot in UHF. People have been talking about this on Twitter, online.

952
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:38,500
Huh. He's Yugoslav. Oh. And he's not- He's Italian and English. You hear-

953
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,620
You hear pretty fly for a rabbi and you just think like he's just like

954
00:53:45,620 --> 00:53:48,900
yeah I just looked it up and it was that it's fucked up because he was the first

955
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:53,220
Jewish guy I ever knew about. Yeah no really really I grew up like there were

956
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:57,460
no like I didn't know of any Jewish kids in my town until I was like 12.

957
00:53:57,460 --> 00:54:04,820
There's the the proof that he's not Jewish is there was a Q&A where someone asked are you

958
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:12,740
Jewish or Polish and he said no. Is that? That's what it is. Both of the assumptions I had, that was me.

959
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:19,220
That was me. I did like a, I did a looper thing or um. Yeah, you did a looper thing called pooper.

960
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:25,220
Oh this is and this the proof for I that's on the talk page, the talk wikipedia page for Weird Al.

961
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:28,900
They're arguing over whether he's Jewish. That was the proof that someone posted.

962
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:32,180
dude

963
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:35,260

964
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:38,860
bit of a this is about this is on the cockpit this is under that this is the

965
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:43,140
talk paid for weirdo yankovic under the heading jewish ok

966
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:47,260
okay in serbia we think he is serbian on the father's side because he is from

967
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:51,500
former yugoslavia and yankovic original spelling of yankovic is common second

968
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:52,140

00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,720
whose music I listen to. Because I don't give a shit. I was just raised like

978
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:43,320
very conservative Christian. It's because you loved Screwdriver. I remember finding out like

979
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,400
Lil Wayne was a Christian I was like okay swag that's awesome and then I found out

980
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:53,760
that T-Pain was a Muslim and it ruined my world dude. Like I couldn't

981
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:58,140

995
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,940
And the response is, "This isn't a forum.

996
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,680
Anyway, if it isn't on the list of songs

997
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,080
by Weird Al Yankovic, then it's not Yankovic."

998
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:58,540
- Do you remember on Weird Al,

999
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,120
did you guys go on Weird Al's website when you were nine?

1000
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,960
- No.

1001
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,880
- He had a whole page.

1002
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:04,920
- When I was nine, no.

1003
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:07,440
- Well, the year I was nine.

1004
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,080
- I don't think I had really any internet access

1005
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,000
besides like eBaum's World and ShoopDaWhoop.com

1006
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,900
until like four years ago.

1007
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,120
- Weird Al used to have a section on his website

1008
00:57:17,120 --> 00:57:19,600
where he would tell you the original artist

1009
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:22,840
of the Limewire song that was attributed to him.

1010
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,740
- Oh yeah.

1011
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,080
- So it would be like Bert and Ernie smoking weed

1012
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:27,680
and he'd be like, I don't know who sings this,

1013
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:28,520
but it's not me.

1014
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:31,540
(laughing)

1015
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,700
- Yeah, I basically growing up,

1016
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,560
I thought every parody song was weird.

1017
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:35,400
- Right.

1018
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,600
- 'Cause I remember, do you remember there was this,

1019
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,020
there was this old Flash animation.

1020
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,840
I was trying to find it yesterday actually,

1021
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:43,400
where it's just like somebody singing the ABC song.

1022
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:44,600
And then at the end it's like,

1023
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,120
Next time, or, now I know my ABCs,

1024
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,960
next time won't you suck my dick, you stupid bitch?

1025
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,320
And as a kid I was like,

1026
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:56,680
that's Weird Al's like raunchy song.

1027
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,480
- Yeah, Weird Al said a swear this time.

1028
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,200
Oh, Elmo's Got a Gun, that's not Weird Al.

1029
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,240
- It's not Weird Al?

1030
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,080
- No.

1031
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,040
- No way.

1032
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:08,040
- No, I think, I don't know what it's from,

1033
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,320
but I found that out, I forget the artist's name.

1034
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,020
- It says a song by Weird Al Yankovic.

1035
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:13,960
- It's not.

1036
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,360
- Elmo's Got a Gun. - Oh no, it's a parody song

1037
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,760
by Tommy and Rumble.

1038
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:18,600
- Yeah. - Tommy and Rumble.

1039
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:20,960
- It was a radio show, it was a radio show,

1040
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:24,600
like a AM shock jock thing, or FM, but--

1041
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,160
- Everybody, all of the like lyric pages say it's--

1042
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:28,840
- Yeah. - Yeah, it's not.

1043
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,600
- It's fucked up. - That's so weird.

1044
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:31,680
- Yeah.

1045
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,920
Weird Al would never do AAVE in a song, I don't think.

1046
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,960
(laughing)

1047
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:40,280
Like at the end of Elmo's Got a Gun, where he's like,

1048
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,960
you want me to walk around Sesame Street

1049
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:48,640
bullet without a bulletproof vest. Patrick on the other hand more than willing. The

1050
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,280
second Patrick gets fired he just fires off a thousand of them in one episode. Yeah he

1051
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:59,120
talks about Hitler for an hour he fucking he can't stop dude. What's wrong with you

1052
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,480
dude you're kind of like the Hitler of this podcast. I'm not like that yeah

1053
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:07,840
because I'm a tyrant. Yeah he said yes. He said yes. He said yes. No I'm not like Hitler.

1054
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,040
And you were smiling.

1055
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,440
I am not like Hitler.

1056
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,200
Let me make this clear.

1057
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:14,200
I am not like Hitler.

1058
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,200
Uh oh, let me be clear.

1059
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,200
Let me be clear.

1060
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:19,680
I think you're talking into a mirror and it's reversing all the knots on your words.

1061
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,840
Just want to put that out there.

1062
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,160
I am ton Hitler.

1063
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,160
That's true.

1064
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:27,160
You're one ton Hitler.

1065
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,160
That is correct.

1066
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,160
You are one ton Hitler.

1067
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:30,160
No, I'm not.

1068
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:35,520
Yo, yeah, this is my boy Squeezy.

1069
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:40,280
This is Brizzy and this is One Ton Hitler.

1070
00:59:40,280 --> 00:59:46,200
And we're kinda like the best fucking janitors at the school, so you might wanna respect us.

1071
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,520
Yo One Ton, which One Ton?

1072
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,080
One Ton Hitler, come over here.

1073
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,440
Oh I found, I found the songs, not by Weird Al.

1074
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:00,960
One Ton Hitler has to be like a Wu-Tang demo.

1075
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,480
Shaolin Hitler.

1076
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,480
Yeah, you don't want to know what the 36 chambers were.

1077
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,480
Yeah.

1078
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,480
I just got that.

1079
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:17,480
Yeah, because you're Hitler and Hitler wasn't very smart.

1080
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,480
No.

1081
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:19,480
You're the total.

1082
01:00:19,480 --> 01:00:20,480
I'm not Hitler.

1083
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:25,480
I'm looking at the songs not by Weird Al.

1084
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:27,480
What's that?

1085
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,480
It's the Weird Al.

1086
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,480
It's a list of every song that's not by Weird Al.

1087
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:37,040
It was Weird Al's website and it says "Not by Al" and it says these songs are not by Weird Al.

1088
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:39,280
And it says uh...

1089
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,280
One of them is just called "Bomb Iraq".

1090
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:41,780

My fart will go on and on.

1095
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:59,600

This song is by a group named Asian Pride.

1134
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:15,780
He's like, "David Icke, a lot of interesting ideas, folks.

1135
01:03:15,780 --> 01:03:18,540
Champions Club, we're going to get through this.

1136
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,020
Weird Al is not Jewish.

1137
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:22,460
David Icke told me that.

1138
01:03:22,460 --> 01:03:26,780
Stuff's weird right now, if I'm being honest."

1139
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:27,780
"We're going to get through this.

1140
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,780
We're going to get through this."

1141
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,780
"Fuck!"

1142
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:30,780

"Alright, bye guys."

1145
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,780
"I like to eat poop."

1146
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,180
Yeah, that was what he said right after "fuck."

1147
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:37,700
He said, "I like to eat poop."
