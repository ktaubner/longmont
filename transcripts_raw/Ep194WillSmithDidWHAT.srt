Yeah, because I totally recall that movie.

21
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,880
Yeah, no, I totally recall that movie.

22
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,880
Not just one scene in it.

23
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,780

That's not a water bug.

30
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,980
A water bug is a cockroach.

31
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,480
A water bug would be in water, too.

32
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,480
And it's swimming on the ceiling.

33
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Water bugs, first of all, they're not in water.

34
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,920
I just noticed that the second we press record. I was looking at it and I was

35
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,840
hoping nobody else would notice because I know you guys have a fear of bugs. If you

36
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,160
swat that towards me, I will fuck you up. Just leave it alone. I hate bugs man.

37
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:15,240
Stop. Dude, what are you doing? Why are you doing that? This is you. That's you.

38
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:20,800
No one can see that. I've had a hard couple days. Antifa stole my

39
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,080
backpack. Oh really? Antifa stole my backpack. You didn't just forget it in

40
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:28,440
the front of the in front of the office. And then they put it back, they put it

41
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,200
back. Because that's their whole thing. They take shit and then they redistribute it.

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,800
Turned out like Robin Hood. Yeah, robbing hood. Yeah, they robbed my hood and

43
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,040
they took my backpack and then they put it back in a place where I might have

44
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,960
left it. And they tried to frame myself for losing the backpack. We were like

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:51,880
driving somewhere this weekend you were like, dude I don't know I totally like

00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,400

00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,520
this have you been in well, that's what because I haven't made a choice. It's

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,720
one because it's like it couldn't go either way. You know yeah, have you been

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:00,140

60
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:04,020
I did the shoes on the knees thing and I have not performed a wicked since because

00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,620
Really?

66
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,620
Yeah.

67
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,620
There was not a single little person.

68
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,620
There's not a little dancing little person?

69
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:29,620
Dude, I was hoping for it and then the guy comes out and he's like, "You're never gonna

70
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,180
trick me or I'm not the best munchkin in munchkin land."

71
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,740
And he's a normal size guy.

72
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,900
Yeah, he's like 5'7".

73
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,740
I audibly went like, "Ugh."

74
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:40,860
Well, let's not call 5'7" a normal size.

75
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,420
He was actually a little bit short.

76
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,420
He wasn't munchkin status.

77
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,420
Yeah, 5'7", yeah, short.

78
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,420
He wasn't like, you know, I would say this.

79
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,420
He wasn't like no

80
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:52,220
Average there's a difference between stage munchkin and movie munchkin. That is true

81
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:57,540
Yeah, you still like they need to still be tall so you can see them from the back. That's true. That's a good point. Yeah

82
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:04,140
Yeah, I've had this crazy tooth problem. It's gonna derail the whole tour really. Mm-hmm. You need to go to

90
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,640

91
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,800
think so. I think so, because I think you said that and I was like, oh, like a

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,440
snake and you're like what and I was like, oh, snakes grow fangs when they're

93
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,840
babies to get out of the egg. I think I remember that. Is that true? Yeah, they

94
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,880
have something called an egg. My mom laid me in an egg. That's not true. Okay,

95
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,040
prove it. Where's the shell? Ate it. Ate it to get out. You don't eat the shell

96
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,080
to get out. You break it. You can't eat the shell. You eat the yolk. You eat the

97
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:26,820
the

98
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,860
that must be the boogers all right. I'm more comfortable with eating a baby's

99
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,540
boogers and a baby is the same as boogers. Yeah, Gus mine is

100
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,700
it's got like actually the same. Sometimes it's got that like red streak

101
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,380
of blood in it and it comes out after you sneeze. It's like it's the

102
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,340
mclaughlin group.

103
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:47,020

111
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,380

112
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:28,180
good job if people aren't noticing it. It says it's a good day to have a good day on

113
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:31,500
it. You should be underlining the date so everyone knows. And adding flashing lights

114
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,740
and emojis. That will really grab my attention. Yeah, and it's Monday. There's nothing like

00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,340

00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,280
And then the pumpkin wasn't on the receipt and you're like, what's this?

203
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:27,120
No, I said you got can't pumpkin, not can pumpkin. No, literally. No, not literally.

204
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:34,640
I was pretty hungover and you said, what is this receipt so long? What is it? CVS?

205
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:41,120
Literally, literally say that I was hungover and it was really early in the morning. It was

206
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,680
earliest I've ever gone to the grocery store. Early. It was like 8 15 and I ate 15 cans of

207
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,720
a pumpkin litter literally yeah, but you actually didn't because they were

208
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,640
can't a paper can literally literally we established that earlier. So I when I

209
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,520
put my card in and when it was a bugio card literally

210
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:09,400
I want to ask if you want cash back for whatever reason, I thought that it was

211
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:14,360
asking me to give a tip and so I saw like ten twenty fifty a hundred. I was

212
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:23,340
holy shit so I clicked other and then I put in she was like you I can't give you

213
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:28,060
two dollars of cash back and I was like what

214
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:37,300
I'm gonna redo the whole like scan everything again because I was like a

215
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:44,300
crazy guy trying to get two dollars. And then also I'm trying to tip on a grocery order.

216
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:51,620
Dude, there's a grocery store by my old apartment that they do have a tip jar.

217
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:53,780
You shouldn't have to tip for anything, first of all.

218
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
I agree.

219
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,220
Second of all, you definitely shouldn't have to tip for anything where the person isn't

220
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:04,380
bringing something to your table. If a tip is on an iPad, and it's not something you

221
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,220
- I think you're right, Don.

222
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,540
If it's something you press on a screen,

223
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,660
that person who's getting the tip should be dead.

224
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,500
- Yeah.

225
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,320
- They should get the tip.

226
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,140
- There should be a big tip of my saber.

227
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,400
- There should just be different options.

228
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,240
You should be able to tip.

229
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,060
- My bayonet.

230
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,900
- But you should also, there should be like

231
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,100
virtual buddy options on the iPad.

232
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,940
- Yeah, slap.

233
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,700
- Where it's like, yeah, throw a thousand balls

234
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,780
at them right now.

235
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,600
- Yeah.

236
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,540
- Forgot my chapstick, Cameron.

237
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,380
What are you doing?

238
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,200
- Stop recording, I have to go home and get it.

239
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,040
- What do you have to get?

240
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,800
- I had a dream last night where I was walking somewhere

241
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,940
and I saw like, there was like someone

242
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:38,180
was having a little yard sale and there's a video game like some of they were

243
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,540
selling a video game in their yard sale called dragon and I was like I need to

244
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,580
buy this and then I like had I was like oh what I'm late and I like went and

245
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,180
then I was like and then later in my dream I was like I forgot to buy dragon

246
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:53,940
I got so mad and upset that I didn't buy dragon to buy it yeah well I forgot to

247
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,820
go back and buy it and I was like I have to go back and buy dragon and it wasn't

248
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,940
there anymore and I that was like I was so mad that I couldn't buy dragon sounds

249
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:05,140
a great dream. It was a bad dream, because I didn't get to play or buy Dragon.

250
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:08,940
But you got to develop your video game. I wonder if there's a game called

251
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:15,100
Dragon. There is. Is there? What is it? Purple Dragon. Well, it's called Purple

252
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:21,580
Dragon. Spiral. Yeah. It has to be just called. I remember the box. The original

253
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:27,380
first Spiral game was called Dragon. That's not true. It was an NES game, too.

254
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,700
like an old it was like a retro game. Oh so it was Double Dragon? Yeah that was called

255
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:36,820
Dragon. Well that the first one is called Dragon and then the second one is called Double Dragon.

256
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:41,220
Guys that's not true. The Dragon is also Spyro's from Dragon. Alright when I search Dragon game

257
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,980
it just gives me a list of every game that has a dragon in it so if anyone's listening to this

270
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:50,580
don't want this to unplug some boys that are like it's a Chinese game huge like

271
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:54,620
probably as big as it now. I don't understand because apparently girl

272
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:58,580
apparently like four inches is good enough for girls so why do they like why

273
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,420
I heard it was three. Why is it every oh there's all these videos of girls

274
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:07,900
putting like like a like a squash into their ass. Yeah well it's the flavor they

275
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:13,220
have taste buds. Oh. Like you know how guys have taste buds. You know if you put peanut butter

276
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:17,140
all over your balls and you don't have a dog you can taste the peanut butter

277
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:24,140
through your balls. If you do have a dog, you can taste your dog's tongue. I am sick of my dog licking the peanut butter off. I'm trying to taste it.

278
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:31,140
Oh my god, I'm trying to taste this shit dude. Get the fuck away from me! Don't lick that! It's not for you! It's got too much sugar in it!

279
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:35,940
Yeah, well so yeah, they have taste buds in there. That's why they put like

280
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,940
squashes and cucumbers and stuff and that's how you can tell when a girl is

281
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:42,220
really weird or a freak because there are some girls, I don't want you to

282
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,060
look this up because it's nasty, but there are some girls that try to taste

283
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:46,020
traffic cones.

284
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:49,180
Well, what is a traffic cone?

285
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,740
And that's what on the street all day.

286
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,820
So you can imagine it doesn't taste like candy corn.

287
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,260
Oh, that's a lot of them.

288
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:54,540
Might.

289
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,380
Oh, it looks like a candy.

290
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,700
And I think that they think that if they, if they maybe, you know, if they're

291
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:03,140
putting a glass bottle or something like that, they might think that it's like a

292
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:03,980
wax bottle.

293
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,980
And maybe they might have some Coca-Cola jelly in it.

294
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,300
Yeah.

295
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,940
It's, it's sort of that type of thing.

296
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:12,700
So what's the, what do they think of what is bad dragon dildos smell like?

297
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,460
Probably smells like a dragon.

298
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,940
I don't think it does.

299
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:16,940
I think it's gross.

300
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
No, that's just for people who want to fuck a dragon.

301
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,940
That has nothing to do with flavor.

302
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
But they're too big.

303
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
That's all I'm saying.

304
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
Do you ever wish that you're-

305
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,940
That's all I'm saying.

306
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
That's setting unreal expectations for my penis.

307
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:25,940
Maybe it's a gummy worm.

308
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,940
I don't have scales.

309
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:30,580
Have you ever seen one of those bad dragon things and been like, "Damn, I wish my penis

310
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,580
looked like that."

311
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,580
Damn, I wish I had that in my butt right now.

312
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,180
Yeah, of course, dude.

313
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,380
If I had a huge knot on my penis-

314
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,620
Yeah, a foot and a half fucking green and blue penis.

315
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,620
You know what they need to do?

316
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,620
Ah, it's so cool.

317
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,620
They need to do-

318
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:45,020
do like ones that are like based on like characters right you think they would

319
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:48,260
sponsor like they do they do like xenomorph one and like yeah they do

320
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,460
like avatar one and stuff right I think they make one based on a guy

321
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:57,980
they should make them based on on yeah on people they have this is a normal dildo

322
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:02,660
yeah no but you're buying what it has a name on the dildo they have they

323
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,140
actually have we have that yeah that's pretty they have ones right also I think

324
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,060
what they should do I think that I think that bad dragon is an unfair monopoly on

325
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:13,140
the market and I think you know companies like Nintendo should be making Bowser

326
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:18,820
dildos and like you know like McDonald's Ronald McDonald dildo you know it's and

327
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,620
just let bad dragon take all the end of but you know what I want a Mare McCheese

328
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,700
I want like I want like a like a stark white you know those sex toys that are

329
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,940
like a butthole and a pussy and butt cheeks and it's just that yeah I want a

330
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,940
stark white one and it's Ronald McDonald's big red butthole and it

331
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,660
chanels a lot of imagining this. I want to make double that heads of a

332
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,220
giant. There's a huge controversy with like a sex toy company because they make

333
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:51,060
one of those like like but and and pussy sex toys, but they put like they put like

334
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,340
legs on and make it run away.

335
00:18:52,340 --> 00:19:00,100
It does backflips like that like the I dog wind it up and it runs around.

336
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,140
It's like an ostrich.

337
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:14,660
No, no, it would be a controversy is the point. There should be more advanced sex toys that have Boston Dynamics should make a sex toy that

338
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:22,740
Obliterates your penis and vagina. Yeah seen those like guys that do the real doll things like they like like those things are really expensive

339
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,180
Be one that they're not very they hard to talk about

340
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:31,940
They should there should be one that's just one of those can return machines and it just sucks your thing in and crushes it

341
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,740
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, there should there should be a new five

342
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:44,620
There should be a flashlight that looks exactly like WALL-E and turns your penis into a cube.

343
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,020
I've been saying this.

344
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:56,980
I think if I got a flashlight for free, I would not use it, but I would use it.

345
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,980
Let me finish.

346
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
Let me finish.

347
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,980
Let me finish.

348
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,100
Let me finish.

349
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:10,460
I would drink something out of it one time.

350
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,060
What would you drink?

351
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Diet Mountain Dew.

352
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
Diet Mountain Dew?

353
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,940
Dude, that's a gross one.

354
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,860
That's going to get like the coating is going to dissolve.

355
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,060
You should drink like chocolate milk out of it.

356
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,060
Why only one time?

357
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,580
I mean if you're going to drink something out of it, you might as well just drink something

358
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:25,580
out of it all the time.

359
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,780
That could just be your cup at the office.

360
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,220
You could just get a fleshlight, dude.

361
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,620
I'm not going to fucking-- I know you're not using it.

362
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,180
Also if you use a fleshlight, that's okay.

363
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,540
I don't care and if you use it and then drink out of it and drink your own nuts

364
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:40,940
Okay, if I do I don't care if you use a flashlight dude. It's normal use a flashlight is it?

365
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,940
I don't know. I think they're probably

366
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,920
Crazy concept because they hand already feels better than a vagina. I don't need them. I don't need some silicon

367
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:54,200
It is a crazy like like they have them modeled after real people and there's a crazy

368
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,100
Idea that you can just sell like a body part and someone jacks off with it

369
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,420
What?

370
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,300
Literally, you're selling a fake body part.

371
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:08,300
That's like selling the fleshlight for someone to jack off to.

372
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,900
You ever think about how the stars we see in the sky are already dead?

373
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
Damn.

374
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,460
It's the same as selling a prosthetic leg to someone for them to fuck.

375
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,820
No, it's different because that's a leg and this one's a pussy.

376
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:22,380
Do you think the food that I see is the same as the food that you see?

377
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,380
Shit.

378
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,220
Like a strawberry could be green for you.

379
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,700
No, maybe that's not even a strawberry to me.

380
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,140
Maybe that's a piece of steak.

381
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,300
Oh, it is a piece of steak.

382
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,280
I see it now. Yeah, it's an audio recorder. It's not a piece of steak.

383
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:40,280
Idiot. Do you ever think of me doing that? Like, I'd be like, "Oh, you're right! Oh shit! That is green! Wait a second!"

384
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,640
Whoa!

385
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,640
Whoa, you got me, dude! We need to go on CNN right now.

386
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,980
Damn.

387
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:50,140
Damn!

388
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:55,780
Stop talking about your damn tooth, boy. I really hope this doesn't fuck everything up. I'm about to smack your shit up! I'm gonna go to the emergency dentist.

389
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,920
I'm gonna smack you up.

390
00:21:56,920 --> 00:22:00,840
I looked that up this morning. I looked up emergency dentist. I'm gonna have you laid

391
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:06,600
up in that Harry Potter hospital. My other side of my mouth is burning too. This is not

392
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,720
a good day for me. I think you got a double demented dental situation. Double demented

393
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:15,360
dental? Welcome to double demented dental. We're two crazy dentists. Whatever you do

394
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,360
if you're booking an appointment do not go to the dementist. It's an easy mistake to

395
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,920
make. Okay? It's only a few letters. I've done it a few times. Trust me. You do not.

396
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,660
I went to the dentist. Listen pal, if you've seen Little Shop of Horrors, okay?

397
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,320
Steve Martin ain't got nothing on the Dementist.

398
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,120
Yeah, the Dementist actually has guns.

399
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,980
One of his eyes is way bigger than the other and he goes like this.

400
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:45,520
And he looks great and sticks his tongue out. And he really sucks at working on your teeth.

401
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,240
And when he comes into the room, tornado. His toothpaste is actually sour.

402
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,800
Great, the Dementist is giving me screaming gas. Awesome.

403
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,360
His toothpaste is sour, but then it's sweet, then it's gone.

404
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,160
No, shut up.

405
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,960
Really?

406
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,120
Mm-hmm.

407
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,160
I hate the Dementist.

408
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,960
Yeah, dude, the Dementist.

409
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,200
He wears that metal circle on his forehead, too.

410
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,720
Yeah.

411
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,200
You know what that metal circle is?

412
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,560
And he bites Crabby Bandicoot.

413
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,440
And you don't even sit in the chair.

414
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,600
You have to stand up.

415
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,240
No.

416
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,200
Yeah, I'm serious.

417
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
I'm dead serious.

418
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,080
And he will make you dead serious dead.

419
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,680
My idea of a Dementist is just a normal dentist.

420
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,760
I motherfucking hate them.

421
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,160
I hate the dentist and I am like $3,000 in dental debt.

422
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,560
- Yo Sandra Miles, if you're still practicing

423
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,000
in Wilmington, North Carolina,

424
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
I'm gonna come and I'm gonna ice you.

425
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,620
- My dentist was Dr. Robert T. Christ.

426
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,460
- Really?

427
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,540
Dude, we had crazy dentist names.

428
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,160
Sandra Miles was Smiles.

429
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,620
That's her first initial and last name.

430
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,200
- And he was Christ and he was like really into God.

431
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,040
- Dope.

432
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:51,200
- And if you called him Dr. Christ, he was like,

433
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,180
"No, it's pronounced Christ."

434
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,760
and it's like dude just fucking own it.

435
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,560
- Yeah, you do have to own it at that point.

436
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,860
- I mean it might be a little embarrassing

437
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,700
when you get to heaven.

438
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,760
- Yeah, my dentist name was Dr. Craze.

439
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,600
- Really?

440
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,640
- Yeah, he was a doctor.

441
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,480
He wasn't a doctor.

442
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,760
- Oh, was he not a dementist?

443
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,060
- Well yeah, well he was like,

444
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,760
I think you trained under him or something.

445
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,040
'Cause he had similar techniques,

446
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,840
but he was more just, it wasn't as mean.

447
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,880
Just kind of just, he was Craze.

448
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,160
- I didn't even honestly have a dentist.

449
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm just making it up.

450
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,140
- His first name was Cra.

451
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:21,520
- Yeah, I didn't see a dentist from the age of 14 to 18.

452
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,040
- I don't think, if you're an adult

00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,300
sees a dentist yeah fucking figure shit you have you have a you'd you like to be

603
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:11,060
This is like the worst like pain I've been in and so long. Did you get punched

604
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:16,460
or kicked or hit in the teeth? No, I ate a lot of candy. Okay, all right. Did an

605
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,860
animal around and run around all your teeth? Maybe. Oh, did you? Did you

606
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:24,780
perhaps pick up? Did you maybe pick? I think I figured this out guys. Did you

607
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:29,140
You pick up a lollipop from the ground that had a wolf-shaped bite out of the

608
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,540
lollipop and lick on the wolf bite part.

609
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:33,980
I was wearing silver, so I thought it was okay.

610
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,300
No, see that's what's going to get you.

611
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:38,900
You probably need to get that silver off.

612
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,700
That's actually probably what the pain is from.

613
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,220
No, my fillings are silver.

614
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,220
Yeah, exactly.

615
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:44,220
That's what I'm saying.

616
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,700
You're probably going to need to take all of those out.

617
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,060
That's a good idea.

618
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,060
I can help you with that.

619
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,060

And he tore up everything butter balls.

652
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:01,100
I think these days even fat people can be thin.

653
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
That's right.

654
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,100
Don't say that.

655
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:05,100
They should have called him Butterbox.

656
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,980
Because he came out of the box.

657
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,420
And then it would make sense if you say you tore up everything but her box.

658
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Yep.

659
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,060
Why would you tear up everything but her box?

660
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,060
Because he's weird.

661
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,060
He's from hell and shit.

662
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,060
I don't know.

663
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,060
How am I supposed to explain what a cube?

664
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,060
He's from a demon's job.

665
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,060
He lives in the gay cube.

666
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,060
Really?

667
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
Yeah.

668
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,060
Because it's supposed to be about Clive Barker and how much he loves S&M, right?

669
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
Yeah.

670
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,060
Clive Barker is one of those guys where I no hands nutted to Rihanna S&M.

671
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,060
One time I no hands nutted to Rihanna S&M.

672
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:26,060
I was like, "I'm going to get you."

673
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,060
I was like, "I'm going to get you."

674
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
I was like, "I'm going to get you."

675
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:32,300
supposed to be about Clive Barker how much he loves S&M right? Yeah, Clive

676
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:37,420
Barker is one of those guys where I no hands nutted to Rihanna

677
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:41,980
S&M as a child. It's so sick when you can read a guy's book and just say, "God,

678
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:48,060
swear on my fucking mom's grave." No hand nut to S&M by Rihanna. Is that true?

679
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:56,620
Yep. You grab your phone like you were gonna look that up. I'm looking up S&M right now to see if I can do it.

680
00:35:56,620 --> 00:36:01,260
She's wild as hell for saying I love the smell of it in that song. Dude, honestly, that's the

681
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,500
part that got me. I was thinking about the smell of a sex swing. I think it was her smelling my

682
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:14,860
stuff, like maybe my taint. I was like, she loves the smell of my taint. I was going for a run,

683
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:21,340
and I had that song on, and I had no hands nutted. Damn. Yeah. Wait, so Hellraiser...

684
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,660
Yeah, well, I would say it's so fun when you have a movie or a book where you can read or watch or

685
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:28,760
watch or to ever instantly be like oh yeah, the guy who made this is gay yeah

686
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:33,480

689
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,140

00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:45,980
leather and you get attacked by evil men and we all and we all attack each other

691
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,820

718
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100

Isn't there a video?

780
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,020
No, no, no.

781
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,020
I'm thinking of the video.

782
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,700
It's like the fight and the guy just gets completely naked.

783
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Oh yeah.

784
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:43,700
I don't know that.

785
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:44,700
But there's a lot of...

786
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,980
Anytime that you're in a combat situation...

787
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,780
I mean that's what the cavemen did.

788
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:49,780
Really?

789
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:50,780
Yeah.

790
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,780
Really?

791
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
They took their clothes off?

792
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,780
They grabbed their loincloths.

793
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,780
Really?

794
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,780
To get in a fight, yeah.

795
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,780
Oh, I didn't even know that.

796
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
And then they put the poop under their eyes like football players.

797
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,780
That's how football got invented.

798
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,780
Is that where that's from?

799
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,780
Oh, yeah.

800
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:01,780
But it was foot rock.

801
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:06,580
foot rock. It used to be club rock. I was trying to find the video. I was club rock the other

802
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:11,780
damn night. I was trying to find the video of the guy in the fight when he pulls his pants

803
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:15,860
off. I go to Planet Hollywood and I think it's called club rock. I was trying to find

804
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:24,820
that video. It's like an old vine and something completely different just showed up. Yeah,

805
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,660
and now for something completely different. And now for something completely different.

806
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:33,580
Oh my God. Number one is I thought you thought it was going to be gas.

807
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:36,660
Listen, I've been there. Yeah. This is what happened to me.

808
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:40,540
That's not so much a reason as an excuse though. That's true.

809
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,500
Wait, these are just two naked guys touching each other's balls and jacking off.

810
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,900
They're not fighting at all. Patrick, Patrick, this isn't fighting.

811
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,540
They're fingering each other's buttholes. No, they're fighting. Look, look,

812
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,580
he did bite his butthole. That's a good move.

813
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,140

814
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:01,120

I haven't seen that in my training.

823
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,240
Let's see how this pays off for him.

824
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Like, now we're in his video.

825
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:28,240
He must have a different master than me.

826
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Of Krav Maga.

827
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,240
Krav Maga.

828
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:34,240
This is what happened to me last time.

829
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,240
That was in 2006.

830
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,240
And I'm 11 right now.

831
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,240
I was sitting there and whoop, there it is.

832
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,240
This and having a dream with Freddy Krueger in it.

833
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,240
Oh my god, having a dream with Freddy Krueger in it would absolutely make me crap my pants.

834
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,240
There's a comment here from

835
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,240
from a fan.

836
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,640
There's a comment here from I think this guy might have been afflicted by this

837
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:57,320
disease crapping your pants says what are you guys laughing about it's not funny

838
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,760
true they should make a scene if they ever make another nightmare on all

839
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,760
street movie they should make a scene where they should make a comedic scene

840
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,520
so this is an idea if you ever want to make a comedy version guys wait so okay

841
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:11,480
I mean don't worry about it right so here's the comedic scene is that Freddy

842
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,200
Krueger tries to go into someone's dream and it's a dream of them having sex with

843
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:22,200
really ugly woman and he goes what the hell and then he leaves. That would be funny. Yeah.

844
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:31,200
He could go, what the hell? Woof. What? That would be a good. What? It's DMX. Oh she's ugly.

845
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,200
Ew. I don't want no part of this shit. No no no no. And I thought I was ugly. And I

846
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,200

855
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,480
myself pretty often. You shit yourself in public once a month. You only have it one time. You shit yourself in

861
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:59,200
I shit my pants in first grade and then I went back to class and sat in it for a

862
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,160
little bit and tried it I was just like okay this is fine. You ever accidentally

All my teeth problems.

885
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:50,840

yeah yeah yeah my shit right you're right listen I misspoke and I'm taking

905
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:49,880
accountability for it one time I was recording a podcast for those good old

906
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,720
profession values and I was in the middle of talking and I had to know I

907
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,840
didn't say anything. I just ran to the bathroom. I was like I'm going to shit

908
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:01,780
my pants. I've had probably two or three times. Luckily, it's only ever been

909
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:05,800
over zoom podcast. I've definitely almost shit myself before yeah pretty

910
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,640
it's so hard when you're recording something or you're doing something and

911
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:14,480
you're like like other people are there and you have to be like I have to go

912
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:20,820
right now for no reason yeah for exactly yeah, I I do that, but I hate when you do

913
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:25,640
that and then you leave and everyone's like yep, he's going to jack off and

914
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:27,160
maybe I don't hate that. I think that's funny.

915
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,840
Do you guys think it's wrong to jack off at another person's house? Yeah,

916
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:36,500
depends depends on what you have to be wearing. You have to be wearing the

917
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,740
yeah, so it doesn't touch their house serious day job like at a I swear you

918
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:45,000
said that on the podcast before I've had it. I swear that we've had that exact

919
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:50,120
interaction before somebody. Please see if you can find this where I say it's

920
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,120
wrong to jack off. So is it wrong to jack off of someone else's house? You say it

921
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:59,240
depends and he says you have to wear depends. I swear to God dude yeah that

922
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,720
has happened before I believe it. We I mean basically we just say that it's the

923
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,760
exact same three things to each other over and over and over. It's crazy that

924
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:12,860

963
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:28,040
that's probably a lot over a long period of time. He didn't age a lot quickly

964
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:32,160
because then he would be young. He aged a lot over a long period of time. A

- They got long white beards.

984
00:51:25,020 --> 00:51:26,300
- Democrat wizards.

985
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,140
- Yep.

986
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:27,960
- Yep.

987
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,500
- Yep, wizards in the KKK.

988
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:33,020
They are actually that, 'cause we did their show,

989
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,460
and they showed us their,

990
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,380
they shoot up on the zoom call all in clan road you have you guys ever noticed

991
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:43,900
your name of their podcast capo cap cap cows mm-hmm yeah ever realize what that

992
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:55,780
stands for for 4ks 4k mm-hmm they are we cannot stress this enough we can't

993
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:01,140
listen there's no two ways about it the entirety of chopper trap house belongs to

994
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:05,760
They're white supremacists. They just are, man. They tell us every single time we stop

995
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:09,840
talk- we stop recording with them. They say, "Thank you for furthering our ideals," and

996
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:15,680
we say, "We're not doing that at all! What do you mean? No! No! You bastards! Don't you dare release this

997
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,840
episode! I don't want to high-five! Wait, what the hell are you doing with your

998
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:22,080
hand?" And we don't email them our audio because we don't want to appear on that

999
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,960
type of program, but they somehow get it anyway. They're hackers! And then later on,

1000
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:31,080
sometimes we forget and we do other shit with them, okay? So some people

1001
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:35,080
forget stuff sometimes you know if we're doing a live show we like you right we

1002
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:41,640
were trying to assassinate them we were backstage I saw I saw Will Menneker he

1003
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,840
when he showed up he took he took in this red armband off and sat down yep and

1004
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:50,800
then he put it back on and then when he got back off the stage he put it back on

1005
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,880
yeah mm-hmm and I didn't see what the armband was I actually think that he's

1006
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,880
so old he was taking his blood pressure.

1007
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,140
(laughter)

1008
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:00,980
- Yep.

1009
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,980
- Number five, girlfriend turns out to be guy friend.

1010
00:53:05,980 --> 00:53:08,220
Now tell me you would not crap your pants.

1011
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,060
- I wouldn't crap my pants.

1012
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,800
- I don't know if I'd crap my pants or not.

1013
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,360
Would you go full Ace Ventura?

1014
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,820
- I would go full Crying Game.

1015
00:53:15,820 --> 00:53:18,280
- I haven't seen that one.

1016
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:19,680
Honestly if I found out my--

1017
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:20,960
- I would go full Crying Game,

1018
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:24,080
I would throw a car bomb in London.

1019
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:24,920
- What?

1020
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:25,760
- Huh?

1021
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,520
games about neither of us have seen it still oh it's about the I watch it I

1022
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:35,680
just watched anything you say about it it's a good movie it's really good I

1023
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,080
think if my girlfriend turned out to be a guy friend we probably just play more

1024
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:46,040
video games yeah I'd probably I'd be like we might drive racing cars together

1025
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:52,000
yeah we probably just like become even closer and more sexual oh my god only I

1026
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,920
I saw them drive racing cars on fear factor like yesterday. No, it's so sick

1027
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:01,200
is crazy. Also, who's afraid of racing an awesome car? Yeah, the

1028
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:05,400
doors on that show are pretty funny. Yep, yeah, yeah, there was one where

1029
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:10,080
the fear is like you will be put in this. You'll be put underwater with now

1030
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,200
like don't scream crabs

1031
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,760
and two of the people quit to the people who got too scared of crabs. Yeah,

1032
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,600
when this I'm afraid one woman was like well, yeah, one lady, so you went. Oh

1033
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:23,320
- Oh my god, it's biting my butt!

1034
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,840
And then she quit.

1035
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,420
- The crab isn't gonna, it's not gonna,

1036
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:27,980
it doesn't want human meat, dude.

1037
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,660
- It's a crab, it's not like a spider or a demon.

1038
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:31,760
- It's similar. - Those are scary.

1039
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:33,380
- It's a mixture of the two, but I don't,

1040
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,520
I'm not scared of it. - It's a fear factor,

1041
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,360
but then like Joe wrote, it's like,

1042
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,140
your challenge is seven minutes in heaven with a demon.

1043
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,640
- With a dark demon Chernabog.

1044
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,880
(snarling)

1045
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:48,720
- I'm sending you to hell for 30 seconds.

1046
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,600
But you can tap out and have your teammate take your place.

1047
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:55,200
three rounds of physical combat with Scorpion

1048
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,200
for Mortal Kombat. And yeah, he's not wearing his mask and you can see his

1049
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:00,600
skull.

1050
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,500
That'd be too scary, man. Yeah, that would seriously factor my fears.

1051
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:09,600
Your first challenge, boo! Your second challenge.

1052
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:14,200
I just wish they would factor more of my fears into that show. Yeah.

1053
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:16,800
Yeah. Number six. Like student loan debt.

1054
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:19,600
Yeah, okay. So basically...

1055
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:22,320
- Yeah, take that, Chappo, we're swinging at you again.

1056
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:23,480
We're taking your crap.

1057
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,640
- Actually, my fear would be if they erase student loan debt.

1058
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,480
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1059
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,120
- Hey, buddy, maybe I wanna pay off my loans

1060
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,880
like a good citizen, you know, asshole?

1061
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,200
- Oh, so I'm supposed to like it when the number goes down?

1062
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,960
- Great, so the Democrips are trying to,

1063
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,160
that's basically net worth, that's my net worth,

1064
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,640
and you're turning it into zero, asshole.

1065
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:42,120
- Yeah, you're siphoning off everything.

1066
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,720
- Yeah, Hillary Clinton, you witch.

1067
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:46,120
- How else am I gonna prove I went to college?

1068
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,760
I already drew all over my diploma.

1069
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:48,600
- Yep.

1070
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:53,280
I don't have a diploma. I had to do math for a tip. I dropped out of school because I knew

1071
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,640
that there were being too much of Democrats there. You are a Kanye West type figure in

1072
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:07,960
my eyes. Do I look like white Kanye today? You do. I'm your guy who camerafies your entire

1073
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:15,360
life. What's his name? Krusty. Mr. Camera. Krusty the Crab. Lakitu. Lakitu? Yeah. Is

1074
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:16,360
walking around like-- - Is that how you say it?

1075
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,200
- Yeah, Lakitu. - I don't know, I've never--

1076
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,640
- Lakitu, Mario's little guy. - I've never,

1077
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,840
I've always said Lakitu.

1078
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,960
- So then I was following Kanye on a giant shell.

1079
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,800
That's the movie.

1080
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:27,380
- Kanye went to this castle-- - You're going the wrong way,

1081
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:28,220
Kanye!

1082
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:29,640
- Kanye went-- - Turn around!

1083
00:56:29,640 --> 00:56:31,140
- Kanye went to this castle,

1084
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,680
and he put on a hat-- - Make a U-turn, Kanye!

1085
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,080
- Kanye turned into some type of raccoon creature,

1086
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,920
and he was jumping around flying.

1087
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,920
What's that thing called?

1088
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,640
- Tanuki. - Tanuki.

1089
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:48,240

1104
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,440
okay if he slapped his but that sexual harassment that's a workplace or and

1105
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:38,760
that

1106
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,480
And that's out in Hollywood, but you know what's in?

1107
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:41,980
Girls.

1108
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:44,840
And that's on Weinstein.

1109
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,640
And he said, "Keep my wife's name out your fucking mouth."

1110
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,280
He said this.

1111
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,840
Who's his wife?

1112
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,800
Okay, so this is sounding a bit sexual.

1113
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:50,920
Jada Pinkett Smith?

1114
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:51,960
Really? I thought she was his wife.

1115
00:57:51,960 --> 00:57:53,720
Damn, I thought that was a damn marble.

1116
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,040
I thought he was married to Willow Smith.

1117
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,040
Yeah, he's married to her too.

1118
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:58,600
They're poly.

1119
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,240
Oh, they're both.

1120
00:57:59,240 --> 00:57:59,880
Okay.

1121
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,480
His wife has no hair.

1122
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,680
I thought she was straight up a bun.

1123
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:08,440
Isn't that crazy?

1124
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:12,720
I thought she was she was she okay you know say what you will but she was so

1125
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:16,960
fucking good in shape of water yep and when she fell off that damn wall

1126
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:25,040
yeah oh my god has no hair but surely she has eyebrows I heard that I heard that

1127
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,120

1128
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:33,480
Holden in blood meridian really yeah that's awesome yeah I heard that

1129
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:40,800
actually and he slapped Chris is that true wait Jada Pinkett Smith slapped I

1130
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:46,320
heard she's gonna play no she's bald but she's not a boy did that wait did the

1131
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:50,440
way I did the light from her shiny head I use someone's eye to hurt them or is

1132
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:53,360
that what it was that like are we talking about the same thing I thought

1133
00:58:53,360 --> 00:59:00,760
that that was a Lindor truffle that's a woman yes what and it was at the Oscars

1134
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,760
But she doesn't have any hair how could that be a woman?

1135
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,760
She had no hair.

1136
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,760
I thought that was a placeholder mannequin because the person wasn't there yet.

1137
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
And he said keep my wife name out your fucking mouth.

1138
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,760
I thought I was watching Mythbusters and that was a crash test dummy.

1139
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,760
And he said keep his wife's name out his fucking mouth.

1140
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,760
To Chris?

1141
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,760
I thought it was like

1142
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,760
Will said that to Chris.

1143
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,760
I thought it was like one of those Ronald McDonald statues on a bench that you sit next to.

1144
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,760
But it was for Humpty Dumpty.

1145
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,760
And it was just

1146
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,760
I thought it was like a story land scenery thing that got brought there.

1147
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,760
And it was just slapping people in the face.

1148
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:31,560
got brought there. And it was a slap at the Oscars.

1149
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:32,760
And it was a slap in the...

1150
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,360
Was it a slap to Oscars itself?

1151
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,760
Would you say it was the slap heard around the world?

1152
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:37,760
Mm-hmm.

1153
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:40,760
It was a slap in the face to audiences, too.

1154
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,060
And to performers.

1155
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,260
And the celebrities.

1156
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,460
And wait, so Will Smith slapped Chris Rock.

1157
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,760
How did his wife, Mike Wazowski, react?

1158
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,760
She wasn't laughing.

1159
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,260
But he was laughing, and then he stopped laughing.

1160
00:59:53,260 --> 00:59:55,460
Yeah, because when I see her, I say, "Put that thing back where it came from."

1161
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:56,760
Or so help me say, "Help me."

1162
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,000
(laughter)

1163
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:03,020
- And they slap.

1164
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:06,160
They slapped.

1165
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:08,220
- They slapped?

1166
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,060
- They slapped each other.

1167
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:09,880
- Wait, they both slapped?

1168
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:10,720
Okay, so they got in a fight then.

1169
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:11,680
- They slapped on TV.

1170
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:13,000
- But they just got in a fight, that's fun.

1171
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:13,840
- That's a slap.

1172
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:14,680
- Well, if they both slap each other,

1173
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,740
that's just yin and yang,

1174
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:19,120
which is also what Jada Pickett-Smith looks like.

1175
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:21,280
(laughter)

1176
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,800
- They slapped on TV, and it got real this time.

1177
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,100
- No, wait, it was on TV?

1178
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:27,600
I didn't know that part.

1179
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,020
- They slapped on TV. - That's not good.

1180
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:33,020
Yeah, Jaden Pickett-Smith has TB.

1181
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:35,360
- I wish you could see my face right now.

1182
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,320
- The bald head.

1183
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,160
- Yeah.

1184
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:39,060
- I wish you could see my face right now.

1185
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:39,900
- Yep.

1186
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:40,720
- Literally.

1187
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,560
- Yeah, literally.

1188
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,400
- Literally, she's bald.

1189
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,820
- I literally slapped on TV.

1190
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,320
- Yo, she was sitting in that chair at the Oscar so long

1191
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,200
I was surprised a magic beanstalk didn't grow out of her head.

1192
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,040
- Bean ass bitch.

1193
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,860
- Literally.

1194
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:54,200
- Listen, bitch, you look like a bean.

1195
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,000
You actually just look like a bean to me.

1196
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
Okay?

1197
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,000
A kidney bean.

1198
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,000
A pinto bean.

1199
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,440
Any bean is what you look like to me.

1200
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:02,440
Some type of bean is what you are.

1201
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
And edamame.

1202
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,440
You're a bean, bitch.

1203
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:07,320
Oh wait, so you're Jaden and Willow Smith's edamame?

1204
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,120
Okay, yeah, 'cause you're a bean.

1205
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,000
And they slapped on TV.

1206
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,000
Yep.

1207
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,320
And wait, you have kidneys?

1208
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,480
Kidney or bean?

1209
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,280
You gotta be kiddining me with how much of a bean you look like.

1210
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:22,280
Yep.

1211
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,280
Yep. All right. I'm not supposed to slap on TV.

1212
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:30,780
The only show left on tour is Chicago. That's tomorrow when this comes out.

1213
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:35,280
So she go ahead by no one comes on stage and slaps on TV.

1214
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:39,080
Us enough. I wish I had a can of coins to shake.

1215
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:42,380
You're doing this right now. This is what I want. Yeah, I think I mean,

1216
01:01:42,380 --> 01:01:45,280
unless it sells out by the time this comes out, which hey, probably going to

1217
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,980
sell out today. Who knows? We added a late show that as I think 18 plus.

1218
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:52,180
So if you couldn't go to the first Chicago show because it was 21 plus

1219
01:01:52,180 --> 01:01:53,460
You should go to this one instead.

1220
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,460
You should buy tickets.

1221
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,340
It'll be the last show on the tour and we're gonna do something crazy.

1222
01:01:57,340 --> 01:01:58,780
It might be slapping.

1223
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:03,780
If you're one of the college co-eds that comes up on stage and slaps me, then I salute you

1224
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,780
at the 18+ show.

1225
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:09,020
And if you ask me to sign your boobs, I will not.

1226
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:10,260
I will only sign your arm.

1227
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:11,260
Yep.

1228
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:12,260
Hey, I've done a lot of thinking about this.

1229
01:02:12,260 --> 01:02:13,260
I've done a lot of thinking about this.

1230
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,260
And no slapping.

1231
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:16,940
I don't even see boobs because I'm so in love.

1232
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,660
I just see two beans.

1233
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:22,020
And if you look like a bean ass bitch in the front row, best believe I'm gonna make fun

1234
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:23,020
of you bean.

1235
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:24,020
No slapping.

1236
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:26,060
Don't bring your husband.

1237
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:28,300
And if you dress up like a bean, I'm gonna eat you.

1238
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,340
It's not advised to bring your husband, because he could slap us.

1239
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:32,340
Yep.

1240
01:02:32,340 --> 01:02:33,340
Alright, bye.
