- You're a freaking monster.

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,440
(explosion)

9
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,720
- And welcome to Dr. Peppercast episode Pepper-soad 2.

10
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,640
- You already fucked it, you did a dry run

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,480
before we even started.

12
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,440
- And you still couldn't.

13
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,200
- And no, it wasn't, you did the same fuck up

14
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,880
that you did 20 seconds ago.

15
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,880
- I'm hungover today.

16
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,600
- Well, did you say well-cam just now?

17
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,720
- Welcome to the new Dr. Peppercast, Pepper-Sowed 2.

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,760
I'm your host with the most, Patrick Doran.

19
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,560
- Wait, do you have, we don't have any

20
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,360
Dr. Pepper this week, though.

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,120
- Yeah, I think maybe Patrick is doing

22
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,720
a Dr. Peppercast over there,

23
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,720
and me and you are kind of over here.

24
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,080
- We're doing our own damn thing.

25
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,960
- And welcome to Dr. Peppercast and Pepper-Sowed 2.

26
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,800
- You know what this is?

27
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,880
You know what this is?

28
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,520
Two birds and one stone.

29
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,360
- Oh my God.

30
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:52,180
- That's what this is.

31
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,760
(laughing)

32
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,640
Two birds and one stone.

33
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,480
- I did show up, so.

34
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,480
That's what I'm seeing over here. I'm a bird, because I'm spreading my fucking wings.

35
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,480
We're spreading our wings too.

36
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,480
We're two birds in a hand.

37
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,480
And this is a straight bush.

38
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
You're a straight bush bird today.

39
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,480
You're a bush bird.

40
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,480
We went, um, me and Cameron did.

41
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Me and Cameron.

42
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
Bush bird, uh, yeah.

43
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
Bush bird behavior.

44
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
Bush bird, you're acting like one.

45
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Me and Cameron did trivia last night, and we won.

46
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,920
yeah so tell me what so I was curious because I missed out sure on purpose I

47
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:35,920
yeah yeah yeah we did it wasn't an accident I didn't want to go because I

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,880
knew I had to be up early okay and and I didn't want to be a straight bush bird

49
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:43,840
like some of us or a stone like some of us well I mean take a look at me though

50
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,440
I will say I was I guess I didn't I maybe didn't stay out quite as late

51
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,200
after the trivia but I still attended trivia and still one and I'm here and

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm bright-eyed and bird-handed.

53
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,600
- So it's almost like one bird, two stones.

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,440
- Yeah.

55
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
- I didn't realize this, but you're a stone as well.

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,120
- Well, I'm saying I'm not a stone at all.

57
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,960
- And you're a bush bird as well.

58
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,780
- I'm saying you can be a bird.

59
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,000
- And I'm a hand bird.

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,840
- No.

61
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,040
- And I'm flying around as fast as I can be,

62
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,880
as I've always been.

63
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,700
- Yeah, hand birder.

64
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,540
- No, I'm not a hand birder.

65
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,360
- The bird in the hand doesn't fly.

66
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,560
The bird in the hand is held.

67
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:10,120
- The birds in the bush jump around in the bush,

68
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,960
first of all.

69
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,780
- You're stupid.

70
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,880
The whole point of the hand bird is that you fly with it.

71
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,720
- No.

72
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,320
and you hold on. I don't think that's the point of a hand bird. The bird in the hand is better

73
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,480
than two in the bush because the bush, who gives a fuck if they're in the bush, if they're

74
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,120
in your hand you can fly around like this. The bush birds are bad because you can't have

75
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:28,880
them. You can fly around like this all day with your bush bird, or your hand bird. I

76
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,880
guess it should be a bird in the hand is worth two birds in the bush unless you have a bird

77
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:39,880
net that works on bushes. Alright. Oh my god, wait, why don't you know. Let's change it to

78
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,360
that. When, like, it's like when people say like why not make the whole plane out of a

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:47,120
a black box. Exactly. Why not make the whole bush out of your hand?

80
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,760
Yeah. People say why not make the plane out of a black box. You've never heard that

81
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,280
before?

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,360
Why not make the whole plane the black box? Like the black box is the only thing that survives the plane crash?

83
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,360
Man, I don't hang out with a lot of funny people, you know? Yeah.

84
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,240
Not really people who let go. That's not really a funny thing though, that's kind of boring. That's what engineers say.

85
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,480
I'm not really into observ... like I don't know a lot of people who like to observe

86
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,320
things and make

87
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,720
crack little jokes about it. I mean, I've seen my friend Jerry. Really?

88
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,120
Yeah, my friend Jerry, he's like that.

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,960
I don't know him.

90
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,240
He's very observational, you know him.

91
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,240
Yeah, Dr. Jerry.

92
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,200
Hangs out with George and his friend Cosmo.

93
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,040
Oh, fuck Jerry, that guy is fucking funny as shit.

94
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:23,440
Oh, and the fat Jewish.

95
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,160
The fat Jewish, that guy is funny as shit.

96
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,360
That guy is so funny. Anyone else?

97
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Beige cardigan.

98
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,600
That guy's funny as shit.

99
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,880
Yeah, these are all guys we hang out with

100
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,240
that we moved to New York.

101
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,600
But what I was saying is--

102
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,440
Mr. Funny.

103
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,720
Mr. Beans Laughing Meme.

104
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,700
That's like he's a he's more of a low-key guy. Yeah, but he is funny

105
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,800
He's what he's like that funny friend who won't be who won't pursue a career and being funny, right?

106
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:55,240
And it's like you want him to so bad, but he's never ever gonna do that. Yeah, I know guys like that

107
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,720
Yeah, yeah all these guys end up being my friend Nanette

108
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:07,160
You think her name is Nanette yeah, I don't think so I don't know what I still haven't watched that

109
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,160
You never watched the Hannah Gadsby special?

110
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
I watched it.

111
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,160
I had to watch it because I'm part of the Golden Globes.

112
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,160
I think it was

113
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,160
an in-yo-face approach

114
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,160
to comedy. It was.

115
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,160
It was in-yo-face.

116
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,160
And not afraid to back down.

117
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,160
I liked it. It was like,

118
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,160
you know, she's a deaf-jam...

119
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:29,160
It was confrontational in a

120
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,160
hip-hop kind of way. Yeah, it was in-yo-face,

121
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,160
it was unfuck-wittable.

122
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,160
It's the kind of thing you'd hear

123
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:44,360
blasting from a boombox yeah that's right what the subway Showtime into Douglas

124
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:59,880
that's not how it starts it's a very sad yeah it's so you're a fucking it's

125
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,160
actually I'm trying to paint the picture but I don't know any of the joke what is

126
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:12,440
What is so fascinating too about Nanette is it's less comedy, more special.

127
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
Okay?

128
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,440
This is comedy where the goal is not to make you laugh and make you think and make you

129
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,080
feel a certain type of way about the world.

130
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,240
Hey, if you wanted to, what if it was a scary special and it was called Banette?

131
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,280
Like the Pokemon ghost type.

132
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Oh, Banette.

133
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:30,560
What in God's fucking name are you talking about?

134
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,320
So it sounds more like that would be a Pokemon special.

135
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,480
Why are you speaking...

136
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
What is...

137
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,720
Oh my god, Banette has a Pokemon special.

138
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,720
How about Beignet?

139
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,720
Oh my god.

140
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
And it's a Popeye's.

141
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,920
By the looks of her, I bet she enjoys a couple of Beignets here and there now and again.

142
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,920
What about Bobette?

143
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Or a Didat?

144
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,920
See, he is a little hungover.

145
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:57,640
Am I the only fucking sober gopher in the whole fucking world?

146
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,420
way he said that, that's just proof. When someone says Bobette, that's proof of a hangover.

147
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,700
No, I literally just said, "What about Bobette or Dadette?" and I said it soberly.

148
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,140
That doesn't make any sense.

149
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,300
That's one of the top ten hangover signs.

150
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:15,020
If your friend says Bobette or Dadette, or especially both of them in a row.

151
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:17,540
Yeah, that's how you can tell your boy's hungover if he comes in and says Bobette.

152
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:21,060
Have you ever convinced yourself that you were having a stroke, a full-on stroke?

153
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,060
Constantly, every single day.

154
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,700
I think I do that every single day. I'm sitting at my desk at some point and I think, "Huh,

155
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,500
My eye is just as different than my other eye right now.

156
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,460
And then I feel, and then my face starts drooping

157
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,420
and I lose all control of my arm and my leg on my left side.

158
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,260
- My, my, my--

159
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,900
- And then it turns out I'm fine.

160
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,300
- Both my arms go completely numb a lot.

161
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,140
- Yeah.

162
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:41,960
- I'll get the--

163
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,660
- All the way from shoulder down to hand.

164
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,200
- I'll get the chest pain out of nowhere.

165
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,040
- Yeah.

166
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,860
- You know, like--

167
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:48,940
- I have heart, I think I have,

168
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,980
I do think if I went and got a full checkup at the doctor,

169
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,620
he would say, "You've had 600 mini strokes

170
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,300
"and 50,000 heart attacks."

171
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,300
I've had basically a heart attack.

172
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,220
And you've survived every single one somehow.

173
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,220
A long heart attack this whole year I think.

174
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,220
Is that just everybody has that?

175
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,220
Why are we not all...

176
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,600
I think about it all the time.

177
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,220
Every single day I'm thinking, "I'm having a heart attack right now."

178
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,220
Is that...

179
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,220
Yeah, I guess is that normal?

180
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,740
I think it's gotta be normal if I'm doing it all the time.

181
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,300
I think the crazy thing...

182
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,940
I've been hanging out with you guys and thought I had a heart attack and I never told you

183
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
guys.

184
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Constantly.

185
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,940
That's what I...

186
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,100
But you had hepatitis A for like six months and you didn't know?

187
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,620
Yeah, let's just tell everybody my business.

188
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,780
Let's just go around telling everybody my medical history.

189
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,980
Fuck fucking HIPAA.

190
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,780
- I tell everybody my medical history.

191
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,500
- And do I tell everybody your medical history?

192
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,340
- Yes. - No, I don't.

193
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,460
- You like to make light of it.

194
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,740
- No, I don't like to make light of it.

195
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,940
- You love to make light. - You shed the light

196
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,180
on my hepatitis A fucking diagnosis.

197
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,020
That's what you just did.

198
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,260
- Yeah, how'd you get it?

199
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,340
- And I think I've already said it before on the podcast.

200
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,180
- Yeah, you have. - But that doesn't mean

201
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,300
I wanna talk about it again.

202
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,580
- You have talked about it. - How'd I get it?

203
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,420
What do you fucking mean?

204
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,380
I was eating guys' shit.

205
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,620
That's how you get it.

206
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,860
I ate a guy's shit.

207
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,420
And I don't remember if it was on purpose.

208
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,180
That's how you get it, is you have to eat shit.

209
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,680
You have to get shit.

210
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,420
You have to get shit in your mouth.

211
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,100
Is that funny to you?

212
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:05,940
The only way--

213
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,780
- You have to.

214
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,500
- Okay, let me break this down.

215
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,780
I had hepatitis A.

216
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,700
- Draw a diagram.

217
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,540
- Okay, here it is.

218
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,500
Here's hepatitis A, okay?

219
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,220
Hepatitis A, H-A.

220
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,220
The only way to get that is to eat human shit.

221
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:26,420
shit is to get shit in your mouth one way or the other not just in your mouth you

222
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,020
have to go it has to be swallowed what if it's not does it have to be human can it

223
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:40,860
be any shit no it can't go down all the way and it has to hit you and you have

224
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,260
to be able to keep it down it can't come immediately back up yeah no I kept it

225
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:50,140
down cuz I'm a champ yeah okay I'm a fucking bro I'm not gonna sit there and

226
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,860
spit listen I what okay can I ask you a question though what does have been a do

227
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,140
to you it makes you I don't know I didn't know I had it until I didn't have

228
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,780
it anymore I got over it so probably nothing then because you didn't know

229
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,940
well I did but then I thought back and I was like I think I was sleeping like 12

230
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,660
hours a day and I couldn't think and I couldn't and I lost a bunch of weight

231
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:18,260
that's what happened when I when I had mono and I didn't know it yeah but you

232
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,060
Did you eat anybody's shit to get that disease?

233
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,180
No, I kissed a guy though.

234
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,420
On his shit?

235
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,540
Yeah, on his pooper.

236
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,260
Or on his mouth?

237
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,140
On his lip.

238
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,980
Okay.

239
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,800
But he could have eaten poop.

240
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,660
See, his back down pants lip.

241
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,820
See, that's the thing is I could have eaten it,

242
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,780
it could have been somebody,

243
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,940
this is the scenarios,

244
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,220
it could have been, that the doctor was saying,

245
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:40,520
it could have been somebody made some kind of food

246
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,140
at a restaurant and served it to me,

247
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,740
didn't wash their hands. Right, and had poop glove.

248
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,580
It could have been a guy--

249
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,060
Oh my God, wait, you were tricked

250
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,500
at a restaurant into eating poop.

251
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,860
It could have been that. It could have been...

252
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,500
No, 'cause I remember...

253
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,140
We served you...

254
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,780
I remember...

255
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:55,180
Caleb, we've served you a delicious baked potato that it looks like skin all the

256
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,740
way through.

257
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,380
It's one of these...

258
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,500
It's a all skin baked potato.

259
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,580
It's one of these Idaho varieties.

260
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,900
It's a triple baked potato.

261
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:07,100
No, it never happened to me. I... But it could have been...

262
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,340
And it wasn't... This chicken finger's burned, Caleb, but don't worry about it.

263
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,260
We left it a little too long in the oven, but it's fine.

264
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,500
I remember, Caleb...

265
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,180
It's about burned and soft.

266
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,180
I remember you were saying...

267
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,340
It burned but still tender.

268
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:22,620
You were saying like six months before the diagnosis, I remember you were saying, "I'm

269
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:27,140
going to this like fancy Manhattan restaurant tonight."

270
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,140
And then...

271
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
Oh yeah, what was it?

272
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,140
It was called Excretions?

273
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,940
It's Excretions by Jacques.

274
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,940
Well yeah, why did you go to Excretions by Jacques Pierre?

275
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,860
I just had a fucking Groupon just this morning.

276
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,860
Yeah.

277
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,860
It was a Groupon deal.

278
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,860
You had a Poupon?

279
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
Hey, you had a Poupon in your lips?

280
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,300
Yeah, I had a Poupon on my plate and I fucking ate it.

281
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,380
So it could have been I ate it at a restaurant or it could have been I just ate somebody's

282
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,260
- Shit. - Even the flour tortilla.

283
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,500
(laughing)

284
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,020
- It's a black bean burrito.

285
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,280
(laughing)

286
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,980
- This is not what I want to be doing.

287
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
- And hey, you know what?

288
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,660
I know he washed it down with a diet doctor pepper.

289
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,500
- This is my real--

290
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,340
- Okay, so then what's this,

291
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,300
and Caleb's like, okay, that seems normal, I'll eat this,

292
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,140
but what's this little white scrap of paper

293
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,700
that's stuck to part of the beans here?

294
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,540
And then Chet was like, that's some white rice.

295
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,540
It's white gold leaf is what he said.

296
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,540
It was white gold leaf.

297
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,540
That's a white leaf.

298
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,540
And we put corn in there too in the tortilla.

299
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,540
Yeah I get it.

300
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,540
I ate shit.

301
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:29,540
It was south west style.

302
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,540
It's so funny that I ate shit.

303
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:36,540
It's so funny that I ate so much shit that I got sick for six months.

304
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Yeah that's really fucking funny.

305
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,540
That I fucking ate such an unbelievable amount of shit.

306
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:48,640
From some fucking stranger that I got sick so sick. I couldn't get out of bed someday

307
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,020
Because of how much fucking shit I was in your system

308
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:58,480
Yeah, it's funny I ate so much shit it ruined my fucking life laugh it up I

309
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,180
Bet that's fucking funny you immature fucking asshole

310
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,980
bitch

311
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:10,860
That's just not right. If you ate shit, I'd warn you. This chocolate shake is so thick. It's like not even liquid shake

312
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,860
I didn't eat a chocolate shake. I know what it was. I know what it was. It was a chicken and tomato pizza from the pizza place I live above.

313
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:21,860
I know it was because they fuck things up all the time. One time I ate a--

314
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,860
They fuck things up and they put a whole log of poop on it?

315
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,860
It wasn't a fuck up. That's not what happened. I just know the guy. I know he's not that clean. He's a nice dude.

316
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,860
But one time he also served me one where all the chicken was somehow completely raw. They forgot to bake it before they put it on the pizza.

317
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,780
You're walking back up to that you walked back into the pizza place and you're

318
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:45,620
like this is a kind of a weird request but could I have a spoon to eat my

319
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:51,900
coca-cola with? It's like really thick. It did not, no. It was a really thick. I didn't get a

320
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,700
thick coca-cola. This is, you guys don't, you've never been through a medical emergency.

321
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,100
What are you talking about? I had mono. I didn't complain about it.

322
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,140
Mono is way different than eating shit and having sickness from it for months

323
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:09,340
and months on end and not knowing until after it's already left your system.

324
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:12,980
My spleen could have ruptured at any point. I do a lot of physical activity.

325
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,140
I had death blight. You didn't have death blight.

326
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:18,260
I had death blight. Alright, alright. We had real serious medical

327
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,860
problems and you're over there making shit up just for fun.

328
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:25,260
I was not making up. I had death blight. I remember you got barnacled into a ship for

329
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,820
a time. You were on the side of a ship. You were

330
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
in cover. You were entombed in barnacles for some time.

331
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,460
Him and the other guys he was barnacled in with, beautiful voices.

332
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,300
when they would sing when they would sing when they would sing you're very nice

333
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,980
voices and I remember that you would be completely still and then when you would

334
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,380
come to sing you'd be like and eat all the barnacles would crack off yeah not

335
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,460
all of them some of them yes Bill Turner bootstrap Bill Turner was your dad I

336
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:57,220
also got frozen solid one time really into a block is that why you're from a

337
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:02,980
different time no no is that what you drink I didn't drink a chocolate shake

338
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
with a chocolate poop cake next to it.

339
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:10,220
Where, you don't see those red and white striped straws anymore.

340
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,980
What the fuck are you talking about?

341
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,980
You don't see those red and white striped straws anymore.

342
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Did you ever see those?

343
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,980
I don't think I ever saw those.

344
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:18,780
Shaw's and Jimmy Neutron in the 50's movie.

345
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:26,260
So you know the 50's movie.

346
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,460
The 50's movie.

347
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,100
But you don't see them anymore.

348
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,380
You don't see them anymore, but they used to be a big thing.

349
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,980
- Jimmy, the straws, the white and the barber shop

350
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,580
- Yeah. - coal straws.

351
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,660
- Jimmy Neutron's red and white straw

352
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,340
used to be in every malt shop

353
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,740
and every shake shack in the country.

354
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,580
- I don't think that that, I think--

355
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,980
- Maybe it's just difficult to make like--

356
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:56,020
- A red and white straw. - Plastic.

357
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:56,860
- Yeah. - Yeah.

358
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,700
- Well, nowadays, they're trying to make these straws--

359
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,080
- I think it's just, I think it's out of style.

360
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,540
- They wanna make straws out of--

361
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,640
It was a fad. It was a they want to make sure I was out of water and air now.

362
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,340
Yeah. Yeah, and that's just not for me. It's crazy.

363
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:10,340
How stupid paper straws are they got to be the worst.

364
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,840
It's insane. It literally like no, it's correct.

365
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,540
Like it's the kind of thing where you see people actually playing about it and

366
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:18,140
you'd though at the continue.

367
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,240
Can yeah, what I'm not speaking to anybody right now.

368
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,640
I'm kind of speaking to a ghost that's in the room.

369
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:24,540
But what you're doing is extremely distracting and ruining everything.

370
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,740
Yeah, genuinely you got owned.

371
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,920
- Yeah, but I feel like you see people complain about it

372
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,940
and if you had never used a paper straw

373
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,900
before you would expect that someone was being a baby

374
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,760
about it, but they literally in 10 seconds,

375
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,660
they're unusable.

376
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,280
- Yeah, they turn into mush. - Yeah, it's crazy.

377
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,340
- Dude, they're the worst things in the world.

378
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,580
They'll give them to you at the bodega

379
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,700
and then like I'll get a Diet Dr. Pepper

380
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,420
and then I'll try and drink it and then--

381
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,720
- You're trying to pepper cast again.

382
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,900
You're just-- - It's not gonna happen.

383
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,740
- The only reason you brought this up--

384
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,460
- Wait, reference, stop making,

385
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,820
stop making the trying to make pepper cast happen.

386
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,100
- What's that a reference to?

387
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
mean girls. The mean girls. Yeah, which is what you two are. A couple of mean girls.

388
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:11,600
I'm so not a mean girl. As if. As if I'm a fucking mean girl. Wait, I'm a mean girl.

389
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,360
You are a mean girl. You're a machine girl. I just realized. In your shirt. I wear a machine

390
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:24,020
girl shirt on. Yeah, you're a mean girl. Long hair. Mustache. I mean, you got reasons to

391
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:28,620
be mean if you're a girl with a mustache I guess. Yeah, bearded ladies are usually

392
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,700
always very mean to me. I kind of like girls with mustaches. Yeah. Yeah.

393
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:39,480
Yeah. Frida Kahlo. Frida Kahlo, hot. She's just had a hairy head. She's had a

394
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,500
unibrow. Yeah. Which, kind of nice. That's a mustache. That is a girl mustache.

395
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,820
I mean, the question of whether something is a mustache, if it's a

396
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,500
mustache in the Mii Maker on Wii, then it's a mustache and a unibrow is a mustache.

397
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,340
- Yeah, exactly.

398
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,160
- It was a mustache.

399
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,500
- Do you ever know anybody with a real--

400
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,660
- Antenna, that's a mustache.

401
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,220
- Real crazy unibrow, you don't have one, right?

402
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,400
- No, but I could have had one.

403
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,240
- You could have?

404
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,060
(laughing)

405
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,900
What does that, what could that mean?

406
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,740
- Just with like, what happened in my life.

407
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,380
- A ghost of unibrow past came to him

408
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,980
and showed him what if he had done something different

409
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,180
in his life, he would have had one.

410
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,340
- Yeah.

411
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,780
- Maybe I'll start putting like,

412
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,020
I'll buy some like Rogaine

413
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,100
and put it just between my eyes,

414
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:14,940
try to grow big.

415
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,060
I feel like that might be a nice defining feature.

416
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:22,060
Yesterday, I saw, I had to have seen 10, 15 white guys

417
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,460
with perfectly bald heads that looked exactly like--

418
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,300
- Together?

419
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,820
- No, just different, no, that would've been a little--

420
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,900
- 'Cause together you should report that.

421
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,740
- No, no, no.

422
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,460
(laughing)

423
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,820
That's stereotyping.

424
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,980
Together I would've joined them.

425
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,980
- Yeah, so we have to report this now.

426
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,260
- No, I don't have to.

427
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,900
No, I didn't see them together, first of all.

428
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,020
I saw them separately.

429
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,260
A couple of them had almost the same clothes on that I had.

430
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,740
- All Amazon essentials.

431
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,940
- It was a fully Amazon, fully good fellowed out.

432
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:55,300
just good fellow straight from Target with an Amazon essentials watch but I I

433
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:00,820
was thinking I was like I need something that isn't just being bald to being bald

434
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:04,020
it's not enough anymore everybody has micro plastic you get a head you get

435
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:09,780
like a one hoop earring and wear a white t-shirt no that looks stupid what do you

436
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:13,780
mean that looks if I got earrings that'd be too much you got you get one earring

437
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,180
you wear a white shirt all the same white pants you were that okay

438
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,980
- Those weren't all white for a minute, like God.

439
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,820
- Lip piercing.

440
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:22,640
- Lip piercing.

441
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,480
- I'm not getting snake bites.

442
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,300
- You should get a nose piercing.

443
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,340
- No, just one big lip piercing.

444
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,180
- A big one?

445
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,020
- The one that--

446
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:27,840
- You should get a boob piercing.

447
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,140
- I'm not getting a nose ring, I'm not you.

448
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,180
Do you have a nose ring?

449
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,020
- No.

450
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,340
- For some reason I thought you did.

451
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:35,180
- No, I have one earring.

452
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,180
- Yeah, on your nose.

453
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,260
- Yeah.

454
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,020
- My girlfriend has a septum piercing,

455
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,380
but she doesn't, she flips it up.

456
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,660
- Yeah, a lot of people do that.

457
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,780
- Yeah, she doesn't want it anymore.

458
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,620
- I know.

459
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,440
- But she doesn't want to take it out

460
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,820
feel weird. My brother has that and he but he he just likes it because it makes his

461
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,040
nose look a little different. Yeah. Makes it look like it has a hole in it. Yeah.

462
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:00,760
Interesting. But yeah maybe I'll get a... Maybe you should get one of them. Maybe you know

463
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,640
what you should get. I'm thinking about body modifications and I'm thinking

464
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,280
about gauges and stuff like that and I think maybe the next big step for one of

465
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,560
us is to get the hole that they put in the side of cows. You know on our stomach.

466
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,760
We've talked about this. We've talked about this. I don't know if we talked about...

467
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,300
We know we've talked about the whole I know we've talked about the whole have

468
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,400
been talking about getting it getting ourselves.

469
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,760
Yeah. You told me about it and it scared me.

470
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,320
So did we talk about it as a fashion statement is what I'm asking.

471
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,600
I think that also.

472
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,640
What are you doing?

473
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,120
Get him off the screen.

474
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,160
Who is that?

475
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,160
That's LL Cool J.

476
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,440
Oh, he looks good.

477
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,520
You're saying that's Caleb?

478
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,240
Oh, I could do that.

479
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,920
This doesn't make any sense what you're doing.

480
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,760
Yeah.

481
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,280
You can't you can't do this.

482
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,080
We're not supposed to be acknowledging you.

483
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,520
Yeah, you're really, you're not even supposed to be here.

484
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,360
Yeah.

485
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,400
That's okay. Ghost.

486
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
That's what, just leave that up the whole time.

487
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Look at your phone.

488
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:01,480
But the hole in the side of you, if you're a cow.

489
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,440
So we already did the cow one,

490
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,480
so I guess we should think of something else maybe.

491
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,600
Okay, so if you're, for your, of the three of us,

492
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,520
who do you think is the biggest candidate

493
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
for that being a combination of--

494
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,680
It's fucking obvious.

495
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
Why you?

496
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:16,080
I guess what are you going to say

497
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
combination of?

498
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,260
But at the beginning of that question,

499
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,060
I could I can't think of a

500
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,960
combination of fashion and function,

501
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,640
which is what that whole could be.

502
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,720
Yeah. Which is.

503
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,020
Yeah. We we talked about this

504
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,480
already. We just put the food inside

505
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,020
of it.

506
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,680
But I have an upset stomach all the

507
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,840
time.

508
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,240
I have a sensitive stomach.

509
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,540
I also have a sensitive stomach.

510
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:35,080
But I've learned recently I get

511
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,600
stressed diarrhea.

512
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,080
Do you? Everybody gets stressed.

513
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,020
I've never I didn't do that.

514
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,800
Didn't happen until recently, though.

515
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Oh, you're dying.

516
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,720
Yeah, I think you're dying.

517
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,840
What was that?

518
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,680
Oh, my God. You're death rattle.

519
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,820
And then I die. That was a great death

520
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:54,380
pantomime. That was good.

521
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,060
You fully knocked yourself out for a

522
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,080
sec.

523
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,980
We should get a coffin for you.

524
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,740
Maybe. OK, what about here's my new

525
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm coming back. We did the cow one.

526
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,320
Have we done this like

527
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,240
a 50s sci fi alien where

528
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,780
it's a glass bubble and you can see

529
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,780
the brain.

530
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,320
Oh, my God.

531
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:11,320
Like evil, evil.

532
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,800
And then a cool, ironic kind of trucker hat on top of that, maybe even.

533
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
That's fire.

534
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,840
Could be the next level for Brooklyn fashion.

535
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,200
To show your brain off?

536
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Yeah.

537
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,560
I think I would be a bit embarrassed at how small my brain is.

538
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,600
Oh, man, that seems like a you problem.

539
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,600
It isn't me problem, but I'm just saying that's going to be a big bear.

540
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
But maybe that could also give you-

541
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,480
But you don't know, you've never seen your fucking brain, you piece of shit.

542
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,240
I saw my brain when I had deathblight.

543
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,240
Why?

544
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,240
But I think that-

545
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,600
I can literally see my brain right now.

546
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,720
That could also be incentive to make your brain bigger and stronger, to work out your

547
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,720
mind.

548
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:50,500
see it so and you'll study you'll want to study every night if you don't fuck

549
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,800
your bro my god guys I think I'm gonna fuck my brain stop don't fuck your brain

550
00:21:54,800 --> 00:22:01,220

551
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:05,840

552
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,460

553
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,100

554
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:20,660
Yeah, it's back. That was really good. I could watch you do that all day. Talk to your own brain with

555
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:25,100
your eyes rolled back. That was cool. It hurts my eyes now. Yeah, it does hurt your

556
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,180
really eyes. So does crossing your eyes. You guys good at crossing your eyes?

557
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,020
I'm not good at it.

558
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,620
I don't know if I can do it. That hurts my eyes too. If someone can do it without holding their finger up, I'm

559
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:42,060
very impressed easily I'm not sure if I can I think I can't I thought I used to

560
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:46,300
be able to do one eye I used to be able to as well this girl Kelsey taught me

561
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:52,380
yeah you're doing it a little bit yeah I'm not not not good at it no you're

562
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:59,380
doing? You look stupid. Hold that face. Don't laugh like that. What that look like? I know

563
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:14,380
it look like I'm crossing the eye. You just look dumb. What is up with you? You just had

564
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:24,940
bubble. I had a bubble because I drank a white monster. What is this thing that you got?

565
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,220
Super Elixir. Hero hydration. So you would say that you going out and doing trivia last

566
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:36,540
night and getting fucked up is heroic? Yeah. I mean, hey, I'm fucking dude. It's Marvel,

567
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:42,580
Brandon. I got some crazy questions right last night. Oh, here's my question. Last night

568
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:48,540
I insisted that the capital of Newfoundland was Newfoundland and Labrador.

569
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,220
He kept saying it over and over and everyone kept saying, "No, Patrick, the answer is the

570
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,220
city."

571
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,300
They're asking, "What's the capital of Newfoundland and Labrador?"

572
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,880
And he kept being like, "If the answer is Newfoundland and Labrador, and if I'm wrong,

573
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,180
you can kill me."

574
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,940
Over and over and everyone was like, "No, that's the question that they're asking."

575
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,940
And then it was...

576
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,940
What was the answer?

577
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,940
St. John.

578
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
The answer was St. John.

579
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,620
St. John, that's a fucking guy.

580
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,620
Yeah.

581
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,420
That's a bold statement if you ask me.

582
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:19,420
But I did get what gay blues singer was in Inconvenient Truth.

583
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:21,340
Who's gay blues singer?

584
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,020
Gay blues singer is Melissa Etheridge.

585
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,020
What?

586
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,420
Yeah, that was the answer.

587
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,820
Oh, gay blues singer?

588
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,820
Yeah.

589
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,140
Oh, I thought you, honestly, I thought you said gay blues singer.

590
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,420
Gay blues singer is this guy who keeps coming to the bar.

591
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,940
Oh, he doesn't sound very cool.

592
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,180
A really funny one, a mishearing of those that happened.

593
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,900
I was talking to I was talking to Pierce about Spy Kids 2. Like we were already

594
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:48,540
talking about Spy Kids 2 and then he said something about like Spy Kids 2.

595
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,460
Like I get he just said that phrase again and I was like what is spike and

596
00:24:52,460 --> 00:25:07,380
stew? And I was so confused. Spike and stew? Yeah. That is crazy. We were literally already my brain was loaded into Spy Kids 2 and I still somehow. Oh my god. Yeah. You need to go to the, you did have a stroke.

597
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:18,580
Spike and Stu. Spike and Stu. Spike and Stu. Sounds good right? It does sound good. I can

598
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:26,780
picture it now. Spike is small and Stu is tall. But Stu is business class. You're thinking

599
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:32,660
STU. Stu is business class and Spike is economy. That's what I thought when he said it. I thought

600
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,660
I was singing S-T-E-W.

601
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,660
And I was singing it as Spiked.

602
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Spiked Stew.

603
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,660
I thought it was...

604
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,660
There's different ways to do it.

605
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,660
Spiked Stew.

606
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,660
Do not taste of the Spiked Stew.

607
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:50,660
We did it again.

608
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,660
With you saying this story.

609
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,660
I thought you said Spiked Stew.

610
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,660
And he said Spike and Stew.

611
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,660
But he was saying Spiked Stew.

612
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,660
Oh my God.

613
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:07,660
Spike it's stew. Oh my god. Wow. Is there even a fourth one? Spike it's stew. Spike it's

614
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:14,660
stew. Spike and stew. Spike. Nah, it's not worth it. Speak and spell. Nah. Did you guys

615
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:18,740
have, was there any time last night where you, there was somebody who said something

616
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:22,380
about like sports or something on the trivia things and you were like, God I wish Caleb

617
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:26,360
was here. There was no sports. There was not a sports section but we fucking do. We crush

618
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:30,840
It's like words that end with Z or end or begin with Z and we said

619
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,260
You have to come up with a word

620
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,260
What no that was a category? Yeah? Oh, what was the word there was 10? Oh, you know what?

621
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,660
What was the one proud of me? Okay? I'm already proud of you, buddy. I

622
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:47,360
Got one of the answers was Zaza Petulia Zaza mm-hmm

623
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,900
Game seven mm-hmm. Do that's a guess I all-timer video one of the ugliest people. Oh my god

624
00:26:52,900 --> 00:27:01,240
Zaza Pachulia. We're going to game seven! Nothing easy! Yeah he's awesome. Yeah. He broke Kawhi

625
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,180
Leonard's foot or something. Wow. Yeah it's pretty fucked up. That's crazy.

626
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:10,620
All right. The ghost is playing a puzzle. I was going to... I think we just can't

627
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:14,380
talk about the ghost or mention it anymore because it's feeding off of

628
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:19,060
our attention right now. That's true. So you actually have a bad fucking attitude. We're putting it a ghost

629
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,540
embargo right now. No ghost mentioning or looking at. I've already been doing this and you two

630
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:29,020
have insisted on talking to the ghost. I'm saying it to Patrick because I also was doing

631
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,540
that and Patrick said that the ghost was doing a puzzle which I was ignoring. You know what

632
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,060
I want to say some things about the ghost? Talk about them. It sucks. I don't like living

633
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:42,460
in a haunted office. I don't like living here period. I hate this haunted place. I would

634
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,820
really rather live at home with my girlfriends. I really don't know why I choose to live at

635
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,340
the office instead of at my apartment. Especially because it's haunted. It makes no sense.

636
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:54,500
I saw a cockroach. I don't even have a bed here. You saw a cockroach here? Yeah. Did you

637
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,900
say you saw a mouse here? Did somebody say that? I think that there's a mouse in there.

638
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:01,740
Oh, that's all bullshit. I think there's a mouse in the ceiling. Or in the walls. What

639
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:07,460
the fuck are you fucking talking about? Why? I heard like, I was here alone and I heard.

640
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:13,140
Don't tell me you heard a squeak and now you're saying, wow. You think that you heard a squeak

641
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:18,140
and there has to be a mouse? What if it could be a toy? Or a squeaker? Or a squeak?

642
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,660
That was a distinct mouse sound. You don't know, you don't live with mice.

643
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:25,020
Somebody could have been watching a mouse video on their phone. That's a good fucking point.

644
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:29,420
Flying on the floor upstairs and playing a mouse video into the floor.

645
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:34,380
Did I ever tell you guys that my, or did I not ever, but did I tell you guys that the mice are

646
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,740
back in my apartment? It's becoming a yearly thing. You should get a cat. Dude, I already

647
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:42,060
got a dog. My mouse. And buddy, they don't get along. That's like me having a dog and you saying

648
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:49,020
you should get a mailman. It's not gonna work. But I found Moe and he's

649
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:53,460
been living with me. Why are you talking about your cat like he's

650
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:58,980
like your gay boyfriend and we're your parents? I found Moe, he's been living with me.

651
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,540
He's been living, ever since he's been in the apartment, all the mice

652
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:07,260
have gone. I guess the other day. Yeah, they should be scared. Although he's the same size.

653
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,380
I keep he walked into the living room up to kneel with him

654
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:18,260
What he's so small that's killed it dude good for him. Yeah, and good for you. That's a right of passage for him

655
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,180
Yeah, the man now. That's that's secured his his space. I still have not even fucking met this kid. Yeah

656
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,740
He's a fucker

657
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,380
Is he big is he big now? He's getting big. He's pretty big now. What are you feeding him?

658
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:35,020
He eats like half a can

659
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:42,660
Every morning an entire like the metal and all like yeah, oh wow yeah, that'll be Jesus dude. He's a straight

660
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:49,860
He's a scrapper to a robot. Yeah, I wish that's a robot. Oh my god. You're debuting this character now

661
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,860
I can't do it yet

662
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,620
That's a little taste. Yeah, you'll see you guys will see it in future episodes

663
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:03,920
Yeah, big changes coming around here, and we might have Cameron doing a robot. Yeah, it's called. Don't say what it's called. Yeah, Mo

664
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:10,100
Don't say that. Okay, he'll be doing some kind of robotic character. Is that better?

665
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,940
Yeah, we put a

666
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:15,780
For I don't know why when you remember that couch that we had yeah

667
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:20,500
No one wants to get rid of that big couch cushion that came with it

668
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,880
We got rid of the couch, but kept the cushion for some reason

669
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,940
It's like a boogie board and now that just on the chair in the living room. It's just like up against the wall and

670
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,580
and Moe climbs to the top of it and jumps off.

671
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,620
- Trying to kill himself.

672
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,460
- Yeah.

673
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,280
- 'Cause he hates you so much.

674
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,120
- He doesn't hate me.

675
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,620
He sleeps in my bed.

676
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,740
- That's 'cause he wants you to fucking

677
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,000
roll over and crush him.

678
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,140
He's trying to kill himself.

679
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,220
- He's not trying to kill himself.

680
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,060
- He is.

681
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,600
- Do you think a cat could land on its back

682
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,140
if it wanted to or they can only land on their feet?

683
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,460
- I wanna see a cat while it's jumping

684
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,740
jump backwards like this, coffin style,

685
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,340
and then pull two deagles out and then--

686
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,180
- Damn.

687
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,020
(laughing)

688
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,620
They're firing on every house in the apartment. That could be some fucking Resident Evil movie shit.

689
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,620
And then land on its back.

690
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:10,120
And land on its back, slide across the floor, still shooting.

691
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,620
Then, kip up, right? Back into a backflip.

692
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Backflip and back into the coffin.

693
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:19,620
Yeah, back into the coffin, lands on a guy's head with the guy's head between its legs, right?

694
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,620
Breaks his neck with his legs.

695
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
Twist, yeah.

696
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,620
And then he goes into a...

697
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:32,360
into oh my god then when he lands he says meow it's personal per all per its

698
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:39,600
meows in all or no yeah I just used the meow no wait what would he say if he's

699
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,560
an action cat a caption in the cat room stars if he was what fuck it a catch and

700
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:52,960
per action star clar a cat an action action clar an action claw if he was a

701
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,680
Caxton Clarke he was a brother squire so if he had the brothers score

702
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:05,240
Also before this whole scene there's a close-up on his eye and and it narrows a little bit then a close-up on his paw claws come

703
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,240
out yeah

704
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,480
And then claws go I cause weird claws go on get a gun

705
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,760
Oh, and he has a scar down his eye Moe has some kind of like we're not

706
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,720
I don't care about your real cat. I want to know what we're talking

707
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,800
This is what I've been picturing the whole time, but fucking what would okay?

708
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,080
What would all right? I said what mo would be doing all right?

709
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,900
What would most say we need a good phrase for him to say we want the dialogue for the movie because that's a lot of

710
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,980
People don't know a lot of movies. That's half the fucking movie is the dialogue and people fucking forget that

711
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:42,120
I'm I must have just gotten one kill per bullet and then he could say he cut somebody's throat with his paw

712
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:46,220
Yeah, and he says he needs some milk. He says that's what I call giving throat

713
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:50,660
I'm here to shoot bad guys and eat and eat

714
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:55,540
Purina or no, what's a good cow mix is a cow

715
00:32:55,540 --> 00:33:02,660
I'm here. I'm here to sniff cat or eat catnip and kick ass. They don't eat and I'm all out of cat

716
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:06,140
They eat it. They don't eat it. They sniff it and they go crazy. They eat it

717
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,900
Oh my god, and even before all that's and he sniffs catnip and that's what gets him another kill

718
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:13,980
Oh shit, that's what gives him his power like fucking people in real life. It's like Bane with the venom

719
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,940
He smokes the catnip like a joint.

720
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,620
He has a syringe of catnip that he puts into his body.

721
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,660
He smokes the catnip.

722
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,780
Like a cigarette.

723
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,740
Maybe he could be like...

724
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,420
That upset Caleb I guess.

725
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
Yeah it seems like...

726
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:30,420
I can't do this.

727
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,600
If a cat can smoke a cigarette, I can't do this.

728
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:38,300
Maybe he could, maybe his line is he's pointing a gun at somebody and maybe he says something

729
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,300
like...

730
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Careful, that's going to foam over.

731
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,140
He says something like, "Lights out furball."

732
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:48,540
yeah but he everyone in his head he doesn't like everyone looks at is a cat

733
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:54,200
to him yeah no also maybe he's putting in a mouse also yeah so a mouse has fur too

734
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,580
well okay so that's the other thing is well I guess we're just coming up with

735
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:02,220
at this point it's just cats versus dogs it's a movie this is cats versus mice so

736
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:06,340
it's completely there's a video of a cat smoking a cigarette holy shit he's not

737
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:11,660
smoking it that thing isn't even fucking lit not even it has the cigarette yeah

738
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
I mean he's not smart.

739
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,660
Poor performance.

740
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Smart cat smoking a cigarette.

741
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Purr-formance.

742
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
Oh my god.

743
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Purr-fer-mance.

744
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:20,660
Purr-fer-mance art.

745
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,660
Purr-fer-man who is a cat.

746
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Yeah.

747
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:29,660
Well what, yeah I guess what if it was like taken, what would somebody need to take to

748
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,660
uh...

749
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,660
His toy.

750
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:32,660
His toy.

751
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:33,660
Like a sock or something.

752
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,660
Definitely his toy, yeah.

753
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:35,660
Or his owner.

754
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
He took my damn...

755
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Or his daughter I guess.

756
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
He took my damn sock.

757
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,660
It could still be his daughter.

758
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
And my daughter.

759
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:44,980
about their kids. Yeah. Trust me. Maybe it's all of the kids. You took a damn sock that I

760
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,860
played with and I'm coming for you. I'm coming! Yeah. And then he would say I'm coming. I have a

761
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:56,900
particular set of kills, because this is more about killing than skills. I have a particular

762
00:34:56,900 --> 00:35:05,220
set of paws that I can use to kill and claw your brains out. Yeah. And that's the thing, his gun

763
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:09,540
would probably just shoot claws. And then he could, right before he kills the final bad guy, maybe,

764
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,540
Maybe? Maybe.

765
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,660
Your litter to me.

766
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,260
Mmm.

767
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,620
And then he shits in his mouth.

768
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,060
Yeah.

769
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:16,700
Almost a jinx.

770
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,980
And then he does that thing where he

771
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,220
licks his nuts.

772
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,060
Oh, yeah.

773
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,060
They lift their leg up.

774
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,660
Post-credits scene.

775
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,140
They lift their legs up and they lick

776
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,140
their nuts on you.

777
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,420
Yeah.

778
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
He isn't neutered yet.

779
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,580
Post-credits scene, Linger by

780
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,900
the Cranberries is playing.

781
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,820
Oh my God.

782
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,900
And it's a romantic scene between him

783
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:33,900
and his own nuts.

784
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,300
Yeah.

785
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,860
Right. And it's like cross-cutting and

786
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:36,860
it's like, "With you."

787
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:44,100
Because earlier in the movie, his ops try to send him to a vet to get him neutered.

788
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Oh my god, this is the movie. He gets sent to-- the bad guys capture him and they say,

789
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,100
"We're going to neuter you."

790
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,100
Right? They neuter him, and he calls him, he says,

791
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:59,100
"You got my damn ball sack over there at the hospital.

792
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:05,100
And I'm not coming for just my balls. I'm coming for my brother's balls, too!"

793
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:11,460
He comes in, he's doing a backflip, coffin flip, kills the vets, slices their fucking

794
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,420
necks off, and then it's a reuniting.

795
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:17,300
He gets, look at those cat balls, those are awesome.

796
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:21,820
He gets them off the pickle, out of the pickle jar, right?

797
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:27,980
He got his buddy who's maybe a smart ass parrot going, "I'll put your balls back!"

798
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
Right?

799
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,620
He fucking uses a nail gun, shoots them back into his body, and then Cameron's eyes went

800
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,620
cross-eyed for a second.

801
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:37,700
About this concept is it's so good and then and then

802
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,800
They're like he's with them. Oh my god a parrot is already fucking unlikely. It's a bird a cat

803
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,540
Yeah, but they're both pets been a mouse

804
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:51,340
No cats try to keep birds teams up or a parrot and a fish and a parrot fish and mouse but a parrot speaks English

805
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:54,820
But the mouse teams up can I get your post-credits scene for this version of the story?

806
00:36:54,820 --> 00:37:00,380
Okay, but real quickly linger plays and he starts fucking licking his balls, and that's like the romantic fucking reunion

807
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,040
So they put these balls back on his body with surgery.

808
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,740
He gets the parrot, the parrot puts this back on with surgery.

809
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,940
Post-credits, post-post-credits, this is the very last thing.

810
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:13,140
And it's like, and he's like, and the parrot's like,

811
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,640
"I just realized something."

812
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,740
What's the cat's name?

813
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,580
- Chevin.

814
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,640
- "I just realized something, Chevin."

815
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,480
- I just realized something, Chevin!

816
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,220
- No, it shouldn't be Chevin, it should be Mittens.

817
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,640
- I'm not sure that those were your balls.

818
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,700
And then, because there were human balls all along,

819
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,540
the cat has--

820
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,860
- Oh my God, the cat has big human balls.

821
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,240
- The cat cat has big human balls,

822
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,280
the human testosterone pumps into his body

823
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,740
and he becomes a human hybrid.

824
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,580
- Or, you know what a good thing would be,

825
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,760
is he says, "I'm not sure those are your balls."

826
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:43,280
And then cut to, there's a Polish--

827
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,240
- The bad vet.

828
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,040
- The bad vet is driving away,

829
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,360
"Get your motor running."

830
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,560
(imitates engine revving)

831
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,100
And in the driver's seat, right as it goes,

832
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,240
"Bond to me, wah!"

833
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,380
The pickle jar with his actual balls in it.

834
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,220
- Oh, I was gonna say--

835
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,140
- And it says labeled at the top, "Mittens."

836
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,980
- Yeah.

837
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,600
- And he did a swap.

838
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:02,120
was here's what I thought here's where I thought you're gonna move is called the

839
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:08,180
no it cuts to the bad guy who they defeated yeah and he's like he wakes up

840
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,200
and he's like bloody and battered and he straps to a table he's like where am I

841
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:23,600
he looks down cat balls on his ball oh so there was a switch oh and in the next

842
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:29,540
movie they have to team up to find a third pair of balls to put on their

843
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:35,600
friend. Yeah. Could be pretty good movie. Does a snake, does a, if you did that with

844
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:42,620
any animal it would work except a snake so we have to cancel that. So we can't do

845
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:47,860
a snake version of the movie. Snakes don't have balls. They have testicles maybe, I

846
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,540
I don't know.

847
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:50,740
They have a chinchilla pee on me.

848
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,740
That's that's awesome.

849
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:55,700
Oh, no. And my roommate had a skink.

850
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,060
It's going to get so off topic.

851
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,100
But the snake version of his balls could be

852
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:04,900
well, look at snakes have a hole that opens up and their things pop out.

853
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,340
It's all just one thing.

854
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,260
OK, look up. Snakes genitals have balls.

855
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:16,420
They have two balls that function the same way a human do.

856
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,560
Take a screenshot of that.

857
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,060
Yeah, you need to screenshot that.

858
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:20,860
That is incredible.

859
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:23,580
Wait, snakes have two penises?

860
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,860
Do snakes have balls?

861
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,700
Two balls.

862
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,740
They have two balls that function the same way.

863
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,940
Yeah, they have like a slit that opens up,

864
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:32,460
and their penis and balls comes out.

865
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,100
Whoa.

866
00:39:33,100 --> 00:39:33,780
Two balls.

867
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,380
I'm seeing here it says snake puzzle ball.

868
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,180
That's not a puzzle I want to figure out.

869
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,780
It's a puzzle trying to make these snakes fucking

870
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,660
cum these days.

871
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,180
Yeah, it's Chris Pontius talking about breeding snakes.

872
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:46,220
It does look like Chris Pontius.

873
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:51,340
I do think that maybe this is, it's just hard to have a snake as a boyfriend.

874
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
I think the snake balls movie...

875
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,340
Unless you're a female snake, of course.

876
00:39:55,340 --> 00:40:00,240
The snake balls movie is even better because it's hidden whether or not they have balls

877
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,360
until you open up their little kind of genital area thing.

878
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,320
So there could be a lot more tension and suspense as to whether he got his balls back or not.

879
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,720
Let me tell you, their genital area...

880
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,720
It's bussin', bussin'.

881
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,720
It's bussin'.

882
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Mine stinks.

883
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:19,960
I think there stays busting well in Udalla. Mine is similarly scaly and scuted.

884
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:25,920
I'm, my genital area this month, molting. One time I did, I've found, I've found it

885
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,640
previously, I've found just full scabs in my pubes. Yeah? Yeah, just full scabs. From

886
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,800
from grooming it? Or like dandruff maybe. Maybe dandruff. Just like came to the surface.

887
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:42,600
Do you have psoriasis? Probably. What's that? It's what my grampy had. Yeah, I have that.

888
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,520
did you how do you know about it he had stuff on his nuts he had like like

889
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,360
flaky hair on there you had like yes the grossest people my grandpa's pubes were

890
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:59,240
disgusting they were white and wiry ah wait you don't get white pubes when you

891
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:04,640
get older do you do I think you get gray pubes like Gandalf's beard

892
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,720
Jubo can you look up yeah thank you images images images for grandpa pubes

893
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,720
See, they go white.

894
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,720
None of these are white! Why are you saying they go white?

895
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,720
That is a lady and it says ginger pubes.

896
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,720
They just don't look... by the looks of it...

897
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
That's a guy...

898
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
Just google "do pubes go white?"

899
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Just google "pubes of white all over them."

900
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,720
"White ass pubes."

901
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
Okay.

902
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
This is a guy...

903
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Nasty boy is done.

904
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
That's a guy with his whole hole out.

905
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
He's completely bare.

906
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
He looks like he's made of silicone.

907
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,060
- He has no pubes.

908
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,180
- Yeah, he honestly looks like a gummy candy.

909
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,220
(laughing)

910
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,860
- Yeah, he does look delicious.

911
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:47,860
- I genuinely would eat that if it was in front of me.

912
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,540
(laughing)

913
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,720
- All right, yeah, now Google candy.

914
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,780
- Do you guys think it's okay to eat butt?

915
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,620
- No.

916
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,440
- I think that's wrong.

917
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,280
- I don't think it's right.

918
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,540
- We're gonna take that out of there.

919
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,380
- Yeah, I think it's--

920
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,860
- We're taking butt off the menu.

921
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:03,620
This is officially, we're stepping in here.

922
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:07,000
It's been some kind of fucking emergency thing

923
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,640
where people got the wrong idea about all this stuff.

924
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,800
And God never put that butt on your body

925
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,400
so you could fucking put it in your mouth.

926
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,360
Or put it in your wife's mouth.

927
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,720
- It is fine.

928
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,600
But for me, I'm going to the butt buffet.

929
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,560
- You're not going to the butt buffet.

930
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,480
- You're literally a munch, dude.

931
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,320
- You're a munch, dude.

932
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,120
- You're acting like a munch right now.

933
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
- You act, nah, dude.

934
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,560
- That's actually a compliment.

935
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,800
So a munch, being a munch is not a compliment.

936
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,720
- Dude, I would not even put my mouth on a woman's leg.

937
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
I'm not putting her butthole in my mouth.

938
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,980
(laughing)

939
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,480
- That's disgusting, dude.

940
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,960
- Now, a machine that goes into the butt is okay.

941
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,680
- That's fine, or a different guy.

942
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,560
- It would be fine if maybe--

943
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,820
- Or maybe like a fist.

944
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:51,660
- A machine--

945
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,920
- That's fine, I'll put my hand in there.

946
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:53,760
I've put my hand in the toilet before.

947
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,280
- Look, I'll put my hand in there,

948
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,600
I'll use her like a puppet.

949
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,440
- Yeah, that's fine.

950
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,200
- Yeah, maybe even just a puppet.

951
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,040
- That's disgusting.

952
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,120
- A puppet's mouth can go down there.

953
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:02,960
- I shouldn't have said that.

954
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:03,780
- A latex puppet.

955
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,680
- Yeah, that's fine by me.

956
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:05,520
- That's fine.

957
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,880
Did you see Jeff Dunham is still not canceled?

958
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,880
He's still not?

959
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,960
Speaking of puppets, that's the name of his new special.

960
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,080
Is still not canceled?

961
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,560
Jeff Dunham's still not canceled.

962
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,040
Didn't also Terry Fedor also have a bit of a...

963
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,680
Well, it's crazy that every single ventriloquist...

964
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,040
Culture war, you're saying?

965
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:25,080
Yeah, every single ventriloquist is like that.

966
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,600
And I guess it must be because they're doing...

967
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:32,600
It's like an antiquated art form, ventriloquism.

968
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:39,300
It is. I mean, honestly, it is genuinely impressive, like for Jeff Dunham to do to have a comedy

969
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:44,200
thing that is so unappealing that nobody cares about it enough to try and get mad about it.

970
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,200
Right.

971
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,600
But also has so many has a bunch of fans. That's so impressive.

972
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:54,820
It's like, is he does he actually care about being canceled or is it just because his audience

973
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:57,200
is like geriatric?

974
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,120
I don't think he'd want to get canceled.

975
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,120
What do you mean?

976
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,040
I think he's just I think he's just playing it up.

977
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,980
Cancel culture you're saying that Jeff Dunham. You're this is your theory Jeff Dunham might not have the

978
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:11,660
Best intentions yes, oh wow

979
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:15,080
Yeah, that's something about here. That's a tough pill to swallow

980
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, and you know what he tricks his entire audience into thinking that there's a little man

981
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,240
Yeah, you go ahead and try to cancel a fucking wizard, buddy

982
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,740
See how that fucking exactly pans out for you you want to this guy can make a puppet talk

983
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,740
Right here gonna. You're gonna say hey, buddy. You got to stop doing you got to stop

984
00:44:35,740 --> 00:44:41,380
Yeah, you're cancer right and then he does in your perfect voice makes your mouth moves. That's a pedophile

985
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:43,700
And then all of a sudden you're in fucking jail

986
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:46,780
Who's canceled now? Yeah fucking you absolutely?

987
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:51,260
This guy he can control he can cancel Jeff Dunham

988
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:55,960
You can't do it make a puppet talk with its mouth you do not want to see what this guy can do to a penis balls

989
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:58,420
But in between areas, I don't want to go against this guy

990
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:04,580
He could do pretty much anything under the sun. Put me and this guy on fucking Final Destination Super Smash Brothers

991
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:08,760
He's knocking me off, KOing. Yeah, he could hit fucking 300%

992
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:14,000
He's not moving an inch. I would not I would I genuine I would rather die than be in the octagon with Jeff Dunham. Me too

993
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,640
Oh, yeah, cuz he'll turn the octagon and he'll fold it up like origami

994
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,600
He's an origami expert as well. He's great at origami. And then I'll start fucking making it talk to me, right?

995
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:26,220
It is interesting. All of a sudden and I think I won the fight right all of a sudden I'm sitting there

996
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:30,000
I'm talking to Joe Rogan. Exactly. He's doing I realize he's a fucking puppet. He's doing

997
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:35,040
just puppeting every Jeff Dunham is making all the audience members cheer. Yeah. Or in

998
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,880
boo. Exactly. Yeah, different ways that make me think the fight is going differently. And

999
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,600
then he makes the announcer voice the fight is over. Please take off your pants. Wait,

1000
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,040
I'm not knocked out. But I guess I'll take my pants off because a ref told me to then

1001
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,640
his hand up my butt me saying I lost the fight. I surrender. And then I'm talking to the referee.

1002
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:56,040
I'm saying listen peanut you're a great ref right but I just don't I I just

1003
00:45:56,040 --> 00:46:04,280
You're you're you're listen your your career speaks for itself. You've officiated so many fights. We know this peanut, but P. Listen up

1004
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:10,680
Sit up P. I didn't get knocked out. I'm not slept. I barely we haven't even touched each other

1005
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:17,000
He's telling me I got knocked out fucking bullshit basically. Yeah, he says you have to go back to my corner, right?

1006
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,000
And I'm he says you were knocked out by Jeff a foot

1007
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:25,280
I'm getting my towel or my head toweled off right and then my coach right he looks at

1008
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:32,960
Caleb you gotta you just give up. I say Walter. Hey Walter. What Walter? Just just let me fight man

1009
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Just let me know you're already concussed

1010
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:39,560
And then there's like and then the jalapeno is giving out jalapenos and then Ahmed

1011
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:44,280
Yeah, and then Ahmed comes in blows up the whole fucking place. Yeah, you ever see the photo of

1012
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,920
Jeff Dunham did like it's like

1013
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:49,380
"Ahmed, this is your son."

1014
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:51,540
And then he had like a half boy.

1015
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:55,680
- This is not, don't pull up photos of Sean Evans, Jubio.

1016
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,080
All right, I'm starting to like the ghost a little more.

1017
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,300
The ghost is starting to make me laugh.

1018
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,680
I can't lie.

1019
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,920
- Can you pull up a photo of Ahmed, the dead terrorist's son?

1020
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,080
- He has a son, oh, he does have a son, doesn't he?

1021
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,680
- What, why do you look up, no.

1022
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,480
(laughing)

1023
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,840
- He's got a mind of his own.

1024
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:23,040
he's not doing his job. Good for him. But Ahmed's son is like, he made

1025
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,840
like a little boy that is half skeleton and he's like, "Hello

1026
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,720
daddy, you blew me up!" He's got a British voice? Yeah. That's cool.

1027
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:37,440
That's kind of a political statement. I think honestly for that he deserves to

1028
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,080
be canceled, but you can't cancel him. How can you cancel Jeff? He's uncancellable.

1029
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:46,760
Can you imagine the 10 apology videos he could make?

1030
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:47,760
Yeah.

1031
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,120
In a grid, playing at the same time.

1032
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:54,000
He's sitting there with all the puppets in the room with him and he's doing their voices

1033
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,000
but he's...

1034
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:59,840
I don't want Jeff Dunham to apologize, I want the fucking puppets to apologize.

1035
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:03,720
I don't give a fuck, what Jeff Dunham, Jeff is not saying anything.

1036
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,360
I don't even know why he's on stage.

1037
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,280
Why is he fucking wasting...

1038
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,800
It would be nice if Jeff was cancelled, we could just have a show that's just the puppets.

1039
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Yeah, yeah, true.

1040
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,960
That's a good point.

1041
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:14,800
Get rid of Jeff.

1042
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,520
Here's the thing, nobody ever liked this Jeff guy anyway.

1043
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:20,560
Get rid of him, bring out Ahmed, bring out Jose,

1044
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:22,080
bring out Walter, bring out Peanut.

1045
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,920
That's what we wanna see.

1046
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:23,760
- The four of them together.

1047
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,680
And you know what? - How come they don't

1048
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,840
all four do stuff together?

1049
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:26,800
- We need to give them--

1050
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,080
- They never watch the Jeff Dunham show on Comedy Central?

1051
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:30,960
- But that has Jeff.

1052
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:33,240
- Pick up these guys for SNL.

1053
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,760
Why are we picking up Lonely Island shit?

1054
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,600
- As writers, as writers go.

1055
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,900
- As writers at first, but maybe they can work their way

1056
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,740
onto the cast.

1057
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:40,000
- Can you imagine the please don't destroy guys

1058
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,120
in the same writing room as Peanut?

1059
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,600
Oh my god, Peanut's pitching the greatest stuff

1060
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,440
that they would turn out.

1061
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,200
I need to see a video of those three with Peanut.

1062
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,040
I do actually.

1063
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:50,860
It may be lizo.

1064
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:53,160
And Peanut, just Peanut, listen.

1065
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,600
We all love you baby.

1066
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:58,080
If you are listening at SNL, get Peanut.

1067
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:58,920
Get Peanut in now.

1068
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,400
Get Peanut on that damn show.

1069
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,920
Get him on right now.

1070
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,760
Because I think that he just like--

1071
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,760
Your roster lost Kate, Kyle, AD, and Pete,

1072
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,760
and we need Pete Nut.

1073
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:09,600
Yup.

1074
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,480
His name's not Pete Nut.

1075
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,320
That's his full name.

1076
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:14,200
full name. Oh, you know that if you know the Dunham lore.

1077
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:20,360
Peter. This name isn't Peter Nut. It's Peter Nut. Shut up. And

1078
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:24,280
his last name is Butter. Peter Nut Butter. It's Peter Nut

1079
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,400
Butter Nut. Peter Nut Butter Nut. It's not his name. Peter

1080
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,400
Nut Butter Nut. Peter Nut Butter Nut or Nut. Alright, I'm just

1081
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:37,000
gonna. Yeah, his name's Butter Nut or Nut or Nut. Yeah, that's

1082
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,520
his actually his name. You **** say this **** on my phone.

1083
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:46,380
Yeah, cuz we're running circles around you know Peter butter not or not or what is it even say that a that I wrote

1084
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,960
No, it's happy to say

1085
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,040
Forgot somebody is pulling up a picture somebody says I look like Carl from

1086
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,000
aqua teen

1087
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,720
Do you think I look like that?

1088
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,400
No, you know you kind of sound like him. What are you talking about?

1089
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,760
He doesn't sound like that. I don't remember what he sounds like

1090
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,720
long should I watch Aqua Teen Hunger Force? I never watched that show because to me it

1091
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:14,480
feels like too much like a commercial for McDonald's and I'm above that. That is true it is

1092
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,680
almost subliminal advertising. Yeah. Yep. Yeah. I'd rather I'd rather watch something

1093
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:24,920
like the Matrix. And also on the topic McDonald's bring the meatballs back. I

1094
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:29,280
used to love those damn meatballs. McDonald's meatballs? Yeah when they first

1095
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,680
had this when Aqua Teen first came out it was supposed to be this whole oh yeah

1096
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,320
fries and shakes and meatballs they got everything at McDonald's. Where are the

1097
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:41,120
meatballs now I barely even remember what they taste like. I make meatballs. You know what they did

1098
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,000
have at Burger King I think they still do is a chicken parm sandwich. Yeah they do.

1099
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,080
I ate that when I was five and I puked and pooped at the same time. That's got to

1100
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,280
be one of the stupidest most made-up stories I've ever heard in my life. It's not false. I ate

1101
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,400
anything that says when I was five that any story that starts. That's the first time I got food

1102
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,720
poisoning when I was five. You don't remember anything when you were five. I remember that.

1103
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,840
That's a lie. We can call up my mom. This is the one person on earth who remembers it. Nobody remembers, you don't

1104
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:09,160
remember anything until you turn 15 and then even then every other you know how

1105
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,280
like when you try to remember my birthday. It's not I remember my birthday

1106
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,080
from when I was seven years old. It's a why saying to me what happy birthday

1107
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:21,560
he I mean it's hard and he put his feet in the cake wow and then he flew my

1108
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,960
brother accidentally spit on the cake when he was younger because he was

1109
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:29,920
trying to blow out the candles and then he's trying to blow out the candles and

1110
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:34,880
and just fully just went and just like tried to spit the flame out.

1111
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,880
That is the least interesting.

1112
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:42,600
My brother was trying to blow out his candle and he did.

1113
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,100
And he put some spit on it.

1114
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,100
He spit.

1115
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,520
He just like hocked the loogie on the flame.

1116
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:50,900
Dude, when my brother breathed that one time he spit.

1117
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:54,200
Everyone got mad at him because they couldn't eat the cake.

1118
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,700
I'm going to say for 30 minutes you were a full stone.

1119
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,080
Yeah.

1120
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,780
And then you just went back to, or you were a full bird.

1121
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:02,940
- You were a bird, you were a hand bird.

1122
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,100
- A hand bird, and then you just turned into a stone.

1123
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:05,940
- Yeah.

1124
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,760
- That was a bush bird story.

1125
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:07,600
- Yeah.

1126
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,440
- Bush bird moment.

1127
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,260
- Yeah, that was a bush bird behavior.

1128
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,820
- I didn't take an Adderall today.

1129
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,660
- Really?

1130
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,220
- So you can see a direct difference

1131
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:17,940
between the episode before this and this one.

1132
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,620
You can see my behavior has changed.

1133
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:22,580
- Yeah, you're acting more erratic and almost sociopathic.

1134
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,940
(laughing)

1135
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,340
You are.

1136
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,580
- Yeah, oh my God, who is that?

1137
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,420
- Who is that?

1138
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:31,480
- It's a picture of Ronald McDonald.

1139
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,500
- Who is that, what is he from?

1140
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:34,340
- Oh yeah, what's this?

1141
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:35,660
Does anybody know what this character's from?

1142
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,140
I used to watch this character on TV when I was a kid,

1143
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,620
and I can't find him anymore.

1144
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:41,460
Does anybody?

1145
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,700
- She's fucking gorgeous.

1146
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,740
- Oh my God.

1147
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,500
That looks like a caricature of the Irish.

1148
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:47,460
I don't appreciate it.

1149
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,860
- I like it.

1150
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:49,820
- I love it!

1151
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:51,500
- I love it!

1152
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,340
- Can you pull up--

1153
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,660
- We're bringing it back, we're doing it again.

1154
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,520
- Can you pull up Ronald McDonald singing?

1155
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,880
Does he have a good smell it like that McDonald Mac what is this?

1156
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:11,720
This isn't really Ronald McDonald, this is a drama alert Ronald McDonald this by racker. This is not right

1157
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,720
I don't want to see yeah

1158
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:20,120
Bird bush again. Yeah, you're a complete bush bird get in the hand bush bird there we go

1159
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,200
I'm sorry TV series starring Andrea Savage. Thank you. That's better

1160
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,620
Yo, I bet she's savage as hell if that's the name of her show

1161
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:30,220
She's probably gonna probably gonna have to constantly

1162
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:35,120
You know they call this website IMDB because I am to be in on this website all the time looking up the actors

1163
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,280
They call it IMDB because I am

1164
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,960
DB Cooper, and I'm about to steal their website. I'm gonna have my own dude. I would

1165
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:48,160
Stole he stole the website from the plane. Yeah, yeah, but not from the web

1166
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:53,600
He stole things literally stole a website as you know you wouldn't even know about a DB Cooper

1167
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:59,840
because he'd probably be involved in probably crypto and intellectual property theft instead

1168
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,840
of gold.

1169
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,720
It's a lot easier to be a thief now.

1170
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,720
Yeah.

1171
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:04,720
Yeah.

1172
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,720
Because you just live forever.

1173
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,160
And his name would probably be like Graydon Cooper or something.

1174
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,960
Yeah, if he was a fucking white guy.

1175
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,840
Have you ever seen that movie, Without a Paddle?

1176
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:14,480
Love Without a Paddle.

1177
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:15,480
Love it.

1178
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,480
Okay.

1179
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:17,480
You've seen that.

1180
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:21,560
In that movie, they don't have sex with these women because they have hairy legs.

1181
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:25,000
Nowadays you can't have sex with a woman unless they're hairy.

1182
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,080
Nowadays I can't get hard unless their head legs are hairy.

1183
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:30,440
Unless they look like a bush baby.

1184
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,640
Have you guys ever seen a movie without a TV?

1185
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:33,640
No.

1186
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,640
What's a bush baby?

1187
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,160
I've never seen a movie without a TV.

1188
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,160
Me neither.

1189
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,160
A bush baby?

1190
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,160
That's some kind of Australian animal.

1191
00:54:39,160 --> 00:54:41,160
That's a lemur type thing.

1192
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,160
Really?

1193
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:43,160
Yeah.

1194
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,320
I can't have sex with a woman unless she looks like a lemur.

1195
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,320
Skinny.

1196
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,320
Lemurs are furry.

1197
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:55,740
yeah I got something to tell you guys. I think a lot of lemurs have toxic

1198
00:54:55,740 --> 00:55:00,800
flesh. Wait! This is that fucking little one from Madagascar! Yeah! He's a

1199
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:07,760
fucking bush baby! Yeah! Wow! Do you know the... Madagascar!

1200
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:12,480
You looked up Madagascar. You completely looked up Madagascar. Just search lemurs

1201
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:17,360
Madagascar. There he is! There's the guy. Voiced by... is that the one who's voiced by

1202
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:23,840
Cedric the Entertainer? No, he's the one that's like, "Hello!" That one. That was Cedric the Entertainer.

1203
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:31,120
They don't have enough... I guess the minions have kind of just monopolized it.

1204
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:34,720
Yeah, but there used to be every year there was a kids movie and every year

1205
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:40,080
there was like a little character like that, like, "Scrat, Scrat, this guy."

1206
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:45,040
So what has changed between from, now that I'm thinking about it, from 1997 or 8 to

1207
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:50,680
about 2012 to 2014 that now I don't see these kids movies anymore with little

1208
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:55,000
characters. What is happening? What they would know I'm not aware anymore.

1209
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:59,060
You know what I mean? You know what I mean? Like they kind of like it's like the

1210
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:03,680
public consciousness. It's like everywhere. You think it's the public

1211
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,920
consciousness? You'd see like like toys of them everywhere. Yeah we don't have

1212
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,760
basically like yeah I haven't I've been barely watching any. I barely even look

1213
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:16,020
at branded toys. Whatever happened to these kids movies. I barely see them in the toy

1214
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:20,920
store when I go. Every time I went to the theaters I was watching one of these movies. Yeah.

1215
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:25,880
And now I just don't see them anymore. Until like maybe 15 years ago or so. Yeah I just

1216
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:32,560
can't. So what could that be? You turned off your mic. That's my bad. I have nephews and

1217
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:37,520
I see these movies all the time. All the time? When I lived with them. And now they don't

1218
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,360
have these little characters anymore. And they own the house. And they don't have. And

1219
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:41,520
They're two and three years old.

1220
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:43,080
- Wow, that's really impressive.

1221
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:44,600
- That's very cool.

1222
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,640
- No, but they don't, there's no little like,

1223
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,560
scrats anymore.

1224
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,560
There's no scrats.

1225
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:51,400
There's no more scrats.

1226
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,360
- It is just the minions.

1227
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,200
- It is just the minions.

1228
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:54,960
- But I also would wager there are a bunch of scrats

1229
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,000
that we do not see because we are adults.

1230
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:58,240
- That's true.

1231
00:56:58,240 --> 00:56:59,080
- Yeah.

1232
00:56:59,080 --> 00:56:59,920
- I think that that is much more likely.

1233
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,440
- I'm 15, 16 these days and I just am too old.

1234
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,280
- I don't watch kids movies anymore.

1235
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:04,440
- I'm just too old for that bullshit.

1236
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:06,120
- I watch, you know what I just started watching?

1237
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:06,960
- You know what I watch now?

1238
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,480
Fight Club and Lucky Number Slevin.

1239
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,480
Yeah.

1240
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,840
Yeah. You know, I like fucking nice.

1241
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,000
I like adult movies.

1242
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,600
Yeah. And I like adult swim.

1243
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,320
Locked up in two smoking barrels.

1244
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,840
Yeah. Yeah.

1245
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:20,920
Twenty one.

1246
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:22,760
I love I kind of like

1247
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,560
the Golden Compass, but only the

1248
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:26,560
parts where the bears fight.

1249
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:27,840
I only like the parts that are

1250
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,840
anti-Christian.

1251
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,400
Yeah. You know, and I like Fight

1252
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,400
Club. I like I

1253
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,120
like the Ace of Spades or whatever

1254
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,120
that movie is.

1255
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,080
The Ace. Twenty one.

1256
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:37,720
Twenty one. I like twenty one.

1257
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:38,840
I said it already.

1258
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:39,840
Um, no, no, Aces.

1259
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,840
I like soft-

1260
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Smokin' Aces!

1261
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:42,840
I like Smokin' Aces.

1262
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:43,840
I like soft boards.

1263
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:44,840
The final chapter.

1264
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,200
Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is actually my favorite movie.

1265
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,600
It's actually fuckin' great.

1266
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:49,600
Yeah.

1267
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,600
Yeah, I love, uh, Snatch.

1268
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
Uh huh.

1269
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,600
That's my kinda movie, basically.

1270
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:57,160
I did watch, I watched Snatch every night before I went to bed when I was in middle school.

1271
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,400
That's just not true.

1272
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,400
Every night before you went to bed.

1273
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,400
Pretty much every night.

1274
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:01,400
Snatch every night.

1275
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:02,400
Snatch and Trainspotting.

1276
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,400
And Mean Streets.

1277
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,400
You watched three movies every night before you went to bed.

1278
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,400
I watched three movies.

1279
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,760
I learned how to pirate DVDs.

1280
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,200
Actually, I didn't do that.

1281
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,000
- You think that's so true.

1282
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:13,820
- That never happened.

1283
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,480
- I used to watch kids movies,

1284
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,160
but nowadays I'm more into adult movies

1285
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,880
like Memento and Nomadland.

1286
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,440
- Same.

1287
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,280
- Yeah, those are my two favorites.

1288
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,120
- And The Limey.

1289
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,840
I love The Limey.

1290
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,400
- It's so funny when you're like growing,

1291
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,640
getting older, you're growing.

1292
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,880
- It's so funny when you're growing

1293
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,520
And your legs hurt and your feet get bigger.

1294
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:41,960
And you're like, you are starting to watch like more adult movies,

1295
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,840
but then it's like, you're just watching like dog shit movies from like 2000s.

1296
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:46,360
Yeah.

1297
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:46,840
Yeah.

1298
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:48,920
Cause you're like, yeah, I need to watch movies with the violence.

1299
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:49,320
Yeah.

1300
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:52,600
It is funny also by the time where you start watching like R rated movies and

1301
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,920
shit, you like, for me,

1302
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:58,320
I had already been watching like hardcore pornography every day for three years.

1303
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:01,440
And then I finally was like, all right, I'm going to watch a movie.

1304
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,560
I'm going to watch, uh, uh, uh, the fucking.

1305
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:04,000
I do.

1306
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,880
I do kind of wish...

1307
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,520
We're Shauna the Dead now.

1308
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,120
I do really wish I could like make myself have, wow,

1309
00:59:10,120 --> 00:59:12,320
I could make myself have the mindset again

1310
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:15,200
of this feeling the same way when I was like 11 or 12

1311
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:18,400
and seeing CGI gore in a movie for the first time.

1312
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,800
And instead of watching it now, I mean like...

1313
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,880
The Expendables?

1314
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:21,720
Yeah.

1315
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:22,600
Had some of the worst.

1316
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,260
I remember the scene in Watchmen

1317
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,320
when they cut the guy's hands off through the prison bars.

1318
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,160
I was like...

1319
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:28,980
That was so sick.

1320
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,820
That shouldn't be in a movie.

1321
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:30,660
Yeah.

1322
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,560
Make you sick to your stomach watching that.

1323
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,460
Yeah, I saw that with my dad. I thought the violence was fine

1324
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:39,320
But then I tried to go to the bathroom during the sex or that when the guy's head gets

1325
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,400
caved in and

1326
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:47,760
Times labyrinth hot fuzz got me to when the thing falls on yeah, just like and when it goes into is

1327
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,280
There's so many throw up so much stuff like that. I see it now. I'm like that's a computer

1328
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:56,600
I'm trying to think of like what's the perfect movie that like when you're like

1329
00:59:56,600 --> 01:00:02,000
12 13 years old where it's like I'm gonna watch this cuz I'm I think it's Fight Club

1330
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:08,140
No, to me that's like actual like like it's an act like like just some schlocky like

1331
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:14,560
2000 oh my god from Paris with or the John Travolta bald movie like watching something like that when you're like

1332
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:20,720
13 right and you're like I'm a fucking grown-up now. Yeah, I'm a grown-up and I've changed my taste

1333
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:24,960
My personal ones are those are definitely fight club and watchmen. Those are the ones where I was like

1334
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:30,920
Yeah, I watched this kind of stuff or that uh that Bruce Willis Morgan Freeman movie where they're all like super spies

1335
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,480
but they're old. It's called like Red or something. Oh, Red. Is it just called Red?

1336
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,520
Yeah, yeah. You know what the gateway is? The Dark Knight. Yeah.

1337
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:43,120
That's the perfect, that's the in-between. I can watch that now. Well, I mean, yeah, of course.

1338
01:00:43,120 --> 01:00:46,880
This is a good movie. Yeah, but I'm saying that, yeah. I know when you're 12, we're talking about

1339
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:50,320
one that is specifically bad. Yeah, it's like you see it when you're 12 or 13,

1340
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:53,960
you're like, this is sick, and then you get older. See, that's hard for me to think of

1341
01:00:53,960 --> 01:00:57,600
one because every movie I watch is incredible and I never watch a bad movie. It's just a joy to watch.

1342
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:04,280
miss when it comes to actually picking the movie. I don't think Hitch is one of those movies. Hitch is dope. Hitch is good. Hitch is fire.

1343
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:09,920
Hitch taught me how to act honestly. Yeah. Yeah. Hitch taught me how to act like a player. I bet it's, I bet,

1344
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:15,040
I think like a gentleman. You know what, it's definitely an action movie like like one of those or a really shitty

1345
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,920
direct-to-video horror movie. Yeah. That like has a bunch of jump scares. Like a Conjuring.

1346
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:24,040
Yeah, or like Insidious or something like that. The Butterfly Effect 2. Yeah.

1347
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:30,900
I watched that on the Syfy channel and I was like I love actually the butterfly effect is that movie or like

1348
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:36,840
I think we talked about it before. The poltergeist remake. Yeah, we talked about it before but like the butterfly effect and

1349
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:43,920
Dance with the devil by immortal technique. Yeah are like the same. They're the same kind of feeling

1350
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,240
Yeah, your friends older brother shows that to you and it's like you're gonna you're about to see something fucked up

1351
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:52,240
And it actually does fuck you

1352
01:01:52,400 --> 01:01:58,320
Yeah, and it is fucked up and that book. You know there's multiple endings of the butterfly effect. Holy fucking shit. I

1353
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:02,680
Didn't realize that yeah, does he lose his arm and all of them well

1354
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,680
I mean the movie is the same the endings change

1355
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:10,200
There's one ending where he goes in he goes back in time to when he's in his mom's womb

1356
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,360
Does he ever chokes himself does he ever try to stop anything?

1357
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:18,720
Other than just like a fucking lady dying or his friend getting fucked no

1358
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:21,640
That's because it's the only things he can do is go back to his blackouts

1359
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:26,240
I don't remember the movie. I watched it when he's a child. I watched it recently.

1360
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:31,440
That's awesome. He would black out, and then he would come to, and like

1361
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:36,840
things would be happening. Oh. Yeah, there's like a scene where he blacks out and like

1362
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:42,520
sees his dad in prison, and then his dad tries to kill him. Okay, so that's fucking

1363
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:46,920
dope. Yeah, see it's a messed up, fucked up movie. I think Taken is another one.

1364
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:51,640
yeah taken's not dark enough I don't think it's about sex trafficking that's

1365
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:57,240
fine it's pg-13 I think that is no but I think that is a movie you watch you go

1366
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:03,480
I'm a grown-up yeah this is what I'm not grown up yet but when I do grow up this

1367
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,720
is what I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna take in people like I'd be fine to be on

1368
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:11,040
either side of a movie that you walk into the house and you see your dad

1369
01:03:11,040 --> 01:03:16,400
watching on basic cable. Yeah. Is like always the... Field of Dreams? No, well I mean...

1370
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:21,840
My dad watching Field of Dreams? That's different, actually that's a different experience. Yeah, like walk in the office, dad watching Field of

1371
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:25,120
Dreams. Dad watching Field of Dreams or like Bull Durham. Blowing boogers into a

1372
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:29,600
sort of a dirty boxer shorts he has. Yeah, right after your parents got divorced just

1373
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:36,720
just snotting into boxers. Just snotting into boxers, pissed big fucking two-liter of piss

1374
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,920
next to him yeah smoking cigarettes inside he's burning himself when my

1375
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:46,000
uncle yeah yeah every Sunday he surgically removed his eyelids and lips

1376
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,800
and then I'm like I'm badass as fuck I'm gonna watch Inception oh no do you know

1377
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:53,880
what actually that just made me realize it was the Heights a Hellboy movie yeah

1378
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,220
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but like you can watch the Hellboy movie now and you're

1379
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:03,000
