00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,800
Are you recording?

00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,800
I'm recording.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Okay, are you recording?

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Yeah, all three of us are feeling fine and good.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
Okay, you ready to take on the day?

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Yeah.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
Yeah, I'm gonna go nuts today.

13
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Yeah, I'm thinking of starting a new club.

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,300
- Yeah, what's it gonna be?

15
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,780
- It's just for bad boys and bad asses.

16
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,560
- The Bad Boys Bad Ass Club.

17
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,800
- Yeah, basically it's kind of a bad boy bad ass club.

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,880
- You have the word bad in there twice,

19
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,720
you could shorten it to the boys ass club.

20
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,880
- That's not a bad idea, boys ass club.

21
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,240
- Bad boys ass club.

22
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:50,660
- Yeah, bad boys ass club, and then I could,

23
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,200
yeah, we could have like a t-shirt that says

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,680
the boys are back BAC, like boys ass club.

25
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,960
- Yeah, oh, that's pretty good.

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,000
you know is a boy's ass club

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,920
the boys are

28
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,040
you know what they're

29
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,680
exactly the bad

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,880
and the bad

31
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,920
okay the boys asses bad is what you could say

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,700
that could be a lot of race

33
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:18,140

34
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,140

36
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,160

37
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:31,160
I'm one big furious ass guy.

38
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,160
I'm a furious ass guy, Game of Thrones.

39
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,160
God damn it.

40
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm the most, I'm a huge furious ass guy, the guy of time.

41
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,160
Yeah, greatest of time.

42
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
Yeah.

43
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Yeah, that's our new club.

44
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Do you guys want to join my club? I just have to write the name on your hand.

45
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,160
It's called the I Love Penis Club.

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,160
I'm not going to... yeah, I have to write the acronym for it.

47
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm not going to tell you what the different words are,

48
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,160
but the tattoo does have to go somewhere visible,

49
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,160
like the top of a forearm or maybe even your neck.

50
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Your forehead.

51
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,160
It has to go on your forehead.

52
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,160
Yeah.

53
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Yeah.

54
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,160
We should start selling temporary tattoos.

55
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
That's not a bad idea. I did think of that.

56
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,160
You did?

57
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,160
First.

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,640
So no I thought about it. No I did think of that first. No Patrick didn't think of that first

59
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,640
I did actually I did send you a picture of

60
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,900
Some temporary tattoo website with the the Caleb monkey face on it, and you guys did not

61
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,960
Respond so I don't remember that I don't even I don't even look at exactly you didn't remember it so

62
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:51,360
Like they put the Caleb monkey face up just independently no

63
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,000
No, I uploaded it to a temporary tattoo website.

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh, okay.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's cool.

66
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,600
I honestly didn't know they had temporary tattoo websites.

67
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,920
I should look at the text that you send more often because that's actually cool.

68
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,920
Yeah.

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,400
Most of the time if Cam sends it, I know that it's business.

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,760
If Pat sends it, I know it's a picture of an old man's balls and penis and I usually

71
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,840
ignore that.

72
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,720
I don't send all business.

73
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,240
i said i sent three pictures in a row that nobody responds to all find a

74
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,320
picture on google that's like

75
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:28,600
this machine can kill of a rat using nightmares and then i'll send it and

76
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,280
nobody responds to the issue of your answer is a guy who has a

77
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:34,320
the

78
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,560
the

79
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,080
and then i would or respond twenty minutes all send something else

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,640
and then they'll be response all this year every twenty minutes until somebody

81
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,640
says lol and then i can

82
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,360
kind of continue with my day. I say I say a loyal to most of Cameron's things. Yeah

83
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Patrick's really nice. I'm the only one who's nice. I'm testing you guys right now.

84
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:00,000
Caleb's the meanest one on the show. Absolutely. Caleb's like the kind of guy

85
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,080
who gets rich and then he he lives in a floating fortress above the earth and he

86
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,880
doesn't let anybody into the fortress. That guy doesn't exist. It's you. It's you.

87
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,320
If you don't think it exists buddy, take a look in the mirror. Yeah take a look

88
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,360
- I'm sending a photo. - Look down, look down right now.

89
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,660
- I'm sending a photo.

90
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,960
- It's your penis. - Nice, nice.

91
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,400
Okay, wow, I really stretched that out.

92
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,220
- What's this photo? - Is anybody gonna respond?

93
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,500
I sent a photo of a big fat woman wearing a shirt

94
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,780
that says, "Riots not diets."

95
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,920
- I respond, "That's crazy."

96
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
That's a pretty good response.

97
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,280
That's like kind of a men's response

98
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,640
that men like to use to things.

99
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,760
- Okay, I'm gonna hit you guys with a no LOL question mark.

100
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,580
(laughing)

101
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,200
Not, check this out, not this time.

102
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,100
This is a, this is just a black square.

103
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,680
Oh no, it has a drawing.

104
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,080
Okay, so Patrick sent us a drawing of a penis.

105
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,640
- Of a square-- - And then it evaporated.

106
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,200
- It actually kinda just looks like the crimson shin.

107
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,040
(laughing)

108
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,160
- Yeah.

109
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,600
Yeah, let's do a whole episode of we text each other.

110
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,280
- Of us texting each other.

111
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,520
(laughing)

112
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,700
- Just all of our text messages.

113
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,600
It's not a bad idea.

114
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,000
Simulate what it's like to be in the group chat.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,360
You can smell my fart.

116
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,360
What's it called?

117
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,240
Yeah, it's called You Can Smell My Fart.

118
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,840
You can smell my fart.

119
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,040
Reference to the--

120
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,280
The Chuck Berry sex tape.

121
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,200
Chuck Berry.

122
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,040
Yeah, the classic.

123
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,920
One of the all-timers, dude.

124
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,840
I would say definitely one of the founding texts

125
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,560
of this podcast.

126
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,480
Yeah.

127
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,400
Yeah.

128
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,640
I would say heavily inspired by the Chuck Berry sex tape.

129
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,040
One part of the canon.

130
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,640
Yeah.

131
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,480
Yeah.

132
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,760
It's like, let's see, what else is besides

133
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,180
the Chuck Berry sex tape?

134
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,320
- The acid stuff.

135
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,520
- The acid, oh yeah, yeah, definitely.

136
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,120
(laughing)

137
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,860
Yeah, taking acid with you two.

138
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,120
- That's the only way you can come up with a podcast

139
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,440
this twisted and deep.

140
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,280
- Yeah, yeah.

141
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,220
- 'Cause if you take acid and then come up with the idea,

142
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:04,560
we're gonna make a podcast where we read lists online

143
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,680
and talk about sucking a poop.

144
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,520
- The entire, the fucked up part was that

145
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,920
we came up with that sober.

146
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,240
We came up with the idea to add Patrick

147
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,640
while we were on X.

148
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,440
We were like, you know what would be so crazy

149
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,680
if we added Patrick.

150
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,660
- Right, and now look at where we are.

151
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,960
- And now look at us, dude.

152
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
- Down in the fucking gutter.

153
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,560
- Yeah.

154
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,760
- Yeah.

155
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,680
- We're all in the gutter.

156
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,280
- I just remember that was like one of the first times

157
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,240
I really did hang out with you guys.

158
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,320
- That's true, yeah.

159
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,640
- Yeah.

160
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,600
- I'm looking up right now what day Patrick

161
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,320
joined the podcast so we can celebrate Patrick.

162
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,920
- Let's do a friendship history episode.

163
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,320
- Yeah, people love that kind of thing.

164
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,280
- Yeah.

165
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,140
- Patrick. - When did I join?

166
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,360
- I'm looking it up right now. - It's on the Instagram.

167
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,420
- Calm down.

168
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:52,520
- Sometime in like April or something.

169
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,000
- Yeah, it was after PAX, I know that.

170
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,800
Oh, we went to PAX East together.

171
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,640
- That was huge.

172
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:01,040
- Let's see, it was-- - I found a Sunday pass

173
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,560
on the ground. - April 4th, 2019.

174
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,400
- Ooh, the April Fool himself has joined the podcast.

175
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,240
- Yeah.

176
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,080
- The April Fool has logged on. - The anniversary

177
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,160
- The podcast itself is Christmas Eve,

178
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,000
which is so funny.

179
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,480
That's the day the first episode came out.

180
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,480
- We could re-release my first episode on April 4th.

181
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,800
- No, it's not a bad idea.

182
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,460
- The one where I was a guest.

183
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,300
- We could.

184
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,880
- You could hear how nervous I was to be on the show.

185
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,800
- You were nervous?

186
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,720
- Not nervous, no, I was nervous that I would slip up

187
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,960
and somebody would get mad at me for something I said.

188
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:31,840
- You slip up.

189
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,460
Dude, we have like 15 people listening then.

190
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,300
- Yeah, I know.

191
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,140
- And none of them knew you.

192
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,040
- And I was mad that one of those 15 people

193
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
would be mad at me.

194
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:39,880
- Yeah, dude.

195
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,360
We were grinding, dude.

196
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,760
We had like 10 listeners for 30 episodes.

197
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,320
- Yeah, for so long.

198
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,320
- It's so awesome.

199
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,480
- I was one of the listeners.

200
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,880
- Yeah, it's crazy that we just kept going

201
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,720
until it actually worked.

202
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,840
- Yeah, I can't believe we didn't just stop.

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,760
- Yeah, dude, any person in their right mind

204
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:58,720
would have been like, well, nothing.

205
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,040
- Yeah, this is clearly not, this is terrible.

206
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,440
Clearly not working.

207
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,520
- Yeah, we'll just stop now.

208
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,800
- No, we've wasted so much of our lives.

209
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,200
I know we deleted like the first 30.

210
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:16,360
Yeah, they're not even, yeah, they're not even fucking four months of our life and then just

211
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,360
deleted it.

212
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,640
I mean, that was like, I had nothing better to do then.

213
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,520
I was just like, "Oh, man, this shit."

214
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,520
And just like, drinking all day.

215
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,680
Yeah, and I mean, the thing to remember too is it was at work.

216
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,280
We were literally, we were making money doing it.

217
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,480
True, we probably got paid more then than we do now.

218
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,480
Right.

219
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,680
It's true, per episode technically.

220
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
What a fucking life that was, dude.

221
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Now, here we are.

222
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:44,680
And now it's a different time, so that shows you how time works.

223
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
Yeah, and time moves forward.

224
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Yeah, that's kind of crazy.

225
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Yeah.

226
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
Who are we going to add next? That's the question.

227
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
Yeah, but we've already added patches.

228
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,680
A year from now...

229
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
That's true, we did add patches.

230
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
He's our employee.

231
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
And I hope he never fucking forgets it. That's the goddamn truth.

232
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,680
Exactly.

233
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680

ok patrick star

247
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,240
- Patrick Starr is the top result.

248
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,680
- I cannot compete with him.

249
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,320
I cannot compete with him and you know that.

250
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,160
- That's true.

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,980
- Dude, it'd be awesome.

252
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:41,080
Neil Pond, do you know I can't compete with Patrick Starr?

253
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,920
- That is so funny.

254
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,520
You are just the Patrick Starr of the podcast.

255
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,080
You fill the same role.

256
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,360
- Yeah, and you're Squidward, bitch.

257
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,840
You're a big blue bitch.

258
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,360
- Guess who gets to be SpongeBob then?

259
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,440
- You are not SpongeBob.

260
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,280
- Nobody's Sam Sandy.

261
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,100
- You're SpongeBob because you're gay.

262
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,120
- You're Mr. Krabs.

263
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:54,960
- I'm not gay.

264
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,200
- You're Mr. Krabs.

265
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,760
- Caleb is Mr. Krabs because he's red, bald.

266
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
- He has a shell.

267
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,400
I feel like I can't even.

268
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
And he's greedy.

269
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,440
He tries to turn everything into a business opportunity.

270
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,360
I get a lot of shit for being red.

271
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
You are very red.

272
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I'm not that red.

273
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,360
You are very red.

274
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I'm really not.

275
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,800
I feel like we gotta cut back on the calling each other gay stuff.

276
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,720
We've already done furious ass guys.

277
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
We've hit the quota already.

278
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,360
We hit the quota up top.

279
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,560
Think if we got Neil Patrick Harris we could be like, yeah it'd be called furious ass guys.

280
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,520
Hey Neil, what is that?

281
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,760
(laughter)

282
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,600
What would that sound like?

283
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,440
- That's the only thing.

284
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,860
- At any time we'd be like, "Yes, dude, yes."

285
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,840
I'm so glad we added you and killed Patrick.

286
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,760
- Yeah, I can't wait till we get big enough

287
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:45,520
that we can hire a producer and put out an ad

288
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,640
that says, "We're looking for a producer

289
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,380
"must be named Patrick, but have a different nickname

290
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,040
"than Pat or Patches."

291
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,000
(laughter)

292
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,240
- Cannot speak English.

293
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,420
- Yeah, must be named Patrick, must go by Rick.

294
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,260
- There we go.

295
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,240
- That's our ad.

296
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,080
- Is that it?

297
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,560
Do people go by Rick?

298
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
- I mean, that's the only other nickname I can think of.

299
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
- My brother's named Eric.

300
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,600
My brother's named Eric

301
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,760
and his friends call him Ricky sometimes.

302
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,800
I think they call him Ricky as a joke, yeah.

303
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,440
- Is Rick the most versatile nickname?

304
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,280
- Let's see here.

305
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,100
- John is.

306
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,080
- Nicknames.

307
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,520
- What is John short for?

308
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,360
- John and Johnson.

309
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,460
- Jim is short for so much shit.

310
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,300
- That's true.

311
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,940
Ed is short for a lot of stuff.

312
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,180
- Yeah.

313
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,020
Ted is also, Ted Cruz's name is Raphael Edward.

314
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,020
- CJ, that's the biggest one.

315
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,780
- Yeah, most abbreviations, yeah, CJ.

316
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,220
It could be, his name is like--

317
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,460
- Big P.

318
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,380

- Yeah.

320
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,060

(laughing)

354
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,420
One of us needs like a basement where we can set up

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,620
- Yeah, we have to call in still.

360
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:47,220
- Well no, we could do, we could put a studio in Connecticut.

361
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,580
- I can't have people watch the podcast.

362
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:54,580
I can't have all these fucking Reddit guys criticizing me.

363
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:58,140
- Yeah, you think they would criticize you more

364
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:58,980
if they saw you?

365
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,580
- If they saw me like--

366
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,820
- Well, yeah, no, you can't give them screenshot ammo.

367
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,760
I mean, those-- - Right.

368
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,220
- The subreddit is entirely just people

369
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,920
posting pictures of people

370
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,080
and then just with the name of one of us.

371
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
- Yeah.

372
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,740
- It's just like people posting--

373
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,580
- I can't have them.

374
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,860
- Don't appreciate the ones targeted at me.

375
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,860
I don't have a dent in my head.

376
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,820
I don't have Down Syndrome.

377
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I...

378
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Jubio is not a host also.

379
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,860
Jubio is not a host and he doesn't look like Luis Gomez.

380
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:26,860
No.

381
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,060
Please stop saying this.

382
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,900
That's actually racist for you to say that.

383
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
So you know what?

384
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:34,540
You're getting a negative flare from us.

385
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,540
That's right.

386
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
We're going to give you a flare on the Reddit.

387
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,740
We're going to give you a flare that says the most racist guy on the Reddit.

388
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,060
That's what a lot of other podcasts don't understand is you have to become a moderator

389
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,060
of your subreddit.

390
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:47,060
You have to become a moderator and you have to torment the fans because fuck the fans.

391
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:54,600
God control you can't let them be autonomous. You need to be you need to be in charge of everything editing every single post

392
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,300
No, but we can't like like the twitch is already too much for me

393
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:03,800
Like I fuck you know any like I jewel too much and I will make fun of you for trying my face

394
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:09,420
No, I'm just no now. I don't know now. I've now I've given them the fucking ammo now

395
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:15,260
I've told them what I'm fucking sensitive about is my tics and shit. You're sensitive about doing drugs. I do

396
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:20,140
Did you have to your tics I yes, I take see you've made fun of them

397
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:25,900
You've made fun of my tics before he has all over him. Yeah, I will in the woods. Yeah, I see them

398
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
They're building a city on your forehead

399
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:37,420
I'm looking I'm looking through the comments on the head is not big enough for a city it is it's not it's getting there

400
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,580
Oh, you're hey, you're already there, but no, I don't I I did the smart thing where I eliminated my forehead

401
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,580
There is no there's no evidence that my forehead where my forehead starts or ends

402
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,320
Yeah

403
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,580
So I for you have no clue your forehead goes from your eyebrows

404
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:57,780
And it goes up over your head all the way back down to your ass exactly which means effectively

405
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:01,060
I have no forehead no it means you have the biggest forehead in the world

406
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:06,500
No, my no my forehead is is just between my eyes or my unibrow would be if I had one

407
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
But I don't so that's my forehead

408
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:14,300
Fucking idiots. No, you're an idiot. So stupid we could add Pat Benatar. That's true

409
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,940
Yeah, the barracuda herself

410
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,460
Yeah

411
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,700
I'm

412
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:26,100
She she's not no no Pat Benatar is not barracuda. I don't care. That's heart

413
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,860
I thought that I thought no heart is an organ

414
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,420
Yeah, you idiot. No

415
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,940
Listen to this. This is a bad trick

416
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:39,200
I want you to listen to this and tell me if this sounds like your experience with having

417
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,820
the name Patrick, okay?

418
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,820
Okay.

419
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,060
My name is Patrick.

420
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:49,980
When I have fights or disagreements, people tend to use my name against me.

421
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Apparently the name Patrick is not as great as you all think, because I have grown to

422
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,980
hate it.

423
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,700
In casual or confrontational situations, people don't usually say your name, but I've had

424
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:00,900
people use my name as a way to make me appear lesser than others, and it is just because

425
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,020
of my name.

426
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,420
like Sean, Matt, Chris, or Kyle, while very average, seem much tougher in comparison.

427
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,060
The name Patrick seems like the title for someone much less tough.

428
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:14,420
There's been a clip online that was on TV about a guy named Patrick and he was referred

429
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,340
to as a guy who reads and writes poetry and is very emotional.

430
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:25,020
Hence his title, Emotional Patrick.

431
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:27,900
There's also Patrick from Spongebob, who is a complete idiot.

432
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:31,620
And Patricia, a female version used when people are blatantly being disrespectful and trying

433
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:36,500
to insult or embarrass you. The name is associated with being pathetic, etc. It can be difficult

434
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,340
living with this title at times.

435
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:53,620
It can be a great name to have when you've been recognized for an accomplishment, but

436
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:57,700
at other times it can feel like a burden, such as working as a green hand in a hyper-masculine

437
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,900
atmosphere such as construction.

438
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,100
As stated above, people will often form opinions based on your name or nickname and you will

439
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,420
be treated accordingly.

440
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:08,380
It's not easy to rise to greatness when people don't think you're worth much.

441
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:12,140
I am constantly doubted and it's rare somebody feels I am worthy of being put in a position

442
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,940
of power or given a great opportunity despite my natural leadership ability and compassionate

443
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,940
nature making me a suitable candidate for leadership roles.

444
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,460
My experience as Patrick has sort of sucked.

445
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,960
No, that's a comment by that guy 27

446
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,680
What does it feel like to be? Well, I don't know I when I was

447
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:37,420
Actually, I did when I was uh, you are only a 1% owner

448
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:44,200
Right. No, I'm not you actually do that because that would suck I could see you fucking doing that

449
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:56,920
That would fucking so bad you would know you would you would be you'd have no tax liability. That's true

450
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:03,460
Yeah, you would be yeah, then where then I would have to explain that where all my fucking money was coming 1%

451
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:08,320
Yeah, we are small business owners now, dude, yeah

452
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:13,940
That's why we got home before the beginning yeah

453
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,260
- Wait, before we move on to the small business,

454
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,120
I just have to, right under that really long,

455
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,580
like, sad comment, the next comment just says,

456
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,440
"It reminds me of that silly character in SpongeBob."

457
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,260
(laughing)

458
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,900
- Yeah, when I was 10, I tried to go by Ed,

459
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,140
I tried to go by Edward, whoa, for a week,

460
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,700
and I wouldn't respond to anybody

461
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,280
if they didn't call me Edward, so.

462
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,340
- I tried to go by Michael,

463
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,220
but my whole family iced me out and wouldn't--

464
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:44,180
- Yeah, my family iced me out, too.

465
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,080
- We gave you, it is kinda fucked up

466
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,640
You don't get to choose a cool name when you're a kid.

467
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:49,140
Yeah.

468
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:57,120
Yeah. I had to choose, I was Pat for a little bit and then I just started going by Patrick recently.

469
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,620
Yeah.

470
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,420
What?

471
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:03,600
Yeah. I didn't go by, I preferred Pat. Like if a teacher asked, I'd be like,

472
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,160
"Yeah, please call me Pat."

473
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,920
I've never called you anything but Pat, I don't think.

474
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm telling you now, you have to stop.

475
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,920
I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all that.

476
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,600
You have to stop it.

477
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,100
No, no.

478
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,600
You have to start calling me Patrick.

479
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,100
Okay, Patrick.

480
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,900
to hate being called cam and then i was just like wait what i have yeah i don't i don't

481
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,380
yeah i don't have any reason to hate being called cam why yeah it's fine well except for the fact

482
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:28,820
it's a stupid name when i was in when i was in third grade you know caleb is hebrew for dog

483
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:33,540
but it's you know it's cool you know what you know what's the most loyal creature on planet earth a

484
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:42,820
dog a bug no no it's not a cricket and it's not a spider it's a dog it's a bug you can't just say

485
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:47,380
bug there's so many bugs and they're not all loyal some of them are very loyal

486
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:50,920
but some of them will stab you in the back like a stick but some of them will

487
00:19:50,920 --> 00:20:07,620
kill you for a piece of sand but yeah fucking what's another bug I only know

488
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,780
you know what okay you know a beetle a beetle probably is the most loyal exactly

489
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:23,220
the most loyal animals a bug or a house plant it's true I met God she's a bug

490
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:32,700
that would be scary though yeah I just remembered when I started going by Pat

491
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:39,420
when I was in third grade because it was I couldn't fit Patrick in NBA Street

492
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:47,500
volume 2. What if... I started going by Pat. It's funny that they didn't have enough letters to fit

493
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,220
like one of the most common names. What if we found out that... Well I couldn't put my full

494
00:20:52,220 --> 00:21:00,380
name if I did Patrick. Oh why'd you put your full name? I don't remember. What if we found out that

495
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:09,180
the Bible is completely true but it's about bugs? God was a bug and he created bugs in his own

496
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:14,580
image like so there's no archaeological evidence of anybody's right yes he was a

497
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:18,500
bug is just a bug people the thing is if you're an archaeologist you're like

498
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,540
looking for dinosaurs and the ark if you find anything else like a fucking if you

499
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:33,300
find like a beetle you toss it away dragonfly and taste in amber and a food

500
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,300
processor and make some that's why everybody in the Bible they said they

501
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,740
or like 900 years old 'cause to a bug,

502
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,060
being even a day is like 900 years.

503
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,060
- That's true.

504
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,540
- What a difference a day makes to a bug.

505
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,580
- I didn't think about that all the time as a kid,

506
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,540
just like--

507
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:50,380
- Yeah, bugs that live like one day and then die.

508
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,900
- How bad is that gonna suck, dude?

509
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,540
- No, dude, you get to fuck like an hour after you're born.

510
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,380
- It's true.

511
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,220
- Dream.

512
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,100
(laughing)

513
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,940
Dream life.

514
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,380
- That's the dream right there.

515
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,380
- I come out, I fuck the nurse in the NICU,

516
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:05,860
and then I die immediately.

517
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,080
My penis gets stuck in her and then I die.

518
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,080
- Yeah, you just shoot out of your mom like a face hugger.

519
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,060
- Like a bug.

520
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,960
- You shoot out of your mom like a bug.

521
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,880
- We should all work like bugs, dude.

522
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,520
You get born, you fight your mom.

523
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,760
If you kill your mom, you get to fuck her sister.

524
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,800
But if you die, she gets to fuck you.

525
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:30,640
- Yeah, yeah.

526
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,460
- It's pretty sad.

527
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,560
- If you die, you're still a bug.

528
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,400
Doesn't matter.

529
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,720
- If you die, you just die like a normal bug.

530
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,040
- And also you're avoiding giant shoes and hands

531
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,040
everywhere you go.

532
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,880
I think that would make us better people.

533
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,440
- Yeah. - If we were giant bugs.

534
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,120
- I think bugs get reincarnated.

535
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,160
They probably-- - Damn, this conversation

536
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,440
is Kafka-esque.

537
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,080
- Bugs only have, like, there are only so many bug souls

538
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,500
in the world, so they have to keep using them over and over.

539
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,600
So I think bugs get like reincarnated after they die, yeah.

540
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,040
- It's good to kill a bug. - Yeah, like if you kill a bug,

541
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,480
it can just start over again.

542
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,800
- Yeah, I do think that some people were bugs

543
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:04,200
in like the, not like a previous life,

544
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,600
- But immediately before this life.

545
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,440
- What people?

546
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,420
- Just, you know, just kinds of people.

547
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,080
(laughing)

548
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,560
Not kinds of people, just some people.

549
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,960
(laughing)

550
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:16,800
Just like, you know.

551
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,080
- Do you mean some famous people?

552
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,920
- Yes, that's what I mean, yeah.

553
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,960
Yeah, I mean, no, but like, yeah, you could just--

554
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,400
- Are you saying, are you, wait.

555
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,240
- You just kinda tell.

556
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,800
- Is this why, wait, is this why you are--

557
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,520
- Like for example, Bebe Netanyahu,

558
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,200
like you know immediately, like--

559
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,040
- Come on.

560
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:38,340
the bug. We can allude to it. We don't have to go there. I think Caleb is this

561
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:45,020
why you were asking. I would never go there, okay. Not in a million years would I go there. Is this why you were asking us for

562
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:50,180
exterminator recommendations, dude? No. No. Yeah, I think I have a men in black

563
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:54,900
problem. I think there's a, I think my, oh my god, dude. Oh fuck, I forgot about this.

564
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:02,000
Okay, I hope Jana isn't listening to me through the wall yesterday. So for like

565
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,160
- The past two days, Jana went up on the roof

566
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,000
a couple days ago.

567
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,440
We have roof access, it just has like,

568
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,040
it's not like a door, it's like a ladder

569
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,840
up to a hole in the roof that's covered

570
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,800
by a piece of metal.

571
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,680
And so yesterday, or two days ago,

572
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,720
Jana went up there and then just forgot

573
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,920
to close the piece of metal.

574
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,100
And yesterday, it rained super, super hard

575
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:25,520
in my neighborhood, and we didn't realize

576
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,320
that that thing was open the entire time.

577
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:31,360
So then the ceiling on the staircase

578
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,360
just like fell through all over the stairs.

579
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,440
And Jana just like, I was like playing fucking Valorant.

580
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,280
Jana like kept on playing.

581
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,120
- I was playing.

582
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,600
- She was like, you have to, no I was not.

583
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,440
She was like, you have to get off right now.

584
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,260
And I was like, what?

585
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,400
She was like, I can't explain.

586
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,240
(laughing)

587
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,200
You have to be quiet and you have to come with me.

588
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,840
And she just showed me just sheet rock all over the ground.

589
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,840
And I didn't realize my fucking fiance is like a,

590
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,760
she's like a criminal.

591
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,520
Like she was like, we have to clean this up

592
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,960
before anybody sees this.

593
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,200
We can't tell anybody, we wait for one of the other tenants

594
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,800
to report it because I don't want to lose roof access.

595
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,600
So yesterday I had to cover up my wife's crime

596
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,800
so that we could still fucking go smoke cigarettes

597
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,640
on the roof.

598
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,480
- People are gonna report this,

599
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,840
you shouldn't have said this on the podcast.

600
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,680
- I'm gonna send you a picture.

601
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:19,640
- The fans are here to ruin our lives.

602
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,480
- In the ceiling, it's horrible.

603
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,160
- It's us versus the fans.

604
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,680
- It kind of is, yeah.

605
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,200
- That's why I try and give my address

606
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,640
and my social security number at all points.

607
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,480
Any opportunity I have.

608
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,960
I gave mine out on the Thomas episode.

609
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,960
Your social?

610
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,960
We censored it.

611
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,800
You said that wasn't yours, didn't you?

612
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,440
Why would you ruin the joke for me?

613
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,400
I didn't know it was a joke.

614
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,480
I thought you were just saying something that wasn't true.

615
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,720
Me and Nealey said that was so funny.

616
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,560
Just like stand up in Boston when there's like 30 people in the crowd.

617
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,960
Is something bombs just say your social security number?

618
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,720
It's funny every time.

619
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,900
It truly is.

620
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,400
It's funny that the way the world works is like you have a number that you can't tell

621
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
anybody.

622
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,400
Yeah, yeah.

623
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,140
If you tell somebody it will ruin your life forever.

624
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:10,660
Yeah, like it could very possibly just fuck up everything for you if you tell somebody

625
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,100
this number, this fucking seven digit number.

626
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,100
Yeah.

627
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,100
Or nine digits.

628
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,100
I don't remember how many digits.

629
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,100
A hundred digits.

630
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
Mine is a hundred digits.

631
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,220
Yeah, they gave me the longest social security number.

632
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,220
Yeah, they gave me the longest penis in the world.

633
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,100
They knew I was smart enough to remember.

634
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,420
Have you ever seen the movie My Blue Heaven?

635
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,420
No.

636
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,420
Well, first of all, it's a great movie.

637
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,420
Have you seen "I Pooped Kevin"?

638
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,420
We need to talk about Kevin.

639
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,420
"I Pooped Kevin"?

640
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
"I Pooped Kevin", yeah.

641
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,420
It's a John C. Reilly movie.

642
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,420
Have you seen that movie "Poop, Where's My Crap"?

643
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,420
[laughter]

644
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,420
Yeah.

645
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,420
Yeah.

646
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,420
Have you seen that movie that's like "Inception"

647
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,420
but it's called "In the Toilet"?

648
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,420
[laughter]

649
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:55,420
No, I thought that was interstellar.

650
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:57,420
No, oh yeah, there's two

651
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:02,460
The same exact names the same director. Yeah, Pistopher Pistopher

652
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:11,500
Patrick's name my phone is splatter ik toilin. His name is pay pay Rick

653
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,780
Yeah

654
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,700
No, but my blue heaven

655
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:21,040
So I when I first learned like what I learned what social security numbers were because of that movie

656
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:25,680
It's a movie where Steve Martin plays like a an Italian mob guy

657
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:29,160
It's very yeah, it's a very like I

658
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:37,640
Just realized like my whole perception of like the mafia was warped because of that movie because I've never seen the Godfather

659
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,840
I've seen good fellas like I get it now, but like up until I saw good fellas

660
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:48,760
I was like yeah, the mafia is just like guys very funny the guy the mafia is just guys like Steve Martin

661
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:57,240
yeah stealing swordfish out of trucks like yeah they're always going excuse me

662
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,160
an arrow going through their head yeah yeah the mafia is a bunch of guys

663
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:11,080
playing a Steve Martin special was like this is oh my god ever since I was young

664
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:17,320
I wanted to be a gangster. My capo is King Tut.

665
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:24,040
Yeah, the dozen, uh, the cheaper by the dozen family, that's all.

666
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:28,120
Those are his, uh... That's the five families and one of them,

667
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,080
all of them have 12 kids. Uh-huh. I mean, that's mostly true for...

668
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,120
It is kind of true, actually, yeah, for Italians.

669
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,960
Yeah, we should add Steve Martin as the... We should add Steve Martin.

670
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,360
We should add Steve Martin to the podcast as the next one.

671
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,360
It's not a bad idea, I guess.

672
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,760
He could do some funny stuff, I think.

673
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,840
Oh yeah, but the fucking social security number, he just keeps listing off numbers.

674
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,600
So I thought you just did that to do your social security number.

675
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:56,800
I thought you just told an FBI agent you're fucking...

676
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,800
What do you mean?

677
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

678
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
I don't know!

679
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I don't remember.

680
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
What?

681
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:02,800
We can move on.

682
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Wait.

683
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,800
So you...

684
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:17,800
I'm fuckin scatterbrained as shit today.

685
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,600
Wait what is he doing?

686
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
He's just leaving.

687
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,320
No I was trying to look for my jewel.

00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,800
I have my mentions off too.

694
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:56,320
Okay, find Caleb's address and go to his house and knock on his door.

695
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,320
It's fine.

696
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,240
My address is the only one on the LLC.

697
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:01,680
Go to Sullivan the Frog Enterprises LLC.

698
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,680
It's out of Delaware.

699
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,520
It's all listed as public record.

700
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,080
- You're gonna give that away?

701
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,920
- I don't care.

702
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,480
I have a gun.

703
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
- Oh yeah, that's true.

704
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,200
Yeah, Caleb has a gun in New York.

705
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,240
It's unregistered.

706
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,920
- Yeah, that's how I stop him.

707
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,960
I just tell somebody, I have a gun.

708
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,440
- My address isn't on it, right?

709
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,520
- No, nobody's address but me is on it.

710
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,040
I lied to Delaware and said that you guys live with me.

711
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:27,880
Which is a funny thought.

712
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,160
- Why would you fucking say that on here?

713
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,320
'cause it doesn't matter.

714
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,120
- God, they're gonna ruin our lives.

715
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:34,960
- We do live with--

716
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
- Delaware's coming after us.

717
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,320
You better move in with Caleb.

718
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,160
You better sleep--

719
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:40,980
- You move into his house!

720
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:43,560
- You better sleep in a triple deck or bunk bed.

721
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,720
- Oh, could you imagine?

722
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,880
Oh my God, I wish I could go back.

723
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,000
I wish I could go back to triple deck bunk beds.

724
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,400
- You better get some of those glow in the dark stars

725
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,920
and put 'em on the ceiling in your shared bedroom.

726
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:57,540
- You guys better play Truth or Dare.

727
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:58,380
- Yeah, yeah.

728
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,620
- You guys better play a game that involves you

729
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:04,140
throwing shit off the top of your bed.

730
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,800
- When Ice is coming to see if a marriage

731
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,260
is just for the green card, they're like,

732
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,540
do you guys ever play truth or dare?

733
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
- Interesting.

734
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,500
- Dare him right now.

735
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,420
- No, I wanna see it.

736
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:18,540
I wanna see it.

737
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,140
- Have you ever held a flashlight under your chin

738
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,900
and huddled up in a blanket and told a scary story?

739
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,140
- Interesting.

740
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:29,180
- So you claim you sleep in the same bed, but.

741
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,020
- And yet.

742
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,840
- Hmm.

743
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:31,820
- Hmm.

744
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,660
- All right.

745
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:34,780
- We should play some truth or dare right now.

746
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,540
- We should get some triple bunk beds is what I'm thinking.

747
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,660
- I think that would be, honestly,

748
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,500
for all of us at this time in our lives,

749
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,780
that would make the most sense.

750
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,620
- Yeah.

751
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,440
- I miss it, dude.

752
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,060
I had triple bunk beds growing up.

753
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:45,900
- I never had a bunk bed.

754
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:46,720
- Is that a break up with Jana?

755
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,420
We just all move into Cam's house?

756
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,620
- Yeah.

757
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:50,460
- You can move in.

758
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,540
- That might be a cool idea.

759
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,380
- Move into my parents' shed.

760
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,540
- You can move in once I move out.

761
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,380
- The shed on my.

762
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,220
- Yeah.

763
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,060
- That's cool.

764
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,880
Me and Pat just bunking into the basement.

765
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,720
- Shut up, I'm in a process.

766
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,540
(laughing)

767
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,380
- Yeah.

768
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,260
- With your mom.

769
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,100
- Yeah.

770
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,860
(laughing)

771
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:05,900
Yeah.

772
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,140
- No, we should definitely get like a,

773
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,020
we should definitely get like one of those TikTok houses.

774
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,860
- Oh my God.

775
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:11,680
- Dude, that would be so sick.

776
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,520
- That would be great.

777
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,360
- That would be sick.

778
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,860
We get like a, we get an attritionist.

779
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,140
If we get the patron of like,

780
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:17,980
like $50,000. - A million.

781
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,300
- I mean people, dude, let's just get a house.

782
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,620
- Yeah, why not, dude?

783
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,080
- People, people make fun of that TikTok house thing,

784
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,520
but it's like that's the new American dream right there.

785
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,860
- Right. - Like that's like,

786
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,440

- Yeah. - Sick.

789
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,200
- Every kid who's like 13 right now is like,

790
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,600
this is what I wanna do when I grow up.

791
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,400
- Yeah, the 13 year olds are teaching like a 27 year old guy

792
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,120
how to do a Fortnite dance.

793
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,200
- Yeah. - And you're there.

794
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,520
- Patrick's there. - It's be awesome.

795
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,000
- I'm there. - Pat's there,

796
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,200
he's the manager. - I'm the guy that,

797
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,120
I'm the guy that they have around to bully.

798
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:54,960
- Yeah.

799
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,800
- 'Cause they need, they need.

800
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,620
- You're the bodyguard.

801
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,460
- They need to bully somebody.

802
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,560
- It's like that, that TikTok,

803
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,480
like where they like show every person

804
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,300
who lives in the house.

805
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,140
And the last one is like,

806
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,920
and we keep a freak in our basement.

807
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,060
And just have them looking through bars.

808
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,320
(laughing)

809
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,160
- He's the golem.

810
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,360
The golem we keep in the cage.

811
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
- This guy's like Gollum from Lord of the Rings,

812
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
except his rings is hot dogs.

813
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,880
- Yeah, we feed him cheeseburgers all day.

814
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,980
We feed him the the dollar store microwave

815
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,800
Leave whenever he wants

816
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:35,040
They have a they have a trap door

817
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:38,740
So if someone comes to apply to live in the tick-tock house, and they don't like them

818
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,740
They can just drop them right into Patrick's lair

Yeah, be pretty cool. Oh, she just sent me something. Oh, that's cool. Dude a 40 pound

Wow.

00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,720
This might be the end of the episode.

826
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,720
You might have to go hunting.

843
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,960

844
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:55,360
have a job I just do nothing all day. Yeah. So now everything is just like I just

845
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,960
live by a I live by a shinobi code now. It's pretty cool. I could honestly

846
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:07,880
unless my schedule is I wake up and I go to the gym I come back I make breakfast

847
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,200
if we podcast I podcast if not I read and then I go for a run and then I have an

848
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,000
two hours of video games built into my schedule.

849
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,700
(laughing)

850
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,420
- I wish I, honestly I could not,

851
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:24,080
I could never live by a schedule.

852
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,280
- Yeah, you're too wild.

853
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,400
- Unless I go back on Adderall or something, I could never.

854
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,240
- I've been thinking about,

855
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,320
if anybody in New York sells Adderall.

856
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,560
- Hey, I'll send you some.

857
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,400
- Don't talk to me 'cause I hate drugs.

858
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,540
- Yeah, I don't know, I think I'm gonna get my,

859
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,200
I think I'm gonna get my prescription refilled.

860
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,080
I think I might do that.

861
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,380
I think that's the move for me.

862
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,220
- I'd rather not.

863
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,060
- Get my Addy prescription refilled.

864
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,300
- Get your Addy prescripts, reef, reef, reef.

865
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,960
- I think I'm gonna go to the dentist.

866
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,440
I'm gonna get that shit sorted out.

867
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,680
- That's where you get Adderall.

00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,880
- I need the prescription.

873
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,700
- Honestly, I honestly have this like,

874
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,460
reoccurring thought that I'm gonna get back on Adderall

889
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,720

919
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,660
it like

920
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:05,420
i love podcasts

921
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,620
yeah nobody gets it. I listen to a messed up podcast and that makes me different from you.

922
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:15,660
How does that feel? The only movies I like are about time travel. I bet you can't relate.

923
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:23,580
I bet you can't wrap your tiny mind around that one British one, Primer. You don't know

924
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,320
anything about Primer, okay? Is that movie British? I don't even think it's British.

925
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,180
If you tried to watch Primer, you would even come close to understanding me. Your brain

926
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,020
- You're just explaining me.

927
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:34,860
- You probably, yeah.

928
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,680
- Even if you did understand it,

929
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,520
you wouldn't even come close.

930
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,520
- I'm sorry, you probably prefer Captain Marvel.

931
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,860
Me, I'm more of a Deadpool kind of guy.

932
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,700
- Yeah.

933
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,360

934
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,200
- Yeah.

935
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,900
- It's the kind of thing you wouldn't understand.

936
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,240
When Deadpool looks at the camera,

937
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,000
you probably think he can see you for real

938
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,240
and you get scared.

939
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,360
- Yeah, 'cause you're so much dumber than me.

940
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:56,120

It says he's a male and Kura gun gun. Okay, so there's different like types of gun gun. That makes sense

1034
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,960
You're so stupid. You don't know anything. You're such an idiot

1035
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:14,360
Dude I bet Jar Jar Binks gives some fucking I bet that throat gets sloppy drop, dude. Yeah

1036
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,760
- Jar Jar Binks gives sloppy top.

1037
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,320
- I mean, also remember how long his tongue is?

1038
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,360
- Yeah, he go, he could put--

1039
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,520
- Look, there's a picture of him with his mouth open.

1040
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:24,360
- He puts his tongue in your butt,

1041
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,200
it's going out your mouth.

1042
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:29,400
- The thing is, I would be really worried about teeth.

1043
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,480
- Yeah, no, both Boss Nass and Jar Jar Binks

1044
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,320
both have teeth that I wouldn't want.

1045
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,680
- Jar Jar Binks has huge teeth.

1046
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,520
- Yeah.

1047
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,360
- What?

1048
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,180
Let me look this up.

1049
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,120
- Fucking idiot.

1050
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:39,760
- Oh, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1051
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,440
- Giant, nasty British teeth.

1052
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:44,280
- Yeah.

1053
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,920
You know how I've looked up Jar Jar Binks rule 34 too many times that it...

1054
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:52,520
He's also kind of, yeah he is kind of ripped now that I look at this.

1055
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Yeah.

1056
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:54,520
He is kind of sexy.

1057
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:55,520
He has an amazingly human body.

1058
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,520
Yeah.

1059
00:44:56,520 --> 00:44:59,120
He kind of, he just looks like Steven Tyler.

1060
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,640
LOTR fan.

1061
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,640
There's a baby Jar Jar Binks here.

1062
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,440
That's the one that Patrick wants to fuck.

1063
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,440
Nope.

1064
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:07,800
Patrick said I would fuck that.

1065
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:08,800
I said I wouldn't.

1066
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,600
You had to fuck any alien from any movie.

1067
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,960
So any of them.

1068
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:19,960
who

1069
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:21,800
It needs to be like a true alien.

1070
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,280
Well no, she is shapeshifting.

1071
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,840
From Star Wars or just any...

1072
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:29,400
No, not shapeshifting, because then you'd be like shapeshifting to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

1073
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:30,400
Magneto.

1074
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,400
Shapeshift into Magneto.

1075
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,400
Ruth Bader Ginsburg.

1076
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,560
Yeah, the ultimate respect.

1077
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,160
You're just moving the goalpost because you're mad I found the right answer.

1078
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,040
I'm not that mad, okay?

1079
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,360
No, he's pretty mad.

1080
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:46,520
Okay, then I fuck her, then I fuck the aliens from Dude Where's My Car, the sexy Asian one.

1081
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:49,320
Caleb would fuck the aliens from Toy Story.

1082
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
- Mm, yeah.

1083
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,160
(laughing)

1084
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,980
- I would.

1085
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,160
- All three of them at once.

1086
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,000
- Yeah, dude.

1087
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,820
That'd be sick.

1088
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,760
That'd be so in sync.

1089
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,600
- Yeah.

1090
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:57,560
- Twins.

1091
00:45:57,560 --> 00:45:59,160
- They'd go, "Wow."

1092
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,200
(laughing)

1093
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,040
- Wow.

1094
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:01,860
- Yeah.

1095
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,760
- That's small penis.

1096
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,600
(laughing)

1097
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,440
- No.

1098
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,640
The balls.

1099
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,080
- They would say the claw.

1100
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,920
They would say the claw.

1101
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,400
- The balls.

1102
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,960
- They would say the claw because you have a mandible.

1103
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,040
- No, they would say the balls because I have two.

1104
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,400
My balls have been so swollen recently.

1105
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:19,240
- Why?

1106
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,900
- I don't know, it's been like--

1107
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,320
- You're pregnant, dude.

1108
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,500
- I might be pregnant.

1109
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:27,080
My balls have just been like, unhideable.

1110
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,920
- Yeah.

1111
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,700
- No matter what pants I have, people,

1112
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,300
like if I, so if I like walked into a wall--

1113
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,420
- No matter what pants you have,

1114
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:35,640
people say, "Yo man, nice balls."

1115
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,060
- Well, I look at 'em in the mirror.

1116
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,560
If I walk into a wall, my balls hit first.

1117
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,420
Do you understand how big that is?

1118
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:44,400
- Okay. - Yeah.

1119
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,240
- So they're bigger than your penis.

1120
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:47,500
- You've got like a boob out between your legs.

1121
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,840
- I don't like the name of this file

1122

00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,040
- Did you watch the Young Turks on YouTube in 2008, Caleb?

1148
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:16,880
I feel like you were there.

1149
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:17,720
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

1150
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,000
- I watched it because they would like comment,

1151
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,040
I would try to find like Two Girls One Cup on YouTube

1152
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,880
because I thought that's where that was.

1153
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:25,720
And then--

1154
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:26,680
- On the Young Turks?

1155
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:29,240
- Yeah, I thought Two Girls One Cup was on the Young Turks.

1156
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,320
- You thought it was Anna Kasparian?

1157
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,540
- And Cenk Uygur, I thought they were doing the cup.

1158
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,740
I thought he was the cup.

1159
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:39,800
But they would like comment on videos

1160
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,280
have videos with that in the title so that they would get like clicks and shit

1161
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,800
like a fucking clickbait. I mean they still suck but they used to be

1162
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:53,280
awful. I would watch their videos and be like okay where where when when does the

1163
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,160
poop stuff happen? That was back when like like the whole thing that was like

1164
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,920
the Young Turks was like almost pro Ron Paul. Oh yeah. All those videos that were

1165
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:10,780
like Ron Paul's the only one only one talking about the war and I was like

1166
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:17,040
did Ron Paul swag yeah I remember when reddit was obsessed with Ron Paul

1167
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,480
libertarian blocks Ron Paul was my that was my guy and then those newsletters

1168
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:27,560
came out and I was like I think my parents voted for him in 2012 I convinced

1169
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:33,600
my mom to vote for Gary Johnson in 2012 really nice yeah Wow and then actually

1170
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,840
- Actually, that makes sense that you were a libertarian guy.

1171
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:38,040
- And then she, well, 'cause it was like my,

1172
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:40,880
you know, I grew up in like a super conservative family,

1173
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,760
so that was like, that was like me rebelling

1174
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:44,600
as much as I could.

1175
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,420
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1176
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,720
- It was like, I think gay people should be able

1177
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,320
to get married, and drugs should be legal.

1178
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,720
- I did the same thing, but I was more socialist.

1179
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,560
- Yeah.

1180
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:55,380
- No, I was younger.

1181
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,220
- I should be able to kill my uncle

1182
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,080
if he engages in aggression against me.

1183
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,960
- That's right.

1184
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,240
- Stand your ground law against your uncle.

1185
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,160
- Yeah.

1186
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,000
- That's right.

1187
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:05,840
(laughs)

1188
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,660
- Yeah.

1189
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,720
- Uncles should be fair game.

1190
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,080
- Yeah, if your uncle says something demeaning

1191
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,720
about your job at Thanksgiving,

1192
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,520
you should be able to tackle him.

1193
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:14,480
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1194
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,880
- If your uncle calls you a homo,

1195
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,920
you should be able to slap his balls off.

1196
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,760
- Now that we do this full time.

1197
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:19,680
- If your uncle calls you a homo,

1198
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,520
you should be able to say,

1199
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:23,680
"I'll show you a homo," and then get up on him.

1200
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,480
- You should say, "I'll show you a home owner,"

1201
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,880
and then you point to yourself and you brag.

1202
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,000
- I own a house now.

1203
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,840
- I own a house.

1204
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:31,680

Yeah, it's not even that big.

1234
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:22,560
No, a sniper dot's too generous.

1235
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:26,060
Yeah, it looked, if I saw that on someone, I would think it was a freckle.

Right.

1237
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:29,060

1296
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:17,220

1304
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:30,700
And they just show you like a--

1305
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:31,540

1306
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,700
