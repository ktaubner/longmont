00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,460
(laughing)

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,960
(explosion)

9
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,000
- I do think it's, I feel like it's un,

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,560
it's un-gentlemanly to be,

11
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,760
to let people hear your shit.

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,600
- No.

13
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,440
- Yeah.

14
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,260
- No.

15
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:23,100
- I just don't.

16
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,940
- I think it lets people's guards down.

17
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,760
- You guys don't have the sound.

18
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,600
- It's female.

19
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,200
- You're not dealing with the sound that I am though.

20
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,040
- Yeah, well.

21
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:28,860
- My sounds are.

22
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,240
Do you think that that faucet is loud enough? Yeah, it's nothing

23
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,680
We need a faucet that just goes like yeah

24
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:44,300
Yeah

25
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:53,360
Get in my Ford Focus and the Bluetooth automatically connects

26
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:59,500
Because it's cuz it starts with yeah, it's 1,000 parts so it starts with a number so it plays it first

27
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,700
I don't want that

28
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,500
You want that or if the uber guy is like you want to play music?

29
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:08,980
I'm like, I want to hear for like you want like regular music or like fart noises. Yeah, I asked him that

30
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,900
He doesn't know what I'm saying. He's yeah

31
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:19,300
Yeah, you have you have to have also you know those the like

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,300
the adapters that people have for their cars where it like goes over the radio signal or whatever.

33
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:24,620
Yeah.

34
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,060
You just look through their car window and see what channel they're tuned to and use the app

35
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,300
on your phone and play fart noises into their car.

36
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:36,220
Telling the Uber driver like, "Oh yeah, like I have a... I've been writing this song for a while."

37
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:41,980
And then just loading up the first 1000 farts in a row by Caleb.

38
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:47,100
One time me and Neil got into an... I may have said this before. Me and Neil were in an Uber once

39
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:47,340
and...

40
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:47,900
Oh, I've heard this.

41
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,420
The guy was playing just, you've heard it so I gotta stop?

42
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:51,940
Yeah.

43
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:57,260
The guy was playing just an audio, just audio book of some guy speaking in another language

44
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,140
and we didn't know what it was. And Neil was like, "What is this? I really like it."

45
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,580
And the guy was like, "It's the Quran." And he was like, "Oh yeah, can you send it to me?"

46
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:11,500
And the guy was like, "You want me to send you the Quran?" He was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

47
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,260
I don't think they ever linked up after that though.

48
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:13,740
Yeah?

49
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,580
Yeah. But it did sound cool. It was like music playing behind it.

50
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,580
The Quran sounds really cool.

51
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,580
It was fucking dope. It was just fucking cool made up words.

52
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,580
I think it was like Ocarina of Time got, there's like a lost...

53
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,580
Aquafina.

54
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,580
Oh yeah.

55
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,580
In the soundtrack.

56
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:30,580
Cause it's like literal like a verse from the Quran.

57
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,580
I think that there are a bunch of old video games where...

58
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,580
He didn't realize how evil it was at the time.

59
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,580
He just slipped it in.

60
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,580
For some reason it's in the Shadow Temple.

61
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:40,580
It's, you know, it's all fucked up.

62
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,580
And they deleted it?

63
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,580
Yeah, they deleted it.

64
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,580
That's fucked up.

65
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,460
like Osama bin Laden listening to the soundtrack and be like this is

66
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:54,340
disrespectful. Yeah. Also there's a David Byrne and Brian Eno song that is just like

67
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,460
verses from the Quran. Osama bin Laden was listening to that. That doesn't even piss me off even a

68
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,260
little bit. Osama bin Laden probably also would have been pretty pissed off at how

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:09,020
feminine Link was. No he wouldn't. Didn't he love like... that has to be fake right?

70
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:15,020
the like Osama Bin Laden, the hard drive. Yeah, obviously it's all declassified by the CIA.

71
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,260
They're gonna throw like little like, like, oh yeah Osama was looking up like Tom and Jerry naked.

72
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:25,180
He was, he was, he was typing into a text note document just a hundred times a day. I am evil,

73
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,260
I am evil, I am evil, I am evil. But did, what, didn't he, wasn't he also like watching

74
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:33,020
The Simpsons and stuff? That's pretty cool. That's, that's normal, yeah. Yeah. He had a

75
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,300
Tom and Jerry clip on it. I remember Tom and Jerry specifically. Well, the thing is, we don't know

76
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,780
of whether that was on his hard drive of stuff he liked or stuff he hated. That was

77
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,580
kind of Obama and him. Yeah Tom and Jerry action. He had custom Tom and Jerry episodes made to edit out the

78
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:52,100
racist stuff. Yeah. You know call him what you can but you know he was not a racist

79
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:56,420
by any means. No he was a lot of things but not a racist. Was a good guy. Do you think he

80
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,220
saw Iron Man? I think he saw Iron Man when he, minutes before he passed. When it

81
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:06,220
happened in real life. Yeah. To him too. I feel like they only get like he could only

82
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:11,580
pirate like sequels or something like Iron Man 2 and 3 it was like they got to

83
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,980
make like an origin story I feel like I'm just dropped into the middle of the

84
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:23,260
action what is going on where is the second Iron Man in here yeah we have

85
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,620
Thomas with us also oh yeah what's up Thomas oh hey yeah Thomas in the big

86
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,060
city are you scared of how tall the buildings are here the first time it

87
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:39,340
I almost got dizzy. I'm used to being able to see just like, I'm not used to hills really at all.

88
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,660
You know, I go up a hill, I don't know what's on the other end.

89
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,260
And the streets are all, you know, you can't even see the sky that much.

90
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

91
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,060
Are you talking about being inside?

92
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Are you saying inside you can't see the sky?

93
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,060
Outside you can't see the sky that much.

94
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,060
As much of it.

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,060
Because the buildings are blocking the sky.

96
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,980
Right. Oh, sky's too tall here.

97
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:06,900
If I if I could change two things about New York, I'd say make it less walkable.

98
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:10,300
Yeah. Mayor Thomas, let's let's Mayor Thomas is awful.

99
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,060
You know, every place that people want to hang out, they're like, oh, it's only

100
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,380
like a three hour walk.

101
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,140
And yeah, it's only like six miles.

102
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,620
And then you can go there, you can get it like half a beer and a cigarette.

103
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,940
Like it's such a good time.

104
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,620
And you go there's just a regular bar.

105
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,700
And then they're like, well, there's this other bar that's close.

106
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,460
It's only two miles walking wise.

107
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,040
Yeah.

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,200
Awful.

109
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,200
Yeah, that's pretty bad.

110
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Yes, Thomas does not want to hang out with me.

111
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,440
What else are you changing as Mayor of New York?

112
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,240
I would say we need to rezone a lot of stuff.

113
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,240
In what? Which direction?

114
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,700
If we could, I think we should demolish a lot of like Bushwick and stuff and put like more like

115
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,540
high-income like high-rises there.

116
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,540
Stuff like that.

117
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:53,200
And maybe like a six-lane freeway through the middle of Manhattan.

118
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,200
Yeah.

119
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,200
There's a lot we could do.

120
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,200
Definitely.

121
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,200
Just straight down the middle.

122
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
A lot of potential.

123
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,200
It's not connected to anything. It goes into everything.

124
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,200
Yeah, just Fifth Avenue turns into six lanes.

125
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:04,200
And it has a cul-de-sac at the end maybe.

126
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Right. I think too, maybe more factories.

127
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Factories could be good.

128
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,200
I mean, you always are saying,

129
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,200
"Oh, this would be a great place for my factory."

130
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
I've been looking for a good spot to put my factory.

131
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,200
So far, I think,

132
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
top, top of my list, so far,

133
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,200
Yellowstone. I think it would be a perfect spot.

134
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,200
There's a lot of... Also, there's already so much

135
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,200
fucking smoke going in there.

136
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,200
There's some shit going in the air there.

137
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,560
fucking million clouds of black.

138
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:31,120
Yeah, there's so much water in Yellowstone that you can just

139
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,280
contaminate with like,

140
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,760
I would say my second choice would probably be the entire

141
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,920
surface area of Guam. Yeah, Guam is gone. Factory Island. I

142
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,040
used to be big on Guam. But like, I don't know. I don't even

143
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,720
go there that much anymore. Really? Yeah. Damn. I feel like

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,040
it fell off. It changed a lot. Yeah.

145
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Yeah, honestly, got guys.

146
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,520
Guam got gentrified to fuck. And it's all shit now. It's fucking

147
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,560
Bullshit over at Guam there used to be fucking dope ass bars that had like mechanical bowls and shit. Yeah, all that's fucking gone

148
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,320
That's my girl said as micro breweries and Astro pose. I'll get a Michelob ultra

149
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,060
Guam weird, right? Yeah, then the only way the only way to keep Guam weird is to you know

150
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:18,380
I guess just let more of these fucking like pieces of shit move in. Mm-hmm and now

151
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:24,800
They don't even have Dave and Buster's there anymore. Yeah, which is like a cool weird indie thing. Yeah

152
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:30,880
Yeah, half the people there don't even speak Guamese anymore. Yeah, so almost a lost language. Yeah, it's almost like no one even

153
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,760
It's almost like it never existed. Yeah, you go up to someone you'll be like

154
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,680
And they don't even say anything back. They say you're being weird man. Exactly. They give you that

155
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, I'm stare you try and order the big special. Yeah

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,680
Thousand yard stare. Yeah

157
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,680
It's basically bullshit now and I see that same thing happening in New York City now. Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,120
no one speaking Guamese. Almost nobody speaks Guamese here anymore. You go to

159
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,880
Chinatown and you start speaking Guamese and they act like you're some kind of

160
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,440
complete stranger. Yeah. They act like they're not even friends with you. Yeah.

161
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,340
They act like they don't even speak Guamese. Yeah. You try and order a

162
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:15,040
chopped cheese, mock, Guamese style, yeah you're getting kicked out of the

163
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,120
establishment. That's right, yeah. Yeah, because the Guamese... Well, because they speak and they don't

164
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,880
like that you're talking about. Guam is northern Canada. It's like there's around like where

165
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:31,880
the ocean is. Oh, so it's like, okay. Well I was gonna, okay. Well I fucked myself over.

166
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:37,120
I was gonna say that Guamese style chopped cheese is just, it's in between two banana

167
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:46,120
leaves. Well it's near Guamatala. Yeah. Around where Central is. It's like it's peninsula

168
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,600
- The peninsula as well.

169
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,680
- Oh, so it's the peninsula of Guamatala.

170
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,840
- So it's attached to that, but it's on a different,

171
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,160
but there's a border.

172
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,000
- Yeah.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,640
- And the river as well.

174
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,680
- Yeah, it's also, it's kind of close to Planet Crazy.

175
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,520
- Yeah.

176
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,720
- Which is a place that doesn't even exist.

177
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,180
- Do you think if you traveled outside of the US,

178
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,600
like Europe and Canada excluded,

179
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,600
do you think you would get sex trafficked immediately?

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,440
- Me?

181
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,360
- Yeah, all three of us.

182
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,760
- No, not me.

183
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,680
- No.

184
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,480
Why would any of us get sex traffic? I'm a dime a dozen in Europe a guy like me.

185
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:21,640
Yeah. Yeah. You might get sex sex traffic. Where?

186
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:25,400
To Romania I think you might be a Romanian slave. Do I have to be?

187
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,360
You might be like yeah you might be like a werewolf kind of. Yeah.

188
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,000
I think they might honestly burn you if you went to a small Romanian village.

189
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,720
You you look like you already. Yeah no I'm the one.

190
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,120
You look like you would capture him. They'd ship you back to like a vampire circus.

191
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,720
Cameron would be like a dungeon master for Andrew Tate.

192
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,940
yeah he's like cranking the old yeah i like

193
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,560
many past if i didn't know what the wheel went to that would be my dream job

194
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,080
back

195
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,840
it was a there's a there's a outlaw so i couldn't wheel cranks like a user here

196
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,540
what was going on but i just got to turn the wheel and feel it go

197
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,840
i agree and to be that way she had a right to get tighter

198
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,440
and then you do instead of what ok one more night in your free time

199
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,880
no that uh... those of the wheels are a bit higher than a decade ago we'll get

200
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:14,320
fucking tighter. And then they make you stop turning the wheel and then a few hours later

201
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,040
you start turning again and it feels completely different. Exactly. You do that 20-30 times

202
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,500
a day. I think I work at some kind of orange juice factory or something. I don't know what

203
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:28,800
this is. Oh my god. Yeah you have like a big iron gate and it's like a bunch of like ring

204
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,960
light ambience behind you just coming from all the rooms. Yeah the shackles, I mean I

205
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,160
would hate to have to clean the shackles because they're always getting blood on them from

206
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,720
And that blood is gonna cause rust yeah, it's a liquid on a metal, and it's not like a nice patina. These aren't like copper

207
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:52,260
Shackles there. They're war made out of just dog shit steel. Yeah, they put dog shit in the smelting process

208
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Yeah, I'm you can't make

209
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,540
girls out of metal

210
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:02,680
Yeah, that'd be bad. Yeah. Yeah, what would be like a reason why they be that be bad though because of rust

211
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,700
Like when they got older yeah, yeah

212
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:11,160
Women had rust when they got older yeah on top all those

213
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:22,200
Would yeah, yeah, there are they already get like uglier yeah, and also really gross they get disgusting yeah

214
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,340
There's so much added texture on top. He was a penny. Yeah

215
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:37,380
And a penny the reason it's that color it's rust my grandma looks like a penny though. Yeah, you have a brown grandma

216
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,980
tanning skin cancer oh

217
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,620
Like a dime oh oh

218
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:51,740
She was completely silver and she started to run and now she's her it's in her urn leave her outside for too long

219
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
She turns green - yeah

220
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,260
It's true. That's what happens to grandma

221
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:04,700
My grandma my grandma's as beautiful as ever we saw your grandma two weeks ago. She's lovely dude. I love my damn grandma

222
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,740
Mm-hmm

223
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,040
Well, I think she's dying in a storm right now

224
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,920
She's flooding. She told me she just moved to a place and she was like, yeah

225
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:16,840
We just moved in this house and the owner said last she was like pointing at the ground

226
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,540
She's like last time there was a hurricane

227
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,640
She said they just whole thing flooded about six feet into the house and she was like and we got this storm coming next week

228
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:29,400
So who knows I was like don't tell me that just let me find let me find out you died from a phone call

229
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,860
I don't want to be like anticipating it right like you know, yeah, just that place that she was at this

230
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:42,640
That's definitely gonna flood dude. Yeah, she lived in the bottom of a crater. Yeah, yeah, that place was crazy. Yeah, the address was

231
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:52,200
Yeah, they could do worse

232
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:57,960
worse. She doesn't even know I do this. They could do way worse. They could become her new

233
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:03,440
grandson and her new favorite grandson. I think they have pretty tough competition because

234
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,480
I'm not even her favorite grandson. It was also crazy. Who's her favorite grandson? The

235
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:11,880
other three, Ty. When she was telling us too that last time they had a hurricane at that

236
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,640
house the winds blew all those battle axes and swords off the wall. They were flinging

237
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:19,760
them around the room. I said, "You gotta get rid of this collection." She said, "They're

238
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,880
antiques. Yeah, this is an antique boulder. Yeah, this is an antique spike that I hang

239
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,240
right above my bed. And all the electricity from the walls came out. Well yeah, she let

240
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,280
it all out. I said, "Why are there frayed wires everywhere?" She said, "Those are antiques."

241
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,520
Yeah, it's antique crash box merch. Those are called electricity shooters. Yeah, this

242
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:43,000
used to be Thomas Edison's house. They shoot electricity. Yeah, I have those because they

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,040
shoot electricity. My house has a superpower. It's so cool they named a whole city in Jersey

244
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,440
after Thomas Edison. Yeah that's really fucking cool. It is cool. It's cool they named a whole

245
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,560
city after him. You invent one lightbulb and everyone's like damn okay. What state is it?

246
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,400
Jersey. Pennsylvania, they got a, I mean it's way cooler they named it after Hershey. Yeah.

247
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:09,240
That's a way cooler. Yeah you're right. Who gives a fuck about Edison? And that lady,

248
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,960
Kitty Hawk. They named the whole place after her. I don't think so. I don't think that's

249
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:22,680
I don't know that was way before women could have things named after them really now you got everything about a named after Mary's Bank

250
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:27,360
Mrs.. St. Mary was not even a woman dude what she's a fucking saint. It's different. Yeah

251
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:33,880
Yeah, I guess if you you become a saint you renounce all the only girl saying stuff. Yeah, there's a little bit

252
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,760
St.. Elizabeth St.. Elizabeth, and then that's the last one oh

253
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,200
I think you're thinking of Queen Elizabeth who read no no

254
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:45,100
No, cuz saying that st. Elizabeth was the hospital. I was born at

255
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,200
That's not a girl then. Oh really? Yeah. Because it's a hospital? It's a hospital.

256
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,720
Alright, that makes sense. That does make sense. I was born at New Hanover County

257
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:01,160
Hospital. Which saint is that? Huh? That's not a saint. I think that's a free clinic.

258
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:07,200
New Hanover County Hospital? Yeah, you were born in an urgent care? Yeah. That

259
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,200
That would make a little sense, I think, with my head shape.

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,200
It's just an urgent care.

261
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,200
It's like a John Mellencamp song.

262
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,200
"I'm calling in an urgent care."

263
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:24,200
I gotta give this guy a rash medicine, I'll be back to deliver your baby.

264
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,200
There's multiple people in here with gunshot wounds.

265
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,200
You can just push that out yourself, I think.

266
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
I didn't go to the hood.

267
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,200
Yeah, you did.

268
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,200
No, I didn't.

269
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:37,200
I was giving you a layup there, you could have said you were born in the hood.

270
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,200
Okay, I was born in the hood.

271
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
He said, "Man, I ain't delivering no white ass babies."

272
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,200
They did say that.

273
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,200
And then they saw me and they were like, "I'll make an exception."

274
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,200
"I'll make an exception."

275
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,200
They saw you?

276
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
Yeah, they saw me.

277
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:52,200
Because I just started coming out, they saw my feet.

278
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
I have black feet.

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:01,200
They saw me and they knew I was going to be different.

280
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,200
Nobody in the whole room helping you?

281
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,460
(laughter)

282
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,900
- Yeah, it was pretty awesome getting born there.

283
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,340
You were born in a bathtub.

284
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,180
- No.

285
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,140
- Oh, swimming pool.

286
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,460
- Regular hospital.

287
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,820
- Regular hot tub.

288
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,140
- In Weatherford, Texas.

289
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,180
- I thought you were a home birth.

290
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,660
- Me too, for some reason.

291
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,460
- I thought that you were born in an inflatable pool

292
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,860
inside of a house.

293
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,700
- I thought you were--

294
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,520
- That's not true.

295
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,860
- Are you Saudi Arabian or am I wrong on that too?

296
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,980
- I'm completely white.

297
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:34,180
not even saudi at all

298
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,020
not only were born into a shoebox either

299
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,160
regular shoes in a bed in a hospital at the award whatever they said that they

300
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,580
got

301
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,100
in the hospital you know it's only a line here's making you know you know

302
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,660
whatever happens in hospital you were born in a fucking saudi arabia that you

303
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,820
were born in a sleeping bag i don't think saudi arabians take regular baths

304
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,740
whoa

305
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,780
well you can say that because you are saudi

306
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,780
That's true, yeah.

307
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,100
No, they probably have some weird kind of bath.

308
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,540
Scrooge McDuck jump into a bunch of, whoa.

309
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,380
I don't know.

310
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,220
What?

311
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,040
Dog blood?

312
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,880
I've heard about it.

313
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
(laughing)

314
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,540
You can read the article.

315
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,380
You've heard that?

316
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,220
(laughing)

317
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,660
Is that a Vice article or something?

318
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,000
No, I wrote it.

319
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,500
(laughing)

320
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,340
On the way here.

321
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,740
Oh my God.

322
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,580
So you could bring up the anecdote.

323
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,940
I was interviewing a guy at the store

324
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,780
and he told me all of that.

325
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,620
Oh wow.

326
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,460
Yeah.

327
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,300
Wow.

328
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,700
Have you been, I know that last time you were here,

329
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,960
you some got you got you seem like a magnet for crazy people from everything

330
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:30,600
I could hear

331
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,740
I'm attacked at all yet no I really got attacked on the train

332
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,140
we didn't get attacked we got we got into a mild argument

333
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,460
which was settled peacefully yeah I'm

334
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:44,940
you know that you were gonna I said I would I think I threatened to fuck that

335
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,260
guy

336
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:49,180
yeah you know that's how you I'm the negotiator

337
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:52,700
yeah yeah yeah closer exactly for kind of

338
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,940
(laughing)

339
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,520
- We were on the train, our friend like,

340
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,820
didn't get his footing right,

341
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,620
accidentally bumped into a woman twice

342
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,040
and this guy started freaking out at us.

343
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,580
- He bumped into a woman twice?

344
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:08,100
- Yeah, like he wasn't holding onto the pole.

345
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,920
Yeah, the guy was like, "Do that shit again!

346
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,180
"Do that shit again, I'll beat the fuck out of you!"

347
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:16,020
And then, fuck, what else?

348
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,380
The fucking, it was going on for like 20 minutes.

349
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,580
- And then you started negotiating.

350
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
- Yeah, then the negotiation--

351
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,580
- And that's a smart move 'cause in New York

352
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,380
you never know who you're talking to.

353
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,660
You might be like, if you don't stop, I'm gonna fuck you.

354
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,180
And then the guy says, son, I'm actually the CEO

355
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:31,740
of Bain Capital and you're exactly the kind of go-getter

356
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,860
we need in the boardroom.

357
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,300
- I remember you looked at the guy and you said,

358
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:40,140
he started laughing in your face, I remember,

359
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,460
and he went, ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha,

360
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,980
and then you said, I'm rock hard right now.

361
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,980
- You know, that's what we call the jester's gambit.

362
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,100
in the negotiating team.

363
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,780
That's something they teach you at West Point.

364
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,740
- I forgot about that.

365
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:59,180
- So you're doing like hostage stuff?

366
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,540
- Yeah, usually like growing up we'd kidnap people

367
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,620
and then just for like pranks,

368
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,980
and we'd have like a walkie talkie.

369
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,260
We didn't have batteries for them,

370
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,780
but we'd just stand close to each other

371
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,400
and we'd negotiate.

372
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,900
And usually it wouldn't work and we couldn't let them go.

373
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,940
But towards the end there,

374
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,380
like last couple years we had several people let go.

375
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,220
- That's great.

376
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,000
- You ever kidnap a child?

377
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,700
- Not that I can remember.

378
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,060
- Hard to negotiate with a child.

379
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,220
They're fucking, terrible twos.

380
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,500
- I don't think you usually negotiate

381
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,820
with the person you kidnap though.

382
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,780
- Well, but if they had kid parents too.

383
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,900
- That's a good point, I didn't think about that.

384
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,660
- I mean, I guess that doesn't make any sense.

385
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,620
- Honestly, I wish I had gotten kidnapped as a kid

386
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,020
'cause I could have taught my way out of it.

387
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,540
- I really was just, I was pretty--

388
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,940
- I could have danced my way out of it.

389
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,500
- I was pretty afraid of getting kidnapped as a kid,

390
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,860
but I was like ugly and fat kid.

391
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,140
Like people wanna kidnap the beautiful children.

392
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,220
- I was a sexy kid but I had a little belly on me.

393
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,060
- Oh really?

394
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,880
- So I don't know.

395
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,720
- Who do you think I would've been?

396
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,460
- Are talented kids at higher risk?

397
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,460
You think a kid walking out of a piano recital or something?

398
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,860
- Yeah, they're like we're gonna get that kid.

399
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,700
- Yeah, that's what happened to JonBenet.

400
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,540
- What?

401
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:10,540
JonBenet wasn't talented at all.

402
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,660
She was a fucking hack.

403
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,500
- Oh, at this girl?

404
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,540
- Yeah.

405
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,940
- JonBenet sounds like a skateboarder.

406
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:18,460
I forgot that was a groundsman's famous kidnapping case.

407
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:25,460
I follow somebody who has that as their avatar on Twitter and I thought that was just a picture.

408
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,460
I thought it was just a following a girl.

409
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,460
Turns out it's a guy?

410
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Yeah, it's a guy.

411
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,460
A guy who has a picture of JonBenet Ramsey.

412
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
It's a pretty odd choice.

413
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
Right, but then the Supreme logo too.

414
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
Oh, that's funny as hell.

415
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Anyway, it turned out to be a different person than I thought it was.

416
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,460
You followed this person on the basis of like...

417
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,740
is John's name. No, no, I just, I might be thinking of a different person. Oh, okay.

418
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:57,740
But it turned out to be a missing person, like a famous one. Oh, damn. Yeah. Not that I

419
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:03,100
found them, it was, like I said. Did you guys ever know anybody who went missing? Or had cancer? Yeah, well,

420
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:11,420
yes, my grandpa. Grandpa? No, a kid. Oh. Oh. I think my grandpa had cancer. You think so? I don't know,

421
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:16,260
when he was a kid? As a kid? I saw people on the street the other day. With cancer? No, with a

422
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,460
giant sign that said like help this little kid he has cancer and it was like

423
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,700
it didn't look like a photo you would take of it it was like too nice of a

424
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,740
photo well it's probably a book I if I if I was taking a picture yeah I would

425
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:35,040
take I would put them in a little clown costume I'd paint a tear next to their

426
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,260
eye and I'd have them holding a drooping flower I would face tune the kid giant

427
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:45,420
eyes huge frown yeah right arrow through their head uh-huh like save this kid has

428
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:52,020
brain cancer yeah and we tried to cure it using holistic methods and now he also

429
00:21:52,020 --> 00:22:01,380
has an arrow in his head. A bow and arrow with a little it dipped in a in elderberry syrup

430
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:07,740
we're in a huge amount of medical debt to dr. William Tell who failed to cure my

431
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:16,740
child of brain cancer. I didn't give him any money. Yeah. Yeah. Why not? Because I

432
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,180
didn't have any cash and I think if I we have a Venmo QR code. I was like okay. If I

433
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,820
got to the point where I'm holding up a sign like that to try

434
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,180
and get someone to pay for curing my kid's cancer, I would just take my

435
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,140
child to a magician. Tell you what, I'd rather my kid fucking die than me beg

436
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,580
for money. Yeah. Yeah. Preach. Who's gonna give me money? I'd rather my kid

437
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,260
fucking die in an agonizing way than me fucking out there on the streets begging

438
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:46,380
for money. It's disgusting. Let my kid die. It's also it's just so much work. No one's

439
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:50,340
gonna do anything. Why don't you go take a chance? Doctors are so busy

440
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:55,180
nowadays. Yeah, I can't even take him to a hypnotist or something. Exactly, yeah. Make his last moments fun.

441
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,260
They have open schedules. Yeah, I don't need to. I mean it might work. I would say

442
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,220
quality of life. Same thing as like old people. It's like quality of life. Yeah,

443
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:11,020
Growing up I had asthma. You didn't see me complaining about it. No. Do you still have it? Yeah, I complain about it now

444
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,200
But you know, I knew I had to wait till I had a platform. Yeah, like that's true

445
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,480
Sometimes I hit my vape too many times in a row and then when I go up the stairs, I start coughing a little bit

446
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Mm-hmm

447
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,380
It's gotta be hard Gary Vee says like I used to work at Burger King and now I have money

448
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:29,960
Yeah, this is the same thing you're doing with asthma

449
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:35,540
Yeah, I'm like the Gary Vee of asthma. Yeah, I like when he rips off old ladies it at a

450
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:42,900
Garage sales. Yeah, they'll have like a they have like an Oscar statue that their son won or something and they're selling it for $2

451
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,100
He's like, can you do $1?

452
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Yeah, and then he sells it for 400 bucks he goes is he the paperclip guy?

453
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,380
Is that how he what the guy who like he's like?

454
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:59,500
"Oh, I traded a paperclip for this, this for that."

455
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,340
- No, you think that's how he became a billionaire?

456
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,180
Was it?

457
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,000
- Yeah.

458
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,540
(laughing)

459
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,060
That must have found a lot of paperclips.

460
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,900
- He's the guy who did,

461
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,660
he did paperclip to house trade,

462
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,060
and he was like, "Oh, I can just do that in front of--"

463
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,540
- Hold up, wait, is that the guy,

464
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,940
is he the little worm that drives the Apple car?

465
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,420
- I don't think so.

466
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:19,020
I think that you're thinking of a made-up character

467
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,220
from a Richard Scarry book.

468
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,300
- Okay. - Yeah.

469
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,900
- Imagine how many, you could re-up though,

470
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,740
imagine how many paperclips you could buy

471
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,940
if you sold your house.

472
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,940
That's true.

473
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
And then infinite money.

474
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,740
And then you get each of those paperclips up into another house.

475
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,300
Realistically, how many paperclips do you have to have before you're making good money off

476
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
selling the paperclips?

477
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,140
Probably like a billion paperclips.

478
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,180
However many Staples has.

479
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:41,540
How did Gary Vee get where he is?

480
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,620
I think he invented Facebook.

481
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:47,420
Is there like a series of videos and books I can watch or read to find this out?

482
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:50,020
If there was some kind of method, then maybe.

483
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
But I don't think there is, no.

484
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,820
I don't think there's a book about his method or anything.

485
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:59,300
I'm looking to do what he does one for one one-to-one recreation. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm trying to he says it

486
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:03,660
You got to go to the garage sales. You have to rip off the old ladies. You have to steal you have to steal

487
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,620
I got it from stealing. Oh, yeah. He's a bank robber. Yeah

488
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:12,880
He found a bunch of pies that were sitting on window sills and he would go to the market and sell them

489
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:19,860
Yeah for a hundred thousand dollars. Yeah. Yeah within weeks. He was a millionaire. He sold one paperclip for millions of dollars

490
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,700
There's this one clip of his I was watching where it's like, he's like all these parents

491
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,260
are yelling at their kids for not going outside.

492
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:31,860
And he's, what do you think, what world do you think they're going to grow up in?

493
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,100
You're not letting them become like amazing eSports players.

494
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,620
I thought that was so fucking sick.

495
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,620
It's true dude.

496
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,620
I thought that was so fucking sick.

497
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,340
Gary Vee is spitting just facts.

498
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:48,380
Yeah, just like oh yeah, kids nowadays have to be in eSports, they have to be on TikTok,

499
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,780
your kids stay inside all day. That's the way out. The screen for a lot of these kids is

500
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:59,140
good. That's right. It was for you. It was for me. It was for Cameron. Yeah. That's right.

501
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:06,140
Thomas grew up. I did. Thank you. In a tree. Yeah, you grew up in a tree. Growing up it

502
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:08,980
was. You used to ride leaves down the trunks of the trees. Growing up it was either eSports

503
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,860
or Lockheed Martin. Yeah. Or otherwise you weren't getting out of the hood. And you stuck

504
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,340
with. Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin. Yeah, I designed missiles. Really? Yeah, I'm working

505
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,340
I'm working on one right now and it's white and it has a red tip.

506
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Okay.

507
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,340
And it says Acme on it.

508
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,500
And there's this one guy who lives out in the desert and he's been buying them by the

509
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
pallet.

510
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,940
Do you ever get worried about what he might do with that?

511
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:29,940
No.

512
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,940
No.

513
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:33,380
I don't really get paid anymore.

514
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,220
It's just more of a passion project.

515
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,220
Yeah.

516
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,220
When you were making money, you just stopped caring about it, right?

517
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,340
You're just like, "I don't care."

518
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,380
They told me I needed a social security number and I was like, "How about this?

519
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:52,380
I work here for 20 years. On the 20th year, I start working here. And after 20 years working

520
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,880
here, you know what? You hire me. And I'll work here for 20 years.

521
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,580
So they know that you're like a grinder.

522
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:00,780
Exactly. You're in it for the love of the game.

523
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,860
It was the only time frame I could think of. So I just said it a few times so I don't have

524
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,820
to find another job.

525
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,580
And they just said, "Well, sure."

526
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:10,380
Yeah. And they ask you a question like, "Where do you see yourself in 20 years?" And you're

527
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,140
like, "Starting working here."

528
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:18,180
Yeah, I say in 20 years. I'm gonna be working here for 20 years. Yeah, I'm working here for 20 years starting in 20

529
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,180
So Lockheed Martin is Acme

530
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,660
It's a no. It's the guy we'd sell to on the desert

531
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:30,660
His his name is like coyote. Oh, okay thing he likes custom branding

532
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:37,120
So he has that do you guys also make those little holes that you've put on the ground and something? Yeah people falling we paint

533
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:42,640
Sometimes we'll paint like a road onto the side of a mountain for him for this guy, right?

534
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:50,100
I don't know what he uses it for but yeah, God only knows. Yeah, are you also do you guys also work on those really delicious carrots?

535
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,380
Oh, yeah, the one really good

536
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,160
Loud, they're so loud carrots. Yeah, you the candles do

537
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,100
The candles candles. Yeah the candles do you do?

538
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:06,720
Do you do big red knots in people's heads also? Yeah, they're kind of a merge. Yeah, we had this layer

539
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,600
The only thing we've had to discontinue was our ink wells.

540
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
Oh yeah.

541
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,680
And also our...

542
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,000
Your car exhaust pipes.

543
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,360
Yeah, those probably didn't age too well.

544
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,360
They did not.

545
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,440
They were very popular for a certain time frame, and after that it became clear that the market

546
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,320
was no longer interested.

547
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Definitely.

548
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
Right.

549
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,880
Thankfully, we didn't get too much backlash from that thanks to our PR team.

550
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,200
Y'all really cleaned that up.

551
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,600
Yeah.

552
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,280
We sell a lot of mousetraps.

553
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,000
mostly mousetraps are hitting the fingers. Right, yeah. And a lot of mousetraps are

554
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,380
designed to kill. These more make you go, "YOW!" Right. I think it is fucked up that

555
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,120
Lockheed Martin is sending so many mousetraps over the Middle East. Oh yeah.

556
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,920
Yeah. Yeah. Dropping them for... I mean, these kids are walking around, right?

557
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,000
They're walking around playing on playgrounds. There's a mousetrap hidden

558
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,200
underneath the sand, right? Yeah, it's been there for like 20 years. All of a sudden their toes are red.

559
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,600
And let's be honest, these mousetraps are meant for the mice, but 80% of the time

560
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,640
these mousetraps we put overseas they're ending up on a cat's tail yeah yeah or

561
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,360
one of those bastards from jackass is jumping around on yeah he's dressing up

562
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,600
like a mouse hey going into a room yeah there's a reason there's a reason they

563
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:23,440
called that show that yeah first of all they're wasting mousetraps yep they're

564
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,560
wasting cheese the cheese that from the mousetrap yeah and then they're wasting

565
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,880
a precious time of animal trainers you could be out exactly training a crocodile

566
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,280
or a snake instead they're training a crocodile to fucking bite a man's thing

567
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,800
yep you know and it's disgusting I don't really and they're wasting the talent of

568
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:47,080
a man who is perfectly suited to crawl through air conditioning shafts can you

569
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:53,600
imagine if if mini-me was an HVAC guy mini-me yeah speaking of it oh yeah no

570
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,520
mini-me mini-me yeah mini-me is we'd be a bit

571
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:02,080
so we man you're thinking of no mini-me okay from jackass if he was an HVAC you

572
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,360
what are you saying? What are you saying? It's Minimi. Minimi is from Oxfam, yeah. He's a miniature

573
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:14,720
version of Johnny Knoxville. All right. He is. When I was like eight years old and I saw like a clip

574
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,680
from Jacket, I did think that Minimi was supposed to be like a mini version of Steve-O. You thought

575
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:24,800
Minimi was supposed to be a mini version? It's not that they were like, I was like, oh it must be.

576
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
It must be the joke here.

577
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,680
Wish I was really small.

578
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I remember when my dad...

579
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,680
I wasn't tall.

580
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:35,680
Before ever watching...

581
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:38,680
Before ever watching Jackass, my dad was telling me about it one time.

582
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,680
I remember him saying like, "Yeah, there's one guy named Wee Man."

583
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,680
I'm thinking, "What the hell kind of a name is that for a guy?"

584
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:48,680
It's a good... It's good because as an American, I'm thinking this has got to be a piss.

585
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
Yeah. It's got to be made out of piss.

586
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:53,680
And then you find out his real name is John Midget.

587
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:57,940
it yeah and you're like well I see why they went with we yeah yeah it's a

593
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:21,580
because he would do skateboarding tricks and he go oh he liked roller coasters

594
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:28,900
then he got and then he got he fell and he got yeah he's be a tall skinny guy

595
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:37,180

596
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:41,900

597
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:51,500
proportions are you saying that's what you are yeah just legs as wide as your

598
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,380
your arms. Well Peter Dinklage is like four foot eight. Don't bring him up.

599
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:59,940
He's like not that, he's pretty tall for a little person. Like his head is

600
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,860
legitimately massive. Yeah, legitimately massive. Yeah, it's not illegitimately

601
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:09,220
massive. It's not photoshopped in the movies to look bigger, which for

602
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:13,980
most people that's what they do. Yeah, they photoshop it in the movies. There's a music

603
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,380
teacher at my elementary school named Mr. Woodman.

604
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:26,260
Mr. Wid-man. Wid-man? Wid-man. So you guys... Widdle-man. And he was a little person.

605
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:30,460
Really? Yeah. Wish he was Mr. Weed-man and you'd probably be smoking that grass up

606
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:38,380
in the class. Mm-hmm. Yeah. And he ended up dating one of my classmates moms and

607
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:42,500
then he moved. Holy shit. Yeah. He hit it and quit it on a classmate's mom? Was she

608
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:46,060
a little person? No, no, no. They moved together. They got married and left. Oh, wow.

609
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,060
And she was a tall lady.

610
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,560
How tall? Well, I think you have to go like abnormally tall if you're really tall.

611
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,060
And he also played the trumpet.

612
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,560
Did they get married in class?

613
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
Yeah, in the school.

614
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,560
I know that day was crazy.

615
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:01,060
Yeah. Oh my god, leave your backpacks at home.

616
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:06,060
I guess he was in this band that would play at the restaurant my mom worked at.

617
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,560
So...

618
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,560
He was in a band too?

619
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,560
He was in a band.

620
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,560
This guy sounds dope.

621
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,060
They're called Sold Out. S-O-U-L-E-D.

622
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,060
Whoa. Oh, Sold Out.

It's a song about the library.

632
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,060
I believe he taught you that.

633
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,760
That's not an agreed upon song.

634
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
Nobody's ever heard that song before.

635
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,420
He taught me that song.

No, sold out was a cover, Ben.

00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:09,180
instead of the recognizable part of the song?

648
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:12,520
both the parts of that song of the most ready to be needed to it in tune with

649
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,820
the song you know

650
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,700
all-around common

651
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,260
well they didn't play it into

652
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:22,820
uh... it is a good it was a recovery they're doing like a bluegrass twist on

653
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,620
it

654
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,480
yeah

655
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,900
i feel like i said too much about this guy

656
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:31,040
yeah it was pretty easy to identify now you know if you would you know look him

657
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,540
up but i mean hell if you look at my thing that man is a hell of a trumpet

658
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:43,620
player says my mom says your mom she said he's in the fucking it's like he's in

659
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:47,020
that band it's like the Beatles in Germany yeah it's fucking doing his

660
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,980
thing doing this thing at whippersnappers and yeah very New Hampshire

661
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:54,100
honing his craft that place doesn't exist anymore so I can say that yeah

662
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:59,780
Germany sure London Derry New York Germany does need to get fucking Germany

663
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:05,560
I I went I visited I was in the bay German I was in the bay no

664
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,560
But I kept seeing all these fucking German people he's fucking German all these

665
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:17,760
Looked like to German I was like all your bloodlines like to pure German like like to German like they look like

666
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:26,540
They have really tight pants with some like fucked up running sneakers running a polo shirt

667
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,060
- Oh, so they're just like super fit.

668
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,900
- Super, yeah.

669
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:34,460
- So you're saying they looked perfect.

670
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,020
- They looked too genetically pure.

671
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,860
They looked 100% German.

672
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,780
- And you're saying--

673
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,900
- There's something in your family tree

674
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,100
that you're not telling people about.

675
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,820
- Right, German DNA.

676
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,620
- Yeah, some going back to the 1940s.

677
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,980
- I don't understand what you're saying.

678
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,380
- I'm not sure I understand either.

679
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,420
- I don't know what you mean.

680
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,220
- I don't think they're that old.

681
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,020
You're saying these people were 70, 80 years old?

682
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,860
Yes.

683
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,060
And they had a little mustache.

684
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,660
Really?

685
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:01,980
Yeah.

686
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,020
They shared it?

687
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:05,820
They all shared this little square-- well,

688
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:08,420
when you do the math, I mean, dividing up that mustache--

689
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,580
They're attached to the lip.

690
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,100
True.

691
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,020
You think there was other guys who

692
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,820
had the other parts of it, that mustache?

693
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:16,980
Yeah, I think Hitler and his friends from World War I--

694
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,060
Maybe they would all--

695
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,700
They were like, let's all have one little part of a mustache.

696
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,620
And there's a guy who had just this.

697
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,380
Yeah.

698
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:23,940
Just that.

699
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:29,340
That would have been way more iconic of a look if Hitler had just right side, just that.

700
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:33,620
Yeah, that would be nice too because then people could wear that little fucking toothbrush

701
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,620
one.

702
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,620
Bring that thing back.

703
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,420
I wish I could go back in time and tell Hitler to do that.

704
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,420
Yeah.

705
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,820
Well that's a hard part of a mustache to grow and his was like, his was strong.

706
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,220
Yeah, I think he probably grew there because like the other sides of it like just, you

707
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,220
think it was all patchy.

708
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,660
I think if there's a popular style though in the 30s.

709
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,500
Yeah, because of Chaplin.

710
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,500
Michael Jordan.

711
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:57,780
I think if there's a nuclear war and all of our the internet is wiped out and all of our

712
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:01,220
information goes back to the stone age I'm going to find every picture of Hitler and I'm

713
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:05,120
going to erase the mustache and put it on the side just so the next generation that

714
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:06,120
mustache is free.

715
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Yeah, yeah.

716
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,120
You can use the Hitler mustache again.

717
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
And that mustache now becomes.

718
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
That mustache is evil, yeah.

719
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Yeah.

720
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,580
Because nobody's ever had a mustache like that so it's okay to make that evil.

721
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,060
You could rock that all day.

722
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:18,040
And who knows maybe we don't want pictures of Genghis Khan he could have been fucking

723
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,040
rocking that.

724
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,740
He could have rocked a normal mustache.

725
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,420
There's this band Sparks.

726
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,420
There is.

727
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,900
brothers Ron and Russell Mail and I think Ron Mail just fully in the 70s just

728
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,660
fully had a Hitler mustache. They tried to get a Hitler mustache up until the 90s.

729
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:36,140
I'm also... Then he found out. And then he was like "Ah, shit." He's a rocker. He dropped out of school.

730
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,460
Exactly. When I'm messing with all the Hitler pictures I'm also gonna put horns

731
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:44,300
on Obama. In the pictures where they're with each other. Yeah. Which there are many of them by the way.

732
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:48,620
They're gonna be a lot more too. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I would love to be

733
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,100
though have all the information in the world and be in control of it. Yeah.

734
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,940
- Yeah.

735
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,140
- You probably need a second phone.

736
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,980
- Yeah, or even I could have--

737
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,820
- Yeah, you'll be busy.

738
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,020
- I wanna be in a big room like from the Matrix,

739
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,220
where they find the creator of the Matrix

740
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,580
and he's in the big room with all the computers.

741
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:05,460
I want a room like that, but it's everything on the screens.

742
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,380
- You wanna be God.

743
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:07,540
- Yeah, I would love to be God.

744
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,220
- It's too much responsibility for me.

745
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,060
- You actually do.

746
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,460
- I'm mainly just down to fucking chill.

747
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,660
- Yeah, I would just chill too.

748
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:13,660
I would chill on it forever.

749
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,180
I thought if something's funny, I would basically do it.

750
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,460
- You'd do whatever was funny?

751
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,300
- Yeah.

752
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,120
- What if whatever was funny was like,

753
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:21,780
I'm gonna fucking make people have turds

754
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,420
their head. That sounds funny. Turds in their head. What if it killed the people?

755
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,000
Then I'd just make new people who could have turds in their head.

756
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,020
If you could make turds in somebody's head you could also just clone

757
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:37,740
that person and just do it infinitely. I could just make it so that everybody

758
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:41,580
likes having turds in their head. That would be so stupid. Yeah. That doesn't make any sense.

759
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:44,660
That's literally the worst idea I've heard in my entire life.

760
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:48,980
Well I would do a lot of stuff so not all the ideas have to be good. Name one other thing you would do that

761
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:52,020
it makes any fucking sense besides put turds in people's heads.

762
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:55,060
By the way, it was my idea, so if it's a good idea, I actually get credit for it.

763
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,620
You said it was a bad idea.

764
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,420
It was a bad idea, but now if you're saying it's a good idea, then I don't even...

765
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,580
I didn't say it was a good idea, I said it was a bad idea.

766
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,580
No you didn't.

767
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,580
I said not all of them have to be good, that's exactly what I said.

768
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,420
Did you just put a turd in Caleb's head?

769
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,500
I wish I did.

770
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,380
You couldn't, there's no way into my head.

771
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,380
You would look so good with a lobotomy scar.

772
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,380
No turds in or out.

773
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,380
Oh my god.

774
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,380
A lobotomy scar?

775
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:13,380
Like if you had the fucking...

776
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,380
You'd give me a turd lobotomy?

777
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,260
You had like a, if you're like the guy in the wheelchair from Nightmare Before Christmas.

778
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
Yeah you would be.

779
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,260
Dude with screws in your head, that would rock.

780
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:25,420
Nah I'm gonna tear your, speaking of turds, I'm gonna tear yours up, I'm gonna rearrange

781
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,780
yours and you're gonna be in a wheelchair.

782
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:27,780
My turds?

783
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
Yeah I'm gonna.

784
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,780
What?

785
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
I'm gonna rearrange your fucking turds.

786
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,780
That's right.

787
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:35,100
I'm gonna go in there, I'm gonna move around like a Rubik's Cube and then I'm gonna come

788
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,740
back out and you're gonna be in a wheelchair.

789
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,740
I'm not gonna be in a wheelchair.

790
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:38,740
You're gonna be in a weird chair.

791
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:42,220
They're gonna have to invent a new wheelchair for your fucking fucked up ass.

792
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,220
It's red.

793
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,900
It's a red with blood because I rearranged his turds and I hit a couple of fucking...

794
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,700
There was some traffic cones I was knocking over in there. I'll say that much.

795
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,500
So, do you have anything else to say, God?

796
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:58,540
Or did I put you at rest? Are you so stupid you really think I'm God?

797
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,540
No, I'm actually smart. He would definitely make up a new word for God if he was trying to do that shit.

798
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:08,180
If he was trying to be God, he would call himself, like, "Sporker."

799
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:11,740
Sporker? That's a fucking awful name. That's the worst name ever.

800
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,980
that's by a good name is why he was genuinely playing with his keys

801
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,700
the back of the lady

802
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,620
uh... i can't actually books dot and i was promised for a record people like

803
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,260
also spurgle

804
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,860
here is for a door also that much of a yeah

805
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:30,380
spurred by getting a test for that soon

806
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,340
asperger's

807
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:33,060
you know you can only have asperger's

808
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:37,200
media you can use that so you know you're so sorry dude

809
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:41,420
he's a show you know it's a shy streak he's not sees not asperger's shadow

810
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:47,500
Yeah. I wouldn't know. I want to get tested for that just to see if it would make sense.

811
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:51,820
I don't think there's any test that you can ever get that will make you happy.

812
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:56,940
Yeah. Yeah. You just got to deal with it. I'm not saying I would be happy if I found out. You would

813
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:03,020
be so happy if you found out you had Asperger's. You'd be like, "Oh my god, yes, I get to be so

814
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:08,380
annoying now." That's the only reason you ever get that test unless you're two years old. Yeah.

815
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,900
You'd be like, look at him, he just moved his hips like that.

816
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:11,900
He's already thinking about it.

817
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,540
He's already like, oh yeah, I have Asperger's

818
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,460
and I'm just gonna scream and then say it.

819
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:20,340
- I thought when I was on Adderall when I was a kid,

820
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,100
I was like 16, not really, technically a kid.

821
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,940
- That's a kid to me.

822
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:29,940
- Yeah, but I took an Asperger's screening quiz online.

823
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,140
- That's always a good idea.

824
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:34,500
- And I was like, holy crap.

825
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,740
Holy crap, these sound like things that I'm doing

826
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:41,060
not thinking like oh my god like a pill that's making me like read Wikipedia for

827
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:46,820
like you ever do oh my god I I have the same personality as Luke Skywalker oh my

828
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,500
god Lee I would be Pikachu just cry walking away it's like you are Darth

829
00:41:52,500 --> 00:42:05,580
Vader walking into my parents room crying cuz I got Fez from that 70s yeah

830
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:12,740
taking a quiz as a 12 year old and you're like fuck I'm a sex addict I knew it

831
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:17,980
yeah I think every everybody's had that taking one of those and it's like it's

832
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:22,060
like you're a psychopath cuz you're like fuck you I don't like three days any

833
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:29,740
fan about taking off it's like fuck this is taking over I love coming I think I'm

834
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:35,340
addicted to having a great big bone yeah what personality type are you guys

835
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:46,620
Myers-Briggs status. I'm a triple X. Don't lick the mic like that. Stop licking the mic. He's actually LGBTQ.

836
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:52,140
Yeah, he got it. That's fine by me to be LGBTQ in that way. That's cool now. Yeah.

837
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,460
Socially I'm fine with that kind of thing and that's the same thing as triple X.

838
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,020
Socially and legally. Legally I think that it should be completely legal and not

839
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:07,580
up to the states. I think the state should have no say in that, personally, and I'm for real.

840
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:15,580
I ain't clowning. And pornographers types should be able to do that. Yeah. Right?

841
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:18,380
That should be allowed. And California and the rest of the country as well.

842
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,740
I think the California laws should be everywhere. Yeah. What are the California laws?

843
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:27,820
Just like, I think there should be a tent city in the middle of Ohio. Yeah. There's just a giant

844
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,820
Well, hey, I got some good news for you

845
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:34,160
Okay, what's the good news? There's a lot of tent cities

846
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,120
in Ohio

847
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,540
real looks like you just agree with yeah, Caleb I

848
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:45,720
Disagree you agree with me. I agree. Mm-hmm. I think we should do it. I agree

849
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:52,720
We should just Sim City cloning tool with San Francisco. Just make the whole country San Francisco that I should be kind of fire

850
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,160
That would actually be yeah

851
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,640
A lot of people would lose weight because of the hills. They would lose weight because of the hills and the weather would be perfect year-round.

852
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,200
The dwarves would love it. The dwarves would not love it. No, they would all the mountain.

853
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:10,640
That's true. That's so much more mountain, dude. Oh, I don't think San Francisco is quite a mountain. No, it's a mountain. Dwarves are small enough.

854
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,560
It's basically like at the top. Do you think there's dwarves in the middle of San Francisco? Just like fire and moldy lava?

855
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,560
No, they're under. They're hidden. Yeah.

856
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,120
Like in the core of it, how do you think the train they're hitting axes on the on the thing? I don't watch them

857
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:30,920
Yeah, well you you think they would invite me to probably not you're too tall or even halls wouldn't fit in the hole, right?

858
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:37,740
You know is I mean I can't I'm not invited there. They got wooden mugs right there. They're cheers in the yeah everywhere

859
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:44,020
Well, what I mean, that's the plumbing. Yeah, they are there and there's coal. Yeah, there's

888
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,220
Sometimes I get pushed by you should you get fucked in like, you know

889
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:44,160
Yeah, what's this what's this impression of a fucking mirror that you're looking into bud no cuz mirrors don't speak typically

890
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,400
Well mine do you speak while you're looking into it?

891
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,240
Technically speak on

892
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:55,880
What a black mirror can speak a phone if you're talking into that's true, but usually the screens on it's a black mirror

893
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,880
It's your mirror that you look at

894
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,680
Because I'm black

895
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:02,680
I don't know, right?

896
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,680
Yeah, maybe you are.

897
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:04,680
Yeah, I mean, maybe I am.

898
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:05,680
I don't know.

899
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,680
I don't know either.

900
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:07,680
Me and Cam do want to do a DNA test, though.

901
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:08,680
Yeah.

902
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:09,680
Yeah.

903
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:10,680
And I think-

904
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:11,680
You've been talking about it for years at this point.

905
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,680
Well, no, I mean, just like, I think- I don't- The thing is, it sucks because there's no

906
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:15,680
way-

907
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,680
There's no way identical twins-

908
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,000
I would like to make it a competition, but there's no way to do that without doing some

909
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:22,000
kind of like-

910
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,000
Eugenics, yeah.

911
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,000
Ranking of the races.

912
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Well, yeah.

913
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,000
I don't want to do that.

914
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
You can- I mean, the only-

915
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:30,720
And I feel like the way it works is you have people place bets on what the results are

916
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:31,720
going to be.

917
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
Yeah, I guess we have to do it like that.

918
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,760
There has to be no value judgment at all.

919
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,760
Yeah, yeah, because once we do that we're in trouble.

920
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,960
Yeah, you have to let everyone else put the value judgment on it.

921
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:46,000
Is putting down stuff like, it's like, because then you're like, "Oh, I fucking hope that

922
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,000
he's not Italian."

923
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:50,840
That's what I'm saying, then that's on them and it doesn't matter.

924
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,000
Yeah, me and you, we're happy for him.

925
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,520
payout whatever comes out of that crazy that crazy website that's true yeah I

926
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:01,560
don't give you like an over and under on how Chinese both you are yeah yeah I mean

927
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:07,400
I think I have a little more Chinese yeah yeah we just got to pick an arbitrary

928
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:11,120
one be like whoever's the most of this but odds are probably neither of us are

929
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:15,760
Chinese at all yeah well you never know that's the thing about it that's a good

930
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,440
point yeah somebody could make like a million bucks off we can play what if we

931
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,880
50% Chinese.

932
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,200
What if we did like--

933
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,680
The odds on that is unreal.

934
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,440
What if we did like--

935
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:30,640
what if we did like guess who, right?

936
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:33,080
With all the different parts of what kind of race we are.

937
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,120
So like we know, but the other person doesn't.

938
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,120
So it would be through 23andMe, right?

939
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:37,620
Yeah.

940
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,000
So we set up little--

941
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:43,880
You can see on that, they have things on there that's like,

942
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,840
oh, you have this much Neanderthal DNA,

943
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,800
or like this much.

944
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,400
Like you're prone to having black hair.

945
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:52,240
- Yeah.

946
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,080
- Or stuff like that.

947
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,240
- You say lack hair?

948
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,080
- Black hair.

949
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,040
- Oh.

950
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:56,880
- Black hair.

951
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,000
- Yeah, you might have black hair later in life.

952
00:49:59,000 --> 00:49:59,840
- Yeah.

953
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:00,680
- That'd be cool.

954
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,500
- Prone to it.

955
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,340
- Kinda sprout, second.

956
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:03,180
- It just comes back like pure Puerto Rican.

957
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:04,000
- Yeah.

958
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:04,840
- Perfect.

959
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:05,680
- Just perfect.

960
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:06,800
- Just hair line right here.

961
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:08,720
I have one inch of forehead.

962
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:09,560
Be sick, dude.

963
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:13,560
- I didn't have black hair growing up.

964
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,340
- So you got cursed probably by some kind of pyro?

965
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,340
Yeah, look at his head.

966
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,340
It's pretty dark.

967
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:20,340
It's dark.

968
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:21,340

00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,600
up towards the head just to hide my thing completely. Yeah. Just make it just look caterpillar.

1038
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:18,040
Yeah, right if it wasn't sexual you'd let me do it probably if it's not sexual

Yeah, it's like yeah, we are talking and for you. It's like cold and clinical. Yeah

1048
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,960
It's like when you go to the urgent care and you have to get your physical and the doctor has a boner

1049
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,960
But like you just need your balls checked. Yeah. Yeah, that happens you doctor my doctor my peter's supposed to

1050
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:16,520
Yeah, yeah, what pediatrician passed away recently really yes, he wasn't that good at it. Yeah

1051
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:22,620
He is it's kind of weird because it's like I feel like something he's probably touched my penis more than anybody in the world

1052
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:29,660
Including yourself. Yeah

1053
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:35,200
He's probably tested my my paint my balls for lumps. I don't think I've been to a doc actually, you know what?

1054
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:38,700
No, that's a lie. I went to a doctor at August 1st. That's nice

1055
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:45,440
Yeah, that's huge after not going for five years. Nice. Yeah, and they touch your penis

1056
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,560
You just immediately walk in, it's been too long, you forget to get over here, just pull

1057
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,560
your pants down, let's get this over with.

1058
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:56,760
The guy, you haven't touched it any in the five years, so it's like, it's just like a

1059
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,760
swollen...

1060
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,080
It looks like an old pier, it's got marbles on it.

1061
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:02,920
It's like when an old man in India grows his fingernails to be six feet long.

1062
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:07,200
Your penis hasn't been trimmed back in so long, it looks weird.

1063
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,200
You haven't pruned it, yeah.

1064
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:09,200
Yeah.

1065
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:10,200
It's so, yeah.

1066
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,200
I hate having to fucking prune my dick.

1067
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,640
He's probably tested my penis more than anyone.

1068
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,300
Really tested it smell test like a bull like a like a whole five panel

And then because he was the first to sleep we were all fucking with him and then he woke

1098
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:23,840
up and ran into the room and my friend Alex was like in a chair far away from him and

1099
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:28,440
because Alex was like he thought of Alex as like weaker than him he just ran over and started

1100
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:31,440
trying to wail on Alex even though Alex had nothing to do with it.

1101
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:37,840
no way I'm glad that you got us caught on them. I was one time with my cousins and then I

1105
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:58,200
closest one was and this is only about four years ago. Well he, he attacked him. I could legally drink at the time. He attacked him but he Alex was far away in the

1106
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:04,800
room. Alex had no involvement. He was far far away. He was far enough that as soon as he

1107
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,840
went over and started trying to wail on him everyone was just like, "Alright, what the

1109
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:18,440
he tried to kick him off of him and he said "Only pussies kick" and then he started kicking

1110
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,320
back and then we kept saying that all weekend and he got really mad and he went home. You

01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,060
Don't kick me and fucking hurt me.

1124
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:40,240
Don't kick the table.

1125
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,240
I just...

1126
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,240
Yeah.

1127
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,240
I thought it would...

1128
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,240
That's beyond...

1129
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,240
That's beyond what's okay.

1130
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:46,240
That's not...

1131
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,240
This table is...

1132
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:48,240
That's inappropriate.

1133
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,240
Let's give it two weeks, man.

1134
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Okay.

1135
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:51,240
Yeah, I am starting to...

1136
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,240
On this side here, we gotta fill this in.

1137
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,240
No.

1138
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:54,240
You...

1139
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,240
It's as is.

1140
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
Okay.

1141
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,240
I'm done.

1142
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,240
It's a good table.

1143
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,240
I'm done.

1144
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,240
Alright.

1145
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
Leave it alone.

1146
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,240
Okay.

1147
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:03,240
There's just a little crack here.

1148
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,240
Tom, do you have anything to talk about and tell people about?

1149
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:05,240
Go check out Pindeo Time.

1150
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,240
Yeah.

1151
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:07,240
You and old Jake.

1152
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:08,240
Old Jake.

1153
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:09,240
Yeah.

1154
01:01:09,240 --> 01:01:10,240
Who's talking about this the other night.

1155
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,760
Jake, if you're listening, I'm sorry that when we slept together in a bed I got a huge

1156
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:14,920
boner.

1157
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:16,520
I don't think he knew about that.

1158
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,520
He knew.

1159
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:20,160
I think he knew you were like ripping ass the whole time.

1160
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,160
Yeah.

1161
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,160
I wasn't farting.

1162
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
No, that was me.

1163
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,160
That's why my penis smells when it gets hard.

1164
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:26,920
- From what his account, both of you were ripping ass

1165
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,840
the entire night. - Liar.

1166
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,960
- He's a liar.

1167
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,800
Don't believe him if he said I had a boner either.

1168
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,640
- That was like a comic.

1169
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,460
- No, he didn't.

1170
01:01:32,460 --> 01:01:34,840
- I don't think he has a memory of you having a boner.

1171
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:38,320
- Apologize to him for me having a boner in the other room.

1172
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,520
(laughing)

1173
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,580
- There's just something about that damn house.

1174
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,020
- Otis also had a boner.

1175
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,400
That's all right.

1176
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,220
Anyway.

1177
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:47,060
- Otis is a cat.

1178
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:48,900
- Yeah, Otis is a cat.

1179
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,040
Yeah, I realize I have to, just saying Otis.

1180
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:52,880
Nobody knows.

1181
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,880
groundskeeper

1182
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:59,680
He's why he looks in the window

1183
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:09,460
Where do you want me to put this

1184
01:02:09,460 --> 01:02:20,320
Anyway, we don't have any shows coming up or anything, but yeah, I've been day all time go check out

1185
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:21,320
Thanks for having me.

1186
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,320
Of course.

1187
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:23,320
It's been a pleasure.

1188
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,320
What do you think of our awesome office?

1189
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:25,320
I think it's pretty sick.

1190
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,160
It's cool you guys have your own little space and everything.

1191
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,480
You think it looks really good right now?

1192
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,720
I think it looks, it's probably the best place I've ever seen.

1193
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:31,720
Thank you.

1194
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,720
You're welcome.

1195
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:34,840
Would you say it seems like big things are happening?

1196
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:38,520
Not really, it seems like everything's going downhill but there's space to do it.
