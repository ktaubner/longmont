1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,080
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,140
- You're a crap monster.

5
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:10,980
(laughing)

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,240
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,880
- Bad things come in threes.

8
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:14,880
- Bad things come in threes,

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,240
but good things coming.

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:19,040
Dozens and dozens of blessings overflowing.

11
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,000
- Maybe even thousands, overflowing blessings.

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,240
- Millions of overflowing abundant blessings.

13
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,800
- In a row, with no breaks.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,160
- I would say good things come in blessings.

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,480
- Large amounts.

16
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,120
- Good things come in blessings.

17
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:31,960
- Yeah.

18
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,800
- Well yeah, blessings are the vessel

19
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,800
in which good things are delivered.

20
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,640
- Exactly.

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,460
- Bad things come in threes.

22
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,300
- But how many?

23
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,560
- Good things come in presents.

24
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,920
- Okay, so bad things come in threes,

25
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,480
but also they say deaths come in threes.

26
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:46,320
- So deaths are bad.

27
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,400
- Sometimes people die and it's completely fine.

28
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,240
- Not true.

29
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,160
- You know, an old, old, old man.

30
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,000
- Not true.

31
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,820
- It's always a human life lost.

32
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,120
- Can you get a blessing as a present?

33
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,960
- Yes.

34
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:58,120
No, that's a present.

35
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,520
A present comes in Christmas.

36
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,760
- Presents come in Christmas.

37
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,600
- Presents come in Christmas.

38
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,420
- Presents come in Christmas.

39
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,240
- Bad things come in threes,

40
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:08,440
but presents come in Christmas trees.

41
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,880
- Bad things come in threes,

42
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,080
but presents come at Christmas and your birthday.

43
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,920
Christmas Eve.

44
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,200
- I'm trying to do a rhyme.

45
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
- Oh, I don't think it needs to rhyme.

46
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,560
- I think it needs to rhyme.

47
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,400
- Why?

48
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,400
- That's a poem if your birthday is on Christmas Eve.

49
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,480
- Yeah, you know, you gotta feel bad for those kids.

50
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,480
I feel good for them because they get presents the next day.

51
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,760
No, you got to feel bad for them.

52
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:33,760
What?

53
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,760
No, they only get one.

54
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,440
If you're born on Christmas.

55
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
My aunt was born on Christmas.

56
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:41,000
I don't think I've ever known anybody who was born on Christmas.

57
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,040
I think that that's probably...

58
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
I think that...

59
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,360
Most people, if their child is due to be born on Christmas, they get a C-section beforehand.

60
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I don't...

61
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
What?

62
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
Oh, a Christmas section.

63
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,640
A Christmas section, yeah.

64
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
I feel like that's...

65
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,640
Honestly, I mean I'm not a woman and I've never had surgery done. I feel like that's worth it.

66
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
Yeah, right?

67
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,640
I mean, I think that's one of those things where as a kid it sucks really bad, but I think it trains you to be a better adult.

68
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:16,640
I think it's like child labor, you know. If you work in a prison camp or something as a child and you grow up, you'll be stronger.

69
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
True.

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,640
Yeah. You will be a great artist.

71
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,640
It's like adversity.

72
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,280
Or you might, you could be the Antichrist.

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,320
Yeah, well, Antichrist will be born on Halloween,

74
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,160
not Christmas.

75
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,040
You could hate Christmas so, so much

76
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,520
that you become, or like, 'cause you hate Christmas

77
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,840
because you don't get Christmas presents, right?

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,240
Right.

79
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,680
And then you hate it so much

80
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,780
that you yourself go your whole life

81
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,160
trying to become the exact opposite of Christ.

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,840
Yeah, you're like, yeah, 'cause your parents

83
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,520
are expecting you to act like Christ

84
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,640
of your birthday yeah or Santa in either one I think you're gonna end up being

85
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:07,760
kind of devilish yeah exactly that's the green the anti Santa oh I guess I bet

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,840
dr. Seuss had this same conversation

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,840
If you're born on Christmas, you wouldn't become the anti-Santa.

88
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,840
He said, "Who is the anti-Santa?"

89
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,840
Oh wait, it's the Grinch.

90
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,840
And then he started reading that.

91
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,840
And then he made up the Grinch.

92
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Apparently Santa Claus's birthday is March 15th, according to Google.

93
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Whoa, that's my little brother's...

94
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
That's the day before my little brother's birthday.

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,840
When is Santa's birthday? The answer might surprise you.

96
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Many may assume Santa Claus was born on December 25th,

97
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,920
if given his profession, and if not on Christmas Day,

98
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,280
then pretty close to it.

99
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,600
But it turns out Santa is more of a springtime baby

100
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,340
than a winter wonder birth.

101
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:50,240
This works out well because who really wants to work

102
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,400
and travel on their special day?

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,360
- Yeah, Santa is such a Pisces.

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,240
- He is. - Is that a Pisces?

105
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,080
- Deadass. - He actually is.

106
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,280
- What does Pisces do?

107
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,480
- Yeah, wait, look at-- - Pisces.

108
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,600
- We need to know-- - Pisces are sensitive as hell.

109
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,520
- You think Santa's sensitive?

110
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
- Yep.

111
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,720
- Let's see, what are the Pisces traits?

112
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,120
- What does a Pisces do?

113
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,480
Pisces traits, do we want male or female?

114
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,000
They'll do whatever they can to make sure the people around them are happy. That sounds like Santa Claus to me.

115
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah, people around him in the entire world, he's got a very large radar.

116
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,360
They're also artistic and use their vivid imaginations to think up ideas many others wouldn't.

117
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,600
Flying reindeer, let's go through this. Elves? Flying reindeer, all the presents?

118
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Intuitive, unselfish, yeah, I mean that fucking fits the bill.

119
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,960
Wise, big ol' gray beard, knows just about everything there is to know.

120
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,960
Isn't he a wise man?

121
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,960
Imaginative. Yeah, he came up with every fucking thing about Christmas. I'd call that pretty

122
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,960
imaginative. Compassionate. Even the kids that are bad, he gives them something. Straight

123
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:54,960
coal. Romantic. Restless claws. Adaptable. He can fit through even a small hole or a

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,960
keyhole, we learned from the Santa Claus series. Open-minded. He even gives presents to kids

125
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:07,280
kids who live in a gay lifestyle or a Muslim lifestyle or a

126
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,440
Judaistic lifestyle so that's actually pretty open-minded I would say.

127
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:18,800
Artistic, he does skywriting with the reindeers. He says ho ho ho. He should do

128
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,280
that more. He should do skywriting with the reindeers. He invents toys with the elves too.

129
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:27,480
Yeah it's artistic. It is funny like as a kid when you're supposed to

130
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,240
to believe that like Santa makes every single toy that you get, but it's like,

131
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:35,560
like you think, you think, you think Santa really made a,

132
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,120
you think Santa really thought up of like that Crayola machine,

133
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,880
that Crayola, a crayon maker where you melt all the wax together.

134
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,840
You think Santa came up with that and not the, uh,

135
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,560
the good old minds of the USA.

136
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,560
The elves. Imagine Santa just hammering the no Russian mission into the,

137
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,200
the Xbox 360 copy of modern warfare two,

138
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,080
which he does it all with a little wooden mallet.

139
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:08,080
made

140
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,720
ones I think I don't think he's making no it's done makes them I think maybe a

141
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,240
simple thing he'll make but I don't think he does cheap knockoffs that's why

142
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,760
they all the all the brands hate him yeah yeah and they try to do they try to do

143
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:26,920
like proprietary stuff that Santa can't do like kind of a they have a guided or

144
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,600
a what on earth to tell me pray tell what on earth can't Santa do exactly

145
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,040
that's the problem they're running into is that they're got a toy on Christmas

146
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:43,040
from a video game from Santendo. That's right. That's right. It's like, yeah. It's not very

147
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:50,040
good. Santendo's Turtle Crossing. It's like Animal Crossing but all the animals are turtles.

148
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:58,840
You can't even do your missions fast. You ever get a pair of Jordans on Christmas, right?

149
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,560
You look at the Dunkman logo, no basketball, he's holding mistletoe. That's right. And his

150
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,800
- His penis is out, his cock is out.

151
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,120
- Fuck, man.

152
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,960
- That's nasty.

153
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,160
- Santa stitched a cock into the thing.

154
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,840
- And he stitched cock and balls here

155
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,560
'cause Santa has a good sense of humor.

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,560
- Ew. - Yeah.

157
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,720
- Right, he's around, he's as old as time.

158
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
- Listen to this scenario from this--

159
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,920
- 2,000 years old.

160
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,200
- From this Santa Claus birthday article.

161
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,360
This is the opening of the article I scrolled up and saw.

162
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,560
As your family prepares for Santa Claus' arrival

163
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,600
this Christmas, your children may wanna plan

164
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,720
an extra special menu for the man in red.

165
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,280
After all, he works up an appetite

166
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,680
traveling all around the world.

167
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,720
Maybe they suggest making a plate of Christmas dinner leftovers to keep them

168
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,160
from going to waste, a veggie packed smoothie to give him energy for all his

169
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,640
deliveries, or even a birthday cake to celebrate a special day.

170
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:47,040
If they suggest the latter, however, you'll have to tell them that Saint Nick

171
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:51,320
wasn't born on Christmas, leading them to ask when Santa's birthday is.

172
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,120
Well, I mean, hey, who wants...

173
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,240
you only eat birthday cake once a year? What kind of life is he living?

174
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,280
He's Santa Claus.

175
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,960
never really looking at the other point this is claus's birthday is a cause of

176
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,200
birthday cake and you have to be like

177
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,240
or sorry i really didn't want to talk about that

178
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,400
yeah this is this coming to the race

179
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,960
birthday yet is quite a while after they not saying that we have to have the

180
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,120
talk with the

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,840
they want to get a bit of a break

182
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,680
it

183
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,680
yeah he thinks that santa was born on christmas and not march fifteenth

184
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,280
what i just give him to give him christmas eve let me born on christmas

185
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,600
eve what are we are being so sick we should start we should start celebrating

186
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,920
Santa's birthday. I agree. Two Christmases. That's the day after, that's the day after

187
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,000
Pi Day for any mathematically minded folks out there. Oh my god. Oh my god. Maybe he's

188
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,720
not celebrating it as to not overshadow Pi Day. Well that might be right. So Mrs. Claw's

189
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:57,800
birthday is Christmas. Really? That's what Krukal says. Wow. That's not fair. Well it's

190
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,400
It's not fair to her, her husband's fuckin'-

191
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,080
How do you think they met?

192
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,080
That makes more sense.

193
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,080
Oh, it's probably-

194
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
That makes a lot of sense.

195
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,640
Wait, she says every year for Christmas, she says, "Give my gifts to someone else, I don't

196
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,640
care."

197
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,280
Listen to this passage that's the info box when you google Mrs. Claus' birthday.

198
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,520
December 25th.

199
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:18,680
Mrs. Claus' age is heavily debated, but her birthday is not.

200
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:23,520
According to multiple sources, Mrs. Claus was born on December 25th, i.e. Christmas

201
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
Day.

202
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,320
say this is a coincidence but mystic investigations writes that her birthday

203
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:34,440
meant she was destined to marry santa claus someday did sit did santa claus

204
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,360
well she sent his present every year did santa claus kidnap

205
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:40,240
mrs claus

206
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,560
is she what's always here that's literally the next heading i was about

207
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,960
to read the headings on this website are when is mrs claus birthday

208
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:51,080
and what's the age difference between santa claus and mrs claus

209
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,040
there's two possible there's two possible answers here according to them

210
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:59,680
like to know both. Alright the first one is 611 years. That's too big of an age gap. I'll

211
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:06,680
say it, that's too big of an age gap. The second one is 1521. That's even worse I would

212
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:13,680
argue. That's even worse. Get this, when she was in high school, right, he could have been

213
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:22,320
628 years old. Isn't that disgusting? That's not right. That's true. Come on. That is just

214
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,800
not right. Well she's in high school. She wasn't even born yet at his at his

215
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,920
thousandth birthday. Maybe, we don't know. You know what you know what you know one

216
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,880
of the craziest thing is? Santa probably delivered her a present once. I've never

217
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:41,720
I've never found myself. I've never found myself wanting to there to be a

218
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:46,040
600 year age gap just because the 1,000 year age gap is just almost too much to

219
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:51,760
fathom. Mm-hmm. Right? And I do and it is kind of upsetting that maybe maybe 18

220
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,660
years in a row he was delivering her presents being like oh my here it is

221
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,760
hey here's lipstick another more lipstick for Christmas here you go here's a

222
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:05,520
here's a Santa Santa style bikini here's a Santa is a Santa Claus calendar it's

223
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:12,480
got sure to me on it I clicked on the source they cited hey birthday she gets

224
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:19,200
Santa's phone number and a six-week birth control.

225
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:27,060
Yeah. Santa wouldn't do that. That's really not right. But he actually did do that.

226
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:32,580
I mean if he did that a year before that would be weird. Maybe they met on an app.

227
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:37,520
I don't think there was an app. Maybe they met on an app and then

228
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,520
and Mrs. Claus is like, "Oh my God, I was like, I knew you,

229
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:45,380
but like, that's insane."

230
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:47,520
- Mrs. Claus has been around for quite a long time.

231
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,520
So it's definitely possible that she was maybe,

232
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,900
she was maybe like a slave or like a really,

233
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,460
like a peasant or something.

234
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,300
- Yeah.

235
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,700
- And he rescued her, you know, I don't know.

236
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,740
- Yeah.

237
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,740
- I mean, is there any, is there anything about how they met?

238
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:10,660
Let's see, there's a lot of information available about the Claus family, but some of it is

239
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,460
conflicting.

240
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,380
So I click here on the source they use for a lot of this information, which is called

241
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,060
mysticinvestigations.com.

242
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:31,660
And you think it might be a paranormal investigation thing, but it's actually, it's Mystic Christmas

243
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,660
blog the bewitching blog of Christmas.

244
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,660
Might as well, they're getting a little

245
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,660
confused, they're crossing holiday wires

246
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,660
there.

247
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,660
"Mrs. Holly Claus was born on Christmas

248
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,660
day by the sheer fate of her future destiny

249
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,660
as the demi-angel Santa Claus's wife."

250
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Really? She's a demi-angel?

251
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,660
No, no, Santa's a demi-angel.

252
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:54,660
"Holly's father, Daniel McBride."

253
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
*laughter*

254
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
Wait, what?

255
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,660
What the fuck?

256
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,660
*laughter*

257
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,660
What?

258
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,660
*laughter*

259
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,660
Daniel McBride?

260
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,660
Her dad is

261
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,660
Daniel McBride?

262
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,660
Was an Irish immigrant and young architect who

263
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,660
aided in the construction of the United States

264
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,660
Capitol. Wow!

265
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Oh, so Santa Claus wants to date my daughter,

266
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
okay. She was born in

267
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:28,980
1792 Holly has no siblings because doctors told her mother that further

268
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:34,660
pregnancies could pose a risk to her health in 1792. They told her that Wow

269
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:41,340
they're about ahead of curve the age difference Mrs. Claus is currently 229

270
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,380
years of age but doesn't look a day over 60. She married Santa Claus at the age

271
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:48,820
age of twenty two on Valentine's Day, February Fourteen, eighteen

272
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,020
fifties when he was a thousand five hundred and forty five

273
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,060
years old.

274
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:59,160
The age difference isn't that shocking when you consider that

275
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,180
their soul mates.

276
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,840
That's true.

277
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,780
Does it say anything about Cupid being at the wedding?

278
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,540
No, you have to assume he was though.

279
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,260
I mean, yeah, I would think it would be all elves.

280
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,700
I don't think the reindeer's know.

281
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:19,700
think the rangers have any any idea what they're doing I think they just run yeah

282
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:26,820
like camels yeah the reindeers don't have the soul no yeah do you think we're

283
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:31,340
thinking st. Valentine's Day begins in the metaphysical mind of the omniverse

284
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:38,020

289
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,980
This is the author is Xavier...

290
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,980
The unholy union of demons and dark goddesses.

291
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,980
Xavier Remington.

292
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,980
As the founder and president of Mystic Investigations,

293
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,980
I have dealt with all manner of metaphysical mayhem.

294
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,980
However, the supernatural beings and paranormal phenomenon of the Christmas season are some of the most magical.

295
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,980
Our supernatural crime-fighting team has had the honor of being welcome at the...

296
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,980
Crime-fighting?

297
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,980
...devi-angel Santa Claus's North Pole City,

298
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:27,980
and the horror of battling the diabolical Anti-Claus.

299
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,980
Anti-Claus?!

300
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:34,980
Wait, hold up. This Xmas blog was born out of my own interest.

301
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,980
Wow, look at this fucking photo of the Anticlaws.

302
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,980
Merry Christmas to all. Holy shit.

303
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
And to all a safe night.

304
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:43,980
And his most recent, he's still posting.

305
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
Christmas is July.

306
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,980
I think there's a holiday episode now.

307
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,980
I think I have to do a deep dive into Mystic of Mystics.

308
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,980
I can't believe it. Santa Claus vs. Dracula.

309
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:58,260
It was the Christmas Eve of 1888 when Santa Claus found himself delivering gifts to the

310
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,740
good little boys and girls of Transylvania, Romania.

311
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:05,580
Santa landed his sleigh upon the roof of a modest home with smoke billowing from the

312
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,740
chimney at the witching hour.

313
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:13,460
He teleported down right into the flames of the hearth that kept the home warm on this

314
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,140
specially chilly night.

315
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:17,140
Dude, he fought...

316
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,180
See also, Santa Claus the Vampire Sleigh.

317
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,180
Oh my god.

318
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,900
There's hundreds of posts on this website.

319
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,740
- Hold on, hold on.

320
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,220
- Yeah, no, go ahead, Pat.

321
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,500
- I just, I don't know if we're about to say the same thing.

322
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,900
I just want to say the sections at the top

323
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,460
of this website here are home page, home,

324
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:37,020
paranormal Q&A, supernatural stories,

325
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:42,020
Christmas blog, Halloween blog, paranormal forecast,

326
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:47,020
paranormal news, time travel, and private investigate.

327
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,740
And when you click on private investigate,

328
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,320
there are three different tabs.

329
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,220
The first one brings you to a website called free background

330
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:59,720
check.org then reverse phone search and reverse email search.

331
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,820
Dude, this is the best website I've ever fucking seen.

332
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:07,920
When you hover over Halloween blog, the three options are

333
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,420
Halloween spirit, Halloween beings and Halloween Queen

334
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:14,720
Shala. And I clicked on Halloween Queen Shala and it took

335
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,620
me to a news article on their site called, "Who is the leader

336
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
of Halloween.

337
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:24,980
The headline is "The Angel-Demon Hybrid Shala Revealed to be Secretive Queen of Halloween."

338
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,940
Okay, okay.

339
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,140
This brought us to a new Halloween mystic blog.

340
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
Oh my god.

341
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:38,320
Antichrist invaded Halloween Island.

342
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
Are you fucking serious?

343
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,320
I'm completely serious.

344
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,320
That's crazy.

345
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:45,360
Let me just read the top here.

346
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:53,600
sections of the website are home, hallow Q&A, Halloween legend, Halloween beings, shop,

347
00:17:53,600 --> 00:18:01,520

348
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:09,800
DVDs and mp3s of spooky sounds and Halloween music. It has a it says gift

349
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:13,560
shopping and there's four things silly stocking stuffers, Christmas costumes,

350
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:18,520
ugly christmas sweater and candy and when you click candy it just searches on amazon for you

351
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,720
yeah i was just about to say when you click devilish dvds it brings you to an amazon link for

352
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:31,480
horror movie dvd listen i'm gonna read this paragraph to you about the plan of um of

353
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,200
anti-claws because i think you guys might find this a little fascinating on what anti-claws was trying

354
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:43,320
to do uh-huh unfortunately the devilish dark claws lucked out and found her hidden hat halloween hide

355
00:18:43,320 --> 00:19:12,920
You would have to assume.

356
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,420
yet he would have a jewelry demon

357
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:19,460
uh... my god i i did find all that there's a recent post

358
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,720
i'm looking at a recent post here

359
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,400
on the halloween blog

360
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,200
the office of jim the vampire

361
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,900
no way

362
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,560
what's what does that say

363
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,160
in an episode of n_b_c_'s the office title business school that flies out of

364
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,660
the office scaring everyone

365
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:36,960
to white shirt is on the hunt for it amid jim helper making him believe he

366
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,360
was bitten by the bat

367
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,920
the intent was to trick to a into thinking he was turning into a vampire

368
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:52,920
If this was real, it would need to be a vampire bat, in which case, Jim would have faced a long-lived, yet not immortal future as a Nosferatu variety of vampire.

369
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:59,920
They are hideously monstrous beasts who can never blend into society, unlike the beautiful vampires who ascend from royal vampire lines.

370
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Those type of vampires don't come from bat bites, but rather a bite from another vampire.

371
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:14,920
So this is just correcting BJ Novak and what's his name, the guy who plays Toby on their vampire

372
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
lore.

373
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,480
I have a very important, okay guys I have a project for us, okay?

374
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Okay.

375
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,640
I think we need to work on it, okay?

376
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,800
We've never been nominated for any kind of award, have we?

377
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
No.

378
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
No.

379
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
But would you guys want one?

380
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
I would love one.

381
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,520
And who needs, I don't need a Grammy, I don't need an EGOT, right?

382
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,320
I'd like one. I don't need it. Okay. I think that I need a

383
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,620

the scourge of paranormal evil.

The Claus Award was conceived by Santa Claus to encourage and motivate people to protect

394
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,540

2018 won by Patriot woman who is a superhero in New York City

422
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:10,460
I'm looking here on the time trap the mystic investigations time traveler section and there's a

423
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,520
Thing here for the top 10 posts

424
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:17,640
ever made by the time traveling blog, uh-huh and

425
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:29,040
Here's one here the future world of Tomorrowland as an Amazon associate we earn qualify if we earn from qualifying purchases

426
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:32,180
Disney's Tomorrowland the

427
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:40,040
The fantastical utopian city is seen in Disney's Tomorrowland film won't exist in reality anytime soon. No

428
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:43,640
That's horrible. Um, I

429
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:52,360
Have this you know Caleb mentioned briefly the this this school that I think I'm a little interested in and maybe we could try

430
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,880
And figure out how to get a tab at school

431
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,880
Yeah, cuz I found this they have a link to this at the bottom of the mystic investigations

432
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,400
And that's it's a separate website for the McTavish International Academy of Magical Sciences

433
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,920
which it says here is the world's premier magic school, but there isn't much on the website.

434
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:13,360
It seems like you need a it says welcome professors and students to log into your magic school account.

435
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:18,560
Please send forth your unique cyber spelled incantation to those not a part of the supernatural

436
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,080
world who found this site. Please keep in mind you will only see only what we want you to see

437
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,640
and what and there's not much on there. So I think what they want us to see is they do have the list

438
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:32,320
of their graduation commencement speakers. Okay, who do they have? The grand graduation

439
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,560
commencement speakers of the McTavish International Academy of Magical Sciences who address

440
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:40,960
all classes from elementary to university level. The speech is generally followed by a dazzling

441
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,960
fireworks display as the students head off to summer vacation. Now I'll go, they've only,

442
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,120
it's only been around for three years so I'm going to go from most recent backwards. So 2022

443
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,680
was alchemist Edelweiss Wu from China speaks of his work melding magic and science into one

444
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:58,720
unenchanted entity for the betterment of humankind. That's

445
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,740
why huge that's big yeah.

446
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,040
Twenty twenty one it was sorceress supreme Elvira winter

447
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:07,840
of the seminary of supreme sorcery hidden in the German

448
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,840
black forest. The top female magician on earth who used to

449
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,060
who used to serve the forces of darkness. Thankfully, she saw

450
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:18,060
the light and now fights for all that it's right. That's good.

451
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,740
That is good. That's a big turn around. I mean I would be kind

452
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,960
of pissed off if I got either of these two when I see who the

453
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,620
first commencement speaker was in 2020. Okay. You guys ready for this? I'm ready.

454
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,740
St. Nicholas of North Pole City, who is better known as Santa Claus, the world's

455
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:40,100
only demi-angel and de facto leader of all good things on earth. Yeah, I mean, of

456
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:44,660
course you'd be fucking pissed off. I think there's a lot on

457
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:51,180
this website here. I'm looking, I'm on the, I think that if we separate the

458
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:56,340
the way that we look at the website in a in a thirds right like one of us gets

459
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,860
Halloween I'm looking at time travel and then one of us looks at Christmas I

460
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:04,140
think we can cover a lot of ground I just clicked on the the link the name Santa

461
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,860
Claus was linked on the the magical Academy website and I clicked on it it

462
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,060

463
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,060
Christmas and I'll just read you the first sentence here which I think speaks

464
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:20,460
volumes about how important Christmas is Christmas is the antithesis of Halloween

465
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,460

It's, let's see, the 13 nights of dark Christmas

472
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,460

475
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:42,460

Yeah. This is the intro page.

Basement, the McTavish Prison for the Criminally Insane.

487

00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,340
It's 13 nights.

492
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,740
It's December 21st to January 2nd.

493
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,980
They get more, Dark Christmas gets more.

494
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,260
Christmas gets more.

495
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:43,760
Okay.

McTavish Prison for the Criminally Insane.

497
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,860
Ian McTavish has one of the oldest known paranormal prisons on Earth.

498
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:52,460
We know it as the McTavish Maximum Security Prison for the Criminally Insane.

499
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:57,420
The maximum security part was added in the mid-20th century to let everyone know his prison meant business.

500
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,420
It's housed in deep sub-basement caverns of the school.

501
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:05,460
More seasoned students enjoy scaring new ones by taking them down there to view the monsters in the cells.

502
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:08,060
There's also that rumored entrance to the underworld.

503
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:12,040
The students are perfectly safe as the cells are supernaturally sealed shut by magic and

504
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,040
the like.

505
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:15,880
School above, there is a powerful spell that prevents harm to anyone.

506
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:20,020
Criminals of sound sentient mind are given a trial based on Magna Carta law.

507
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:25,520
They can be found not guilty or receive set sentences that allow for release upon competition.

508
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:29,080
I don't know why it says competition.

509
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,560
I think it means competition.

510
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,000
I think it means that you have to compete for your freedom.

511
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
That was accurate.

512
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,120
"Hospitalization takes place via paranormal psychologists and even students at the school

513
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,880
studying the supernatural mind.

514
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,760
Probation sometimes entails working at the school in a useful capacity before final release

515
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,400
into the human world.

516
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,200
Some have even been known to stay with the school for the rest of their days."

517
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,600
So there's a school and then there's a full prison underneath.

518
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Wow.

519
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,960
That has all kinds of devilishly evil monsters just banging on supernatural cages.

520
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,000
That's easy because if someone tries to shoot up the school they can just throw them in

521
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
the basement.

522
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,640
I mean, and they gotta be scared of the sorcerer Ian McTavish, a tall, muscular, commanding

523
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,200
figure standing at 6'5" in height.

524
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,240
Even without magic, he would be quite capable of taking down multiple adversaries via his

525
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,640
raw power and immense fighting skills.

526
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:22,560
He has emerald green eyes that almost seem to glow with power, and often blatantly do

527
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:27,480
because of the massive metaphysical energies surging through his body and soul.

528
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,080
I have to figure out how to make this work since we're recording remotely, but

529
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:40,120
the anti-clause page on here is huge. It's gigantic.

530
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:45,120
I mean, all of these are probably 10,000 words each.

531
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,320
Yeah, I'm looking at an article here.

532
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,320
I know. I'm telling you something important here.

533
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,360
I'm at the bottom of the anti-clause page and they have a link.

534
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:59,360

Oh my God, I'm fucking that was that was the voice of the anti Claus.

550
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,640
Here's the voice of Santa Claus.

00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,240
Oh, Merry Christmas.

552
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,640
Okay,

553
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:40,440
this is still laugh.

554
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:45,640
Yes, okay, here we go.

555
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,340
there is

556
00:31:46,340 --> 00:32:02,140
another sound. They posted called scared elf

557
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:09,340
wait

558
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:13,840
dude. There's a santa's elf. There's another light to land at

559
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:20,840
There's a seat in the connection of the National Airport authorizing your landing at runway

560
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
11.

561
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
He's directing that.

562
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,840
That's Santa's elf directing flight to land at North Pole.

563
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,840
Guys, I may have found a...

564
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,840
What is it?

565
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,840
I may have found the most important one yet.

566
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
What is it?

567
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:45,720
So I picked out, I don't even remember which website it was, I clicked on a subheading

568
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:49,760
that was called "Godhoodism" and I clicked on it.

569
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,360
It's a website called godhoodism.com.

570
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,360
Godhoodism, the godhood ascension religion.

571
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
Oh my god, yeah, I'm here now.

572
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,480
Be your own lord and savior, attain godhood, amen.

573
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,560
And here are the headings on this website.

574
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,680
Home blog, godhood definitions, pole, universal structure, pure thought power, quantum mind

575
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:13,000
Mind power, existence cycles, godhood observations, supernatural beings, civilization types, higher

576
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,320
dimensions, related sites, binaural beings.

577
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,440
This website's fucking crazy.

578
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,880
Oh my god.

579
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,680
I can't believe this, dude.

580
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:29,240
I'm on the Mystic Investigations Facebook page here.

581
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,480
I'm trying to find...

582
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,480
I feel like we need to stay on godhood.

583
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
This is a really...

584
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,600
- No, no, no, definitely go look through godhoodism,

585
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,480
but I'm just saying, I'm just looking through here

586
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,600
to see what kind of stuff.

587
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,080
- So what if I'm evil?

588
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,280
- Who follows it and who hosts here?

589
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:47,480
- We go on the assumption that only reasonably decent people

590
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,240
become gods and that the almighty of all the universes

591
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,460
is the same, so it's a fair bet that if you're evil

592
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,440
and you die, then you're really dead.

593
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,080
You simply don't exist ever again.

594
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,960
We don't believe in hell because there is no crime

595
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,060
that fits such a punishment.

596
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,800
The existence of such a place implies a sadistic nature,

597
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,760
which would be an evil trait for a god.

598
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,560
The removal of your evil waste of space from our reality is justice and punishment enough.

599
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:13,600
In all fairness, however, even if you're evil in this reality, you might still end

600
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,480
up being good in the majority of parallel universes.

601
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,000
Although we believe that those who commit horrific acts in one reality are most likely

602
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,400
evil in the majority of others, this is due to the power of your spirit overriding the

603
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,920
other two factor that govern your life, environment and genetics.

604
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,480
If your spirit is good, you simply can't commit a horrific acts of evil.

605
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,480
This is crazy.

606
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,480
Wow.

607
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,560
Dude, this website is...

608
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:42,200
I'm looking at the community for Mystic Investigations Facebook and I'm looking at a post here from

609
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,440
Ruben Munoz Medina who asks, "What would happen if by some reason a vampire was executed in

610
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,520
the electric chair?

611
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,160
Would he survive or die?"

612
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,120
That's a very good question.

613
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,120
Dude, this is...

614
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,880
And Mystic Investigation answers almost immediately and says, "Being electrocuted wouldn't harm

615
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:05,560
a vampire at all would actually make their dead heart pump during the

616
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:09,520
electrical surge and they'd feel a rush similar to consuming a large amount of

617
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,200
blood like the lethal injection a smart vampire would play dead and escape from

618
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:18,520
the morgue later on I cannot believe we went from Santa to godhood is a dude

619
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,120
here the other question here's a god and if they do here is the title of a blog

620
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,760
post on godhood ism is unfortunately all children die and then there's a picture

621
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:35,000
of a cute baby. Here's more of the FAQ. Is God evil? Do aliens exist and do they

622
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,900
become gods? Do I have a soulmate? I have a big ego or I like riddles. That could

623
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:44,760
mean anything. So can I create a religion for my people? Can I not just hide and be

624
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,160
with my people? Can I create magical realities where supernatural beings

625
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,600
really exist? So the answer to this is knock yourself out, create magic,

626
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,800
fairies, genies, vampires, werewolves, Santa Claus, and leprechauns as well while

627
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,420
you're at it. So won't being God get boring eventually? Why does God allow bad

628
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:03,540
things to happen? Do you have a holy book? Do you have church service? And do you

629
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,480
accept donations? And they say no. So this is a religion that

630
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,920
basically says that you are God or you can become a God at the very least.

631
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,520
There's stuff about quantum jumping and like... Yeah I just tried to... they have a

632
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,300
poll on their website which is a... you can vote in a poll and give you give them an

633
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:28,580
opinion on their religion and I tried to vote that yes it's the perfect religion

634
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:32,940
that makes sense and I got an alert from Google that says this information you're

635
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,020
about to submit is not secure. So we have we have all the I'm scrolling through

636
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:41,060
all these blog posts we have all this stuff about like how to quantum jump you

637
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:45,260
know how to ascend to godhood what is the root of all mental illness and then we

638
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,540
got another post right here that I'm seeing it says Dr. Benjamin S Carson

639
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:55,500
speaks common sense at national prayer breakfast that's yes

640
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,380
various ideals that flew in the face of president obama's agenda eight

641
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:04,260
they said they want that one of the authors on god is it is just named god

642
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:07,460
well the from guiding shit here

643
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,540
he i'm looking at uh... some visitors posts on the on the mystic investigations

644
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,660
page still

645
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,700
lot of pictures from one guy

646
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,900
but also

647
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:21,060
Obina Nuasu asks a lot of things.

648
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:24,020
"How do you access the pure thought foundation of reality?

649
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,400
"What powers do travelers possess?

650
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,120
"Is Azazel an actual demon or an archdemon?

651
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:31,440
"What are the powers of Slender Man?"

652
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,280
- Slender Man's in on this? (laughing)

653
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,400
Oh wait, I opened a tab and I forgot about it.

654
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,920
- Here's one more. - Hold up, hold up.

655
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:42,480
- Here's one from Obina again, I'll read this last one.

656
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,960
"Has anyone ever heard of the anti-Halloween spirit?

657
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,100
I got psychic echo that sort of told me about it.

658
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,760
I want here I'm going to send you guys this link because I think this is a page that we

659
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,440
all need to be looking at on mystic investigations.

660
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:55,800
I forgot to bring up before this is a list.

661
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,360
Every episode of the podcast is about this now.

662
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,800
This is this is this is honestly I can't.

663
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:05,720
This is this is a mystic investigations.

664
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,280
This is their their encyclopedia.

665
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,640
This is the known list of supernatural beings and they have categories here.

666
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:15,640
Halloween beings, Christmas beings, horror legends, superheroes, super villains,

667
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:21,640
righteous royalty, dark royalty, and here I'll just read the A section

668
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,640
because this will give you an idea of what we're working with here, okay?

669
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,640
There's so many of them, we can't go through all of them, but here we go.

670
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,640
I just want to note on every single page on Mystic Investigations,

671
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,640
there is a disclaimer or I don't know what to call it,

672
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,700
every single title of every single web

673
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,820
page it says as an Amazon associate we

674
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,840
earn from qualifying purchase that's

675
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,960
good that's just good practice yeah

676
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,120
yeah I'm gonna read a and B here cuz I

677
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,440
think this is a perfect lineup of

678
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,560
supernatural beings I'll just run

679
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,920
through a lightning-round style

680
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,560
abominable snowman adirondack

681
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,840
abomination Amazon's angel in angels

682
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,480
guardian angels angel demon hybrid angel

683
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,840
goddess hybrid Antichrist anti-claws

684
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:14,360
was April antifool April fool our arch vampires Arctic abomination Asian

685
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:20,240
sprites or I rinse nymphs autumn nymphs baby new year baby spring Bigfoot

686
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,320
black stick Ben Slenderman assassin blue lady boar hog Moosey sin blob monster

687
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,600
bloodbather and bogeyman there's an antifool there's an April I had no

688
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,540
fucking clue single name, every single name I'm reading is like a link by the

689
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,100
way, like everything is like a piney associate me about the antisocial many

690
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,960
paragraphs. I didn't know that was a fool in the April antifool warning April

691
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:48,680
second is anti April fools day and with it comes the evil mischief of the April

692
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:52,680
antico aka the chief nemesis of the April fool who blesses us with

693
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:57,780
humiliating, yes, hum let yet humorously harmless hijinks on April fools day. All

694
00:39:57,780 --> 00:40:00,720
of the two are enemies. They are temporarily separated in a four

695
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:04,940
manner confined to their respective days which from their perspective last one

696
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,800
whole year. Unlike the April Fool, the Anti-Fool can be very dangerous in

697
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,740
nature and his so-called pranks can be extremely dangerous and diabolical. The

698
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,500
Anti-Fool has equivalent magical powers including mind control and enhanced

699
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,300
superhuman abilities like the Fool. The Anti-Fool wears a black and white

700
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,020
jester's costume complete with magical scepter that has a skull at the top. He

701
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,700
also wears a skull mask to hide his identity along with being an

702
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,420
intimidation tool. Unlike the Fool whose powers are truly imbued within him, the

703
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,900
antifool derives his powers from his scepter so taking it away we'll turn him

704
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:42,180
into a normal evil human dude I had no fucking clue there was an antifool or a

705
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:46,100
fool and in contrast to the April Fool who is powered by the Norse trickster

706
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:51,300
God Loki we have no clue where the antifool came from I'm looking here at

707
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:56,220
a there's a section at the top of the page for omniverse personifiers mm-hmm

708
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:59,980
And there's obviously, you know, like light, darkness,

709
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:01,180
There's a dark Cupid.

710
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:05,980
Light, darkness, life, death, karma, fate, destiny, that's all one thing.

711
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,380
Love, luck, fortune, chance, all one section.

712
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:13,580
Hate, the four horsemen, the sandman, and Jack Frost.

713
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:17,900
Jack Frost. We need to defeat Jack Cross.

714
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,300
Jack Frost.

715
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:25,420
There's an evil version of Valentine's Day. There's an anti-every fucking holiday.

716
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:30,220
Yeah. I cannot believe this. Did you know Baby New Year and Father Time are the same guy?

717
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:37,260
Why do they not teach you any of this in school? I know. This is way more important than like...

718
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:40,060
I honestly just can't fucking believe it. So I guess there's a difference between an

719
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:45,020
Easter Bunny and an Easter Spirit as well, I'm seeing here.

720
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:52,060
There's also... What the fuck? Frankensteins, Friday 13th Demon Specter, Frosty the Snowman,

721
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,260
fuzzy monsters gargoyles and gargoyle mancers.

722
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:59,560
Yo, the Grinch is real.

723
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,260
The Grinch is real.

724
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
Is there an anti-Grinch?

725
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,160
Is the Grinch real?

726
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:05,760
Yes, would you believe the Grinch is a real supernatural being?

727
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:09,160
However, his story was greatly simplified by the infamous author,

728
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,360
Dr. Seuss.

729
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,460
The infamous Dr. Seuss.

730
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,560
In reality, the Green Grinch was a gnome helper of the Anticlaws.

731
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,360
Really?

732
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,120
so you're not going to do that is specifically said the green grants to

733
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,920
to say anything about roast beast juries and i'm rich

734
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,060
control f roast beast here

735
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:34,720
now i'm not seeing anything let me see the comments who bill that to find out

736
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,640
that that's made up this kind of a

737
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,680
i mean i think it was i think it's doctor seuss is fault i mean that guys

738
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,340
totally wackadoodle

739
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:45,140
the future foretold from galaxy fleet well here we go nation

740
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,000
i here's what happened with his a really happen with the grinch

741
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,320
The infamous aforementioned anti-Klaus coup attempt by the Grinch took place in December of 1952.

742
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:59,040
Dr. Seuss knew of the story since he had been lucky enough to visit Santa's North Pole City in that same year.

743
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,160
It seems Seuss had been secretly abducted by aliens and taken to a planet similar to what he eventually described

744
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:07,760
to an extent in 1971's The Lorax.

745
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:13,760
A number of his crazy characters and silly stories came from his short time on the unknown extraterrestrial planet.

746
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,520
He also had disturbing visions of a second alien abduction.

747
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,600
The E.T.'s brought him back with other brainwashed abductees as a part of a

748
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,080
master plan to conquer Earth.

749
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,360
Santa Claus intervened when he happened upon the extraterrestrial vessel.

750
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,600
Not only did he save Dr. Seuss, but the entire planet as well, by sending the

751
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,920
aliens back through an intergalactic super cluster portal

752
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,400
that transported them here.

753
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:39,240
And they destroyed the technology to create portals on their home world. That's huge.

754
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:44,240
So Godheadism has a shop page, but it's completely empty. There's nothing there.

755
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:48,000
That's good. It's about advancing yourself, not spending money.

756
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,960
Oh, that's kind of on the verge.

757
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,880
So I was going down the list of known monsters.

758
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,000
And there's one in the T section.

759
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,320
And these all have to be made by the same guy also, right?

760
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,800
It's Xavier Remington.

761
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,360
This is the stool.

762
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,600
What is the stool?

763
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:13,040
We hesitate to even mention this particular paranormal phenomenon

764
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:16,600
since it's by far the most disgusting we've ever come across.

765
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,840
It is an excremental entity known as the stool.

766
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,080
The creature of crap is caused by all manner of fecal matter, randomly coalescing into

767
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,160
a sentient blob.

768
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:31,720
Although a rare event is clearly a health hazard that the government often deals with

769
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,980
and covers up in the media as well.

770
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:38,760
If the stool is left unchecked, it will grow into the giant pile of poop as seen in photos

771
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,760
on this page.

772
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,440
The stench is unbearable to the point of causing mass barfing episodes, even among those with

773
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,220
protective masks on.

774
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:52,760
The high levels of methane it gives off drive away oxygen, therefore causing asphyxiation

775
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,440
in humans and other creatures.

776
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:59,280
This is often a concern in sewers, which is the place this despicable entity forms the

777
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,280
most.

778
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:01,280
Wow.

779
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,360
Did you know there's such a thing as human-leprechaun hybrids?

780
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,520
Yes, you're looking at one.

781
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,360
I know, I have it paged up right here.

782
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
It sounds very similar.

783
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:17,600
It says, "Whoa, apparently Keanu Reeves is one."

784
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:18,600
What?

785
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:19,600
That makes sense.

786
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,560
That's what it says here.

787
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,720
Oh my God, dude.

788
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:32,040
I'm finding Xavier Remington clearly has a bunch of different Twitter accounts.

789
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:42,040
He has one at Santa Claus at North underscore Pole underscore City where he's saying, "Why

790
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,320
on earth has @readersgazette blocked Santa Claus?

791
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:51,560
I will have to tell my friends at Metaphysical Private Investigations about this injustice."

792
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
[laughter]

793
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:58,120
"Supernatural Investigations Firm fighting paranormal forces of darkness in a metaphysical

794
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:00,480
quest for justice."

795
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,920
Are there any zombies at North Pole City?

796
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:11,220
What is a reverse ghost?

797
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:14,320
Is Chucky the Child's Play doll real?

798
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:20,600
I did see they say that Jason Voorhees is real.

799
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,320
And then the first thing is Jabba's.

800
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:26,480
What are supernatural Jabbas?

801
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:34,120
the superhuman jackpot with a ground zero nuclear blast wait what

802
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,720
Pat's shit froze up Oh he's completely gone dude they're trying to shut us down

00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:44,840

804

806
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,000
I won't be silenced.

807
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:01,380
I tried to talk about a Jabba and I got completely silenced.

808
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:02,380
I know.

809
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,600
It's fucking crazy.

810
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:07,000
Who is the plague doctor?

811
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,000
Oh my god.

812
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,000
Tooth Fairy Laws.

813
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,880
Jabba's are paranormal monsters named after the infamous Star Wars character Jabba the

814
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:14,880
Hut.

815
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,480
These are relatively new cryptids that first began to appear in the 50s and were merely

816
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,160
classified as large-scale cannibalistic shapeshifters for a time until given the

817
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,520
name Jabba in the mid 80s. Wait so there's Christ, there's an

818
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:35,080
Antichrist and then there's also a neutral Christ. Will there be a neutral

819
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:38,700
Christ upon our earth? Yes indeed the Vatican and other Christian religious

820
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,080
authorities have suppressed a missing biblical chapter called the destiny of

821
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,720
mankind that would have told the tale of the so-called neutral Christ would have

822
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:51,480
saved humankind from a damned ending in Armageddon, while ushering in an eternity of enlightenment

823
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,480
for humankind.

824
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,640
Interestingly, it is also written that the Neutral Christ will be the Judas of the Antichrist.

825
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:02,080
We know that the Antichrist was born in spring of 2015, but no word yet on whether the Neutral

826
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,120
Christ has been born or already exists.

827
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:10,120
I'm reading that, I'm reading that, the Antichrist's birth during the spring solar eclipse of 20...

828
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,120
Bro, what are we doing? He's 77 years old!

829
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:20,120
Ever since the first battle of Armageddon on Halloween 2013, the devil has been on Earth in biological form,

830
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:24,120
ousted from Hell by the diabolical sorcerer, Timitri Diablo.

831
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:33,120
I did read about the first battle of Armageddon. According to Xavier, it took place in Kazakhstan.

832
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:38,920
2013 wow I like this website is so

care about kids Wow and that's really

842
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:02,240
good news to hear at least dig for a

843
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,240
The greatest sorcerer known to fight against evil, Ian McTavish, there he is again 6'5" by the way,

844
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:12,240
led the charge to neutralize what turned out to be a cloaking spell as the Halloween Witching Hour approached.

845
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,240
This is all the Battle of Armageddon from 2013.

846
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:17,240
The- oh, I mean here he is.

847
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:24,240
The Great Claws immediately whisked the innocent human sacrifices away into his holy portal powered by the Star of Bethlehem.

848
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:27,240
Wow, dude, everybody was here.

849
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:33,280
Claws, anti-claws, Xavier Remington, oh my god, Mystic Investigations, Xavier Remington wielding

850
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:38,640
the Sword of Judgment let forth a battle cry as he came at the anti-claws which forced him

851
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:41,920
to remove the flaming sword from Santa's heart.

852
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:47,600
Santa was clearly weakened and stumbled into his portal which promptly closed.

853
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:52,240
Remington, a human, valiantly engaged in an epic sword fight with the demi-demon claws

854
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,400
but the supernatural being was quite powerful.

855
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Oh my fucking god dude.

856
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:00,400
Xavier saved the world.

857
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Now I get why he got so many awards.

858
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,400
Of course, yeah.

859
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,400
He got his first one in 2013.

860
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,400
Oh my god.

861
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:08,400
That makes perfect sense.

862
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,400
Of course.

863
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,400
And then he got his lifetime achievement in 2015 and got another one in 2017.

864
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:14,400
I found the first article on here.

865
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,400
Wait, wait, guys, guys.

866
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,400
Did Xavier Remington have a kid in 2015?

867
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:23,400
I don't, I mean, does it say that?

868
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,680
that. I mean I do some research. I have to do I have to sorry I got so

869
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,500
distracted. I have to do more research.

870
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,000
He was definitely birthed during the first battle of Armageddon. I found the

871
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,800
first article on this website that I found so far where the answer to is this

872
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:39,000
real is no.

873
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:43,400
You want to know what it is? Yeah, what is it are the Twilight vampires real?

874
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:46,700
Thank God the Twilight vampires are not real.

875
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:53,300
But it says that if they were real, they will be fairy vampires, not normal

876
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:00,520
vampires of course yeah I mean there is so many is the chicken nuggets werewolf

877
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:07,040
what the king of God's zoo saves a woman by nearly striking her with lightning

878
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,420
Christian Bale thanks the devil who made him famous what holy shit the real

879
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:18,460
Freddy Krueger was a man named Sylvester Hawthorne however I have to see

880
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:21,980
nightmare on Elm Street movie debuted Hawthorne decided to rename himself

881
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:24,100
himself, Freddy Krueger.

882
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,100
I have to see the Chicken Nuggets Werewolf.

883
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,700
Yeah, what's the Chicken Nuggets Werewolf?

884
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,020
What's the Chicken Nuggets Werewolf?

885
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:33,620
It's a video of a person who looked like a werewolf, I guess.

886
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:38,740
Werewolf exposed, alcohol intoxication used to cover up the werewolf, and then the brave

887
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:40,520
member of the paranormal community.

888
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,460
This wacky woman was known to be a member of a werewolf pack who taught her how to control

889
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:48,460
herself, yet she was still a novice and gave in to her demonic DNA rather than letting

890
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:51,300
the righteousness of the Yule Moon guide her.

891
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,400
werewolves face fighting the urges of this DNA while in human form at present

892
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,280
she has mellowed and accepted the responsibility of the power she wields

893
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,500
she works bravely with the supernatural community to fight the forces of

894
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,680
darkness while saving many innocent lives don't judge her by this one

895
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:11,800
incident so she attacked a McDonald's worker because of the chicken nuggets

896
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:17,280
this one is actually kind of this one's scary I love this they're all scary this

897
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,580
This I mean a lot this one this is the scariest one. I think who is the blood

898
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:27,080
bather the blood is a monstrous immortal shapeshifter killing machine composed of

899
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,380
the blood of virtually every species on Earth. It is the physical

900
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:34,480
personification of blood in our world blood representing both the gift of life

901
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,080
and the loss of death loss of death the blood bather rose from the spilled blood

902
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:42,880
of mass extinction two hundred and fifty two point two eight million years ago

903
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,240
during the Permian Triassic extinction event.

904
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:49,080
- This is crazy. - Wow.

905
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,680
- The bloodbather is the first and only of its kind.

906
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:56,200
The master shapeshifter of molded blood.

907
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,960
- There's so many categories. - It's invincible.

908
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,480
Oh, and it was last seen in Florida.

909
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,480
- No way.

910
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:02,320
- Please no.

911
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,960
- They have an MP3 recording of it.

912
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:05,960
- I need to hear it.

913
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:07,120
- This one's not on SoundCloud,

914
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:09,120
so I can't play it from my phone.

915
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,200
- Send it, send it to me.

916
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:18,200
Oh, it's scary, but the, it's very scary, but also the bloodbather, I would say, needs to upgrade their microphone a little bit, maybe.

917
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,700
There's something called a were-zombie.

918
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,200
A were-zombie?

919
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:26,200
It's a common misconception that a were-zombie is a werewolf-zombie hybrid.

920
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:30,200
In most cases, the werewolf virus trumps the zombie virus, so such a creature won't exist.

921
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:36,700
However, a fresh zombie created from a live human could become a zombie-werewolf hybrid for the remainder of the full moon night it was bitten.

922
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:40,200
This is an extremely temporary creature.

923
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,840
Who is the Cringe?

924
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:44,840
The Cringe?

925
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:45,840
Who's that?

926
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:51,400
The Cringe loves posing as a creepy clown.

927
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,480
There is one man on earth who is the complete embodiment of instilling a deeply disturbing

928
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:59,640
feeling within all who lay eyes upon him.

929
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,360
He is only known as the Cringe.

930
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:06,840
Some say he resembles Pennywise the clown from the movie IT, although Pennywise looks

931
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:11,140
like a charming bachelor compared to the cringe.

932
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:14,280
I cannot, I, we need to get in contact with.

933
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:20,960
The first, it's getting me so good every, every, every article starting just with yes,

934
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,080
100% is incredible.

935
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:28,080
I'm loving this so much just to be able to see a post that says, does, does silver hurt

936
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:31,200
vampires and I'm thinking to myself, no, that's a werewolf thing.

937
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:36,720
And then clicking on it, it says, yes, 100% pure silver is a kryptonite of sort for vampires.

938
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:43,400
Dude, they have so many employees.

939
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:48,080

954
00:55:55,800 --> 00:56:02,560

957
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:14,320
hopefully we don't have to worry about being scared away like the last

958
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,400
receptionist was and then here's Michael Remington code name traveler corporate

He has a pilot's license for small jets and helicopters.

966
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,680
Lineage, human.

967
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:40,440
Although during recent genealogical research,

968
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,800
there was some minor evidence that his great, great,

969
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,320
great, great grandfather may have been a traveler.

970
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,040
He was born on the magical island

971
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,920
of Washington Island, Wisconsin.

972
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,600
(both laughing)

973
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,640
Powers, so this is Xavier's brother.

974
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,000
powers time travel through technology he invented age 25 residents Michael still

975
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:01,320
has a room at minute Remington Manor and a laboratory in the basement near

976
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:05,400
Rebecca Abernathy's witches lair this that is where he stays when he returns

977
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:10,080
to our time in Woodland Springs he also maintains a time time museum slash home

978
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:14,040
a million years in the future in what he calls the million years manner

979
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,120
additional notes he's rarely around and is often gone for many months at a time

980
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,920
temporarily traveling he wants to age with us so he doesn't return to the

981
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:26,180
instant he left our time. Also due to time travel causing one to be pushed to

982
00:57:26,180 --> 00:57:29,480
parallel universes there's no way to change events in our timeline of origin

983
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,360
unless it is predestined. Therefore we don't use time travel as a methods to

984
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:37,520
right or wrong. Michael simply loved history and invented time travel to

985
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:41,160
explore it. Although his past explorations can sometimes give us the

986
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:45,800
answers we seek, since he isn't around on a regular basis, Assistant CTO Zach Powers

987
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:52,840
stands in as acting CEO. Wow! And he has a blog. This is crazy. He's a time traveler.

988
00:57:52,840 --> 00:58:03,240
Yeah. I'm looking here. I see a disclaimer notice here. Sure. Oh, wait, no, I shouldn't read it.

989
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:11,000
Why? It's required under the Supernatural Secrecy Pact of 33 AD. Oh, yeah. You don't want to violate

990
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:16,240
that so I'm not so Xavier Remington I definitely shouldn't Xavier Remington

991
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:21,000

992
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:26,560

one book on Amazon called the Demi Mermaid witch and the strawberry fairy a

994
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:35,600
paranormal adventure and now this book sounds really fascinating here's the

995
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,920
here's the blurb here about this book as the full June strawberry moon approaches

996
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,080
a fiendish fairymancer is after the human mermaid hybrid witch Rebecca Abernathy

997
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,000
and her little friend a strawberry fairy named Red. Together they fight and evade

998
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:51,920
the dark magician as they make their way to Red's nature nymph ascension ceremony.

999
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,720
It is the fairymancer's hope to crash this paranormal party and siphon all the

1000
00:58:55,720 --> 00:59:00,200
nature deities powers including the Roman fruit goddess Pomona. His twisted

1001
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:04,080
plan even involves the archdemon the devil himself along with his newly born

1002
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,920
for an antichrist child. Now this

1003
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:08,320
sounds like a an epic romp right

Xavier. I would love to do

1014
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,160
anything for the team. I

1015
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:29,240
didn't realize it's so many

1016
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,720
people working on this project

1017
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,160
over at mystic investigation.

1018
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,560
we work freelance. Yeah I mean Barbara even I would even if Barbara Gerber the

1019
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:43,840
current receptionist is 47 years old been there since 2011 if she wants to I don't

1020
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:47,200
know move up the ladder a little bit I'd be more than happy to take her spot as

1021
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:52,900
the receptionist at Mystic Investigations. Yeah. Right? I do want to

1022
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:56,380
learn about the vice executive vice president. I would look at you like a

1023
00:59:56,380 --> 01:00:00,000
treasurer. So I've actually changed my mind because the executive vice

1024
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:06,840
president and chief vampirologist who's a 25% shareholder in the business by the

1025
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:12,480
way his secretary is Mrs. Finch he is a vampire and I'm not sure that I could

1026
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:18,360
basically be a co-worker of a vampire especially work for a vampire. Wait are

1027
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:22,080
you serious? Especially knowing that he recently suffered complete amnesia to

1028
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,640
the point of not even exhibiting the symptoms of being a vampire there

1029
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,240
by proving the power of mind over matter the amnesia occurred when he was

1030
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,340
literally blown up along with an alien vessel somewhere in the high altitude

1031
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:40,400
skies over Kentucky. His vampire mother and headduana helped him regain his

1032
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:48,120
memories of the past centuries. Yeah and he's 742 and he's worth 325 million

1033
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:53,640
dollars. Oh. His vehicle's a silver Aston Martin v12 vanquish. That's pretty cool.

1038
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:24,920
to kind of set the scene for anyone who wants to buy this book, which I would recommend to

1039
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:25,920
go out and do.

1040
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:26,920
Of course.

1041
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,200
The story takes place on the evening of June 2, 2015, toward the witching hour of June 3,

1042
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:35,960
2015, during the full strawberry moon and the continuity of our Supernatural blog revolving

1043
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:39,920
around the adventures of Mystic Investigations, a paranormal crime-fighting firm battling

1044
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,840
the forces of supernatural darkness.

1045
01:01:41,840 --> 01:01:45,800
The unusual firm is based in a town teeming with paranormal life called Woodland Springs

1046
01:01:45,800 --> 01:01:47,420
in the great state of Colorado.

1047
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:52,740
The main character is mystic investigations resident human mermaid hybrid, aka Demi-mermaid,

1048
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,820
senior vice president Rebecca Abernathy.

1049
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:57,540
She is also a top flight wielder of witchcraft.

1050
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,660
The story involves Rebecca aiding a fairy in her escape from a fairymancer.

1051
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:04,900
A fairymancer is a type of magical practitioner who has the power to mystically manipulate

1052
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,940
fairies and absorb their power for their own nefarious ends.

1053
01:02:07,940 --> 01:02:11,140
There is mention of the devil himself along with his newborn antichrist child, which is

1054
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,660
a part of a greater storyline.

1055
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,140
He came to be trapped in human form on earth during the first battle of

1056
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,940
Armageddon on Halloween 2013.

1057
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,420
If you remember that.

1058
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:22,540
And eventually fathered the antichrist in March 2015.

1059
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:27,660
And this story also, it still has, you know how everything on the website has

1060
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:28,660
links?

1061
