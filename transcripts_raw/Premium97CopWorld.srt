00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,300
Speaking of, you wanna hear my favorite Norm Macdonald joke ever?

6
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,300
Yeah, let's hear it.

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,300
The other day I was gonna get me a cup of coffee, right?

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,800
Uh, but then I took an arrow to the knee.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
[laughter]

10
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Yeah, that's a good one.

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,140
- Whatever happened to him?

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,880
- Yeah, I mean, he used to be putting out heaters

13
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:34,880
all the time.

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,480
You know what, you remember that joke he did

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,300
when he was like, "Sat down next to the girl in class,

16
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,980
"she moved to another desk."

17
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,800
And he held up a picture of a penguin?

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,960
- Yes.

19
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,800
- That one was so good.

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,760
- I remember that, yeah.

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,880
I remember, "Your mom's so fat,

22
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,240
"she goes out onto the beach

23
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,320
"and all the whales, they crawl up onto shore

24
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,120
"and say, 'We are family,

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,520
even though you're fatter than me. Remember that?

26
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,520
Yeah, he, oh my god.

27
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,920
He was put, what hap, I mean like, it feels like he was so funny until like four days ago.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,420
What happened?

29
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,620
I know, I don't know, yeah. And yeah, I mean, what, now all his jokes are like this.

30
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,020
Yeah, or like this.

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,820
Or even like this.

32
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,420
[Laughter]

33
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,420
Oh, he's back!

34
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,920
They buried him alive!

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,920
No!

36
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,980
He wasn't dead after all.

37
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,980
First Norman, now Patrick, bro.

38
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:30,480
Yeah.

39
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,540
Two legends lost within days of each other, dude.

40
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:38,540
Two comedy, I mean two incredible joke writers.

41
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,040
Yeah.

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,140
Just lost within days of each other.

43
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,420
Podcast moguls.

44
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:45,980
I know, dude. Yeah. Two legends of the game.

45
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,740
We should do that cards thing.

46
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,780
The card, the jokes thing?

47
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,220
The jokes cards thing.

48
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,620
That's the best, dude. Yeah. I'm jealous of that format that he came up with of like

49
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,700
just have someone write just like a bunch of jokes of very varying quality.

50
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,020
Yeah.

51
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,020
And then some of them will make Andy Kindler laugh.

52
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,940
Yeah. And some of them will make people not happy.

53
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:12,940
I saw something today that was like, Conan did this like special about Norm,

54
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,500
this like remembrance special, because like they were close.

55
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:16,060
Yeah.

56
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:21,180
And then like 30 minutes in, Andy Richter's on it. It's like a podcast. 30 minutes in,

57
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:27,780
Andy Richter's like, "Yeah, but also Norm, he called me gay a lot, which is like actually

58
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,780
pretty offensive."

59
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:36,140
It's like fucking 36 hours after the man died and Andy Richter's fucking porky pig ass is

60
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,140
sitting over there.

61
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,700
It even kind of hurt my feelings when the funniest guy ever called me gay.

62
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,660
I listened to that, I was like fuming mad.

63
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,380
I was like, "This dude should get fucking curb stomped.

64
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,380
He's so stupid."

65
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,380
He sucks, dude.

66
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,820
He is the worst person in the world, dude.

67
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,820
Andy Kinloch?

68
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,340
I'm not Andy Richter.

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,340
Not Andy Kindler.

70
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,340
Andy Kindler is awesome.

71
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:57,340
Yeah.

72
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,340
Another boost.

73
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,940
He's the one who got divorced, right?

74
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
Because he couldn't.

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,940
Andy Richter, yeah.

76
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,300
And then he was just like trying to fuck 17 year olds all the time like a boss.

77
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
Actually, you know what's funny?

78
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,620
I just changed my mind on him.

79
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,940
He's actually the coolest guy in the world.

80
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,940
But I remember like, I forget, I think he posted or someone in his family posted like

81
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,140
a family picture post-divorce and like it's just like his ex-wife is standing

82
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:26,180
like as far away from him as she can be like while still being in the photo.

83
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:32,740
I bet he smells so bad. Yeah well I actually I did encounter him. You met him? I

84
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,860
didn't meet him I definitely was talked about this before but I almost hit him

85
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:39,940
in the face with a bathroom door. You should have. I was talking shit about him

86
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:43,740
like probably like 30 seconds before that happened too yeah me and Alex were

87
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,000
talking shit about him. He heard it and then you and then you almost beat him to

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,560
death with the door. It's very possible he heard it I don't know but yeah I like

89
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,840
pushed the bathroom door open too fast and he was like right there and it like he like

90
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,480
stopped it and I was like oh sorry. Then it registered like a few

91
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,500
seconds later. Yeah yeah cuz it's like it's like when you get too close to a

92
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,260
passing cruise ship and you don't see anything like the bottom of it and it's

93
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,060
too big to even fit in your view. You're like, "What is this?"

94
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,060
I was like, "What's this belly button?"

95
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,060
"What's this door frame?"

96
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,060
Oh my god, what is this snout nose?

97
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,860
Oh my god.

98
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,060
Directly in my face.

99
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:36,060
Yeah, what is this, what is this creeping, um, prowling finger that's probing its way towards my groin?

100
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,780
my growing anything except this oh oh wait four minutes as he passes by like

101
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:52,500
it's like this spaceship from Spaceballs yeah yeah that's what the 18 year old

102
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,700
that he pays have sex with see whether trying to get his dick they just slowly

103
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,740
go down yeah you have to take an elevator yeah to crest his stomach and

104
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,780
And then you finally get to his penis.

105
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,380
- Yeah, and there's nothing there.

106
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,220
- And there's nothing there?

107
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,220
- There's nothing there.

108
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,220
- Yeah. - Yeah.

109
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,340
- Almost like a magician.

110
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,700
- Almost like--

111
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,700
- That's a guy, like, I don't know how he's

112
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,860
made money on TV for so long.

113
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,980
- Yeah, I mean, I feel like he just had to have been

114
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:21,780
in the right place at the right time, right?

115
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,260
- Yeah, I guess that makes sense.

116
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,860
And also, just like, Conan needed, like,

117
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,300
I guess like a fat, ugly punching bag.

118
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,140
- Yeah. - Right?

119
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:29,960
Everybody needs one.

120
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,800
- Everybody needs one.

121
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,620
- It's funny that Jimmy Kimmel was like,

122
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,940
I'm just gonna get like a random Mexican.

123
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
Yeah, it is really funny.

124
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,300
That's a very like...

125
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,700
Do you think that would fly if he picked Guillermo today?

126
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:44,140
That's what I'm saying, like it's crazy that nobody's said anything about that.

127
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,740
I mean, because he's... because Guillermo's like in on it, I assume.

128
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:50,460
Yeah, but he's also like... Guillermo's like rich.

129
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,980
Yeah, I don't know anything. I've watched maybe like Jimmy Kimmel like twice in my life,

130
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,020
so I don't really know.

131
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,620
Yeah, but the whole thing is he's like...

132
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,780
All I see, yeah, the only stuff I've seen is just it's like,

133
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,900
oh isn't the way that Guillermo pronounces this insane?

134
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,260
Yeah, yeah, Guillermo, like Jimmy will hold up a banana and he'll be like, "Hey Guillermo, what's this?"

135
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,900
And he'll be like, "I don't know, Jimmy. A telephone?"

136
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,780
And everyone's like, "Ahhhh!"

137
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,860
Yeah.

138
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:18,220
Yeah, I feel like it probably wouldn't... Is Jimmy Kimmel still going?

139
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,620
Yeah, yeah, I think he is.

140
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,120
He's still doing his thing?

141
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,020
All of those guys are supposedly like gonna retire in like the next couple years.

142
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:31,060
Yeah, well, I feel like they will already... the way that I hear late and I talked about you think they'd already have been retired and like

143
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,940
replaced with like Netflix like yeah yeah they just Netflix late-night shows that

144
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,040
drop like 30 episodes at a time yeah yeah which makes no yeah yeah I think

145
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:46,180
the the thing is like I think the only one of those guys who has like any

146
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:52,100
viewership outside of like very old people is Corden yeah yeah I think

147
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,860
Corden my mom likes Trevor no numbers dude well Trevor that's like different I

148
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,500
guess is it I don't know I mean there's old school like Johnny Carson like you

149
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,540
you walk out, you monologue, you have a desk,

150
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,220
and then you have a guest and shit.

151
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,260
The Daily Show, that's just like,

152
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,140
that's just like annoying.

153
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,660
It's like a more annoying version of the news now.

154
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,140
- Yeah, that's true.

155
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,280
- They need to get a fat sidekick.

156
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,420
They need an Andy Richter.

157
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,220
- They do, yeah.

158
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,140
He should just be on all of them.

159
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,980
- Andy Richter?

160
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,800
- Yeah.

161
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,640
- He would love that, dude.

162
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,480
- He would do so well.

163
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,240
- So many more audiences for preteens

164
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,780
that he can go up to afterward and say,

165
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,860
you want an autograph?

166
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,700
- Yeah.

167
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,220
- You want an autograph in the bathroom?

168
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,740
come on yeah he's holding up cue cards for the audience that say like approach

169
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:42,220
and he ricked her approach any Richter with high school I do and yeah yeah he

170
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:46,140
wouldn't do that oh that's horrible to say that's horrible you would never do

171
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,580
that no he'd probably eat them because it was big fat nature he'd probably

172
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,860
think that they were a donut or a popsicle and he would eat them oh you

173
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,520
It just made me so mad just hearing hearing yeah

174
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,020
Because norm called him gay in 2004

175
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:09,260
That is so yeah, it's like dude. I just that's so funny - it's like there are people who norm said way worse stuff about

176
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:16,380
Yeah, that's like really tame definitely for him. Yeah. Yeah, he called so many women just like disgusting cunts

177
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:22,140
Yeah, it's like trying to like a pigeon just landed right at your window. Yeah. Oh, he's there like every day. Yeah, what's his name?

178
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,420
He's never told me you didn't name him not yet. I mean we can name him right now. Yeah

179
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:33,360
Barack Barack

180
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,540
Yeah, yeah, why why'd you pick that name?

181
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:39,780
You know I don't know

182
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:47,700
Couldn't tell you why I picked certainly not because he's a filthy rat carry disease

183
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,980
City, yeah, yeah destroying the cities of America

184
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:57,720
That wouldn't be the reason. That wouldn't be right dude. And it's not because he has a

185
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,220
magnet in his brain that guides him to back home. Yeah, yeah to Hawaii.

186
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:07,900
Yeah, it would have that would it's definitely not the bright yellow beady eyes.

187
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:17,900
None of those are why I chose Barack. No. No. It's because he looks cool. Yeah, he's regal. Yeah exactly.

188
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,180
- Yeah, he's dignified. - I'd do what he said.

189
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
It's funny that Barack Obama is one of those guys

190
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,120
where you can talk shit about all the time,

191
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,260
like all you want.

192
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,520
If he was in the room with you,

193
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,800
I think he could convince almost any person on earth

194
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,200
to suck his dick in 15 minutes.

195
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,740
- Probably, he's so charismatic.

196
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,460
- Would you suck Barack Obama's dick?

197
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:40,220
- I mean, I would say no now, but you know, that's--

198
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,300
- You'd never know what you'd say if he's in the room.

199
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,820
- Yeah, I mean, yeah, he would ask me

200
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,380
come to the to the White House Easter egg hunt and I'd say that's so far away

201
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,380
Barack and he said that's so far but like you know both in space and time and

202
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,640
and he'd say no I'm doing a very special one just for you and there are two

203
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,860
Easter eggs I want you to hunt and I'd say that sounds really fun and then

204
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,940
things would kind of proceed from there and I'd still have to go to the White

205
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,340
House so. One is a normal Easter egg and the other one's a wedding ring. Yeah

206
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:14,900
yeah well they both have wedding rings inside. You pop open the thing and it has a

207
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,540
a wet one once an engagement ring yeah there's a wedding band because you're

208
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,260
getting married immediately yeah yeah it's just it's the six-second

209
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,780
engagement yeah yeah yeah but he's like just one of those guys man he probably

210
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:31,180
could cast a spell like a real-life I think he might be doing like actual like

211
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:37,660
Alakazam chaos magic yeah you know yeah he is he's very is impressively

212
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,020
charismatic sheer force of will yeah you know there's not I think it's it's funny

213
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:48,120
that he was a follow-up to W also who was just like funny. Yeah, also very

214
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,800
charismatic. Definitely charismatic but not doesn't have a different kind of...

215
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,400
Dude, if you showed up to a party... Oh I mean this

216
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,080
guy's an animal dude. He should have been the lead singer for the Doors. This guy was like a

217
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:04,520
fucking party animal. He should have been like a guy who lived in my basement and I could

218
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,520
like if I was having a party I could like bang a broom on the floor and he

219
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:13,200
would like to come up and entertain everybody for me. Can you imagine growing up as Jeb Bush's son you

220
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,040
have that dorky ass fucking pussy dad yeah and you go over to uncle W's house.

221
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,600
Yeah. Dude. Oh my god. He's letting you do anything you want he's like letting you

222
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:30,240
try to guess the nuclear code on the briefcase. He's like go ahead yeah yeah

223
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:37,440
see if you can get it. Nah try again why not. Yeah yeah he's letting you

224
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,200
you he's letting you like punch the the the Secret Service guys to see if you

225
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,940
have strong you are yeah exactly yeah they can't let you like he's like

226
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,200
letting you try to tackle him yeah Secret Service guys have to get in the

227
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,280
way yeah it's like he's like you can he's like here's a here's a bill that

228
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:57,960
just that just came across my desk add any sentence you want to this yeah yeah

229
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,000
stamp this. Sneak anything you want.

230
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Yeah.

231
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,880
I wish the president still could do like the 1700s thing where it was like if you

232
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,440
had a beef with the president you would write him a letter and then you guys

233
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,000
would, he'd get so offended that he would duel you.

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,280
Yeah. That's sick. That is cool. The fact that the president used to be like I'm gonna like I

235
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,980
I gotta rep my set.

236
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,380
- Yeah. - You talk shit,

237
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,800
but I'm the president, I gotta rep my shit.

238
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,640
- Yeah.

239
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,420
I think that we should bring back dueling,

240
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,740
but it shouldn't be guns.

241
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,420
It should be like everybody has a weapon specialization

242
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,900
that they pick like an RPG type thing

243
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,940
where you can maybe skill tree it or something,

244
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,220
but you have a specific weapon

245
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,620
that you can only use that in a duel.

246
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,900
So then it would be like, oh, I wanna duel this guy

247
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,220
'cause he's fucking my wife.

248
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,400
but my weapon is like a, you know, a katana and his,

249
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,740
well, he picked a crossbow, so, you know,

250
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,680
he's probably gonna win, so I might have to rethink this,

251
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,280
you know, it just adds an element of strategy.

252
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,620
- That's a good point. - 'Cause duels are so boring,

253
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,360
what, walk away and then turn around?

254
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,860
- Yeah, it's nothing. - It's kinda stupid,

255
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,960
also like, apparently a bunch of people

256
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,740
just like survived them all the time.

257
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,580
- Yeah. - It's like,

258
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,320
you get one shot, like that's--

259
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,880
- That is true, yeah. - Like if you both

260
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,720
just miss, and you're like, I guess--

261
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,560
- Yeah, they don't let you shoot again.

262
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,060
- I guess we do it again, I don't know.

263
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,500
But just like adrenaline racing,

264
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,300
of a fucking shaking gun. Yeah, I feel like you would both miss a bunch. Yeah, dude, a

265
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,740
gun is hard to shoot, especially those old ones that are so inaccurate. If you're turning

266
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,940
around, like, you're not even looking at the, like you're turning to shoot as fast as you

267
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:38,140
can. I don't know, I couldn't shoot a basketball like that. Maybe that's because I don't play

268
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:42,940
basketball, but. But I don't think these guys, ammunition's expensive, especially back then.

269
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:46,220
That's true. You know? Well, yeah, would you get in trouble if you just shot like three

270
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,460
times in a row. I don't, the guns couldn't do that. That's, I think that's why you only

271
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:55,300
get one shot because it was just a little cocked back single shot pistol. Yeah. Whatever those

272
00:13:55,300 --> 00:14:00,600
are called. I don't know. I think you're right that you need to have, you have to pick a

273
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,000
weapon that for the rest of your life you're going to duel with. Yeah. But to trick it,

274
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,820
you have to pick it this day you're born. Yeah. You have to like crawl to it. It's like

275
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:14,380
Harry Potter or something. They have like a sorting hat. And they, you take like a personality

276
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:18,300
quiz yeah when you turn like 10 or something to see what you yeah to what

277
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:25,900
was and some people get like yeah like do you feel more like a sword or a gun

278
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:32,900
are you are you long and pointy or are you short and shooty do people throw you

279
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:42,580
or swing you around yeah yeah that huh it says gun but I'm pretty sure I'm a

280
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,980
sword yeah deep down did you see there's this movie coming out with like I think

281
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:50,900
Matt Damon's and it's called like the last duel of France or something I did

282
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,020
see a trailer for that it's very funny to see Matt Damon and Ben Affleck in that

283
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,900
getup yeah like both of them to get like one of them alone Ben Affleck is really

284
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,580
the funny one to see in that getup to be honest but seeing them both together in that getup is really good

285
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:07,820
they should have learned their lesson with Boston actors by now

286
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:13,700
people from Boston look fucking insane if they're not in Boston. Yeah. If they are

287
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,900
anywhere outside of Boston they look they look wrong. Yeah. So to send those two

288
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:23,820
back to... yeah. And they have like Dunkin Donuts cold brew teeth. It's fucked. It should be like a

289
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,820
kid in King Arthur's Court situation. They should be Boston guys who are sent

290
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:32,100
back. Exactly. That's how you make that movie work. Definitely. You literally you

291
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,100
can leave everything else the same but as long as you had a prologue where they

292
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,140
get sucked into a time portal. And then they just are like okay I guess we'll

293
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,820
just do that. Okay I guess we'll just act like them now. Yeah. And then that movie

294
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,860
would make perfect sense. Yeah. Yeah and then you'd add a scene at the end where

295
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,220
they go back home and they go it was crazy you were there and you were there

296
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:50,640
and you were there and all their friends look exactly like the medieval

297
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:55,180
characters. Oh true. But in Mark Boston. Yeah that's a good idea. Yeah. I looked up I looked up

298
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,380
because it's like supposedly based on a true story mm-hmm and it's called The

299
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,740
Last Duel of France. I was like oh that's cool like The Last Duel of France. Looked

300
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:07,500
it up like when it actually happened yeah it was like the 1600s dude France was so

301
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,060
fucking stupid about it they banned dueling way too early that is really

302
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,420
early dueling is like dude they're dueling should have like outlasted

303
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:23,100
slavery by 300 years you know what I mean yeah like if like that just should have

304
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,700
been dueling should have gone on way way longer it should have been yeah

305
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:32,100
absolutely it should still be around yeah yeah I think they've been they

306
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:36,640
probably been what's the point of banning it I mean people gonna do that shit yeah

307
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:40,140
well the point is I think you're gonna do it I'd rather you do it here you know

308
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:47,700
yeah it's a Venezuela to duel exactly here we got I got guns for you right I

309
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,140
mean it's to say like yeah you open dueling dispensary type thing like yeah

310
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:57,140
what you can do it should be a league yeah we're kind of getting into like a

311
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,740
Gerald what's his name Gerard Butler movies yeah I mean this could also gamer

312
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:07,540
and this could be also a really good like anime plot I feel like true bring those

313
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:12,380
back and we and everyone has their own weapon yeah yeah yeah I would like the

314
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,740
Super Bowl I yeah okay yeah all right if you like anything like anime turned like

315
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,620
Naruto turn no no no if you went to if you went to a so like a bloodsport thing

316
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:30,100
Yeah, yeah, if you went to a football game paid $100 you'd be like whatever fine

317
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:33,180
You know I had to go see a man kill another man

318
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:39,420
Yeah on a on basically a like a track and field thing yeah, but it should be going on in the Olympics during

319
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:46,260
Yeah, yeah, it should be in the middle just to know what

320
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:53,420
It should be they should like they should contract whoever builds like theme parks to build like real-life

321
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,820
like Halo free-for-all maps. Oh true.

322
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:02,460
Yeah, Slayer or whatever. Yeah. But I feel like doing it old-school I feel like

323
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:07,320
is a good... it'd be good for the Olympics at least. Yeah. The Olympics

324
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:10,740
whole thing is... Yeah, well right, and then they can introduce other weapons and stuff

325
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,780
in the... And moving, because otherwise, because paces, you know... Yeah, and abilities too.

326
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,580
Yeah, well you'd have to have a blue ability of course. A blue ability, yeah.

327
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:28,100
So since it's just me and Cam, we just decided to have some beautiful conversations between

328
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,100
best friends.

329
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,100
We were talking about having a conversation today.

330
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,100
Yeah.

331
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:35,420
I texted Caleb and I was like, "Hey man, do you want to have a conversation today?"

332
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:36,420
And he said no.

333
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,420
I didn't say no.

334
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
But he said no.

335
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
I didn't say no.

336
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,740
I said please and he said okay.

337
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,060
I just, I'm sorry.

338
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,980
I didn't say no, first of all, because I love talking to you.

339
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
You're my best bud.

340
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Yeah.

341
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:51,480
I just I feel so I mean I love the art of conversation.

342
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
It's a beautiful art.

343
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Would you agree?

344
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,480
I definitely would agree.

345
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,580
Would you find do you feel like honestly answer me this do you think that words can be beautiful?

346
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,840
I think words are kind of their own form of beauty and let me say this to you as well

347
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,780
I think that a sparkling conversation is worth more than any sparkling wine.

348
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,780
Wow.

349
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,780
Wow.

350
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,620
I truly believe that.

351
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,620
I mean yeah, I would say a hot, juicy conversation

352
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,980
is better than a hot, juicy hamburger.

353
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,180
- Absolutely, yeah.

354
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,620
- Which is a thing that I just came up with,

355
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:23,580
is saying-- - A hot, juicy hamburger.

356
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,420
I think that's a real thing.

357
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,740
- Oh, you're right, my bad.

358
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:27,300
See, but that's what conversation is about,

359
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,140
it's about that back and forth.

360
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,740
- It's about a-- - I can say--

361
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,900
- It's kind of like a duel.

362
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,380
- It's a bit of a duel. - It's kind of like a

363
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,500
duel of beauty. - Yes, 'cause I can say

364
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,220
anything I want, you know what I mean?

365
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,180
- Blee, blah, blow, blah, blah, blah, bleh.

366
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,380
- You can say that and I can counterpoint and say,

367
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,300
Cameron, that doesn't make any sense.

368
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,380
Cameron, that's completely, you're saying nothing.

369
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,740
- And then I could say,

370
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,860
blah, blah, blah, I could just keep doing it.

371
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:52,180
- Yeah, and that's also the beauty of a conversation.

372
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,420
It could go on forever.

373
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,140
Who knows how long this episode will last

374
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,180
because this, my friends, is a beautiful conversation

375
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,780
between friends. - It is, yeah.

376
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,740
Well, I can't think of anything to talk about.

377
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,580
- Me neither.

378
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,820
We have a conversation starter list.

379
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,180
- Yeah, here, I pulled this up here.

00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:13,020

389
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,580
- Metropolitan Girls are like monkeys at typewriters.

390
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,860
Eventually they'll write something worthwhile, right?

391
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
- Yeah.

392
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:35,860

00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,100
you and your best friend should try.

395
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,060

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,420
That is, that literally like when I was like searching for, when I was trying to think

00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,620

Yeah.

403
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,300
But it's on there.

404
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300

had somebody do that like in if you have like a small like group

410
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:27,940
of people someone will like like this happened in high school

411
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:32,340
once some kid was like uh was like let's look up something to

412
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,780
talk about yeah we all just watch a movie or something and

413
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,540
and he like looked at a list on his phone,

414
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,580
he was like, "Oh, we should talk about movies."

415
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:42,840
(laughing)

416
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,060
- Like why did, you had to look up

417
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,220
that you wanted to talk about movies?

418
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,820
- Yeah, sometimes you do.

419
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,780
There's no shame in that.

420
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,340
- I think there's some shame.

421
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,420
- No, absolutely not.

422
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,180
A conversation can start in any way.

423
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
That's the beauty of it.

424
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,700
It could start, you could talk,

425
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,980
you could suddenly strike up a conversation

426
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,180
with a guy on the train out of nowhere.

427
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:08,900
Okay, you could suddenly strike up a conversation with that same guy, 20 minutes later, outside

428
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,260
of his front door and he doesn't know how you got there.

429
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
True.

430
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,820
He didn't know you were having a conversation with the back of him from 30 feet away.

431
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,660
That's right, because he thought it was his brother.

432
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
You thought it?

433
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,660
Yeah.

434
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
The back of his head was your face.

435
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
Sorry, can you turn around?

436
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:24,660
I'm not done talking to your hairy brother.

437
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,540
He's very ugly and we've been talking about it for quite a while.

438
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Yeah.

439
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:31,020
And he has super hearing and he can hear me from way over there.

440
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,220
He's walking down the street like 30 feet behind somebody and he's going, "Wow, you're so hairy."

441
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,020
"Why do you wear all your clothes backwards?

442
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,020
You're a weird freak."

443
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,460
"I hate you, you stupid bitch.

444
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
Oh, hello sir.

445
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:51,020
I'm sorry, I was actually berating your ugly backside, friend."

446
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,020
Yeah.

447
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,020
Yeah.

448
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,020
Yeah.

449
00:22:54,020 --> 00:23:00,660
Anyway, there's interesting conversation topics to talk to your best friend about.

450
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:03,340
Now you're hanging out and it suddenly gets quiet.

451
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,820
This has happened to all of us.

452
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:09,380
You feel like there's nothing else to discuss and that's where you are wrong.

453
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,140
You haven't exhausted all the topics in the world, not yet.

454
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,780
The fact is you don't fully know the specifics about each other.

455
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,780
Are we going to get deep and down and dirty?

456
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,320
I think we're going to get into some specifics.

457
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,540
Look at this beautiful image.

458
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
Oh my god, there's a rose.

459
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,540
Dude, that's us.

460
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,820
Are you green or purple?

461
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,460
I think I'm the rose.

462
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,460
You can't be the rose.

463
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,660
Well, because this is only half of the faces, so that's one person.

464
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
So that's you.

465
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm actually the Metropolitan Girls logo. I changed my mind.

466
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:37,820
Okay. Conversation topics for best friends. They have a title every

467
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:41,860
paragraph here. Try these uncommented topics below to keep things interesting.

468
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,100
I've always wanted to talk to you about this first topic.

469
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:48,340
I've just always wanted to talk to you about this.

470
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,420
Number one is food. I mean

471
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,420
where do we even begin?

472
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:57,420
I mean

473
00:23:57,420 --> 00:24:01,820
yeah well let's talk let's just let's talk this out right talk so i mean i'd like

474
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:05,820
to before we even basically start talking about this yeah i would just like to say

475
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:14,140
pizza hot dog hamburger they're all delicious they're all right okay so we can agree on that

476
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:19,340
much i did i when i was a kid i didn't like hot dogs because one time i ate a hot dog and i i

477
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,900
threw up and there were chunks of hot dog in in my throw up and i saw it and i was like that's

478
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:28,080
disgusting. Dude, I mean, it's called Nathan's Gambit, dude. You take it every

479
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,520
time you eat a hot dog. Who knows what's gonna happen to you? Yeah, well the thing

480
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,320
is... It's about a 50/50 chance. It's the perfectly shaped food to make you throw up.

481
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,720
It's very easy if you completely forget to chew for it to hit your

482
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,440
uvula and then shoot out like a bullet. It's true. Which is kind of

483
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:46,400
impressive, actually. But the thing about a hot dog is like you either have to

484
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,640
like... it either powers you up to light a firework or like you have to sit on a

485
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,280
leather couch for like, like a cold leather couch for hours after eating a hot dog.

486
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:55,520
Yeah.

487
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,200
Because it'll just fucking, there's something, because it's mystery meat,

488
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,920
it's like, it's like Russian roulette.

489
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,160
Yeah.

490
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:08,320
You know what I mean? Like there's something, there has to be one part of bad rancid meat in

491
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:08,480
Yeah.

492
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
In every other hot dog.

493
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:10,320
Oh, absolutely.

494
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,480
Right?

495
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,840
Yeah. Yeah.

496
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,560
So it's got fucking ups and downs.

497
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,240
It's like a toy in cereal, but.

498
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,560
Yeah. That's why you should only ever eat one hot dog at a time, because you are limiting your

499
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,680
chances of getting the stinky dog.

500
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,160
Two hot dogs at a time.

501
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,900
- You know when you're eating a bag of pistachios?

502
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,520
- No, you gotta eat two at a time.

503
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,360
- Two hot dogs?

504
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,200
- Yeah.

505
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,880
- What are you, Andre the Giant?

506
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,560
- If they're both, let's say it's a 50% chance.

507
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:32,720
- What are you, Joey Chestnut?

508
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,960
- Let's say it's a 50% chance that you get the bad dog, okay?

509
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,800
- Yeah.

510
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,600
- That's .5, all right?

511
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,440
You with me here?

512
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,280
- Yeah.

513
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,320
- .5 times .5 when you add another hot dog, that's .25.

514
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,480
That's one in four.

515
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,200
- That's a really good point, actually.

516
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
You're less likely if you eat two hot dogs.

517
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
The more dogs you eat actually.

518
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Yeah, because it multiplies the...

519
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,200
That's a good, yeah, it halves it every time.

520
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
Yeah, and I wouldn't think that, but you know, when you do the math it checks out.

521
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Yeah, exactly.

522
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
I mean we just did the math, we have a whiteboard here.

523
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,200
Yeah, and I mean when you add the bun it's even less likely.

524
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,200
True, yeah, because you have a barrier now.

525
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,200
Yeah, well because the bun, it's a 0% chance it's going to be a bad hot dog because it's not a hot dog.

526
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
So you multiply it by zero.

527
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,200
So you multiply it by zero, it's a 0% chance.

528
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
So actually you're fine every single time.

529
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,360
- Yeah, true, the bun is a protective condom.

530
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,200
- Yeah. - Yeah.

531
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,480
- No, no, no, it's not.

532
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,320
- Oh. - No, it's not.

533
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,140
- What's it called?

534
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,600
A paraphyla, anaphylaxis?

535
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,160
- Huh? - A paraphylaxis?

536
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,840
- Anaphylaxis? - No.

537
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,600
The paralax, the phacalax. - What?

538
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,440
What are you trying to say?

539
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,640
- What's a fucking, what do they call a condom?

540
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,880
And, or like a dental dam?

541
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
- Oh, um.

542
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,560
- Anthropathic?

543
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Apropethic?

544
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,080
(laughing)

545
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,440
- I don't know. - A simplepethic.

546
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,320
- A temperpedic? - A temperpethic.

547
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,560
I think it's a tempur-pedic.

548
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,720
- What is that fucking word, man?

549
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,540
Acrobatic!

550
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,600
- I don't think I know the word.

551
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,440
- Acrobatic, sympathetic, fucking shit.

552
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,720
- I don't think I know the word that you're talking about.

553
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,600
- Whatever, man.

554
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:01,440
- Okay.

555
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,880
- Paralaxic, paralaxic, paralaxic, oh, I'm so close.

556
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,120
- Paraplegic.

557
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
- No, shut up, shut up.

558
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,960
Fuck, dude.

559
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,720
Paral...

560
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,640
I give up, I give up.

561
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,240
I'll think of it in, I'll never think of this.

562
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,080
I don't know.

563
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,560
- It's been happening to me more and more recently.

564
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,440
Been losing words from my brain.

565
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:21,840
Yeah, I think I might have a neurotoxin in my life.

566
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,760
- It could happen.

567
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:23,880
- You think I have lead paint?

568
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,560
You feel weird when you walk in here?

569
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,280
- Oh, no, I feel pretty normal when I walk in here.

570
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,560
You probably have lead paint, though.

571
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,800
Doesn't like everywhere have lead paint here?

572
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,160
- I don't know, I probably should look that up.

573
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,200
But also, I think they have to tell you when you move in.

574
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,680
- Yeah, I don't think you should look that up.

575
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,400
- Yeah, I definitely shouldn't.

576
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,400
Yeah, that'd be a really bad idea, actually.

577
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,720
- Yeah, I think you're right that they do have to.

578
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,880
I think that's what I'm thinking of,

579
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,080
that when I signed my lease, they were like,

580
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,860
"We have to tell you if there's lead paint."

581
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,700
And I took that to mean,

582
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,240
"Oh, there's probably lead paint everywhere."

583
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,280
- Well, the truth is, if there's lead paint,

584
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,920
it's like, you know, a couple layers deep.

585
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,720
- Yeah, I'm not eating the paint.

586
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,880
- I mean, lead can't get through paint, right?

587
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,640
- Right, yeah. - So, pretty much.

588
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,240
- That's why they put paint over it.

589
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,280
- Yeah, exactly, exactly, yeah.

590
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,240
- That's why, yeah.

591
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,080
- It just makes perfect sense.

592
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,640
- They were like, "We have to get rid of all this lead.

593
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,080
"I guess we'll put it in paint where it can't hurt anybody."

594
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,400
(laughing)

595
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,760
- Yeah.

596
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,800
- Yes, sir.

597
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,360
- Yeah, and in pipes, too.

598
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,200
- True.

599
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,040
- Yeah.

600
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,280
- But that's fine.

601
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,520
That doesn't do anything to you.

602
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,640
That's just water.

603
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,320
- Well, water is, here's,

604
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,800
and also, speaking of hot dogs,

605
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,960
it balances out, right?

606
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,800
- Yeah.

607
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,120
- 'Cause water is good for you.

608
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,880
Lead is probably as bad for you

609
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,440
as water is good for you, right?

610
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,360
Like, you can't live without water,

611
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,560
but lead's gonna kill you.

612
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,460
- Yeah, if I had as much lead a day

613
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,560
as I have water a day, I'd probably die.

614
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,680
- No, you'd be fine.

615
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,760
- No, if I, no, I mean like,

616
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,680
if instead of having water I had that same amount of lead I would die but if I had that

617
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
amount of water I'd be alive.

618
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,680
You mix it, it's just like you barely had any water.

619
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,840
So as long as you drink more water than lead I think you're in a good position.

620
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,600
I also do kind of feel like people who get lead poisoning from pipes are complaining.

621
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
Right.

622
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,600
Because like how long have, there's so many cities in America that have lead shit in the

623
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,600
pipes.

624
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,680
Yeah, oh you think, yeah, you think you, this house has been standing for like however long

625
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:11,480
you think you're the one who got lead poisoning?

626
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Come on.

627
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,720
I wake up, walk over to the sink, drink a scorching hot cup of water out of the tap.

628
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:20,480
Just because I want to make sure that lead is dissolved in there.

629
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Yeah.

630
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,000
I put, I put, I put, I put, it's hot out of the tap.

631
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,120
I put it into a Dasani water bottle.

632
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,000
And then I actually, I put that into a saucepan and I heat that up on the stove.

633
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,640
Just to really get it really nice.

634
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:38,960
And then I, and then I turn it into like a flaky salt and I put it over all of my steaks.

635
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,960
Yeah.

636
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:40,960
Yeah.

637
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Yeah.

638
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,720
lot of steaks. The other part is, the other part of my healthy lifestyle is I eat a

639
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:55,520
steak for every meal. Oh a lot of steaks and I paint the steaks before I eat them. Yeah, I really I really want it to feel like I'm eating the Tin

640
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:02,720
Man from Wizard of Oz. I hate that guy. He sucks. He's so, he's so. Yeah and I tried to and I tried to eat him when I saw a

641
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,560
statue of him I hurt my teeth really bad. Yeah. Steak is a lot softer than statue.

642
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,360
It's true. We were in, I was in Times Square the other day I can't remember if

643
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:15,960
were there or not. This was like when my cousin was in town. I don't think I was there. And we saw

644
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,120
one of those. Actually I haven't been to Times Square since I moved here. Oh really? Yeah. We

645
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:27,160
saw a tin man, one of those guys who stand still. Yeah. And he was not standing still, dressed full,

646
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:31,160
full tin paint all the way down. And then people were walking by and he's like,

647
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,240
"You know what I noticed recently? A whole lot of mixed race couples hate giving me money."

648
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,560
And I was like, and he was just going on this like tirade.

649
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:45,360
He was like, "Mixed couples hate me, man.

650
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,560
They never give me money.

651
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,760
It's the worst kind of couple.

652
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Fuck you.

653
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Fuck you."

654
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,240
He was just like pointing at people, talking shit to them.

655
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,240
And I was like-

656
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,840
And you were like, "Why isn't he talking shit to me?"

657
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,520
Yeah, well, I was like, "Dude, come on, bro."

658
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,960
Yeah, we're right here.

659
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,680
I'm Italian, Jenna's inbred.

660
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,960
This is like an insane mix, right?

661
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,960
You know?

662
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Yeah.

663
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,960
shock.

664
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
That is very true, yeah.

665
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,960
But I was also like this has got to be the worst statue in the world, right?

666
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,960
Yeah.

667
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
You know?

668
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
Well, he's an animatronic.

669
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,960
Oh.

670
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,960
He's doing an animatronic.

671
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
Well, that's, he's the racist animatronic.

672
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah.

673
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Yeah.

674
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:20,960
Everybody knows the racist animatronic.

675
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I should have known, dude.

676
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,960
Yeah.

677
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,560
But I was amazed that I saw one of those guys move for once.

678
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,400
And it was, he was not, it wasn't like people were touching him.

679
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,400
Yeah.

680
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
He was just doing it on his own.

681
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
I mean, sometimes, right?

682
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
You might as well, yeah.

683
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
He got shit on his mind, right?

684
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,400
Yeah.

685
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,400
And I bet he earned a couple dollars.

686
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,080
And I bet you earned a couple dollars.

687
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,880
That would be really fun actually to do,

688
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,320
to put yourself in the whole living statue costume

689
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,440
and then go and just walk around.

690
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,920
Not even do that, but just walk around

691
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,360
and act completely normal.

692
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,180
Yeah.

693
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,020
Yeah.

694
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,000
You love Bicentennial Man with Robin Williams.

695
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,840
Yeah.

696
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,680
Yeah.

697
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,920
Never seen it, but based on the cover,

698
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,760
that's what it's about.

699
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,280
(laughing)

700
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,320
You could go up to other living statue guys

701
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,980
and try and talk shop with them.

702
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,820
Yeah.

703
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,800
That would be a good way to trick them into moving.

704
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,440
Hey brother, like I've been thinking,

705
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,960
like do you have any tips on this?

706
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,460
What?

707
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:03,960
Oh!

708
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I'm trying to not move!

709
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Can you not see that I'm trying to be super still right now?

710
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,740
That's the thing, those are the real Buckingham Palace guards.

711
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,000
The ten men.

712
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,440
They should staff them there.

713
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,200
That would, yeah, they would do a better job.

714
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,520
Buckingham Palace guards also should be able to do ventriloquism.

715
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,680
They should be able to sit there and be like...

716
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,800
There should be some that are dressed like Spider-Man too.

717
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,640
I think a lot less people would fuck with them.

718
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,640
Yeah, absolutely.

719
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,640
Yeah, I'm not blowing up Spider-Man's face.

720
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,120
That has to be the least scary man with a gun in the entire universe.

721
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,120
Absolutely.

722
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,340
like looks like a toy that is a toy he's the joke is he's dressed he's it's like

723
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:49,800
it's like if you like so if like if you were like oh don't go over there

724
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,600
there's there's those are really intimidating scary guards there's a guy

725
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,960
in like a rubber duck costume yeah like standing oh don't touch that Tonka truck

726
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:04,240
yeah yeah no it's a very scary yeah yeah like I and I know obviously is not

727
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,800
dressed as a toy but that he is he is a toy he is a toy yeah that's absolutely a

728
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,040
toy soldier is the only way that that type of soldier exists. He is a walkabout

729
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,680
Disneyland character. Yeah. I think there are multiple theme parks filled with

730
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,880
people who dress up like him. Yeah. And walk around. He is doing Halloween every

731
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,440
day of the year. Okay, theme park idea. Yep. It's all walk around

732
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:32,320
characters that are like just different ranks like military people. Like it's

733
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,600
just a military theme. That would, you could ride like a tank on the

734
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,160
roller coaster. Dude, that would clean up. That would do, yeah, if you put that in the right

735
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:44,440
city that would like... Holy shit! Yeah. Also make it World War II themed. I guess, I guess

736
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,360
also, oh my god! Also it employs veterans because those are the only people who are

737
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:53,760
allowed to wear costumes like that. True! So they don't have to be homeless and like, you

738
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,880
know, kill women who walk across their front yard anymore. That's a good point.

739
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,680
They can work at theme park and kill children in the teacups. Yeah, by turning

740
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:07,320
it on to map onto 11. They draw 11 like in Spinal Tap on the teacup, right? And

741
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,480
they turn it all the way up. But also like, wouldn't they, do you think they would feel

742
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:18,040
uncomfortable dressing up as Adolf Hitler and all these evil versions of soldiers that are all good?

743
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,920
I think you could find some soldiers who would really like it, to be honest.

744
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:25,720
A soldier who likes Adolf Hitler? Someone who's in the American military who's into being a Nazi?

745
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,960
I don't think so. I think you're going to be horrified.

746
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:32,360
You could have like a spinoff that's like Cop World. That would do like even better than

747
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,960
Military World. Cop World would literally like

748
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:40,440
destroy in all 50 states. That would like outstrip Disney. It would be packed and I'll tell you what,

749
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,120
I'd probably go there twice a year. Absolutely dude, I would get the season passed. Cop world?

750
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,480
Cop world. That'd be the sickest shit of all time. Even people who are like,

751
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,000
even people who are like, their thing is like, oh man I hate the freaking cops.

752
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,160
Wait till a cop gives you a candied apple buddy and then tell me you hate police officers.

753
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,120
They would go there and take video. Your cord's fucked up I think.

754
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,880
How about now? I think it's okay, but it's been doing it. Oh, no. No, it's so oh my god

755
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,960
All right. Hold on

756
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:13,480
But even people who you know hate cops and even these these freaking a cab types nowadays

757
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,400
They would go there just to disrespect the cops

758
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:20,120
They would go there to prank them on their gopros true and that would be allowed because that would double the profits

759
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,300
I wish these a cab fellas would get in a cab and go back to china. Oh, absolutely

760
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,000
It's just not right.

761
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,900
It's not right.

762
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:30,400
Yeah.

763
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,900
Yeah.

764
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:33,400
Don't you, do you realize that a cop goes through all day?

765
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,200
Have you ever heard of, have you ever heard of?

766
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,000
Do you realize how hard cops work?

767
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,800
Okay, they, all night they're up protecting your community from

768
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,500
from creeps and ne'er-do-wells and then in the morning they

769
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,400
have to go to cop world and they have to, they have to make

770
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,200
popcorn.

771
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,600
Exactly.

772
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,800
For the other 12 hours.

773
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,100
That's the other part is that it's included in a cop's work

774
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:51,300
now.

775
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,600
Yeah.

776
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,600
You know, because all these cops.

777
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,200
It's like the draft.

778
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,700
They want to cut funding for police.

779
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,300
How about the police give back, right?

780
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,920
The other thing is about if you hate cops so much, have you ever heard, like thinking about

781
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:06,120
what they go through, have you ever heard of how bad blue light is for a human eyeball?

782
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,120
Yeah.

783
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,960
They sit in a car 12 hours a day looking at a laptop.

784
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,000
Their corneas are fucking decimated.

785
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,320
Yeah, and their attention span, I mean, it's damaging.

786
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Nobody talks about cops having ADHD.

787
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Yeah.

788
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,320
You know, these cops-

789
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
It gives them ADHD.

790
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800
PTSD, that doesn't exist.

791
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:29,160
ADHD, they come home, all of a sudden they're strung out on Adderall on the streets asking

792
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,760
people for Vyvanse, Ritalin, Focalin.

793
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,760
You know?

794
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
It's disgusting.

795
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Yeah.

796
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,640
It's just really sad.

797
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:38,640
It's just not right.

798
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Yeah.

799
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,840
So cop world might be a big fix for us.

800
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,280
I think it could work.

801
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,440
I think it could be really good.

802
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,120
And I don't think that anyone will ever sneak in either.

803
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,120
Also.

804
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,440
I think it'll be really, nobody will steal the food or anything.

805
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
True.

806
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
You want to go...

807
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,760
Alright, here's another angle on it.

808
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,760
I'm gonna go Six Flags right now, but somebody just called me and said, "Don't

809
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,360
come to Six Flags tomorrow. I'm worried about a mass shooting."

810
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,720
What's my alternative? The Copper War. There's a mass shooting every day. No, no, no,

811
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,200
they stop the mass shooting every single time. No, it's like when the

812
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,800
princesses do the parade at Disney or whatever. Every day there's like a

813
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,880
mass shooting that they all stop. Yeah, it's like when you're at

814
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,280
Knott's Berry Farm and they like robbed the bank.

815
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:24,780
Yeah.

816
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:26,280
The old western, the cowboys.

817
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,680
Oh, and dude, October at Cop World.

818
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,480
Oh my god.

819
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,180
Don't even get me started.

820
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:32,480
Yeah.

821
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,980
Yeah.

822
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,880
There's a guy, there's a guy dressed as a creepy clown and

823
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,880
he's walking around and he gets, he gets bullets pumped in him

824
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
like three times a day.

825
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,880
He's wearing a vest.

826
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,080
Completely just, just cheese.

827
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,880
It's not bulletproof, but he's wearing a vest.

828
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
Swiss cheese constantly.

829
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:46,680
Yeah.

830
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,580
Oh my god.

831
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:48,780
Now that's scary.

832
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,680
It's terrifying.

833
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,180
Yeah.

834
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,480
Yeah, it'd be sick though.

835
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,680
It would be awesome.

836
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,680
They should make more movies like, like Alien vs. Predator, but it's cops vs. something.

837
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
Right?

838
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,880
Wouldn't that be sick?

839
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,640
Like cops vs. killer clowns from outer space.

840
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,240
They should just do that for every franchise.

841
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Yeah, cops vs. predator.

842
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,280
It's like an entire police precinct in Astoria that have to fight the predator.

843
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,280
That'd be sick.

844
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,280
Yeah.

845
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,800
Predator 2 is kind of cops vs. predator.

846
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Is it?

847
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,800
Yeah.

848
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
Oh, sorry.

849
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Alright, cops vs. something else.

850
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
Yeah.

851
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,640
Cops vs. Alien would be really good.

852
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,480
- That would be good.

853
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,000
Or like Cops vs. Chucky.

854
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,840
Maybe could be good, yeah.

855
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,080
- Oh yeah, more of a slasher thing.

856
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,160
Jason V. Cops.

857
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,480
- Or like, oh my god, what is going on?

858
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,800
Is this cord fucked up or something?

859
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,640
- Should be.

860
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,720
- Oh, whatever.

861
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,680
You guys can deal with it, I don't care.

862
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,440
- Yeah, this is the price you pay for Cop World.

863
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,000
- Yeah, it is such a good idea.

864
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,360
That could also, Jesus, what the hell?

865
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,520
- You wanna pause it and figure it out?

866
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,380
- Yeah, hold on.

867
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:56,740
And so even what I was saying is even if we don't even if we don't aren't able to

868
00:38:56,740 --> 00:39:02,020
build cop world which is a big if a big yeah we aren't because it's happening

869
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:08,740
because it's definitely so easy to build an amusement park it would make a really

870
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,460
good movie or TV series like a Westworld or yeah yeah also I think like the

871
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:18,380
sharks might be a very strong possibility for funding on this can you

872
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,300
Can you imagine any of those five people on national television?

873
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,100
Yeah, saying like, "No, I don't want to invest in police officers."

874
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,100
"I don't want to support our police."

875
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,860
And you could just be like, "What? Really? I came here, a humble..."

876
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,860
Okay, hold on. I'm going to switch out the cord.

877
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,860
Hit that button.

878
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:39,660
Okay, alright. Hopefully this fixes it. If not, there's nothing I'm going to do about it.

879
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,780
I'd like to move on to level two of our intense conversation right now.

880
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,820
We only covered one topic so far. That's how beautiful this conversation has been.

881
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,380
Honestly, I could look into your eyes and talk to you

882
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,820
for over six hours probably without pausing.

883
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,660
- Probably, yeah.

884
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,480
- Yeah, we could just-- - It would be easy to do, yeah.

885
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,780
And really fast too, like maybe twice the speed

886
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:58,620
of a normal conversation.

887
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,440
- I know, it'd be a 12-hour conversation.

888
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,280
- It's actually like 12 hours, yeah,

889
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,900
a 12-hour conversation-- - Stuck in six hours.

890
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,740
- In six hours with eye contact too.

891
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:05,900
- Eye contact the entire time.

892
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,180
I do feel like if I had one person in my life

893
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:10,940
that I would want to do Scientology to me, it'd be you.

894
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,780
- Yeah. (laughs)

895
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,420
- I think you could get a lot out of me.

896
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,460
- Yeah. - I think if you sat me down

897
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,100
and started electrocuting me when I said

898
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,300
I don't wanna fuck my mom,

899
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:21,200
than like I think that might be more the electricity than me.

900
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,400
It's doing my work.

901
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,400
You're my only friend with a guts to push the button, dude.

902
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,700
I think all my other friends are pussy out.

903
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,100
Yeah, and then I think

904
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,800
dude, like if Patrick was auditing me, dude,

905
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,900
I'd be in big trouble.

906
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:33,700
I'd be walking around thing.

907
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,100
I was immune to electricity.

908
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,700
I'll be getting like Union electrician job saying like, yeah,

909
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,280
I'll just hang from the bars like a monkey and then I just get

910
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,680
fucking owned you you'd have the guts to flick that switch and

911
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,860
hit me with 13,000 volts, blow my toes off.

912
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,380
(laughing)

913
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,220
I saw something.

914
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:52,420
- Your toes just blasting off.

915
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,260
- That's what happens, dude.

916
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,100
- That's what happens?

917
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,340
- Dude, it happens constantly.

918
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,420
You don't know about this? - Constantly?

919
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,020
- Literally, probably every second.

920
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,060
(laughing)

921
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,420
- I don't believe that.

922
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:06,420
- No, so people will, like this happens on film sets

923
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:09,740
and shitty construction shit

924
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,500
where they have an exposed wire.

925
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,860
Someone will touch the wire,

926
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,260
get like ten thousand volts pumped through them through their hand

927
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:19,500
the electricity wants to go to the ground it always trying to move into the

928
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:23,740
ground so it will go through your feet and it'll blow your toes off

929
00:41:23,740 --> 00:41:25,860
like just explode them

930
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,500
like it's the coolest shit I've ever heard. That's so funny. Yeah just fucking blasting toes

931
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,180
like and I mean

932
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:36,740
god bless the people around you who showed up in sandals that day. Well that's like that's

933
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:39,620
that's like a superhero origin

934
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:44,380
where it's like I touched like an ungrounded wire and it blasted my toes

935
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,380
off and turned me into horseman.

936
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:54,180
Dude, I was like looking at different people who had this story the other day

937
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:58,660
and I saw one guy who was he was working on a movie set and he lost six toes.

938
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,660
Goddamn.

939
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,860
Working on a movie set lost six fucking toes.

940
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:02,860
That's crazy.

941
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,860
So cool dude.

942
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,860
That's sick.

943
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,860
Yeah and he called it a near-death experience.

944
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,860
No.

945
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:07,860
It was like six toes man.

946
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,860
No.

947
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:12,620
of fucking kill you, dickhead. That's nothing, yeah. You know? But I honestly I don't know

948
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,820
what the long-term effects of electricity in the body is so maybe... Maybe, yeah. I don't

949
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,820
know, maybe he is... No, he's wrong. Six toes. He's probably fine, six toes. You still have

950
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:23,820
four left. Yeah, dude, that's enough. You could be... That's a lot of toes. You could

951
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,380
be... Can you imagine showing up to like... Imagine, imagine, imagine seeing like an insect

952
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,140
or a snake or something and complaining to it like, "Oh, I only have four toes." Yeah.

953
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:41,940
Yeah, or showing a baby Paralympics. Mm-hmm like okay. What's your para and you're like I have four toes instead of yeah

954
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:46,980
If you lose a toe like even one toe you do have to like relearn how to walk not me

955
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:53,740
Yeah, I want my heels all the time. Yeah, it doesn't matter if I lose you take all I I walk on only my left

956
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,540
Big toe, so if I lose that one, I'm fucked but any of the other one. Yeah, it's

957
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:03,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right topic number two songs

958
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:09,780
I mean, we talk about songs.

959
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,980
Yeah, I mean I love songs.

960
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,260
You love songs, I don't really like songs.

961
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,260
You don't like songs?

962
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,260
I don't like music that much.

963
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:18,420
I'm in the, I used to like music a lot more than I do.

964
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,380
I mean I like music a lot but I just don't listen to it that much anymore.

965
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,380
I don't listen to anything.

966
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,380
I listen to...

967
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,140
It's very funny, it's so like yeah, it's just like, oh I moved to a city where like I can

968
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:31,580
like go around, walk around and talk to people and I don't listen to music anymore.

969
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:32,820
Yeah, music is for losers today.

970
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,540
It's literally for like, like pussies who sit inside all day.

971
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,540
Yeah.

972
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:41,580
You know, like when I, nothing going on, I listen to so much music and my life was dog

973
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:42,580
shit.

974
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,580
Yeah.

975
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,580
Right.

976
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,140
But I was like, but hey, yeah, hey, I, Elliot Smith is good.

977
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,820
You know, now the only songs I like, I like Pitbull.

978
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:58,220
Like the Pitbull J-Lo song that's like, that's like, I don't remember what it's called.

979
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,220
See that's the thing.

980
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,180
You know that somebody has a good life if their favorite song, they don't even know the

981
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:05,820
name of it. Because they just hear it. They don't care. It's on everywhere. The other

982
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:11,580
good song, Cascada, Evacuate the Dance Floor. Oh yeah. You know what's a really good song

986
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:37,800
When he goes like, "I'll fly with you" and in that like in the high-pitched voice. It's

987
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:42,240
a great song. It's good. It's so good. What's that other one? Eric Pride, "Call

988
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:49,000
on Me." Call on me, call on me, call on me, call on me. I don't know. You don't know that?

989
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,840
I don't know it. You must not be a dancer. I'm not a dancer. I am. Yeah. I found out

990
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,360
recently if I go any if I go to anywhere with music you dance with

991
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:02,080

00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,920
I will dance the night away absolutely no when if you're dancing with your girl

994
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,800

995
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,600

996
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,220
with a woman. And I don't want to be seen with her also is the other thing. Yeah.

997
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,520
I mean but if I go like we were in Atlantic City I'd dance the night away.

1019
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,180
It's so funny because the bride walks out and it's like, you know, like you're crazy bitch

1020
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:04,760
But the way you fuck I'm on top, you know that whole thing and then and there's like it's like it's like a wedding

1021
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,200
wedding. So there's like kids and stuff there and like right in front like

1022
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,200
someone's filming and you can see like right in front of the person filming

1023
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,600
like saying slightly the side is like a dad and like a son and the dad is

1024
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:20,600

1027
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,900
before our wedding. We're looking at the wedding playlist. If she chooses

1028
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:40,900
single song with the word slut, whore, or boyfriend in it, I'm not getting married.

1029
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,580
The wedding is off.

1030
00:47:42,580 --> 00:47:43,580
That's a red flag.

1031
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:49,140
If your girl likes any music that is sung by a girl, huge red flag.

1032
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,140
Absolutely.

1033
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:57,340
But if, on the other hand, if we're looking over, I see any songs with the words "Happy

1034
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:03,660
birthday or Cameron in there that's I'm

1035
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,980
not signing a prenup yeah if she thinks

1036
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
it were if she wants to honestly and I'm

1037
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,620
gonna try to pretend to argue or like

1038
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,300
like talk her out of it yeah if she

1039
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:13,100
honestly comes in she's like I want to

1040
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,700
play the happy birthday song about you

1041
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,300
at our wedding I'm like I'm buying

1042
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,860
second-rate such a funny first dance

1043
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,900

00:48:24,900 --> 00:48:34,580
first it's only one of you really mad yeah but then but then they're like and

1045
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:43,700
now for their second dance the happy birthday are you what okay well that's

1046
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:48,740
songs the third one I've been excited to get to this topic for our conversation

1047
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:52,460
the third one is something in the room so we've talked about everything in my

1048
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,560
apartment I feel like we could find some stuff what the fuck it is of any

1049
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:59,960
interest in this fucking this well there's a record player right there so

1050
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:08,160
what song would you want to play on let's see do I have anything anything fun in

1051
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,600
here I have I don't know it's raining outside that's not in the room but I'm

1052
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,720
pretty upset about that I can open the window I don't think you should do that

1053
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,440
Then it'd be in the room though.

1054
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,360
That's a good point.

1055
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,400
There's a lit candle over there.

1056
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:26,760
Yeah, I did that because my house smells like such shit today.

1057
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:27,760
Yeah.

1058
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,000
Yeah, because I have probably 40 days worth of dishes in the shower.

1059
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,000
Are you a candle guy?

1060
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,200
Do you get candles a lot?

1061
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:34,840
Do you light scented candles and stuff?

1062
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,840
I used to.

1063
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:40,240
Whenever I'd go to Ikea, I'd get like, I would buy nothing except like $40 worth of candles

1064
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:41,320
and I'd light them all the time.

1065
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:43,880
I've never been a scented candle guy.

1066
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,160
I just got one that's like pumpkin something scented and it smells like too good.

1067
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:49,160
Really?

1068
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Like I can't.

1069
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
I don't do that.

1070
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,440
This is like, this one's called like laundry.

1071
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:55,560
I can't be like walking around the house and smelling dessert.

1072
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
Yeah.

1073
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
It's too nice.

1074
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,560
It's too.

1075
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:01,760
I also, you don't like, I feel like whenever I go to, you know what the worst is?

1076
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,200
You go over to someone's house for dinner, right?

1077
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,840
They tell you like, we're making lasagna, we're making fucking like chicken pot pie,

1078
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,920
something like that.

1079
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,840
walk in they have like a Fruit Loops scented candle.

1080
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
Yeah, no that literally happened to me.

1081
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,840
Yeah, it was like I was eating dinner.

1082
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:22,840
We're eating, I think we were just having like pasta.

1083
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:24,840
And yeah, it was smelling like pumpkin.

1084
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,840
It's like, dude, what am I supposed to do? I want dessert now.

1085
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,840
I want the pumpkin so badly.

1086
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,840
You're fucking ruining my appetite. I want a pumpkin so bad.

1087
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,840
Have you ever had just a raw pumpkin?

1088
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,840
I've never eaten it.

1089
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:36,840
Really? I mean, I've carved a pumpkin before.

1090
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:38,840
You've never eaten raw pumpkin before? No, why would I do that?

1091
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
Just see what it tastes like. No.

1092
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,340
It looks disgusting. It doesn't even- it smells like shit.

1093
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:48,340
Why does it- how is- how is that possibly the same thing as pumpkin pie?

1094
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,540
Raw pumpkin is a gross enough looking food that if you eat it I think there's

1095
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,240
something wrong with you mentally.

1096
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,240
It's not even food. That is not something you should put in your mouth ever, I don't think.

1097
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:00,240
That's like if you were like- were like found a dog shit and you're like,

1098
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,740
"Oh, I just wonder what it tastes like."

1099
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,040
That's not true. They don't make pie out of dog shit, Cameron.

1100
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,740
Oh wait, wait, wait, quick editor's note.

1101
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,540
We're at the first argument of our conversation.

1102
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:16,060
so this is actually this is huge but pumpkin literally looks like like it's

1103
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:19,940
like looks like a David Cronenberg special effect pumpkin literally it's so fucked

1104
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:26,980
up it looks like this like weird jagged smile and then two triangle eyes yeah

1105
00:51:26,980 --> 00:51:30,540
what are you gonna do it does when you cut open a pumpkin to carve it it looks

1106
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:34,380
horrible inside yeah it looks like a spider web and you want to eat that I

1107
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:39,860
don't want to eat you said you did wait there's a movie where the like the alien

1108
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:44,180
goo looks exactly like pumpkin shit. Oh, it's the Super Mario Brothers movie.

1109
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:48,580
Yeah. There's like some, they get like stuck in some shit in that that just

1110
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:52,580
looks like the inside of a pumpkin. Mm-hmm. Like that weird like spiderweb

1111
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:57,940
orange like nasty membrane. That's so gross. It is disgusting. You ever put your hand in a

1112
00:51:57,940 --> 00:52:02,140
pumpkin? Yeah. But those seeds are damn good if you toast them. Seeds are so good. It's fucked up.

1113
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:07,700
Yeah, I hate like, I hate stuff on my hands, like slime on my hands and stuff.

1114
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:11,700
carving pumpkins was a real test for me as a kid.

1115
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,700
Especially because you love knives so much.

1116
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,700
Yeah, well you don't use a knife with the difficult part is scooping out the, you know.

1117
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,700
I don't even do that.

1118
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,700
That's what I mean. You don't scoop out the stuff.

1119
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,700
What am I going to set on fire?

1120
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:24,700
How do you light it if you don't scoop it out?

1121
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:25,700
Gasoline.

1122
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,700
You just put, it's a bowl, you put gasoline in it and you set it on fire.

1123
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,700
But it's not a bowl until you scoop it out.

1124
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,700
It's pretty much hollow.

1125
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,700
No.

1126
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,700
It's pretty hollow.

1127
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:38,040
- There's seeds and tentacles in there.

1128
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,640
- I don't care, those can burn, those can go to hell.

1129
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,140
I don't care.

1130
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,980
It's easy, dude.

1131
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:43,800
- Yeah.

1132
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,020
- Do you think it's scary to harvest pumpkins?

1133
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:49,360
- Probably, if you saw one with the face, it would be scary.

1134
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,660
- What if you walked out there,

1135
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:51,500
and you have to harvest them at night?

1136
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,220
- It would be scary if there was like a monster

1137
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,540
in there with you too, I would think.

1138
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,780
- You have to harvest pumpkins at night, that's the thing.

1139
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,060
- Well yeah, they go bad in the day.

1140
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,420
- They go bad during the day, you have one hour,

1141
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,820
the witching hour is what it's called.

1142
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:03,640
- Yeah.

1143
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,420
- And you have to harvest them,

1144
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:08,900
because it's which pumpkins are ripe, these ones, and you get them.

1145
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:09,900
Yeah.

1146
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:13,100
And they, it's got to be terrifying.

1147
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,100
Yeah.

1148
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,100
Right?

1149
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,660
You walk out there, all of them just looking at you.

1150
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:21,700
And confusing too, because if you have, you'll need scarecrows for your pumpkin patch so

1151
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:24,500
these crows don't eat the pumpkins, don't carry the pumpkins away.

1152
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:26,340
How scary can you make a farm?

1153
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:28,860
And a lot of those scarecrows, if you want them to be really scary, they're going to

1154
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:31,100
have to have a jack-o-lantern for a head.

1155
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,100
Yeah.

1156
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,380
dark out in the night, how are you going to be sure you're harvesting the right

1157
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:39,340
pumpkin and not pulling the head off your scarecrow? Exactly. It's confusing.

1158
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:44,140
Yeah. No, no. I mean how scary can a farm be that has a pumpkin field, pumpkin patch,

1159
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:50,580
and a scarecrow? That is one of the scariest farms. And a robot ghost. Yeah. That'd be

1160
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:55,300
pretty fucking scary. Yeah. Right? That would be really scary. Also if the farmer was

1161
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,140
evil I wouldn't want to stay over at his house. I mean you have to be some kind of

1162
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,220
evil to choose pumpkin as your livelihood, right?

1163
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,220
Yeah.

1164
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:07,660
You know, because it's not like if you make, if you are a corn grower, right?

1165
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:10,060
Every other night have a couple of years of corn with dinner.

1166
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:17,700
Back to the sorting hat thing where when you decide to be a farmer, you go to farm warts

1167
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:24,420
or whatever and they put a sorting, it looks like a straw farmer's hat, right?

1168
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,420
That's pretty good.

1169
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,420
They put a sorting hat and it'll tell you what crop.

1170
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,540
And everyone who gets pumpkin, they look exactly like Jack Skellington.

1171
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,260
Oh, they're already kind of scary looking people.

1172
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,260
Yeah, pumpkin claw.

1173
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:35,260
That makes sense.

1174
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,260
Yeah, pumpkin claw.

1175
00:54:36,260 --> 00:54:37,260
Corn puff.

1176
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,260
That's what corn farmers have.

1177
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,260
Corn puff?

1178
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:40,260
Yep.

1179
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:41,260
Sounds so good.

1180
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:42,260
And then there's tobacco slitherin.

1181
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:43,260
Yeah, and then Appledore.

1182
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,260
Appledore.

1183
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:45,260
Yeah, and then there's a pumpkin.

1184
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:46,260
Yeah, and then there's a pumpkin.

1185
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1186
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1187
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1188
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:50,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1189
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1190
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:52,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1191
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1192
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1193
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1194
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,260
And then there's a pumpkin.

1195
00:54:56,260 --> 00:55:00,900
Those are the four options that you can grow.

1196
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,820
If you could farm one thing, what would it be?

1197
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:04,420
I don't think I would do one of those big...

1198
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:07,220
Does it have to be a thing you could actually farm?

1199
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:09,060
Because I would love to have it.

1200
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,060
I would love to...

1201
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:13,060
You know what, I'm going to say just for your sake because we are such best friends.

1202
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:14,060
No, it doesn't have to be.

1203
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:17,060
It can be anything in the world.

1204
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:23,540
If you could farm one thing, but it can be anything in the world, what would it be?

1205
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:24,540
DVDs.

1206
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,540
DVDs.

1207
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:27,460
- I would love to form DVDs.

1208
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,760
That would be so cool.

1209
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,420
- Would they be like DVDs that already exist,

1210
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,760
or new DVDs?

1211
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,140
- You could cross-pollinate them and whatever

1212
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:36,980
to make DVDs.

1213
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,360
So I could plant alien in the ground,

1214
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,520
I could plant predator in the ground,

1215
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,920
and then when alien grows,

1216
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,680
I could take some of the pollen from alien

1217
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,240
and put it into the predator plant,

1218
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,800
it would make alien versus predator DVD.

1219
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:50,640
- Wow.

1220
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:51,600
But then if you breed too many,

1221
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,860
you get a scary movie?

1222
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:53,700
- Yeah.

1223
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,540
- Yeah.

1224
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:55,540
Yeah, a parody movie.

1225
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:59,820
Yeah, so, and you, exactly, you could make new movies that people have never heard of

1226
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,820
before.

1227
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:04,380
The scary movie movies are like, they're like the cuties of DVDs.

1228
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,940
Yeah, they've been.

1229
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:10,740
Yeah, they've just been so fucking mutated from the, like, what they're supposed to be.

1230
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:11,740
Yeah, the baseline, yeah.

1231
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:16,860
There's so many different sugars in them that it's almost impossible to recognize them as

1232
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,860
what they really are.

1233
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:21,020
Yeah, well, there are just like a few baseline movies that are like, they're DVDs that are

1234
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,020
like the pure ones.

1235
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,740
Alright, what are your starter seeds that you're getting from Monsanto?

1236
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:30,140
You got it. You have to get you get a Frankenstein. Okay seed. Yeah, you get a one for every genre probably, right?

1237
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:36,340
Yeah, that's what you get like you get like a ten things. I hate about you. Maybe could be one. Yeah, you get

1238
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,900
Lord of the Rings

1239
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:44,700
Maybe one of the Lord of the Rings right off the bat. Uh-huh cross pollinating Frankenstein and Lord of the Rings. Yeah

1240
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:45,940
What are you getting?

1241
00:56:45,940 --> 00:56:52,420
Probably I would get um, I would probably get brain dead Peter Jackson's horror movie. It's a really good. Yeah, I think

1242
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,500
DVD former.

1243
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:55,500
Holy shit!

1244
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:59,380
You might be the best DVD former of all time.

1245
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,700
That's how the Redbox works, actually.

1246
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:04,420
I don't know if you know they have like a little incubator in there.

1247
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:07,580
It's like a little hydroponic DVD former there.

1248
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:13,020
We got my teenage son growing DVDs in his closet.

1249
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,020
R-rated too.

1250
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,020
Yeah.

1251
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,020
Oh no, yeah.

1252
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,020
No thanks.

1253
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,020
That was not good.

1254
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,020
Yeah, so what else is it?

1255
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,020
What else we got to talk about here?

1256
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,740
This conversation has been too beautiful.

1257
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,740
I know.

1258
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,740
Oh wow, it takes a turn.

1259
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,740
All right, let's hit them.

1260
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,740
We wanted to, okay, number four.

1261
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:34,860
So just to run through, the first one's food, then songs, then something in the room, and

1262
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,860
the fourth one is regrets.

1263
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:39,580
I mean, if we're going to try to have the most beautiful conversation ever, I feel like

1264
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:40,980
we do have to do these next two.

1265
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,980
Yeah.

1266
00:57:41,980 --> 00:57:47,140
You know, because I feel like every beautiful conversation has to have a curve to it, right?

1267
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,980
Yeah, a moment when it gets real.

1268
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,980
Exactly.

1269
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:50,980
So let's get real.

1270
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:57,980
That's your biggest regret in your entire life, but it can be anything in the world.

1271
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,980
It can be anything, probably DVDs.

1272
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:04,980
I don't know.

1273
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:13,980
I really regret not, I probably regret like not investing in Apple or something.

1274
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,140
The worst answer I've ever heard.

1275
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:22,420
I was trying to think of a really bad answer that didn't have to say anything about my

1276
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,420
life.

1277
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:28,860
I probably regret, honestly, I probably regret, I wish I was still vegan.

1278
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,860
Yeah.

1279
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:32,660
I wish, yeah, because I quit being vegan when I was like 18.

1280
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,900
And now I feel like my life is noticeably worse.

1281
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:40,420
I feel like I have a more evil life because I'm not vegan anymore.

1282
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:44,820
Yeah, especially once you quit being vegan, it's hard to go back.

1283
00:58:44,820 --> 00:58:46,580
I know that it's probably very easy.

1284
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,580
Mentally it's like impossible.

1285
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:50,580
Mentally it's hard because it's like yeah, why would I...

1286
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:52,580
Because everything about my life would have to change.

1287
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:54,580
It's also like, well I already put in the time.

1288
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:56,580
I'm already not evil.

1289
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:58,580
I feel like I earned my way into heaven.

1290
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,580
And then I quit and then I...

1291
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,580
And now I'm slowly kind of inching back towards hell.

1292
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:06,580
And at some point I'll have to make a turn.

1293
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:08,580
But I always, I remember as a kid I was like,

1294
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:12,580
I'm probably going to go to heaven if I at least am vegan for one year before I die.

1295
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,580
Yeah.

1296
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:19,180
I still, I mean, depends on when I die, but probably being vegan, yeah.

1297
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,980
Because also, I was vegan when it was fucking hard as shit.

1298
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,180
There was nothing good.

1299
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,180
It is insane, seems insanely easy to be vegan right now.

1300
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,280
Especially like in New York.

1301
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:36,280
Yeah, moving from Boston here, like so much, so many fucking vegan freaks here.

1302
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,480
It's so easy to accidentally eat vegan too here.

1303
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,680
To like go somewhere and then find out, "Oh, I'm not even eating, this isn't chicken."

1304
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:43,180
Yeah.

1305
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:46,180
I didn't even realize when I ordered it.

1306
00:59:46,180 --> 00:59:49,180
There's that place in Bushwick that has those really good chicken sandwiches.

1307
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:51,180
That place is good. I've been there twice.

1308
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:52,180
Damn. Really good.

1309
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:53,180
You're addicted, dude.

1310
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,180
Well, we went once and then I went once.

1311
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:56,180
You have an addiction.

1312
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,180
I have an addiction to vegan chicken.

1313
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,180
Also, I've been offered...

1314
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:04,180
My other regret is I've been offered a lot more drugs than I've done in my life.

1315
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:06,180
I wish that I'd done it every time.

1316
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:10,180
I don't think that I've ever been offered enough drugs to hurt me.

1317
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:16,020
Yeah, and I think it probably would have been fun almost every single time. Yeah, you know, yeah

1318
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:18,060
Yeah, I wish I wish I'd either

1319
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:25,040
Started drinking earlier and never drank at all. Yeah, that's my that's probably if we're going there. That's my yeah, that's mine

1320
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,980
You would have been a you would have been a poet if you started drinking earlier. Oh, absolutely

1321
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:34,960
You would have been a beautiful. I don't think I didn't start drinking until I was like 18 or something

1322
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:40,040
Yeah, I was pretty much straight-edge damn for high school. I didn't know what straight-edge was

1323
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:44,680
was. If I had known what it was, I definitely would have called myself straight edge.

1324
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:50,760
Alright, and now death. What do you think happens when you die?

1325
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,320
I have no idea. I think...

1326
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,720
Do you ever think about it?

1327
01:00:53,720 --> 01:01:04,240
Oh yeah, a lot. Yeah. But I think probably it's like... it probably just... it probably...

1328
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:10,640
It's probably something that is so alien to how we experience life as we know it that it

1329
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,680
might as well just end because it's something so different.

1330
01:01:14,680 --> 01:01:19,580
Like it's the functional... and anything we can imagine it might as well just be that

1331
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:22,160
we stop existing because...

1332
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,160
Because it's not...

1333
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:24,160
You won't have...

1334
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,160
That's what I think.

1335
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,160
Even if there's something after you won't have some...

1336
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,000
You won't remember your birthday.

1337
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,160
You can't like conceive of it so it doesn't matter.

1338
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:33,160
You know what I mean?

1339
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:34,160
Yeah.

1340
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:37,500
you can make I mean it would be so cool if it was just like the far side heaven

1341
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:41,640
where you just like it's a hangout on a cloud like that literally that it is

1342
01:01:41,640 --> 01:01:45,240
funny that Christians found the best version of heaven like Jews for

1343
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:50,520
thousands of years we're like I don't know you like hang out in like a river

1344
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,500
or some shit I don't know yeah and then Christians were like you get to

1345
01:01:55,500 --> 01:01:59,240
basically hang out on a cloud made of cotton candy God is your best friend

1346
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,760
your entire family's there but only the ones that you like yeah who were good

1347
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:08,960
Yeah, there's unlimited Xbox you get to you know what you get two meals a day the third one you have to make yourself

1348
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:15,040
It is funny like like I like it makes Greek heaven was real ancient Greek heaven

1349
01:02:15,040 --> 01:02:17,600
What was it good to just like like a beautiful golden field?

1350
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,960
Just like boring dude. No, that'd be so nice

1351
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:26,320
DS no that's after you after you've lived like a full life, and you know like I

1352
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,440
Like and like you know when you went okay when if you died right now

1353
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:34,120
you would be really bored in a golden field but you're like 90 years old and

1354
01:02:34,120 --> 01:02:36,840
you're already like you just wanted to sit in your armchair and like do

1355
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:40,920
crosswords well I don't think it's like actual just you know like a waving

1356
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:45,120
beautiful yeah yeah yeah just a beautiful field yeah that would be so

1357
01:02:45,120 --> 01:02:49,880
nice and nice yeah yeah I feel like I'm I feel like I'm approaching that I feel

1358
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,080
like by the time I'm 30 I'll be pretty ready to die you know like old people

1359
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,240
like some people find comfort in the fact that like every old person which I

1360
01:02:57,240 --> 01:02:58,900
I don't know how this is comfortable to you.

1361
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,300
Every old person that you see over the age of 80,

1362
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,800
you ask them about death and they're like,

1363
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,360
I want to die so badly.

1364
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:06,700
They're like, I fucking wanna die.

1365
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:07,740
Except for Larry King.

1366
01:03:07,740 --> 01:03:11,400
Larry King was always, Larry King was very publicly like,

1367
01:03:11,400 --> 01:03:14,420
if I die, I hope I never die.

1368
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:16,260
And he's 90, he was 91 when he died.

1369
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:18,300
He was like, I'm terrified of death.

1370
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,140
If I--

1371
01:03:19,140 --> 01:03:21,460
- To never get over that, oh that must be hell.

1372
01:03:21,460 --> 01:03:23,300
- To be 91 years old, yeah.

1373
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:25,220
I like my entire life like, you know,

1374
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:28,300
You have a fear of death and then you see old people like that and you're like, "Oh, okay."

1375
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:29,660
So I guess at some point you figure it out.

1376
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:32,340
And then Larry King is like, "You'll never figure it out.

1377
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:33,340
It's always terrifying.

1378
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:37,940
It's always the most scary thing you can possibly imagine just not existing.

1379
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:39,860
It's so, so scary."

1380
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,860
And then he died.

1381
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,300
It's funny because Larry King is the scariest thing I can imagine.

1382
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,300
Yeah, exactly.

1383
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:48,380
Also, if I became Larry King, that would be the worst of my problem, or the least of my

1384
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:49,380
problems.

1385
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,380
I'm so scared.

1386
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:51,380
I'm terrified of mirrors.

1387
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:52,380
Yeah, exactly.

1388
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,460
and the front-facing camera on my phone.

1389
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:57,820
I'm terrified of my sons, they kind of look like me.

1390
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,520
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1391
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:01,140
But what was I saying?

1392
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:05,280
Oh, yeah, I feel like by 30 I will arrive at that place

1393
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,140
where I'm like, you could kill me and I don't care.

1394
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:11,900
- Yeah, there's a point where you do what you need to do.

1395
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:13,100
- How do you want to die?

1396
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:17,820
- Probably like suddenly and unexpectedly.

1397
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,380
I feel like knowing you're about to die

1398
01:04:21,380 --> 01:04:23,140
is probably the worst part.

1399
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,980
- Definitely.

1400
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:26,420
- I think like, yeah, if you know, like somebody like,

1401
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:30,140
like if you're like being held up, like with a gun

1402
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,620
and you're like, oh my God, I'm gonna die.

1403
01:04:31,620 --> 01:04:34,240
And then you die, that would probably suck really bad.

1404
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:38,020
Even if it was like, even if like you,

1405
01:04:38,020 --> 01:04:40,620
even if it didn't hurt, it would be like,

1406
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,940
I feel like that would probably be,

1407
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,940
I mean, I'm sure the pain would be really bad, but--

1408
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,260
- Pain, probably, who cares, gunshots.

1409
01:04:45,260 --> 01:04:46,660
- Yeah, but like, you know, like, yeah,

1410
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:48,500
standing there and be like, oh my God, oh my God,

1411
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:49,320
this is it.

1412
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,380
And then it actually happens.

1413
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:52,540
- You don't have like the release that would be like--

1414
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:54,620
- You know who had the biggest balls of all time?

1415
01:04:54,620 --> 01:04:55,460
- Who?

1416
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:57,780
- Was that guy who was on flight 93

1417
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:02,100
or one of the 9/11 flights and like somehow used a phone

1418
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:04,620
on the plane to call his wife and he's like,

1419
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,800
"Hey baby, I'm pretty much going through there

1420
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:09,620
"and I think I'm probably gonna die,

1421
01:05:09,620 --> 01:05:12,140
"but love you, all right, bye."

1422
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:12,980
- Oh my God, yeah.

1423
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:15,040
- That dude, the fact that he was not like trembling

1424
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:17,120
and screaming and also was like,

1425
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,740
"I guess I'll call my wife."

1426
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:21,940
Dude, I would not think to call anybody if I was in that situation.

1427
01:05:21,940 --> 01:05:26,300
No, dude. I would be like, I'd be like, I would be the person who jumped out of the

1428
01:05:26,300 --> 01:05:30,060
Twin Towers because they thought that they might have a chance of surviving by

1429
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:33,860
like, being like one of those cats who falls off of a building and

1430
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:35,860
doesn't break their legs.

1431
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:39,580
Yeah. Yeah, that's so depressing.

1432
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:42,580
That stuff. I don't think so.

1433
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,140
Just the phone call and stuff, so horrible.

1434
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,640
Yeah. I mean, I love to laugh about that stuff, but hey.

1435
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:51,640
That's the upside, right? Is that we talk about it every day.

1436
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,640
Funny as hell.

1437
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,640
I mean, that's low-key. I mean, it's the most depressing, horrible thing of all time.

1438
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:03,140
I mean, but just imagine like that you do that and then your phone, that's like your

1439
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:10,140
private last phone call to your wife and it's like what fucking like Milo Yiannopoulos posts

1440
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,140
like every year.

1441
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:12,140
Yeah, exactly.

1442
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,140
Yeah, it's so horrible.

1443
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,480
That's gotta suck, you know.

1444
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:17,420
I think anybody who died and then like had their death

1445
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,820
turned into like anything would probably be like,

1446
01:06:20,820 --> 01:06:22,500
at least at some point, be like,

1447
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:25,340
why is my family not like rich, right?

1448
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:27,900
Like if I was, anybody who ever got like killed

1449
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:31,420
by a police officer, I would be so pissed

1450
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:34,540
if my family did not become like billionaires.

1451
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:35,740
You know what I mean?

1452
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,740
It's like, dude, you're using my face and shit.

1453
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:40,460
Even just like, I should be getting royalties from CNN

1454
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:42,340
for just reporting on this shit.

1455
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:44,340
my family should be loaded right now

1456
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:46,500
art lightning round as we're over time here

1457
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,580
and also a hand on death

1458
01:06:48,580 --> 01:06:52,580
was fixes its securities uh...

1459
01:06:52,580 --> 01:06:54,060
my honestly

1460
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:57,860
sometimes if i go to do that showering only sitting down at my desk

1461
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:01,420
and i smell my own balls yeah i just smell

1462
01:07:01,420 --> 01:07:05,380
my balls which is the dislike you know three-time i'm always afraid that i

1463
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:09,420
somehow smell and don't realize it yeah because of their people there are people

1464
01:07:09,420 --> 01:07:10,800
there are people that

1465
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,020
that uh...

1466
01:07:12,020 --> 01:07:13,420
But also no one tells you if you smell like shit.

1467
01:07:13,420 --> 01:07:14,260
- Yeah, exactly.

1468
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,580
Yeah, there are people who will never know.

1469
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,140
And it's like, I'm not gonna tell them.

1470
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,980
- No, and we all know those people.

1471
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,860
And we, and everybody else, when they walk in,

1472
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:21,700
makes eye contact. - Yeah, exactly.

1473
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:23,180
- And when they leave, they're like,

1474
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:24,620
he smells like shit.

1475
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:25,740
- Yeah, yeah, it's crazy.

1476
01:07:25,740 --> 01:07:26,920
It's such a, yeah.

1477
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:29,640
- It's the funniest thing to be oblivious about.

1478
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:31,700
And then sometimes those people find like,

1479
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,540
significant others, and you're just like,

1480
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:35,860
how did that person, they must be like,

1481
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,980
made for each other.

1482
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,500
This is some pheromone that I don't understand.

1483
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:45,020
That is actually the most like, this is the horniest guy of all time or something.

1484
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:51,300
Number seven, throwback Thursdays.

1485
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:52,300
Love them.

1486
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:53,300
Okay, great.

1487
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:56,180
What is there to say that hasn't already been said about these?

1488
01:07:56,180 --> 01:07:57,520
Number eight, last things.

1489
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:58,580
Don't know what that means.

1490
01:07:58,580 --> 01:08:01,060
Number nine, bucket list.

1491
01:08:01,060 --> 01:08:02,980
Visit cop world.

1492
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:04,860
Well create cop world is it for me.

1493
01:08:04,860 --> 01:08:06,060
Yeah, that's good.

1494
01:08:06,060 --> 01:08:09,300
It's like a week two in one.

1495
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:10,300
Number 10, aging.

1496
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:12,260
I was thinking about this today though.

1497
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:18,420
I think I would go get some poor kid's blood put into me if I was rich enough.

1498
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:19,420
Yeah.

1499
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,420
Right?

1500
01:08:20,420 --> 01:08:21,420
That's a no-brainer.

1501
01:08:21,420 --> 01:08:22,420
Yeah.

1502
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:23,420
This kid is not going to miss his blood.

1503
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:24,420
He's young and virile.

1504
01:08:24,420 --> 01:08:25,420
He'll make more.

1505
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:26,420
He has a heart still.

1506
01:08:26,420 --> 01:08:31,940
If I'm 60 years old and I miss one boner, one of my 8 a.m. boners that I have every single

1507
01:08:31,940 --> 01:08:37,180
day and I have more than $100 in my bank account, I'm taking some kid's blood.

1508
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,180
Absolutely.

1509
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:39,580
Number 11, life goals.

1510
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:42,100
I would like to be the most famous person on the earth.

1511
01:08:42,100 --> 01:08:44,660
- I'd pretty much like to be the superstar from the future.

1512
01:08:44,660 --> 01:08:45,580
- Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

1513
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:48,220
Number 12, the last one is zodiac sign.

1514
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,780
- I think I'm an Aries Spears.

1515
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:51,380
- I know, I'm a Cancer.

1516
01:08:51,380 --> 01:08:55,680
I'm a Cancer.

1517
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,740
- Wow.

1518
01:08:57,740 --> 01:09:00,340
- Yeah. - Wow.

1519
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:02,140
- All right.

1520
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,900
(laughing)

1521
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,320
- Bye. - Bye, everybody.
