2

Let me see your butt.

(laughing)

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,040
(explosion)

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,760
- Your doppelganger is Buck Angel.

10
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,920
- That's not true.

11
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,760
- Yeah.

12
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:17,840
- I also was saying that my doppelganger at the gym

13
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,360
looks like me but has hair.

14
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,200
- Buck Angel.

15
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,840
- Buck Angel, does Buck Angel have hair?

16
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,960
- I don't know.

17
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:23,920
- I don't even know.

18
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,400
- Has hair down there.

19
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,240
- That's not--

20
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,060
- On his pussy.

21
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,220
I don't care about if he has hair on his pussy, man.

22
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,580
That's not my, I'm talking about a doppelganger.

23
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,460
- Wait, you have a doppelganger with hair down there?

24
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:38,300
Is that what you're saying?

25
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,120
- I didn't see the down there.

26
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,220
There's a guy at the gym, he has almost the exact same--

27
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:43,140
- Where he was in the shower where you saw his hair?

28
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:45,780
- The showers are closed at Blink Fitness, actually.

29
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,300
- Okay, so you were in-- - Why?

30
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:48,900
- Because of what I did. - His shower.

31
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,720
- What?

32
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,660
- You were in his shower to see his hair.

33
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,500
- Yeah, I was in his shower.

34
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,620
- Or he was just naked on the machine.

35
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,820
- Yeah, he was on the naked squat rack,

36
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:56,180
showing his asshole at the bottom of the squat.

37
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,060
my favorite machine at the time. Me too. I love waiting for that machine a lot. I love

38
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,500
going and waiting. Yeah, when it's my turn I go, "Oh, never mind." I actually just realized

39
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,060
I have to go to lunch. I'm too nervous. I actually just realized my weakness would stop

40
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:12,540
me from using this machine, so I have to leave. Yeah, I have to leave. But you can go ahead

41
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,340
of me. Yeah, go ahead. Actually, I'm waiting on somebody else. We're going to do a double

42
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:21,060
squat on this. Yeah, so go ahead. So just go ahead and do naked squats on this machine.

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:25,780
And my text ringtone is a camera sound, so don't worry about it. It's just playing like

44
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:32,820
a cannon how do you make that with your mouth you know that's how I learned that

45
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,140
sound is the winder you're a wine no way at the bottom wait that's the winder

46
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,660
it's not the shutter holy fucking shit it wasn't the shutter it was the winder

47
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:43,820
that I always wondered that I thought that must be the shutter cuz I got the

48
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,700
power winder we're gonna get fucking asshole we never wondered that we're

49
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:53,460
just saying bullshit oh jeez don't put down your Patrick I have the perfect

50
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:59,420
thing to cheer you up. Me and Caleb are working on something. Don't roll over my charger.

51
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,860
I think you're really going to like it. I'm sorry. I care about it if it's a one. Alright,

52
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,380
you're breaking something I can't talk about. Don't get near my, don't slap me. Do you even

53
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:13,420
want to hear this thing that Caleb and I prepared for you? Getting these rolly chairs is like

54
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:17,740
the worst. I shouldn't be sitting in this. Yeah, I don't know why you are. I just didn't

55
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:22,500
feel like anyone else used. I didn't want to move that. Then don't. Yeah. But me and Caleb

56
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,180
prepared something for you. He really doesn't care and he doesn't want to hear it.

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,620
That's fine. I guess we'll just, you know what, let's end the episode. We'll do a two minute

58
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:33,660
and fifteen second episode. Okay, that seems like what Patrick wants. Okay, just hit stop

59
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,940
record Patrick. You can say whatever you want now. Okay, I just, okay, it's paused.

60
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:42,860
It would be funny if we did put out like a two minute episode and then another one hour

61
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,500
one, but. You fucking idiot, I didn't pause it. That was all caught on tape. Now the fans

62
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,460
hear you for what you really are. And now one of these other podcasts is going to steal

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:52,460
I'm actually going to pause it now.

64
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,460
Okay, it's paused.

65
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:58,460
Go ahead, say everything you've always wanted to say off air.

66
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:01,460
What the hell?

67
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,460
No, of course not.

68
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:07,460
I'm going to have to cut that out.

69
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,460
Okay, I'm actually going to...

70
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:14,460
We pretended to pause and then had to cut out whatever Patrick said.

71
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Okay, I'm actually going to pause it now, Patrick, so you can say whatever you want.

72
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:24,460
it

73
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,460
I actually paused it.

74
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,460
I actually paused it.

75
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
Can you pause it though?

76
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,620
I have to pee.

77
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,300
He doesn't have to pee, he's lying.

78
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,860
Okay, it's paused Patrick.

79
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,860
Yeah, go ahead.

80
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,860
Go pee.

81
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,860
How are you so quick with that button?

82
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:39,860
How are you so quick with that button?

83
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,860
I did it twice.

84
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,860
You didn't have to pee, I fucking knew it, you fucking liar.

85
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:45,860
You just wanted to give him a pause.

86
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,860
I wanted to give him a...

87
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,860
Okay, fine, I'll pause it.

88
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,860
I'll pause it.

89
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,860
Okay, it's paused.

90
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:50,860
It's paused.

91
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,860
It's paused, bro.

92
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,400
Say whatever you need to say.

93
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
- Hold on, can we restart the episode?

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,240
- You wanna restart the episode now?

95
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,840
- Yeah, we can restart the whole thing.

96
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,160
- Okay, we're restarting right?

97
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,980
- Okay.

98
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,240
- I'm in a sour mood. - Okay, I just restarted it.

99
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,080
- I'm in a sour mood.

100
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,520
- I just restarted it. - Why are you in a sour mood?

101
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,480
- 'Cause I just feel like fucking shit.

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
- Why do you feel like shit?

103
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,480
- Depression and anxiety.

104
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,400
- A combination of the two?

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,520
- A combination of the two.

106
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,040
- Are they interacting with each other?

107
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,960
- They're interacting in a very harsh way.

108
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,960
- That's a deadly combo.

109
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,680
That can actually kill you by suicide.

110
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,320
Have you ever thought about just killing yourself,

111
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,360
just ending it all?

112
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,620
(laughing)

113
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,360
- Just fucking ending, just ending it all.

114
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,200
Either one of you.

115
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,020
- I started seeing--

116
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:31,860
- If you guys ever just been like,

117
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,520
"Oh fuck, I'm just gonna fucking kill myself."

118
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,280
- I started seeing a psychiatrist

119
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,880
'cause I was talking about getting on Adderall again

120
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,560
so I can actually focus.

121
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:43,220
And one of the first screening questions was like,

122
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,040
"Have you ever thought about killing yourself?"

123
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
And I was like, "Well yeah, duh."

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,880
- Yeah, I did.

125
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
(laughing)

126
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,540
- Yeah.

127
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,400
- What kind of fucking psycho goes into a--

128
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,240
- Doesn't, yeah.

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,240
doesn't want to kill himself.

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,240
Not even want to, but doesn't say like,

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,240
"Oh yeah, no, I've actually, wow, you know what?

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,240
I've never even thought about it."

133
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
"I've never even, that's never even crossed my mind,

134
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,240
killing myself."

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,240
The fact that I even said, the fact that I said "duh" too,

136
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,240
like, I said, "Yeah, duh," and then she wrote something down.

137
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,240
"Duh, have you ever thought of killing yourself?"

138
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,240
She wrote something down, like, immediately,

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,240
and I was like, "Oh, fuck."

140
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,240
One of the worst things as a...

141
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,240
And then I got, and she was like, "I think I'm gonna put you on Wellbutrin."

142
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,400
a straightjacket. One of the worst things about being a psychiatrist would have to be when

143
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,860
you're giving someone a screening like that and you ask them, "Oh, have you ever thought

144
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,560
of killing yourself?" And they just go like, "Oh!" And a lightbulb goes on over their face

145
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:40,440
and they run out of the office. I don't think I need you anymore. Are you using these scissors?

146
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,760
That'd be a really horrible way to kill yourself is running with scissors. Yeah, it'd take so

147
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:50,000
damn long. We used to get in elementary school, in elementary school we used to get these

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,400
stickers if they were called they were the the South School Hawks like the

149
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,360
Hawks stickers. Go Hawks. Go Hawks dude. Go South School Hawks.

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,760
So they were they were the red white and blue stickers there's the red

151
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:08,440
for respect white for responsibility and blue for safety and if you did something

152
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:16,720
Is that what the flag stands for? Yeah. Wow. The South School Hawks flag. Okay. So the you would

153
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,720
get the stickers for being an exemplary,

154
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,000
being an example of those three things

155
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,840
in the mission statement.

156
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,320
- Any one of them or all three combined?

157
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,760
- If you got all three in one day

158
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,000
and you were walking around with red, white, and blue,

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,960
you were a goaded student.

160
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,800
- Holy shit.

161
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,840
- But I saw, one time I just looked at my teacher

162
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,000
and I was like, hey, I just had an idea

163
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,160
'cause I think I had a red sticker

164
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,900
and I was like, I know how I'm gonna get a blue.

165
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
I know how I'm gonna do it.

166
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,820
And I was like, I walked up to my teacher and I was like,

167
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,180
I think when you walk with scissors,

168
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,340
you should walk with them facing down.

169
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,220
(laughing)

170
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,340
And then the kid sitting, I got back to my seat

171
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,880
and the kid who's sitting next to me is just like,

172
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,300
I know you only said that for the sticker.

173
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,740
It's like, yeah, fucking of course

174
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,220
I only said it for the sticker.

175
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,900
- Did you guys have show and tell in your school?

176
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,340
- We didn't have show and tell.

177
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:16,300
In German class, we had cultural tidbits,

178
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,420
where we would have to bring in a thing about Germany

179
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,660
that we learned on our own.

180
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,100
We had, at my school I went to until like sixth grade,

181
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,140
we had like mandatory show and tell.

182
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:25,960
That's fire.

183
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,800
Everybody had to bring something in.

184
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,020
And I had some pretty fucking fail show and tells, bro.

185
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,860
Yeah?

186
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,620
Yeah, I was bringing in fucking DVDs.

187
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,100
(laughing)

188
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,140
I was bringing in whatever, bro.

189
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,580
I was showing my lunch.

190
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,860
Oh yeah, dude, we, what was this?

191
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:41,620
My friend Ian in first grade brought in the,

192
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:47,860
I think we were, I want to say, straight up, I know this isn't true, but I want to say that

193
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,780
we were learning about eggs.

194
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,180
That's not a crazy thing to learn about.

195
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:55,940
But then he brought in his GameCube copy of Billy Hatcher.

196
00:07:55,940 --> 00:08:00,940
You know what we need to do is get a homunculus growing at the office, get an egg and put

197
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,500
all of our, we could just do like a sperm box.

198
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,460
I'll take it and I'll administer it with a hypodermic needle.

199
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,900
I'd rather you administer that in front of us.

200
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:14,020
i really want you know what i was i don't know i don't waste your guys time so you

201
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:18,700
guys get is not in like a vile here i'm very protective of my spurs you know

202
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:21,920
yes a lot of them again not in a cardboard box

203
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,740
whenever i know that you know plastic bags there any female fans would be

204
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,980
interested in buying a combination slurry of the three of our spurs

205
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,420
splitting

206
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:35,340
and we could just see what the kid looks like who who's from one

207
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,980
we have competition

208
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,980
What the fuck is wrong with you?

209
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,980
Buying the slurry of sperms.

210
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
Why would you even...

211
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,980
Some fucking psycho is gonna message us.

212
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,980
I don't think so. I don't think...

213
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,980
Some psycho is gonna message us and say

214
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,980
"Give me your sperm slurry now!"

215
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Wouldn't you be interested to know whose sperm was the fastest and won the competition?

216
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,980
Well, I already know it's me.

217
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:01,980
And I don't need...

218
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,980
See, that's what I mean. I know it's me.

219
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:10,100
I don't need some crazy woman and I know I actually know that it's camera it

220
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,820
shoots out really fast it's not that my sperms are fast but they're really

221
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:21,100
clever the other ones really good tortoise in the hair I don't want I don't

222
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:25,100
want to race straight to the egg and get tired of minor my number two guns - I

223
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,100
don't want messages from crazy women saying drain your sperm into a bag and

224
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:37,100
send it to me. A bag? It would be fucking, first of all, a latex bag. First of all, we get a contract. A latex bag with an udder.

225
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,100
You get a contract that says no matter whose sperm it is, we ain't helping with that baby. That's right. Even a little bit.

226
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:48,100
And you can't abort it. Yeah, you can't abort it because if you do, we'll get kind of mad because we won't know who it looked the most like.

227
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:53,100
There's a clause in it that says if you abort the kid. You must raise it to at least 18. And then you can abort it. Yeah.

228
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,640
The I for an I clause, if you abort the kid, we...

229
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
We abort another baby.

230
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,640
We abort a baby at random.

231
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,940
Yeah, no, I was going to say we abort you.

232
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
Oh, shit.

233
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:06,020
We get Agent 47 to abort you.

234
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:09,420
And that's the I for an I clause, and that's legally binding.

235
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:12,460
I have a strong feeling that kid's going to pop out looking like Agent 47.

236
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,460
No.

237
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,460
Yeah, I think so.

238
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,260
I think until it's like three, maybe it'll look like Agent 47.

239
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
No.

240
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,260
I think until it's about...

241
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,260
That's true.

242
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,260
Caleb has an edge right at the beginning.

243
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Yeah.

244
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,260
Oh, it looks just like me.

245
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,260
Oh, shit.

246
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,780
Yeah, but if it's a girl, it would look like you two downstairs.

247
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
That's all I'm saying.

248
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Sorry?

249
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,540
What are you so concerned about a baby's downstairs for?

250
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,540
You are.

251
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,540
You are.

252
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
You are.

253
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,540
Okay, reverse.

254
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Didn't say that.

255
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,540
I didn't say any of that.

256
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,540
Draw four.

257
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:46,660
You're about to draw four for my son who is going to come out of this woman.

258
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,660
Green seven.

259
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,500
You're going to draw four because you're teaching him alphabets.

260
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,500
Green 8.

261
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,500
Green 9, fucking easy.

262
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,500
Ok, green 1.

263
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
Yellow 1.

264
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
Black 2.

265
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Black 2?

266
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,500
There's no...

267
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,500
He means draw 2.

268
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
No, I mean black 2.

269
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Oh, then yeah, you're cheating.

270
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,500
He made his own fucking card.

271
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
He made up his own card.

272
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
Dose, that's what I'm playing.

273
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Holographic 2.

274
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Oh, uno.

275
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,500
I forgot to say uno.

276
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Oh shit, fuck you.

277
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
But, you guys don't think that's a good idea?

278
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,780
Did you ever do a Dose rule?

279
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
No.

280
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
In Uno?

281
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:24,780
What's a Dose rule?

282
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:25,780
You have to call Dose too.

283
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,780
Uno's so fucking fun.

284
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
Uno is fun as fuck.

285
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,780
Uno's fun as fuck.

286
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,860
We used to play Uno at the lunch table in high school.

287
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
In high school?

288
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,900
Yeah, one day someone was like, "Hey, I just found a bunch of Uno cards."

289
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:35,900
And I was just like, "Alright, fuck it.

290
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,900
We're gonna play Uno."

291
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:37,900
I didn't go to public high school.

292
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
And then we kept doing it.

293
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,100
I thought by then everybody was just fucking fingering each other and shit.

294
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
Yeah.

295
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:46,340
I also went to a very small high school.

296
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,340

00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,340
- Swag.

320
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,060
- And it was just, I don't know, it was kind of weird.

321
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,900
It was kind of like, I feel like he was like a guy

322
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,300
who did like nude yoga with his wife.

323
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,380

- The older I'm getting, and I'm getting old, right?

327
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,780
The older I'm getting, I'm starting to re-imagine

328
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,920
all the things that i think are cool in this world

329
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,460

00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:21,140
cringe i think is based basically that's the truth you know i i don't like the

331
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,080

That's a good idea.

339
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:42,940
That is a good idea.

340
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:43,760
Maybe we can get like a--

341
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,180

342
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,100
Like a, what's the other one?

343
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,260
What's the other brand?

344
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,240
Patek Philippe.

345
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:51,220
AP.

346
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,940
Cartier.

347
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,220
Audemars Piguet.

348
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,060
Is it Cartier?

349
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,940
I started getting Cartier watch ads on my Instagram.

350
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,780
It thinks I'm rich.

351
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,420
It's kind of made me go like, oh my, oh.

352
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,900
You're gonna join the 700, or the 500 club?

353
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
Yeah, 'cause I'm gonna turn 500.

354
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:08,220
What's the 500 club?

355
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,780
Is that the, if you work for a Fortune 500?

356
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,620
Or is that just--

357
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,460
- I don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:14,300
- Yeah, I'm not sure I do either.

359
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,780
- I don't even know what I'm talking about.

360
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,300
- The Fortune 500, you're saying it's,

361
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,460
so there's a Fortune 500, but then if you work for that,

362
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,340
you're in a club?

363
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,380
- You're in the club, the Fortune 500 club.

364
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,220
- I mean, now listen, buddy,

365
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,040
I know about the Mile High Club

366
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,060
and I've been a member since fucking sex ed.

367
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,100
- Yeah. - Yeah.

368
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,060
- Yeah.

369
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,940
- I don't think putting all of our sperms

370
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,540
in a slurry would work.

371
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,740
- I think it would be fine.

372
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,900
- I think that's a fucking very valid way

373
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,020
of deciding stuff. - I think that the,

374
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,820
i think the we have to the thing about it and we have to construct kind of a a

375
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:44,340
perpetual motion type thing

376
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,900
uh... where but you know we don't have to know what it is a cold i don't know

377
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,260
don't hold on hold me on him telling you something this okay technology because

378
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,820
whoever goes first

379
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,980
in this and when we're sperming into our boxer bagger whatever

380
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,160
their sperms are going to be on the bottom okay make so we need is that we

381
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,660
need something exactly a permanent swisher that's constantly switching

382
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:07,180
centrifuge. We get a centrifuge. But it needs to be constantly growing.

383
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:12,860
So it's just pure sperm. So we kind of just give this woman like basically a little Lego

384
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:18,300
piece cube. A sperm rock. Yeah, yeah, and say put that in you. Yeah. And well she has to

385
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:25,300
buy it. Not stepped on. So we freeze the sperm into a cube and then it just all the moisture

386
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,900
inside. It's not frozen, it's just all the moisture. I'm not having no fucking caveman

387
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:34,380
sun. He's fresh, never frozen. It will just be a solid rock because we take all the moisture

388
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:39,060
out of it with scientific machines. Yeah, a centrifuge. Yeah, or other machines. Stop

389
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:43,260
saying, what you're talking about is a centrifuge. Like a permanent swisher. When I was like

390
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:52,760
nine or ten, I learned about jacking off and I went at it for like an hour in the bathroom

391
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,780
and I looked in the toilet and I saw a hair and the reflection on the toilet bowl made

392
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:04,460
me think that I'd shot out one big sperm. You thought you shot out a single sperm?

393
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:08,180
Single giant sperm. Was it a long hair? Was it like a woman's head hair?

394
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,480
It was like my hair. I had long hair as a kid and I saw it in the toilet.

395
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,860
You know when you look in the toilet bowl and there's like light reflecting down and

396
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:21,740
you can see the reflection of the hair? I thought that was a sperm.

397
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,700
I'm with you. I thought sperm was going to be like a tape worm or like the tendon in

398
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,660
chicken. That's what I thought it was going to be like. Yeah, and I didn't even, I couldn't even nut

399
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:35,220
at that point. Yeah, well you thought you did. I thought I was done because I saw one sperm and I

400
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,620
was like, "Oh, I'm pretty young." Yeah. I'm pretty young. That's what it'll look like. Sperm can't

401
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,580
run around on its own. Yeah. Not yet. If you put it on a flat surface, it's not going to run to the

402
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:52,340
side. I don't think it starts popping like a magnetic fluid, no. My uncles, one of my uncles,

403
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:56,540
is like I had a rotating cast of uncles growing up and my one of my uncles left

404
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:03,540
a photographed Kama Sutra and shit and they it was but they couldn't show the

405
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,500
they couldn't show the actual stuff that was going on so I just assumed that it

406
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:12,260
was all done in the butt until I was because I found it when I was nine I was

407
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:15,920
like really what is the vagina look like I'm not gonna look it up on the computer

408
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,220
because I don't get in trouble I never thought of the butt as any kind of

409
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,300
sexual thing until I thought it went in and then it go and then it went around

410
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:27,820
what probably the Mia Malkova way explain I thought the sperms went in and then it

411
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,340
swam back down into the sperm went into the butt and then when they swam and I

412
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:35,360
thought you know the vagina was like a center inside the yeah and that you

413
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,780
would nut in the butt I didn't know swim around okay no one really my parents are

414
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,100
Irish Catholic they didn't teach me what I said that at first I thought you meant

415
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:48,620
that the guy puts his dick into the butt and the dick goes around and out and in

416
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:51,420
Yeah, that's what yeah, cuz that's what it sounded like you said what I first

417
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:57,100
You thought that a guy's dick could be as long as a tube yeah, and it would go around

418
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,740
I thought the miles gonna grow into a big it'll be like weaving a basket. Yeah

419
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,500
Okay, I'm glad I didn't learn about sex very much

420
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:11,220
Yeah, yeah, it's too scary when you're I guess I saw too much adult media as a kid

421
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:15,980
And then it I'd learned about sex stuff, but didn't know what sex was yeah

422
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:19,260
You learned about stuff like saying like yeah, just got some pussy. Yeah

423
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:24,620
Yeah, I was like nine years old saying like he got a dirty Sanchez. Yeah

424
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,740
Yeah, I had a similar thing cuz I had older brother. Yeah, I was walking around saying

425
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,340
I'll get some pussy with pubes on it

426
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,500
Extra pubes on the pussy, please

427
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:45,780
Pussy and butt for my nut. Oh my fucking happy trail into a fucking girls. Puss. Yep. Yep

428
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:52,400
And he would I gave her a I gave her a reverse Sanchez a reverse Sanchez. What's that one got clean one?

429
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:59,760
You give her clean what is it dirty Sanchez you put who you split it you put

430
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,480
I thought you put poop and then you put the poop penis on the girl's upper lip make it look like a mustache

431
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,900
I don't think that's what it is. Well, that's something that's the Caleb then

432
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:13,420
That's the Caleb. It's someone put that on dirty derby dictionary

433
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:18,940
They should have called it dirty. You should be able to just say anything on the

434
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:22,580
Urban Dictionary and say this is the meaning of this. There should be

435
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,860
Wikipedia style editors who say this is good, this is bad. It should be

436
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,340
like a Merriam-Webster thing. There should be one or two experts.

437
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,740
Just some urban experts. Urbanologists. Yeah, urbanologists. I mean I

438
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:38,900
consider myself a part-time so I mean if I pursue some kind of graduate degree

439
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:42,420
maybe I'll be eligible for the position. You've been talking about damn sex too much this episode. It's my fault. You brought up the

440
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:46,140
sperms thing but then I just kind of ran with it. All right then fucking stop

441
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,300
talking about it. What do you want to talk about? I don't even know. I don't know

442
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,680
what people want to listen to us say. It's not about these people.

443
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,980
Pretend the people don't even exist because they might as well not.

444
00:19:55,980 --> 00:20:00,620
Tell me what you, what is on your mind Patrick Doran? I have a tooth

445
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:05,300
problem right now. Really? And I'm very tired because I was up all night

446
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,140
with tooth pain. Really? You were up all night with tooth pain? See this is why

447
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:14,140
understanding each other so yeah you said you were tired and we should have I

448
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:19,180
would assume that you were maybe at the 40/40 Club Jay-Z getting tipsy no no no I

00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:39,100

if the Simpsons were in England they'd probably be named the Thompson's well

499
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,740
they need to do you know they did the Mexican Simpsons shout out to Mexican

500
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:13,700
Homer who fucking died Mexican Homer yeah they did a Spanish version of the

501
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:17,900
Simpsons like like Spanish version of the like like they dubbed it like they were

502
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,620
called like the Hernandez's. No, they were not called the Hernandez's.

503
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,220
It's as if the Simpsons is like a common name in America.

504
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,420
When I was watching The Simpsons on Disney Plus, there was some glitch with my

505
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:34,220
Disney Plus that kept putting the the audio language into German for some

506
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:38,380
reason. Oh, it happened to me too. Yeah. Subtitles? No, not the sub, the like

507
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,140
actual like audio. Like it would kept playing a German dub of everything.

508
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,580
And it happened probably three to four times that I would turn on a Simpsons

509
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:51,820
episode and it would open with Homer being like, "Grrr, grr, grr, grr!" and I'd be like, "This is an interesting choice for the episode!"

510
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,820
And it happened so many times and every time I fell for it.

511
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,820
Mmm, very funny. Oh wow.

512
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,820
You're one of the Conan years.

513
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,820
This is weird.

514
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,820
Mmm.

515
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:05,820
Just a completely different voice of Homer.

516
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
Yeah, it was crazy and I did fall for it every time.

517
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,820
They need to do a British version though,

518
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
because they did the Spanish version and like, the Brits

519
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,820
don't fucking know what a duff beer is, you know?

520
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:19,160
you know? No, they'd have a Duff pint. They'd call it a Duff pint. I'll have a Duff pint. I'll have a pint of Duff.

521
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:25,820
I'm Homer Thompson. I'm Homer Thompson. This is my son Bartholomew. Marguerite.

522
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:33,100
Marguerite. Marguerite. Margella. Margo. I don't know. You know how like

523
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,900
sometimes like British people will have like an Italian name or something?

524
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:42,700
Or like oh oh no never mind I'm thinking of Nigella that's not Italian.

525
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:49,200
Nigella, oh shit, the cook who was really hot when I was a little kid.

526
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,600
We'd watch those YouTube videos. You ever see that? You ever see that YouTube poop

527
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,200
with Nigella? No, you never saw that one? Are you thinking of Gia De Laurentiis?

528
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,760
No, not Gia De Laurentiis. Nigella was another one. My dad didn't know how to clear the

529
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,520
history. Oh, Giada. Giada De Laurentiis. Yeah, my dad didn't know how to

530
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,440
clear the search history. Oh man, that's a bad dad trait. I saw Giada De Laurentiis

531
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:25,040
sexy in the search bar. We're gonna have something, when we get older and we have kids, we will need to be, we need to remember that lesson. I saw that when I was seven.

532
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,400
I was like, uh oh. We need to remember that lesson when we get older because

533
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,680
there will be something like that that dads don't understand. Definitely. That we will

534
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,200
have to be like, fuck my dad didn't know how to. I taught my dad how to use

535
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:40,560
incognito browsing see we need we need we need to stay ahead that's the only

536
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:45,040
reason I found fake taxi in it to my dad is a

537
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:49,600
alone dude he's fucking your mom listens to this leave your dad you don't want to

538

00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,640

00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:03,440
the fucking pot my friend chowder taught him what fake taxi shut up Taylor his

541
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Shut the fuck up.

542
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,440
We called him Chowder.

543
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Okay, then it was Taylor, it wasn't Chowder.

544
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
Dude, it's Chowder.

545
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
Fuck you.

546
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440
This is, fuck you.

547
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
It's his name.

548
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
His name's Chowder.

549
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,440
No, his name is not Chowder.

550
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
You said you'd call him Chowder.

551
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
I'm fucking dissing you.

552
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,800
We called him Chowder unless we were mad at him, then we'd call him Taylor.

553
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm fucking mad at you right now.

554
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I'm gonna call you Chowder.

555
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Why are you mad at me?

556
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
'Cause I had a friend named Chowder.

557
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
You're just making up bullshit and fucking pissing me off.

558
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
My friend Chowder.

559
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,480
My friend Chowder taught my dad what fake tax he was, and then my dad looked it up later,

560
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,440
and then we had me and my two brothers had like a Mexican standoff in the living room

561
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,440
saying...

562
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
A Mexican standoff?

563
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,440
He's just adding more letters.

564
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Oh my god.

565
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
We had...

566
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
You remember that book A Million Little Pieces?

567
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,440
You're doing that shit.

568
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,440
No, we were all standing in the living room.

569
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,440
Oh, it's a million little...

570
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
Oh, I'm fucking addicted to heroin.

571
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
We were standing there and I was like, "You look at dogs' dicks for money."

572
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
You looked it up.

573
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
No, you looked it up.

574
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,440
It was me and my two brothers and we were yelling at each other.

575
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
You're a million little pieces right now.

576
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,880
I can show you.

577
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,880
You are a million little pieces.

578
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I will show you.

579
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,880
You're on Oprah right now.

580
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,880
You're lying about your fucking drug use.

581
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,640
You're a piece of shit.

582
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,040
I'm not a piece of shit.

583
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
Chowder.

584
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,040
Chowder.

585
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,040
Chowder showed my dad fake taxis.

586
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,800
Shut the fuck up.

587
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:04,440
Chowder skis.

588
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,720
Don't put his at on.

589
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Why?

590
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,040
People might, what if they like skiing?

591
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
That's true.

592
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Yeah, it's cool.

593
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
Chowder.

594
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
Chowder.

595
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
Fuck you.

596
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
That's his name!

597
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
He goes by Chowder.

598
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
You made a fake Instagram.

599
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,040
I made a fake Instagram?

600
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,760
I filmed a bunch of GoPro footage of me skiing.

601
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,760
You did.

602
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:27,600
this you can't make so Regina's gonna hear about this who Regina don't tell

603
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Regina I didn't make you know what I think about I've been pretty I've been

604
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,820
pretty crass on this up now I think it felt falls in the confines of the comedy

605
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,320
podcast but at least are you familiar with clowning yeah clowning when you do

606
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,920
this podcast you know we kind of all are yeah I'm kind of finding an inner see

607
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,800
we're not we're not really ourselves right and see if Regina's listening yeah

608
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:56,360
Regina Carey our HR rep. She's not a rep, she's our HR person. HR representative.

609
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,240
Yeah, just HR manager. Okay, manager. She's like she's probably gonna ding you for

610
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,200
that too and every time that she dings you I have to pay her $5,000 so just like

611
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,480
really yes just like maybe. Regina, we just paused the recording

612
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,560
after that and while it was paused Patrick said I want to ding Regina. I did

613
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,960
not say I want to ding Regina. I'm not saying that about fucking Regina. Let's move on.

614
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Does Regina listen to everything?

615
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,760
Because she's, what do we have like 290 episodes or something right now?

616
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,260
She has to comb through, yes. Does she have to comb through everything?

617
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:34,660
She'll probably find this. Because if she has to comb through everything, there's a big long stretch of episodes

618
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,660
where you are saying that you want to fuck my butt

619
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,860
and you're saying that you want to put me in a dress and fuck me

620
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,860
and like you want to turn me into like a sex slave for you.

621
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
I didn't say sex.

622
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,540
You want me to become a footrest that you can nut on.

623
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,740
That's fucking lying.

624
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,860
That's what you said.

625
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:52,860
You said stuff like this.

626
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,860
That's fucking lying bullshit.

627
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,140
It's not lying bullshit.

628
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,860
You used to talk about wanting to have sex with me.

629
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,740
I used to have a fucking big crush on you and everyone knows that.

630
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:05,160
You said you wanted me to grow my hair long so that you could pull on it when you fucked

631
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,160
me from the back.

632
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,420
I don't think I said that.

633
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,500
I think I said certain things.

634
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,900
I said you would look really great in one of those dresses that teachers wear that have

635
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,900
pockets.

636
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,900
That's what I said.

637
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,900
(laughter)

638
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,900
With an apple, a denim dress with an apple at the bottom.

639
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Yeah, you'd look really fucking pretty in one of those.

640
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:21,900
And I would laugh.

641
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:25,900
Would I fucking lift it up and fucking ram your head into a bathroom stall and fucking take you?

642
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,900
Yeah, if the time was right and the moment felt good.

643
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:36,900
You can't say, "Regina, please jot down 2920, that's where Caleb sexually harasses me."

644
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,900
I think Caleb, I remember Caleb also saying something along the lines of,

645
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,620
of I would like to invite you over for a dinner party

646
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,760
and do the popcorn trick to you but with Jell-O.

647
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,020
- What's the popcorn trick?

648
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,860
- The popcorn trick from the movie theater but with Jell-O.

649
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:51,660
(laughing)

650
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,980
- If we make it even louder noise,

651
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,900
it'd be the most conspicuous possible.

652
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,740
- You can see it too.

653
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:56,560
- Yeah.

654
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,400
- Oh, I can just--

655
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,220
- Clear Jell-O.

656
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:00,340
- Hey, if you want us to Jell-O with your hand.

657
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:03,620
You wanna grab some of this Jell-O out of my lap?

658
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,860
(laughing)

659
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:06,700
- It's like--

660
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,520
- It's jiggling.

661
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
It's a big cube of jello!

662
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,520
Sir, can I have some of your jello to enjoy? I love jello with my movies.

663
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,520
Oh yeah, go ahead and reach in.

664
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Help yourself!

665
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,520
It's like a big, green block of jello!

666
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
Like it's ballistic jello!

667
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,520
It's ballistic jello and somebody's putting their hand through it!

668
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,520
There's a slow-mo cam on it like Mythbusters, too.

669
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,520
We need to invest in something.

670
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,520
Hey can I, can I...

671
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,240
You hold up the block of Jell-O like that with your ticket in it.

672
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,600
Hey can I, can I have some popcorn?

673
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I'd love some popcorn.

674
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Yeah you can have some popcorn.

675
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,880
Oh, I think I just dropped the last of my popcorn in the bottom of my soda.

676
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,560
So you'll have to reach into my soda cup.

677
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,560
What about just a briefcase?

678
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,560
That should be enough, right?

679
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,560
Yeah.

680
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
To get away with the...

681
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
That was what was in the Pulp Fiction briefcase.

682
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,560
A little movie reference for all the movie heads out there.

683
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,480
Marcelo Wallace's penis was in there.

684
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,200
Marcel the Shell's penis was in there.

685
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
Yep.

686
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Chicken Marsala Wallace.

687
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Chicken Marsala Wallace?

688
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I want some chicken Marsala right now.

689
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Tikka Masala?

690
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
Different food.

691
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,200
Yeah, I'm just thinking of different salas.

692
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
Tikki Mahalo.

693
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
Let's go surfing in Hawaii.

694
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Shana Masala.

695
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,200
What's Shana Masala?

696
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
It's with chickpeas.

697
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
Oh yeah.

698
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,200
I kept trying to prepare this and

699
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
I kept trying to

700
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,400
- Q us into this and Caleb just drives it with them.

701
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,680
- I was just teeing it up.

702
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,520
- Oh yeah.

703
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,720
- He doesn't even want me involved in it anymore.

704
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,560
- No, I want you to get--

705
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,380
- Wait, what was that?

706
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,220
- Can we introduce it, Caleb?

707
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,060
- Wait, what was that?

708
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:42,880
- Can we introduce it then?

709
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:43,720
- What was that song?

710
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,560

711
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,380
- Yeah, go ahead.

- This is a song, Patrick, that me and Caleb

713
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,400
have been working on today before you got here.

714
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,240
- Did you write it for me?

715
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,880
- We wrote it, well, for you,

716
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,780

717

00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,780
Dude, that shit was bonus.

00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,780
That was bonus as fuck.

773
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,780
Dude, that's fucking good.

774
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:03,780
That's perfect.

775
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:04,780
That's the next slang, yeah.

776
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,780
That's bonus as in like, doing the most.

777
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:06,780
Like after you have sex, you're like, "That sex was fucking bonus."

778
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,780
That was bonus.

779
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:08,780
Bonus.

780
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:09,780
That was bonus.

781
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
That shit was bonus.

782
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,780
That food was bonus as fuck.

783
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,780
Damn, like, yeah.

784
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,780
I just think that's a good, we need a new fucking thing.

785
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:14,780
Yeah.

786
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,780
You know, we're getting fucking, I'm getting sick.

787
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,780
You're trying to do a frindle right now, and I'm here for it.

788
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,780
It's not a frindle 'cause it doesn't replace a word.

789
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,780
And also, I accidentally said it.

790
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,780
And it's just a cool slang.

791
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,980
a friendle right now and I'm here for it. It's not a friendle because it doesn't

792
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:28,100
replace a word. And also I accidentally said it. It's just a cool slang.

793
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:32,660
Yeah. It's more like a bussin than a friendle. Yeah.

794
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:36,660
But sometimes that friendle is bussin. Did I ever tell you guys I invented

795
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:40,220
bussin? I think that I was the first guy who said bussin. I think honestly we

796
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,420
could get bonus going and people could start. We could see in five or six years

797
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:48,460
people saying Twitch streams. Definitely. People will say bonus. Like damn that's mad bonus. That's a bonus.

798
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,460
Like that shit was just bonus as hell.

799
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:50,960
Yeah.

800
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
But it's kind of close, it's like the opposite of bogus I guess,

801
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
because it's got a, it's like instead of the G you swap it for the N and now it's bonus.

802
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
Bonus or bogus.

803
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,460
Yeah.

804
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,460
That could be like a thing, that could be a sys thing.

805
00:35:59,460 --> 00:35:59,960
Oh my god.

806
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,960
So we're going to find out today if this is bonus or bogus.

807
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,960
That's so good.

808
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
That could be like a new segment we do.

809
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,960
Hot or not, need it or keep it.

810
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,960
Bonus or bogus?

811
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,460
Remember that app Hot or Not?

812
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:09,960
No.

813
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
You put your picture up there and people rate you.

814
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:12,960
Rate my poop.

815
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,460
Just like that but for people's faces.

816
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,460
I was getting it perfect tens.

817
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:21,740
I put a picture of myself on Hot or Not and it was my face in a flatbed scanner and I had

818
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,740
a 4.

819
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,740
You had a 4?

820
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:24,740
Mhmm.

821
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,740
Wow.

822
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Out of 4?

823
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,740
Mhmm.

824
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:34,260
I remember kids would use that app when I was 16.

825
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,980
Other 16 year olds would use this app.

826
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:42,300
And then it made people, it was like a self esteem ruiner for like 16 year olds.

827
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,980
There were so many apps like that when we were growing up.

828
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,500
That's just what every app is.

829
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,500
Poppy jump.

830
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,500
Poppy jump, yeah.

831
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,500
Can I jump?

832
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,020
I'm such an idiot, I can't jump.

833
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,820
I've never even jumped on two or three platforms.

834
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,820
I can't even cut this rope!

835
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,820
Fuck me.

836
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,820
I wanna fucking kill myself.

837
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,820
Where is my water?

838
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
I can't find it.

839
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,820
What was that other app?

840
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Yik Yak?

841
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,580
They brought Yik Yak back though.

842
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,740
They brought Yik Yak back?

843
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:04,740
Yeah.

844
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,380
I used to, when I was at my first year of college, I used a lot of Yik Yak.

845
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,380
I've talked about that.

846
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,740
I used to just, every time I'd take a shit, I'd do like a fucking 300 word thing on it.

847
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:18,640
And then Yik Yak just became people complaining about this guy who started raiding his shits

848
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,960
every time he took them.

849
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,800
And then there was copycats too.

850
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:26,180
And people started pretending that they were me, being like, "Wow, I just took a fucking

851
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:28,160
awesome shit in this place."

852
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,840
But they weren't as eloquent as I am.

853
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
Yeah.

854
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
Yeah.

855
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,240
So you just write about you pooping?

856
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
Yeah.

857
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
And I'd describe what it looked like.

858
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,120
You couldn't add pictures to Yik Yak back then.

859
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
I remember.

860
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
Yeah.

861
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,480
And so I would just be really honest.

862
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,160
I would spam.

863
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,440
I think I would describe my critiquing style as like,

864
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,120
honest but fair.

865
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,960
You know?

866
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,780
- Yeah.

867
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,620
- And so I was doing it.

868
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,440
- There weren't a lot of people.

869
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,280
- I think, I mean.

870
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,120
- There weren't a lot of people back then.

871
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:54,940
The population's basically doubled.

872
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,860
- I think you could've taken it to the next level.

873
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,980
- See, I got cut off.

874
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,260
I was about to say the thing, but you can go.

875
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,960
- What's up?

876
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,160
- He started making fun of me for saying

877
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,600
there weren't a lot of people.

878
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,760
- No, I wasn't making fun of you.

879
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,600
- He was making fun of me completely.

880
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,540
- I wasn't making fun of you, I was just agreeing.

881
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,380
What was your point?

882
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,200
- I'm so confused.

883
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,040
What's happening right now?

884
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,040
Basically me and him are having an interpersonal conflict that's gonna get kicked right up to Regina.

885
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,040
Okay.

886
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,040
Okay? So, but you're completely out of it and I would call you a mediator at this point.

887
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,040
Okay, I wasn't gonna mediate.

888
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,040
So you don't have to, so just tell me what you're up to.

889
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,040
Okay, I was just gonna say that...

890
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,040
So you're just like a bystander.

891
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,040
Right, or just like a...

892
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
An accomplice.

893
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,040
Yeah, or like Batman.

894
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Yeah, right.

895
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,040
Or Iron Man.

896
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:38,040
I was just gonna say like, I feel like you could take that to the next level and I think that it would be great...

897
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:41,480
you should bring this back and maybe rate other people's poops and they could pay you.

898
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,560
I would do that. Yeah, I think that's disgusting. Why? I would do anything for money. Yeah. Yeah.

899
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:51,960
That would be a good way to kind of flex your writing chops. I wouldn't do that. Yeah. Yeah.

900
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,800
Because that's about attention. Thomas is on there. I would do anything anonymously. Yeah.

901
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:02,280
For yeah, for money. Okay. Like maybe, like I would get. I would do an anonymous cameo. Yeah.

902
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:06,280
I would make a cameo account and it says you could be anybody. Yeah. That's good.

903
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:12,580
It's like behind a sheet so it's just a silhouette and it's a through a voice

904
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:18,080
changer. I'm just going like happy birthday to Jacob I may or may not have

905
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:24,220
been in your favorite movie. I could be anybody. Yeah I could be anybody. Marilyn Monroe.

906
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:31,320
Muhammad Ali. I don't know. Yeah yeah it could be literally anybody living or

907
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:34,560
dead. That's a great idea and you can make that fucking crazy expensive. Yeah I know.

908
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,000
Yeah, I just feel like and you don't have to tell it because if it's really expensive people assume that someone really yeah, exactly

909
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,120
Yeah, yeah, and then you could put do little hints like I hope you're I hope your birthday is is fucking great

910
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:52,040
I I wish I could be there, but I faked my own death. Oh, or did I?

911
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,680
Did I just say that?

912
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:59,400
Teehee and people might assume that you're either Michael Jackson or Tupac Tupac said T

913
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,280
Yeah, a couple times.

914
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Yeah.

915
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
So it's a pretty good idea.

916
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
It is a good idea.

917
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,880
And yeah, you can charge five or six hundred bucks a pop.

918
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,680
Yeah, because people...

919
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,680
And then people also can't be mad if it ever leaks who you are because it's like, yeah,

920
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
we're anonymous.

921
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,680
Yeah, it could be anybody.

922
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,680
I remember Norman Dowell had a Cameo account and it was like three hundred dollars and

923
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,200
I was like, "Fuck you, man.

924
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm not paying three hundred bucks."

925
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,000
But he knew, "Oh, I'm going to fucking die."

926
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:30,200
he was like I'm gonna make it really fucking expensive so that people people

927
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,120
don't know yet but there's gonna be a fucking deal okay yeah yeah so maybe you

928
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,920
could do that and then you could just fucking I mean back to pass away yeah

929
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:40,880
kill yourself yeah right yeah you could do a cameo that's really expensive and

930
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,680
it'd be like it could be like I'll do one cameo and then a media and then I

931
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,480
will kill myself so you will have the most valuable video in the world that'd

932
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,960
be a pretty good way if you were planning to kill you selling video of

933
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
some guy who is dead.

934
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Telling video of strange long hair guy who died immediately after.

935
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,960
That's probably if they remade Breaking Bad today.

936
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
Cause the meth problem is pretty much unsolved.

937
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,960
It'd be freaking OnlyFans.

938
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
Yeah he probably would have done a fucking...

939
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:06,960
"Jesse we need to fuck."

940
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Yeah he probably would have started fucking Jesse on camera.

941
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
It's kinda disgusting when you think about it.

942
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,960
That is, yeah.

943
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,960
And Gus would have like a whole empire.

944
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,680
and they're trying to work with Gus,

945
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,120
he's like, "I need to work with you."

946
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,600
I need to work with Heisenberg.

947
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,480
He fucks that team.

948
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,400
He fucks that hoodie team so good.

949
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,360
- That is crazy that Jesse Pinkman

950
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,000
is supposed to be like 19, right, when that show starts.

951
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,760
- Especially if you watch El Camino.

952
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,600
- Yeah, so funny.

953
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,280
- And he's 50 or 60 years old.

954
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,120
- Fat AF.

955
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:37,960
- Yeah.

956
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,780
- I wouldn't even say he's fat,

957
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,920
he's just got a huge round head.

958
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,840
- Whatever that other guy's name is, got fat AF.

959
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,680
- Mike.

960
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:52,480
Oh the guy who plays Todd. Yeah, Todd. What's his name? Oh, Jesse Plemons. Jesse Plemons. Yeah, he puffed up really really funny. That's hilarious

961
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:58,980
Yeah, it does a piece of shit. Oh, yeah Todd or Jesse Plemons. You know, I'm trying to see a Skylar

962
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:02,640
He didn't answer me who

963
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,080
Todd deserves it or Jesse Plemons deserves it Todd

964
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:11,840
Jesse you realize Friday Night Lights, you know, I did bad things in that - no, I didn't know what you know

965
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,280
Damn in fuck yeah in like season three the whole shows about football and then season three he covers up a

966
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:25,860
Him and a girl cover up a murder bro out of nowhere. Well, it's it makes no sense. That's not true

967
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,620
That's what we call the industry jumping the show just starts. Are you sure you didn't just accidentally watch season three of Breaking Bad?

968
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:37,500
The first two episode the first two seasons were like look how fucking hot these high school football players are don't you want to fuck?

969
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,340
Like look at these guys their abs are fucking unreal. They're popping their bicep veins

970
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,700
We're literally popping out 3d on screen right and then third season

971
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:51,080
It's like look at this fucking guy this fucking 80 IQ idiot kills some guy and covers it up that happened

972
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:55,500
Players man, there's a similar thing in this other show

973
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:01,080
I'm spongebob where it starts out and it's like about like sea animals about it with restaurants

974
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:06,300
Yeah fry cook, and then it's like you know seasons in or whatever you're like what the fuck is the Flying Dutchman doing here

975
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,620
Yeah, that's true. This is not a sea animal the flying. This is a green bit of jump in the shark

976
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,620
Yeah, it was like okay. I guess

977
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:19,980
You have jumping the shark is there a shark in sponge I was thinking about it yesterday, and I don't think there is I literally

978
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:27,960
Know there's a shark in the salty spittoon. Yeah, he's waiting in line, but there's not like a shark like

979
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,740
How could he be fucking be eating them?

980
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,220
That's true

981
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:35,300
It's kind of a cop-out to put us if you have like a sea show but a fucking

982
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,580
Octopus or a squid is like one of those like an apex predator

983
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:45,260
Yeah, but he doesn't look like like yeah Squidward is a squid, but you're not like immediately like like they did something creative with

984
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,260
Yes, word is a squid

985
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:55,340
Yeah, Squidward's a squid, but they did something creative with his like design. That's true. They should have just been a shark character though

986
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,340
I agree man

987
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,960
You guys you guys ran out of ideas for sea animals, and we got we have we have a freaking squirrel down here

988
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,300
Yeah, or a shark. I think it was a piece of plastic

989
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,780
piece of I read something I read something that originally Sandy was

990
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:12,780
gonna be Sandy the shark is that true she's gonna be a shark and she was gonna

991
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:18,700
still live but how would she be from Texas yeah well yeah it made no sense

992
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:23,740
for her to oh it was a juxtaposition it was a juxtaposition yeah yeah

993
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,820
Helen Berg that's a guy fucking must have been on fucking acid mm-hmm yeah I

994
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:33,620
I read that SpongeBob was very much inspired by the album

995
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:40,580
The Mollusk by Ween. I thought the Mollusk came out after SpongeBob. No. Really? The Mollusk came first.

996
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:43,180
I thought the Mollusk was like 2001. No.

997
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:49,420
2001 was when the Ween made Quebec. Oh. Or yeah, I think 2002?

998
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:56,660
2001? The Mollusk is you can you it sounds like a SpongeBob album. The first song? Yeah. What's that song?

999
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:03,700
I'll be dancing in the show tonight. Yeah, it's all that sounds like SpongeBob and Patrick. It's basically all just SpongeBob music. Yeah

1000
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:09,580
You imagine being a ween and being like that most impactful thing we ever did was SpongeBob. That's not true

1001
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:16,080
Yeah, it is. Come on. SpongeBob is a way bigger cultural phenomenon. Yeah, what else than ween? What else they were in the movie?

1002
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,080
It's Pat no way

1003
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:23,180
SpongeBob I think without SpongeBob probably most people our age would be very different. Yeah

1004
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:28,660
There would be no reaction me mostly the big the big show imagine YouTube poop

1005
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:34,200
Well the first YouTube poop ever was toys gone wild which was Toy Story

1006
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:41,540
So without - okay, so without Toy Story and Spongebob. Yeah, what about yeah and without cartoons or animation?

1007
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:45,940
If there was no TV, we'd all be a little bit different. I'll say it tunes are good tunes

1008
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:51,700
Are you really good good for you? Yeah, I've been saying that for fucking years. I can't wait tomorrow morning

1009
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:58,780
See kids in central. Oh my god. Oh Saturday Saturday morning. So I feel like I feel like the people who listen to this show

1010
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:04,820
Don't listen to it exact right when it comes out because that's when all yeah, we need to change the schedule. Yeah

1011
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:12,540
Using a whole audience there's like a bunch it's like splitting the ratings. It's like obviously our audience is heavily tuned

1012
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:19,640
Tuned fans. Yeah, so they're fucking - splitting off. They're sitting in front of their why do we release this on Saturday morning?

1013
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:24,040
on the TV cabinet, they're like a bowl of cereal on their stomach, they're on the ground, and

1014
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,040
they're watching fucking tunes.

1015
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,920
Yeah, you know like a balanced breakfast, like cereal, banana, orange juice, two pieces of

1016
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,840
toast, bacon, eggs.

1017
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
And a go-gurt.

1018
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
And a go-gurt, yeah.

1019
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,840
And a go-gurt is big.

1020
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
The healthiest thing you can eat.

1021
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:41,440
I think we can change these Saturday episodes into tunes, and then we can put them on TV.

1022
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,920
You are a fucking genius.

1023
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,400
Put them on TV, then people will, even more people will flock to them.

1024
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:47,400
You know what I think?

1025
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:48,400
So it's a Saturday morning tune.

1026
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:52,400
I think instead of putting them on TV, we need to put you in the fucking White House.

1027
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,400
I won't say no.

1028
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,400
Okay, you can't say no.

1029
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,400
Because you're the fucking president.

1030
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,400
You should be the president.

1031
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,400
Oh, as the president?

1032
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,400
You're a fucking genius.

1033
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,400
Yeah.

1034
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,400
I thought you meant as a visit.

1035
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,400
Fuck no.

1036
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,400
Dude, that's a lot of responsibility.

1037
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:04,400
I don't give a shit.

1038
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:05,400
You need to do that.

1039
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,400
Because you could probably save every single part of this world.

1040
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,400
I guess I probably could.

1041
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,400
Yeah, especially when you have ideas like, we could change tunes.

1042
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Like, that would fucking blow minds and send ripple waves.

1043
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,400
I would be giving a speech and I would say we need to change tunes and I would do the politician hand.

1044
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:25,400
Yes. And you could do it as an homage to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

1045
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,400
Uh huh. I have a dream that tunes will be changed.

1046
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,400
Yeah. To be Saturdays and Sundays.

1047
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:40,400
And every day. And every day after school though so that it doesn't interrupt your morning routine.

1048
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:45,760
or very early before school so that it teaches kids to wake up early. I'm not

1049
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,520
gonna lie I used to watch a couple of tunes before I went off to school.

1050
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:55,320
I used to play I would either watch baby looney tunes or I would play

1051
00:47:55,320 --> 00:48:00,800
Ocarina of Time. Bro I would play Gameboy. It's almost like we had three

1052
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:07,000
fucking like separate but parallel upbringings. Wow. Yeah. Did you guys

1053
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,880
ever go to after school program? Yeah. Do your after school program have game boy time? I

1054
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,240
tried to get my mom to take me to boys and girls class. I didn't have an after school

1055
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:21,720
program as much as it was called, so like the periods of our day was like A period through

1056
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:30,000
A through H period or whatever. And I had something called I period which was a, I had

1057
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,200
to stay after school and do my homework in a classroom because I wouldn't do homework.

1058
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,560
like after school. What kind of kid does homework man? Yeah. That's bullshit. I used to have

1059
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,280
to stay after school because they were like you aren't doing your homework and you need

1060
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,680
to do homework in a room with a teacher who doesn't, who wants to watch the Beatles on

1061
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,400
YouTube the whole time. This is a big memories episode. Yeah. A little bit of a flalalala.

1062
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,780
Back into time. Flalalala. Like that's the sound that it makes when you remember stuff

1063
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:03,200
like this. And we go and we got back into our childhoods. Yeah. In my after school everyone

1064
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:07,760
bring their Game Boy and their Nintendo DS or like a few the few kids who had like a Nintendo DS would

1065
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:12,800
bring it and everybody else they would have the new Pokemon game that just came out and everybody

1066
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:16,640
else would sit would gather just a huge crowd of people around them and just watch them play it and

1067
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,720
be like do that do that do that and then eventually the that like after school program was like okay

1068
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,600
now you can only we're creating Game Boy time where you can only play it from this time to this

1069
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:30,800
time because it's all anybody does and I really I would love to I miss the experience of standing

1070
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:35,080
behind the kid who had whatever Pokemon game just came out and being like, "What is that

1071
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,720
Pokemon?" I really wish that maybe people could do that on the subway or something.

1072
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,880
I do that. You can watch me. You can come over to my house and watch me play Arceus.

1073
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,600
I need a big crowd of people.

1074
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,600
Okay.

1075
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,600
I need, I want, I want...

1076
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,600
Or we should just do fucking Madison Square Garden.

1077
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,600
Yeah.

1078
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:49,600
That works for me.

1079
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:53,680
Do you guys think in a year's time, if we do, you guys are familiar with like Jim Carrey's

1080
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,680
whole philosophy, right?

1081
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,680
No.

1082
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:59,800
Which is like, if you say stuff into the world, it happens. So can we just say like a year

1083
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,880
Law of Attraction. Yeah Law of Attraction. That's Jim Carrey's philosophy? I call it Jim Carrey's

1084
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:08,000
philosophy. Why did he say that? Because he just said that once. Oh. He said one time

1085
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,920
he went on the top of a mountain when he was like 19 and he was like I would... He

1086
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,120
went to the top of a mountain, are you thinking of the Grinch? No he was like I

1087
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:20,160
fucking hate Christmas and then he ended up making the Grinch later. Well I think

1088
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,200
it's not what you said. What did he say on top of the mountain? It sounds like he sounds like he was

1089
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,240
it happened in the Grinch. I could be misremembering this I remember him saying

1090
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,080
at some point. He's such a dickhead. He went to the top of a mountain... he's dope. I heard he

1091
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,320
assassinated his girlfriend. Yeah, with herpes. No, he assassinated her like

1092
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:40,840
literally fucking Hitman 2, like one of the options. Like he speed ran. I heard

1093
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:46,400
you put her casket down a water slide when the cameras were off. He went to the top of a

1094
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:51,720
mountain when he was not a famous actor. Right. He probably did a crazy thing with

1095
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:57,240
his arms and legs and made a weird Scrooge face and he said I want to be a

1096
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,220
famous actor that's okay and then it happened so I want to be a famous

1097
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:06,840
explain that with anything scientific or spiritual so what I'm saying is spiritual

1098
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,920
we need to say outside preferably so that more of the world hears us next

1099
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,080
year we want to do a fucking full Madison Square Garden live show with

1100
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,260
sold out and so it sold out, maybe a flame and rides and a ride rides and

1101
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:28,660
rides. So the carnival now we don't want to do a carnival that cheapens it. It's

1102
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:35,920
a sir in Madison, sir, sir, sir, to podcast about lists. So we'll have so

1103
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,040
we'll have different stuff.

1104
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:41,420
We'll have tons of animals. I'm talking dogs, cats. That's like the best idea

1105
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:44,380
you've ever had. Cirque de podcast about lists. I know we've talked about having

1106
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,880
a carnival before but circuit the podcast about list is like next level that is

1107
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:53,240
ingenious that's like camp vlog not level genius it's better than camp

1108
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,840
probably yeah that's a way better fucking suck my dick camp vlog no I

1109
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:02,320
don't want that picture like it was like they some guy like going around doing

1110
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:06,320
like fashion photography of people at camp vlog now and there's that kid who's

1111
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,680
wearing like head to toe and golf like golf of the floor shit and just looks

1112
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:19,120
like like fucking shit. It's so funny like the whole like it's so funny that

1113
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:22,480
that's what Tyler the Creator turned into. I'm pretty sure we've beaten this

1114
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:28,720
conversation to death but just like every song that he has now is just like...

1115
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,160
We've definitely talked about this aspect of Tyler the Creator a million times.

1116
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,520
Yeah where it's like every song used to be like "I'm gonna rape a triceratops and call it a f***"

1117
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:43,480
turn it into turn it into a porcupine this guy sounds a lot like scrub daddy

1118
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:49,720
does it Tyler the Creator kind of did rip off scrub daddy I think maybe cuz scrub

1119
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,080
daddy is like an OG from the bay scrub daddy was bonus and Tyler's bogus yeah

1120
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:59,360
basically yeah Tyler the Creator you bogus scrub though scrub daddy was like

1121
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:05,720
like ten toes down basically ten toes down hyphy as a yeah he's thizzing on

1122
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:09,360
As I would say he was like people would call him the slow e40

1123
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:14,300
Yeah, cuz he already was so fast e40 is fast within scrub. Daddy was like I

1124
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:17,560
Love to rap

1125
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:24,060
Not that fast. Yep. I write a song it goes not to it goes long

1126
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,880
Yeah, because of how long it takes me to think of a word

1127
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,200
I'm the slowest freestyler in the bay. Yep

1128
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:40,480
I'm not fast like a horse. No, do I eat? Hey, no, do I know?

1129
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:45,560

1151
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:36,280
The bus driver stopped at a stop. There was like three people there.

1152
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,280
Holy shit.

1153
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,280
And he didn't open the doors for them. He just stopped the bus in front.

1154
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:45,280
Maybe his route was done or something, but he stopped the bus in front of these people

1155
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:51,200
people and then sat, laid down on like the handicap seats and just started watching a

1156
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,680
video on his phone for like five minutes and then he just got up and drove the bus and didn't

1157
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,000
even pick those people up.

1158
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,000
That's sick.

1159
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Wow.

1160
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,080
That was like, I remember I was sitting there just like...

1161
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:04,120
Probably the wrong route.

1162
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,440
Sitting on my butt on the BART bus to Berkeley.

1163
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:08,640
My butt takes up too many seats.

1164
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,920
I gotta sit in the handicapped space.

1165
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:14,840
I have a rhyme here so you basically just ruined it and said handicapped space for no reason

1166
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:20,920
Doesn't rhyme. Yeah, you're just waiting on my butt on the Bart bus to Berkeley. My butt is weighing down the bus

1167
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,920
It can't move quirkily

1168
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:27,200
See and instead you said that too quick. That doesn't sound like screw

1169
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:33,720
This sounds - I should have done it slower so you could have interrupted in the first half of my sentence

1170
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,600
Slow

1171
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,000
Fist bump destroyed fucking destroyed

1172
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,220
Regina will be hearing about that. He said fuck you to me.

1173
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:54,660
What? I didn't even fucking catch that. Yeah, you said F-U-C-K to him? He said fuck you destroyed to me.

1174
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,880
Destroy? Regina, right? 56-42.

1175
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,720
All right, so you got a couple of timestamps. So that's fucking $10,000 out of our paychecks. Yeah, it's funny

1176
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,960
I will say also, I mean don't want to point throw blame here

1177
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,080
But Patrick was also making some interesting jokes about handicapped spaces right before this one.

1178
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:12,920
- Well, I'm disabled.

1179
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,720
- I think Regina will have to, you know.

1180
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,800
- I'm completely disabled.

1181
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:16,640
- We can let Regina kind of look over your--

1182
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,840
- And I'm laughing at my pain.

1183
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,140
- Your medical documents and figure some stuff out

1184
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:20,980
about that.

1185
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:21,880
- I'm chronically ill.

1186
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,160
- What's your disability?

1187
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,640
- Fibro...

1188
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,520
Dialga.

1189
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,680
(laughing)

1190
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,160
- Really?

1191
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:33,840
- It's a different from fibromyalgia.

1192
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,660
- Yeah.

1193
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:35,560
- It's what you get when you sit on the couch

1194
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,160
and play Pokemon for too long.

1195
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:38,240
- What are you talking about?

1196
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,000
I have to sit on the couch and play Pokemon

1197
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,200
because of my disability.

1198
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:46,200
5729, Cameron making fun of my disability.

1199
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,200
That's true.

1200
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:50,800
All right guys, that's $15,000 that has been wiped out by Regina.

1201
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:51,800
Not wiped out, sorry.

1202
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,800
That's 20 now.

1203
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,800
5739, Caleb diminishing Regina's job.

1204
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,800
Stop giving the time stamps.

1205
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:55,800
We're in so much debt to her already.

1206
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:56,800
Belittling Regina.

1207
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
You know what I should start doing?

1208
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,800
I should be like Mark Cuban.

1209
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,800
You know?

1210
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:00,800
Where like Mark Cuban, he does an NBA interview and he says, "I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan

1211
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,800
of yours, I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan of yours,

1212
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,800
I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan of yours, I'm a fan

1213
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,440
what I should start doing is to be like Mark Cuban, you know? Where like Mark Cuban,

1214
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:12,400
he does an NBA interview and he says, "Yeah, all I wanted was the

1215
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,560
fucking win." And then the news person or whatever says, "Well, you know you just

1216
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,680
said the F word on live TV so the league is gonna fine you $50,000 that goes to

1217
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:24,680
charity." And he'll go, "Oh yeah? Well, fuck it, fuck you, fucking bitch."

1218
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,840
Whoa. It's pretty fucking badass. That is crazy. Yeah, because then he's giving $200,000

1219
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:33,560
to charity right and he doesn't know the charity could be some fucking pro slatery

1220
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:37,120
fucking charity. It's probably a charity for swearing. Donald Sterling

1221
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:42,680
Defense Fund. That's what it was back when they filmed that it was

1222
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:47,960
Donald Sterling's Defense Fund. The DSDF. Yeah. Yeah. What was his whole thing?

1223
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:52,680
Donald Sterling. He was the Clippers guy. He was the Clippers guy and he would complain

1224
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,800
about his girlfriend talking to the black guys on the team or something. Oh

1225
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,920
- Oh yeah.

1226
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,000
- I think that's what it was.

1227
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,280
- He said the N word too.

1228
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,760
- Yeah, yeah, he said the N word

1229
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,800
and then there's that interview

1230
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,760
with his girlfriend or something.

1231
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:07,920
I forget what she says,

1232
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,360
but it's the funniest fucking thing in the world.

1233
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:11,760
Do you remember that one?

1234
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:13,400
- Honestly, I think I got into basketball

1235
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,080
the year after all that stuff.

1236
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:15,920
I got in like 2014, 2015. - Really?

1237
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,600
I never got into basketball, but I love drama.

1238
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,360
- Yeah, you are a bit of a drama hog.

1239
00:59:20,360 --> 00:59:21,200
- Yeah.

1240
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,600
(laughing)

1241
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,640
- 5908, Caleb making fun of my weight.

1242
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,780
What? That wasn't about your weight. You look fucking really good.

1243
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:29,380
I almost said it earlier, but then I was like,

1244
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,880
"Nah, he's gonna think that's a sexual harassment thing and fucking write it down."

1245
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,540
59, 17, Caleb sexually harassing.

1246
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:35,700
*gibberish*

1247
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:36,360
I'm saying that you're-

1248
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:39,000
59, 22, Cameron making fun of my speech impediment.

1249
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,000
I'm saying that your body is looking very healthy-

1250
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:42,660
Joke's on Patrick.

1251
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:44,740
And like you've lost some weight and you look fucking-

1252
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:45,940
You look like...

1253
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:48,120
You look good.

1254
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:50,200
59, 33, Caleb's fatphobia.

1255
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:52,400
Joke on Patrick.

1256
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:55,060
- Because of all the weird pausing stuff we did,

1257
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:57,720
that timer is not right and he's giving wrong timestamps.

1258
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,640
So Regina will not be able to find any of this.

1259
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,480
- Okay, so you tricked her,

1260
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,160
so that means that I can keep doing it.

1261
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,000
- 59.48.

1262
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,160
- I wish you were fatter so I could put you in a corset

1263
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:09,300
and bind parts of your body to my liking.

1264
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,280
Just completely model you like clay.

1265
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:17,760
- I guess I'm completely stumped here.

1266
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,400
- Yeah, 'cause you can't do anything.

1267
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:20,880
- Yeah.

1268
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:21,720
Wow.

1269
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:26,720
Caleb wants me to not be able to do anything so then he can have his way with me.

1270
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,720
I'd say that's about accurate.

1271
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,720
Yeah.

1272
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:33,720
Yeah. I want you in a wheelchair.

1273
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,720
What?

1274
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,720
So I can sit on you.

1275
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:43,720
You can't say that to somebody with fibro-dialga because that could actually happen one day.

1276
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,720
One day. I think when you hit 30 or...

1277
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,720
When I turn 30 I'm going to be in a rascal scooter.

1278
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:54,260
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna be in a rascal scooter cuz I can't walk around the mall and he's gonna go around saying I'm gonna give you the

1279
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:56,360

Not in my rascal don't give me a lap dance in my rascal scooter we're gonna give you a tracheotomy

1293
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:06,160
The past two minutes we owe Regina so much fucking money. I think at this point we owe

1294
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:11,060
her $75,000. I'm looking at your hat and it's reminding me that I meant to get a stinger

1295
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:15,060
installed that shoots, that infects you with my cum.

1296
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,060
70, uh, $80,000.

1297
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:22,840
I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get like, I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get like cyborg clamps on the

1298
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:27,400
backs of my legs so I can sit on your lap and you can never get me off.

1299
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,460
But I'm gonna get you off.

1300
01:02:28,460 --> 01:02:31,200
I'm gonna put you on, I'm gonna give you a house arrest anklet, right?

1301
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:34,340
But it only, it goes off if you leave my diaper.

1302
01:02:34,340 --> 01:02:38,620
$100,000 to Regina.

1303
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,740
We owe her $100,000 because she's going to have to look into all these disputes.

1304
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,140
No, this is all fair use.

1305
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:45,140
There's no dispute here.

1306
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:46,140
This is all fair use.

1307
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,140
This is fair use.

1308
01:02:47,140 --> 01:02:52,500
Because I'm going to use you and it's not going to be fair.

1309
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:58,340
Do you think they have fair use in sexual harassment claims?

1310
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:02,620
I don't know, but I...

1311
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:07,020
Your Honor, I plead fair use.

1312
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:15,340
I plead I was doing a parody of a sexually deviant co-worker like Rob Schneider.

1313
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,380
You're gonna get a pair of these.

1314
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:20,620
You're gonna get a pair of these.

1315
01:03:20,620 --> 01:03:21,820
You're gonna get a pair of those.

1316
01:03:21,820 --> 01:03:24,700
I'm pointing to lingerie and you're gonna be stuck in them.

1317
01:03:24,700 --> 01:03:27,260
They're gonna be fucking super glued to your body, right?

1318
01:03:27,260 --> 01:03:28,780
Gorilla glue actually, right?

1319
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,580
And I'm gonna put got to be glued in your hair so you have a mohawk.

1320
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:37,180
Wouldn't really be a mohawk because you'd have to shave the sides of my head down.

1321
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:38,180
I was going to get to that.

1322
01:03:38,180 --> 01:03:39,980
I'm going to shave the sides of your head down.

1323
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:41,220
I'm going to give you a mohawk.

1324
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:43,140
I'm going to spray the Jordan logo into it.

1325
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,780
With spray paint, not the hair kind.

1326
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:45,780
Right?

1327
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,060
So it's going to be permanent.

1328
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:50,460
I'm going to be a Bugs Bunny cannonball into you.

1329
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:51,460
I'm going to be a bug on you.

1330
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,420
And I'm going to play a game where you have to swat at me away.

1331
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,420
Bite your butt.

1332
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:58,580
Wow, I can't believe all this is falling on your fair youths.

1333
01:03:58,580 --> 01:04:00,980
I'm going to rename myself the bed bug.

1334
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:07,980
I will. Me and a lot of friends are going to bite you. And you're going to walk in, it's

1335
01:04:07,980 --> 01:04:13,100
going to be me and my crew 5,000 deep in your bed. Right? We're going to be rolling hard.

1336
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:16,620
I'm going to get trapped in an industrial machine and become Flat Stanley and I'm going

1337
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:20,780
to hide inside your entire outfit. I am going to put glue paper down around the office so

1338
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:24,460
I can't catch you. And you're going to get stuck. And I'm going to forget that you're

1339
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,060
here. I'm going to go out of town and when I come back you will have gnawed your legs

1340
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:34,060
off. So, yeah you better be fucking excited for that. And I'm gonna come back and be like

1341
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,460
"Ah fucking god damn it, I didn't even catch him, he ate his legs and died."

1342
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,820
Oh no. Shit.

1343
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,820

1348
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,060

1349
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:56,060

1359
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:42,260
It's going to be better perform. He's pretty much. I mean he's basically an effort

You can't have to do this while recording, it's very rude.

1367
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:12,720
I think it's ruder to ditch out on your buddy.

1368
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,720
I'm not ditching out, I...

1369
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,720
