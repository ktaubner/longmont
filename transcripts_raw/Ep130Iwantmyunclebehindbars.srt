Caleb, is that a whoopee cushion?

20
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
It doesn't pick up.

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,200
It didn't get picked up.

22
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,200
It didn't pick up.

23
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,200
It picked up on my mic.

24
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,200
That's good.

25
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,560
I see a humongous spike on my mic.

26
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,200
You clicked zoom so we couldn't hear it.

27
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,880
I'll hold it further away.

00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,880
Yeah.

29
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,880
Here, ask again.

00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,160
Hey, Caleb, what did you have for lunch today?

31
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,880
No, no, ask if it's a whoopee cushion.

32
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,800
Hey, Caleb, what did you have for-- did you eat beans for lunch today, Caleb?

33
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,800

39
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,680
They didn't call it a Chinese finger trap in the Chinatown arcade.

40
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,680
I'm not kidding. They just called it a finger trap.

41
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,680
That makes sense.

42
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,680
I was like, "Yeah, I guess so. A Roman candle in Rome is a candle."

43
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,680
It's true.

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,680
Yeah. I went to the arcade. I won a Whoopie Cushion.

45
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,680
And I played Guitar Hero. Pretty great night.

46
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Wow.

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,680
You played Guitar Hero at the arcade?

00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Yeah, dude. You can versus all your friends.

49
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,680
The arcade is open?

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,440
They have like limited capacity. It was like just me and two other people there.

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,440
Oh.

52
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:00,440
It's pretty fun, dude. Except for all that stupid hand sanitizer.

53
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,440
Yeah.

54
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,440
I hate that shit.

55
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,440
Yeah.

56
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,640
Smells bad. Makes your makes it if you eat like a hamburger or a hot dog.

57
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,160
I never until COVID I never realized how many different like types of consistency of hand

58
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,560
sanitizer there are. Like I assumed it was all just like, oh, it's like hand sanitizer.

59
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,560
Like there's only one.

60
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
It's all runny.

61
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,840
I feel like every time that I get hand sanitizer, it's like a different kind of disgusting. Like

62
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,140
There's some that just like stays on your hands forever.

63
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,740
There's some that's like a film.

64
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,040
Yeah.

65
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,540
Somebody that like smells really bad.

66
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,540
Like I don't know how there can be that many different kinds.

67
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:29,040
Like it's just like alcohol, right?

68
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,540
Yeah, it's alcohol and beads.

69
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,740
Yeah.

70
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,940
So that's the worst kind.

71
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:34,740
The bead stuff.

72
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:35,640
I like it.

73
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,840
It gets in all my cuts.

74
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,740
Ugh.

75
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,140
Ugh.

76
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,040
I love it, dude.

77
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,140
Yeah, it makes me feel like a warrior.

78
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,140
Mm-hmm.

79
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,140
I hate that.

80
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,940
When it gets in my paper cut that I got from

81
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,680
taking from putting a dollar bill in my wallet too quickly.

82
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,720
Yeah, it's gonna feel tough to which I do all the time.

83
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,080
Yeah, you know dollar bills are so sharp because they're just made out of normal paper and they'll cut your fingers. Yeah

84
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,740
It's fucked up. You know, what's the most fucked up hand sanitizer when you go into a bathroom?

85
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,200
And they have it where the soap should be

86
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,160
And then you put it on your hands and then you wash it off

87
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:13,640
And you're like am I what the what what is this? Am I on earth? Yeah

88
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,960
where the fuck am i with

89
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,080
you're in america and say that i is so

90
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,680
is a handsome just using hands and washing your hands is better than just

91
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,880
using hand sanitizer a

92
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,840
so but what about what about now and i want to wash your hands with their

93
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,500
using all the with someone watching your hands is so gross

94
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,440
i agree

95
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,480
which is better washing your hands with soap and water are using hand sanitizer

96
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,160
it's better to do nothing because the different things on your hand builds up

97
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,920
a pretty answer to my question

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,420
one of the other i didn't know you could say neither

99
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,020
i'm i'd say i would or there was an option so i don't think you can pick it

100
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,400
i don't play by your rules and i'm kind of a bad boy

101
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,180
you're you're kinda sitting here like

102
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,100
you think you own the damn place

103
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,140
i mean you just too stupid to pick one

104
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,280
okay hand sanitizer then hand sanitizer i think soap is probably better

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,800
so but yes so then here's the

106
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,900
question right is

107
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,900
is plus soap without water

108
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,580
or hand

109
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,740
could you put soap on your hands and then use hand sanitizer instead of water and

110
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,000
would that be better

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,740
now or what if you just use so play kills and sanitize it what are you use water

112
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:19,580
what if you use water like it was so

113
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,300
and what i like it was a lot of reaction

114
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,840
what if you use

115
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
what if you have

116
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,280
what if you use like a what if you give your hands like a dust bath like a

117
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,040
chinchilla or a sparrow

118
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,680
okay could that get you and i think they can get covered

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
chinchillas can get covered

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,720
i'd just found that out

121
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,000
Can any animals get COVID? Is that confirmed?

122
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,200
Can we check on that?

123
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,400
Is it is in the bat where it came from?

124
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,500
I think the bats get sick.

125
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,560
I don't know.

126
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Is that how you say that?

127
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,340
I think it's a penguin.

128
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,600
Penguin.

129
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
It's called a penguin.

130
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,540
It's a flightless bird.

131
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,140
OK.

132
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,580
That is a very funny ass movie about.

133
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,880
What's it called?

134
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,980
The fart of the penguins or whatever.

135
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:02,780
You remember that one?

136
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,580
Yeah, I do.

137
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,460
It's just like them talking over like penguin footage

138
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,500
and being like, suck my penguin ass, dude.

139
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,660
That was talked about. Yeah.

140
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:14,060
Have we? You said that you saw it in the theater.

141

It's one of the ultimate movies, dude.

142
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,420
Yeah. Sick.

143
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,960

man-centric writing you get with Adam Carolla.

177
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,620
- And then Adam, and then, and then Adam ruins everything.

178
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,620
Comes on the scene and he goes,

179
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,340
"Actually, the monkey that gave the guy AIDS was not gay.

180
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,380
It was straight."

181
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,300
(laughing)

182
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,860
- That's the only thing you said.

183
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,860
It's the only thing he fact checks.

184
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,860
The monkey actually had a wife and her name was Alessa.

185
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,860
The monkey was paid to do it.

186
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,860
[Laughter]

187
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,360
Yeah. I'm not... that's a...

188
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
I think, um...

189
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Can you imagine if you were a monkey and you were in monkey college and you were like,

190
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,360
"I'm gonna experiment this once," and you started AIDS?

191
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
[Laughter]

192
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,360
I love thinking about the guy who fucked the monkey

193
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,360
Because for him to have transmitted it to humans, it means that in his life,

194
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,360
he fucked a monkey and another person. And that's game.

195
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:40,360
That's some fucking game.

196
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,360
He wasn't just some monkey fucker.

197
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:48,360
He fucked a monkey and then he was like, "Time to get some pussy."

198
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,360
He fucked a monkey and he was like, "No, I don't think so."

199
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:56,360
I don't feel so good. My bones hurt. And now I'm gonna fuck his other guy.

200
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,900
I don't know why fucking a monkey wasn't for me. Anyway, I'll just fuck this guy just normal

201
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:07,400
Yeah, but that is ultimate game if you can is that how is that how it started? I don't remember

202
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,640
Yeah, guy fucked him. Oh, you don't remember you weren't there. No, I was you were the guy. Oh

203
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:22,920
Yep, I don't know. I don't know whether that's how how AIDS started but in my brain. Yeah, that's I

204
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:29,160
I kind of if a scientist came up to me and tried to tell me how it really started I would say no because it's less fun

205
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,720
so true

206
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,840
So true. Yeah, I'm surprised that

207
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,480
Kovat wasn't started by monkeys because it seems like every day. It seems like every disease

208
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:47,680
That just like destroys you is started by monkeys. What as revenge like what like which diseases?

209
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:53,180
Monkey's caressless leg syndrome the monkey's paw. Yeah

210
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,620
Banana addiction. Yeah

211
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,220
Yeah, true

212
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,720
Uncle's life. Mm-hmm getting bitten by a monkey

213
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,600
Swingers yeah, did they get I feel like getting bit. I feel he was probably got bit by a monkey

214
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't know. So I think it was a guy fucked a monkey having sex style. Yeah

215
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
Reverse cowgirl with the monkey.

216
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:22,780
[laughter]

217
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,780
I wanna look at you.

218
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,780
Keep the lights on.

219
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
Keep the torches on.

220
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,780
I have to look at you.

221
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
Yeah, do you think he was like playing music?

222
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,780
Yeah, he had

223
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,780
banana peels leading to the bed.

224
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,780
Yeah, how do you seduce a monkey?

225
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,780
'Cause a monkey

226
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,780
is faster than a human.

227
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
It's not like he like caught him and fucked him.

228
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
That monkey was like down.

229
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
he was down to fuck.

230
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
Yeah, the monkey was into it.

231
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,780
I hope it was a baboon.

232
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,780
I feel like that's the most fuckable monkey, right?

233
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,780
No. What?

234
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,780
It's got a big fucking slit on its butt.

235
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
It's not the most fuckable monkey.

236
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,780
It's got a big puffy vagina.

237
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:06,780
It's like the biological equivalent of a sign on its back that says "fuck my ass."

238
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Exactly.

239
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
It's begging for you to fuck it.

240
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,780
I looked up...

241
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
These whorish monkeys, they're putting their ass on the glass, dude.

242
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,980
I did, I did just google "most fuckable monkey"

243
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:18,980
What'd you end up with?

244
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:19,980
Um...

245
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Uh, the human, technically, it's a monkey

246
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,980
Wow, here, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait

247
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Should we... nah, we shouldn't read this list

248
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,980
I found a list called "The World's 7 Most Fuckable Lesser Apes"

249
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,980
Um, yeah, we should read that list

250
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,980
What, what website is this on?

251
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,980
It's on Runt of the Web

252
00:10:41,980 --> 00:11:06,300
web

253
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,100
The website loaded but nothing else loaded.

254
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,300
Oh, I got it, dude.

255
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,620
I'll tell you what number one of eight is, right?

256
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,580
Also, there's eight entries here.

257
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:17,620
I can't, I can't, oh, it's 'cause I have Adblock on, huh?

258
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,460
Turn it off, dude.

259
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:21,140
You're gonna want to see this hot monkey.

260
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,500
Okay. What the fuck, dude?

261
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,300
Oh, yeah, mine won't load either.

262
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,380
It must be Adblock.

263
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Yeah, it's Adblock.

264
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:28,780
I actually love supporting websites in Amazon,

265
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,100
so I never have Adblock on.

266
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,100
I hate supporting websites.

267
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,500
Dude, you should use--

268
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,980
All right, I'm on Adblock Plus

269
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:38,480
I'm whitelisting "Rent of the Web/Fuckable Apes"

270
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
[laughter]

271
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,480
I can't wait to, in a year, see that on my whitelist

272
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
and look at my ad block.

273
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,480
It's so funny that we had something else planned.

274
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,480
[laughter]

275
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,480
We'll get to it. This is more, this is really pressing right now.

276
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,480

00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,460

00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,320
that we've ever read on this show.

292
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,240
- Oh my God.

293
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,400
- They say, he might not be able to give consent,

294
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,800
but those come hither eyebrows scream yes, yes.

295
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,280
- Oh my God, dude.

00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:11,120

you wrote this wrong website.

299
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,160
- Yeah, what the fuck is this website?

300
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:20,120
- Hold on, let me look at the Donald Trump stuff.

301
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,760
- I think this is a,

302
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,880
I think this is a satire website.

303
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,280
- A satire website.

304
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,940
and this is like

305
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,880

the city to best clap backs of all time

313
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,760
We I think we should spend some time on this.

314
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,760
And in the world's seven most fuckable lesser apes.

315
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
Right in the middle. What's number two?

316
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,760
Siemang.

317
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,760
Oh, the Siemang. That's the best ape.

318
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
That's my favorite. Maxing out at 30 pounds.

319
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
Oh, he's got a middle part. The Siemang is the biggest.

320
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:08,760
The Siemang has a guller sac.

321
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,760
So it's like, it has like a throat like a frog.

322
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
And it like makes these crazy noises.

323
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,760
Two ball sacs. That's ultimate.

324
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Yeah. Maxing out at 30 pounds,

325
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,760
the Siemang is the biggest of the lesser apes

326
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
in more ways than one, they said.

327
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Just the thought of getting inside this fru-vigorous member of the mor-moraceae

328
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:26,760
Oh, come on.

329
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Is enough for us to overlook its inability to say no.

330
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Why are they obsessed with this- with monkeys?

331
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,760
Dude, what the fuck is this?

332
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,760
Saying yes or no to sex.

333
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:37,760
Who wrote this? How did we-

334
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,760
How do we report this to the police?

335
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,760
Yeah.

336
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,760
I'm trying to-

337
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,760
Before we finish the list off.

338
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,760
I'm trying to call the cops.

339
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:53,960
Hey, there's like a guy online who is making pictures of monkeys that are horny and I might

340
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,560
commit a crime if you don't take it down.

341
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,480
Number three is the northern buff-cheeked gibbon.

342
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,320
This newly discovered species of gibbon from the jungles of Southeast Asia makes us hot

343
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
and heavy.

344
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,900
In fact, we'd like to buff its southern cheeks.

345
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:12,120
With its sleek, dark pelt and relative of manly gait, who cares if it lacks the understanding

346
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,160
to acquiesce to a sexual act?

347
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Why?

348
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Why are they so-

349
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,460
is this this is like the evil version of the like like because

350
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,360
of his great size.

351
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,960
He cannot be a human being and thus and yeah, the same this

352
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,560
is the same writing style.

353
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,860
This is the most readable by this is written by the guy who

354
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,660
got AIDS.

355
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,760
This is that guy.

356
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,260
No, it's not.

357
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,160
It's him dude.

358
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,360
No, it's not.

359
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,960
I think this is his website.

360
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,860
Number four is Kloss's Gibbon.

361
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,160
They all look kind of the same.

362
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,760
Yeah, they're all as as called also called the.

363
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,260
Yeah, why is it all Gibbons?

364
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,260
Long arms, dude.

365
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,560
They hit it from the back.

366
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,860
Slap that ass.

367
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,760
Choke you.

368
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,260
Put a finger in your mouth.

369
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:58,760
That's just the truth.

370
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,060
You know how like girl,

371
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,960
but sometimes you'll have to like be like,

372
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,060
hey, move your move your when your doggy style,

373
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,460
you have to be like move your knees further.

374
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,760
I don't know what that means, but go on monkey style.

375
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,760
I'm sorry.

376
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,360
Okay.

377
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,160
Yeah, because they have long the distance from their hips to their knees is too long.

378
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,160
"Clauses given, also called the Baloo, this primate is considered a threatened species."

379
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
Yeah, when I'm around.

380
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,160
"Probably from all the fucking people want to do to it."

381
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
Well, they stole my joke.

382
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
[laughter]

383
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,160
"One thing's for sure, give us ten minutes alone with this guy, and we'll show you an animal to which the concept of permission is non-existent."

384
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
This is like...

385
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
Ugh! Awful!

386
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
Oh, Christ!

387
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
Come on!

388
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,160
Come on, dude.

389
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,160
I mean, we talk about fucking animals, what, every episode, fifteen times?

390
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,160
But not like that!

391
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
not like that.

392
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,160
But not like that, dude.

393
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,800
I like that the recommended stuff on this page is still like, "The funniest reactions to

394
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,520
Capitol Riot.

395
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,520
Best toys.

396
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:58,600
Buy one of these 35 toys for your niece or nephew."

397
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:03,040
Like they don't even have anything that's similar to this.

398
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,120
Bizarre photos that prove history was far stranger than you ever realized.

399
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,240
It is just like a random...

400
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
This is the best website.

401
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,040
So this website minus this.

402
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,840
Number five the Bornean white bearded Gibbon.

403
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:22,440
Endemic to a small range between the Capuas and Burrito Rivers.

404
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Burrito River.

405
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,040
Okay, sign me up dude.

406
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,340
Hey, somebody somebody send Perry Grip an email.

407
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,940
He's going to want to hear about this one.

408
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,140
He's going to think of a pretty funny song.

409
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:32,840
In Southern Borneo.

410
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,420
We imagine it gets its name from the amount of cum people shoot

411
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,240
into its face when they see it.

412
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:44,120
those piercing eyes unable to reflect either implied or express agreement

413
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,160
definitely get our panties dropping

414
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,080
uh... so it's a woman

415
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,000
of learning this or a man who wears panties

416
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,720
skinner way it's getting pretty hot

417
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,720
uh... let's just finish this was just cut the rest of the way here to come in

418
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,000
with what you don't like it yeah i don't like i mean it's anymore

419
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,240
i wish it people need to go check out this website and you see that

420
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,000
this is clearly supposed to be a a satirical uh... list

421
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,040
but it's the only one from the website

422
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,280
i think that was just a normal you had a place for you to have a table section

423
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,840
dedicated to donald trump

424
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,620
well he said he's good let me tell you he actually did all that crap

425
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,520
all that wild crap that he did that

426
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,780
of the crazy as shit

427
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,080
uh... i just would like click

428
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,200
of shit

429
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,680
actually clicked one of the the

430
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,520
when i fucking click up here

431
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:41,800
I accidentally clicked one of the ads and it brought me to coffee magazine dot com.

432
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,520
We should write an email to coffee magazine and be like, "Do you know what your ads are

433
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,680
on?

434
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
Are you sure?"

435
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,600
Here's coffee, here's coffee magazine.

436
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:56,400
Coffee brewing methods, coffee reviews, coffee stories, coffee recipes, coffee musings, and

437
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,960
coffee perks.

438
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,240
Yeah, I don't think they'd be thrilled.

439
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,240
We should try and get this website de-platformed.

440
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,240
Start with the advertisers.

441
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,740
Yeah they want to fuck a bunch of different kinds of monkeys.

442
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,580
Dude I just clicked on the Donald Trump heading and the first image is just a picture of Donald

443
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,080
Trump standing up and behind him is the Israel flag and in front of him is Jesus.

444
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,440
Pretty strong Photoshop job.

445
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,840
Yeah.

446
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,080
That's pretty good.

447
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:32,000
We don't have to say, we'll just say, okay, the next two are the Lar Gibbon and the Silvery

448
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Gibbon.

449
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It's all Gibbons.

450
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:40,160
Yeah, so the thing is, I get that this is a joke, but it's also like, at least pick some

451
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,680
like actually fuckable monkeys, you know what I mean?

452
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,200
Right, you just looked at Gibbons.

453
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,800
Yeah, like you just found, you just searched like lesser apes and picked like the first

454
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,800
group.

455
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,800
Oh, here, okay.

456
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,760
I'm really glad they have a, they have a Facebook share button, guys, in case you want.

457
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,160
I think I might share this on Facebook right now.

458
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,480
I found the author.

459
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,840
What's his name?

460
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,360
Michael Gibbon fucker.

461
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:05,120
Wow, what are his other articles?

462
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,120
Top 10 Gibbons I fucked.

463
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,400
There's a podcast called Gibbons We Fucked.

464
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,160
And who does he host it with?

465
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:23,080
Channa's Ape.

466
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,840
i found that i found the about page for run to the web

467
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,520
uh...

468
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,480
run to the web is a spirited site that brings a breath of fresh air to the web's

469
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,000
comedic landscape

470
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,020
by marrying a blend of biting original pieces with highly clickable curated

471
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:39,880
content

472
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,920
run to represent internet comedy at its very best

473
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:47,200
and then it has a section for the people behind runs and it's three people here

474
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,580
the first two people

475
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,580
are morgan in gary and terry dorgan

476
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,720
and they have pictures

477
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,720
the third person does not have a picture and it's alex baldwin

478
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,480
and it says founder

479
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,520
helen paul came in to get a guy who did a great alex baldwin

480
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,680
now i don't think so

481
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,520
i'd is a quick dot i would i would see a picture of the right here

482
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,760
and uh... it's a bit of a guy's on the

483
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,400
we should we call your address is twitter

484
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,440
has he done

485
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,240
Not too good.

486
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,940
Not too good? Is he dead?

487
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,140
No, he's alive.

488
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,240
Do you think he's getting top from a monkey?

489
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,140
I don't know.

490
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,240
I think a really fuckable monkey would be a gorilla

491
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,240
because they have those big nostrils and you could maybe fit your penis in it.

492
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,340
Oh, come on, man.

493
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,840
Come on. What the hell?

494
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,940
What? I don't want to fuck a monkey.

495
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,540
It's definitely not okay for us to fuck any monkey.

496
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:43,840
No.

497
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,240
Correct. Right?

498
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
I would never fuck a monkey.

499
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,940
Agreed.

500
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:50,860
But can like a gorilla fuck a gibbon?

501
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:55,260
- I mean that's the way of nature, yeah.

502
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,860
- What, but is it okay?

503
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,220
- If a dog--

504
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,780
- What if a duck fucks a bug?

505
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,580
- If a dog fucks a cat in the forest and nobody's around.

506
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,180
- Yeah, that's a very good point.

507
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,860
- Can they make a baby?

508
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,700
- I don't know, man.

509
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,260
I'm just trying to figure out the math of all this.

510
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,180
- The offspring of a dog and cat.

511
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,860
- It's a fox.

512
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,660
uh...

513
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:22,540
uh... that's why they're in the woods yeah if you're abandoned that's why they

514
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,740
can't be pets because

515
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:28,040
uh... i don't know

516
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,360
his you're just just as we have to speak i don't like them

517
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,480
i think they could uh...

518
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:37,940
i think you could only seen videos of russian people in info

519
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,820
that's the craziest that's the thing i love about russia's area of record

520
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:48,380
fund us to cause disorder in politics but they also are gonna let me get a

521
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:54,180
caracal. It's much like a fox is what happens when a dog fucks a cat if a

522
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,760
robber breaks into your house and your guard dog starts fucking him that's how

523
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:06,180
raccoons are made. Wow really? Oh my god wow. That makes so much sense.

524
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:10,780
Like a criminal outfit. True yeah that's a good point yeah and that's why raccoons love

525
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,620
stealing it's in their DNA dude. They steal your trash.

526
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,740
Because they're part robbers. A dog will eat a trash.

527
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,180
Dogs like trash. Robbers like stealing.

528
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,140
Yeah so you get a perfect trash.

529
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:30,620
Exactly. Yeah. You ever seen somebody call a raccoon a trash panda?

530
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:33,340
Yeah it's pretty epic. You ever see?

531
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,380
Pretty good. Yeah. I'm really excited. I love those people like

532
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,220
freshman year of college who would just do like reddit jokes to you in class

533
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:47,260
yeah and they'd say shit like that yeah dude total trash panda oh look at the

534
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:53,020
little trash panda mm-hmm oh that dogger oh oh no look at this

535
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:56,300

it's so cool dude little do you know that's so cool

537
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,700
that snake will kill you dude yeah wholesome wiggle boy is not

538
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:07,340
yeah all right that's the if you're using that to describe a snake

539
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:12,300
It's, I guess I'm fine with that, but if you're using that to describe anyone else...

540
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:16,620
If you're using that to describe a person, I got a real problem with that.

541
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:20,140
Yeah, that feels really charged and a lot of different ways.

542
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,420
Yeah, I don't like that.

543
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,140
Did you hear that?

544
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,140
They're talking about Jeff from The Wiggles.

545
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,740
He's always sleeping!

546
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,740
Did you guys ever know anybody with a snake, a pet snake, like a big one?

547
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,780
No.

548
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,060
I knew a guy, what are those snakes that are like yellow and white?

549
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,420
What the fuck?

550
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:44,620
Yeah, my neighbor growing up, his dad had like an alligator for a couple weeks.

551
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,060
Oh, that's not a pet.

552
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:46,780
What do you mean?

553
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,420
That's a guest.

554
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,740
He had an alligator stay over.

555
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,860
He didn't have a pet alligator for a couple weeks.

556
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,060
Yeah.

557
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,740
That's fucking, it's a rental, dude.

558
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,900
Yeah, I guess.

559
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,460
Yeah.

560
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,220
Did you get to meet the alligator?

561
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:08,220
I think I got to see it in the cage it was in.

562
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
Yeah, alligators are not like...

563
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,220
The case?

564
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,220
I would say they're the only animal that people...

565
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:20,220
It's impossible to anthropomorphize with cute photos and be like,

566
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,220
"Oh, look at this sweet..."

567
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,220
It's just a fucking dinosaur.

568
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,220
No, people do it.

569
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
People do it.

570
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,220
Have you seen that?

571
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,220
People do that?

572
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,220
People do that all the time.

573
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,220
It pisses me off because it's like...

574
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,220
I don't want to see a video of...

575
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:33,580
of like people post the videos of the really fat alligators.

576
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,180
Oh yeah. And they and they act like it's cute and it's like I know

577
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:41,340
you give that thing one second with a baby with it with its brother and it

578
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:45,980
will rip its brother in half. Yeah dude. It's like the only baby. It's the only

579
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,020
animal. Why do you want to give a baby to an alligator? You want you want to give

580
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,420
an alligator a baby? I just want to see what happens.

581
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:57,980
It's like I'm doing experiments okay. It's like do you guys remember the

582
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,420
The scientific method.

583
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,260
You guys remember those like YouTube videos,

584
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,620
early YouTube videos where they would just

585
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,060
make two animals fight?

586
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:04,900
Yeah.

587
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,720
Those ruled.

588
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:09,460
They put like a scorpion in with like a fucking, a snake.

589
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,700
Yeah, or like the classic mongoose

590
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,100
versus a cobra or whatever.

591
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,740
Dude, those were so sick.

592
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,580
Or like, there was one that I always heard about,

593
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,100
which probably didn't exist,

594
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,420
but my older brother told me about it,

595
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:28,180
and it was a, it was an ostrich versus a lion.

596
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,420
And he claimed that there was a video

597
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,620
of an ostrich versus a lion

598
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:34,880
where the ostrich kicks the lion in the face

599
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,260
so hard that it dies.

600
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,220
- Yeah, I don't believe that at all.

601
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,740
- I believe that.

602
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,580
- Yeah.

603
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,300
- Do you think an ostrich, okay.

604
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,380
Ostrich versus kangaroo, do you think that,

605
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,740
or kangaroo wins, kangaroos are nuts.

606
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,220
- Probably fall in love, dude.

607
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:52,100
- What are ostrich native to?

608
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:59,100
ridge

609
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,100
there were ostriches around here dude

610
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,740
i thought there were ostriches in fuckin'

611
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,940
australia

612
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,100
i think australia is emus

613
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,100
they already have their kicking thing

614
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,140
okay so kangaroo vs emu

615
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:16,420
uh... i'm sure that's happened and i'm sure you can find a way to do that

616
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,700
kangaroo beats anything that can't punch it

617
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,340
yeah

618
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,140
Yeah, but dude getting pecked out by a bit like oh

619
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:27,780
And they have claws and getting pecked out. What does that mean? Yeah, dude?

620
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:32,540
And I just got pecked out

621
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:35,020
Yeah, I don't wear

622
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,220
picked out of your eyes

623
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:44,340
Guys get all pecked out and shit not get it you're getting them pecked out though. Yeah, I just got

624
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
he pecked out.

625
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,100
Oh dude, this kangaroo is smaller than this emu.

626
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,140
He shut down the zoo for a private party.

627
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,060
Kangaroos are so fucking strong though and they have claws and shit.

628
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,740
They can fuck people up.

629
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,460
I do, I...

630
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:02,620
Like if we're talking like a big kangaroo, like a full grown kangaroo.

631
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,620
It's gotta be like a baby.

632
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,820
It could just like wring its fucking neck dude.

633
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,820
I just think of that video of that guy punching.

634
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,260
Dude, this emu is, oh my god, it's bucking out.

635
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:13,340
That guy punching that kangaroo in the face and the kangaroo is like, "How did you just

636
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:16,060
kick me with your hands is one of the fucking greatest videos.

637
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:20,140
Dude, there's so many videos of kangaroos like walking up to like a glass door and just like

638
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,980
going through it because they don't realize that it's a door and then just leaving.

639
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:27,500
It's like smashing through shit, dude.

640
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:30,380
A scary ass animal up close is a fucking pelican.

641
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,380
Oh, yeah.

642
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,380
Oh, they're weird.

643
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,380
It's the size of a polar bear.

644
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,500
Birds look disgusting up close.

645
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,620
No, a pelican will like attack you.

646
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,060
It has a giant mouth that it uses to eat trash and free meat.

647
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:46,660
do that thing where they like hit their neck up through the bottom of their mouth and like

648
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,220
turn their mouth inside out?

649
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,300
Yeah, they're really scary.

650
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,220
Every bird looks disgusting up close.

651
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,140
Honestly, every bird fucking sucks.

652
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,140
I hate birds.

653
00:28:55,140 --> 00:29:00,940
You know what the worst, yeah, the worst bird, the worst looking bird is the condor.

654
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
Condor's bad.

655
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
The California condor.

656
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,620
I think the worst looking bird is the potoo.

657
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,620
What is that?

658
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,700
I hate fucking potoo.

659
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,020
That's the one that has the eyes that go the opposite directions.

660
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,020
I need to spell it.

661
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
P-O-T-O-O.

662
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
I can't imagine.

663
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,380
They're just like, like, it's just like a demon.

664
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
I'll say this much, as a socialist...

665
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,140
What are you talking about?

666
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,460
As a socialist, I think the worst is the, is the bald eagle.

667
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,460
Look, dude.

668
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,460
Yeah.

669
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,380
It's an ugly, it represents so much...

670
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:32,340
Dude, this looks like this, this looks like a, this looks like a sleaf stack.

671
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,340
It's fucked up, dude.

672
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:37,740
It either has, the eyes are either pitch black or they're like bright yellow with pupils pointing

673
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,740
the opposite way.

674
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,740
You know what? No, I just saw this thing with its mouth open.

675
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,740
Yeah, dude. It's fucked.

676
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,740
I wanna throw a stick of dynamite in there.

677
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:51,740
Do you guys ever see something natural and you just think, "Nature's so metal."

678
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,740
Yeah. Nature is metal.

679
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:56,740
I do sometimes wish nature was more hip-hop.

680
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,740
Yeah.

681
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,740
I wish that there was more kind of hip-hop animals.

682
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,740
Like breakdancing and graffiti.

683
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:09,180
I'll accept anything in nature as long as it's not rap or country.

684
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,740
So true, yeah.

685
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:14,060
As long as nature is not rap and it's not country, I like it.

686
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,540
Even like the old stuff.

687
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:22,740
But nature, there should be more like, you know, hippos that can do graffiti or something.

688
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,180
Hip hop hippo?

689
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,620
Now I wasn't even thinking that, but now that's the best thing you've ever said.

690
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,380
And I'm really proud of you and I hope you keep talking.

691
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:37,220
What if there were two rappers from New Zealand called the Hip Hop Hopotamus and the Rhyme

692
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,220
Noscerous?

693
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:41,020

00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,620
No.

701
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:57,020
No, it's because all the vowels move down one.

702
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,180
Fleep.

703
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,420

Hungry, hungry Hitler?

719
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,380
I've got a long ride home, and I like to eat spam from the camp.

720
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,380
Back to heaven.

721
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,180
It's a long train back to heaven where I live.

722
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,180
He doesn't live in heaven.

723
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Yeah.

724
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,180
For him, for Hitler, hey, well...

725
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,180
Don't set me from heaven to be your imaginary friend?

726
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,180
For Hitler, heaven is...

727
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,180
I'm your guardian angel?

728
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,180
His heaven is hell.

729
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,180
Dude, if Hitler was your guardian angel, you'd be... you might be a bad boy.

730
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Yeah.

731
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,180
What if he was your family out there?

732
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,580
What if the guy in like It's a Wonderful Life, he's like about to kill himself and his guardian

733
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,180
angel comes up to rescue him and it's Hitler?

734
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,180
He's like, "Oh, fuck you."

735
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,020
Oh man.

736
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,580
(laughing)

737
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,680
He's British Hitler.

738
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:25,120
What if he had a guardian demon?

739
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,960
I do.

740
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:27,340
That would be sick, dude.

741
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,320
Dude, guardian demon,

742
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,400
'cause a guardian demon would protect you.

743
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:34,560
Dude, I have a guardian demon, it's called my mind.

744
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,440
Isn't that just big mouth?

745
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,600
Doesn't, don't they have demons in big mouth?

746
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,440
They have puberty demons.

747
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,680
No, yeah, I think they have like--

748
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,600
Ugh.

749
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,440
Like--

750
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,280
Yeah, it's disgusting.

751
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,680
I thought it was cooler.

752
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,660
I thought the whole thing was that they're all,

753
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,400
it's like devil worship.

754
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:54,900
Yeah dude, I thought that it was like those were like the souls of pedophiles that were like trapped within monsters that were trying to like teach them to masturbate and stuff.

755
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,900
I guess that's what it is.

756
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:04,900
Yeah, yeah, I thought no I thought it was like like eternally cursed like pedophile souls that were like trapped within a crystal.

757
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,900
I was like pretty sure about that but and they get punished forever by having to watch kids jerk off.

758
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,900
Yeah, those are the good pedophiles that go to heaven so they get rewarded by becoming.

759
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,400
Oh, it's just priests.

760
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Puberty monsters.

761
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,640
Oh, holy shit.

762
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,600

You're fucking with the Meisters right now.

834
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,220

00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,060
bad taste.

867
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,860
yeah I tried, I did, I did. It was not that you played all the characters.

868
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:45,700
I did try to bring Rasputia from Norbit into in the heights I thought it was a

869
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,540
good idea.

870
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:49,660
Thought it would work. Yeah, no it didn't work. No.

871
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,460
Actually a lot of people were mad at me. You paid fifteen thousand dollars for the

872
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,500
rights to the book. I paid another fifteen thousand for the exact suit.

873
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:03,740
Yeah, you had a tailor-made you had a light and magic design

874
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:08,380
You got the actual you got the actual suit that was used in filming, but it was like years old

875
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:13,100
So it was like rotten it rotting the latex like had holes in it and was like there were maggots in it

876
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:16,780
It was like a Chuckie cheat like an abandoned Chuckie. Yeah, like one of those old

877
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,700
Yeah, exactly like a Five Nights at Freddy's in the way, you know, you know, I

878
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,700
Do anything for the I'd do anything for this thing we called show

879
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,140
Wow, I

880
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,300
I will say you left it all on the stage.

881
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Mm-hmm.

882
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,300
Yep.

883
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,300
You did.

884
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
You left so many voices on that stage.

885
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,740
Voices I could never do again.

886
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,740
Yeah.

887
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:39,460
And probably could have never done then.

888
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,460
Mm-hmm.

889
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,460
But you did it.

890
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,460
I did it.

891
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,940
And it was, it got, I got one and a half star.

892
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:46,940
Yep.

893
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,940
Roger Ebert.

894
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,940
Mm-hmm.

895
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:49,940
That's what killed him.

896
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:50,940
Because I filmed it.

897
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:51,940
I sent it to him.

898
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
He survived cancer and then died at your show.

899
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,500
I sent Roger Ebert the suit.

900
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,180
He died of racist shock.

901
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
Yeah. He did.

902
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:05,180
You sent Roger Ebert the suit and the like plastics in it got into his bloodstream and gave him cancer.

903
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,180
Yeah.

904
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,180
What's wrong? Are you crying?

905
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:14,180
No, I just imagined Roger Ebert and Norbert, Norbit for some reason.

906
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,180
Roger Norbit?

907
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,180
I don't know. I don't even know what I'm laughing at.

908
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
[Laughter]

909
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,180
Here we go.

910
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
Oh, we're getting there dude.

911
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:33,500
Hey Patrick, Roger Ebert. He died. It's not funny that he died. Dude I'm so upset

912
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:40,740
that Roger Ebert died. Is it gonna make you laugh Patrick? Maybe an ostrich

913
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:48,180
kicked his jaw off. Yeah that would have been cool. That would have been some pimp shit.

914
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:52,180
Roger Ebert just fucking lost his jaw in an ostrich accident.

915
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,180
Yeah and then people constantly like "oh he lost his jaw to cancer"

916
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:00,180
That was the name of the ostrich!

917
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,180
Nah dude he was in the Sahara and he got his shit rocked by an ostrich.

918
00:40:04,180 --> 00:40:08,180
You know who wins in ostrich versus Roger Ebert?

919
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:12,180
A kangaroo literally slid his jaw dude.

920
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:16,180
It slid right off.

921
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:24,420
do just I watched Rick Moranis get his jaw slit. I forgot about that. That's one of the funniest

922
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:29,300
sentences. Kangaroos just walk around Australia doing the knockout game to people. Yeah. Yeah.

923
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:35,700
Yeah. It's like a it's like a random encounter in like an RPG. It's like when you like like find a

924
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,500
Pokemon in the wild grass. It's just like a kangaroo can just hop up to you at any moment

925
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,740
and just fucking rock your shit dude.

926
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
Just fucking, just...

927
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,220
And you know that they laugh so hard.

928
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,820
And the thing is, it's for the love of the game.

929
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,260
They don't take anything.

930
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,780
They have that pouch.

931
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,620
They could put your iPhone in there.

932
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,980
They can't even do it.

933
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,380
Have you...

934
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,660
Oh, we've talked about it,

935
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,420
but the inside of an ostrich pouch?

936
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,300
Yeah.

937
00:40:59,300 --> 00:40:59,700
Yeah.

938
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,340
Disgusting.

939
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:00,900
It's wet.

940
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:01,700
It's a pussy, dude.

941
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,460
No, it's bone.

942
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,220
Um, oh yeah.

943
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:09,300
Just imagine hollows rounding the corner

944
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:17,180
in like a chicago and it's getting knocked out of the game by a kangaroo

945
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:24,820
any midwestern state having a kangaroo problem

946
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:25,580
any

947
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,060
any gang that gets a kangaroo

948
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,900

949
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,900

00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,620

00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,660

963
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,000
and just seemed like a really nice guy.

964
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,700
And then he was like, so your brother tells me to me,

965
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,460
he was like, your brother tells me you live in New York City.

966
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,420
And I was like, oh yeah, yeah, I do.

967
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:19,700
And he's like, well, I only went to New York City once.

968
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,900
It was with this girl that I was going steady with

969
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,860
back in the day.

970
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:25,300
And you know, the thing about New York City

971
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,780
is you shouldn't go out late at night.

972
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,940
You know that son?

973
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,900
And I was like, yeah, man, sure.

974
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,980
And he was like, yeah.

975
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:34,680
So one time I went on a walk around her house

976
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,680
at about 10 p.m. Brooklyn, New York City.

977
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,120
And what do I see across the block from me?

978
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,800
But let's just say five of New York's finest youths.

979
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,960
- Oh man. - That's what he said.

980
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:46,920
And then he was like.

981
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,040
- Oh no. (laughs)

982
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,840
- I basically had two options.

983
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,860
I could either run away, at which point they would chase me

984
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,720
and they would kill me, or I could just walk past them.

985
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,320
And so I held my breath and I walked past them

986
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:03,360
and then I ran away all the way home.

987
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:06,920
so he just told me a story about this scene five black guys are just running

988
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,580
home

989
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:17,580
and i was like okay and and uh... yeah new york's crazy dude

990
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:20,860
yeah and then we started to see it is he still does he think it's still like

991
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,120
that

992
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,840
it is he still has never like that there was never a time where you said that

993
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,680
that's what i think i don't know what you like

994
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,680
I have to run home!

995
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Oh, I'm glad you ran away safely.

996
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
No, I'm not glad you ran away.

997
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,680
Did you know that I never had to do that?

998
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,680
That's not what I'm saying.

999
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,680
Yeah, but that was

1000
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,680
that was the only, actually

1001
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,680
the only racism that I saw when I was home.

1002
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,680
In North Carolina,

1003
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,680
that was the only racism you saw.

1004
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
Yeah, it was a pretty record

1005
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,680
year for me.

1006
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,680
You didn't see any Confederate flags?

1007
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,680
My granddad kept his lips

1008
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,800
lips shut about Tiger Woods for an entire two weeks.

1009
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,360
It was really impressive, yeah.

1010
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,840
- Wow. - That's crazy.

1011
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,440
That's actually, I'm impressed.

1012
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:04,360
- Me too. - I'm proud of him.

1013
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:07,000
- He was high on Oxycontin 'cause he had surgery,

1014
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,780
so it could've been that.

1015
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:11,840
He just kept falling asleep and asking for pretzels,

1016
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,840
so he didn't have a lot of time to complain

1017
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,200
about Tiger Woods.

1018
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,320
- Hey, dude, what kind of-- - All in two ways.

1019
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,600
- What kind of surgery do they give him?

1020
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,320
They take the freakin' racist bone out of his body?

1021
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,800
- Wow, maybe.

1022
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,640
- You get it?

1023
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,640
still leaves like a hundred and sixty something.

1024
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
Yeah, two hundred and five other ones.

1025
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,640
[Laughter]

1026
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:31,640
[Laughter]

1027
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:33,640
Uh,

1028
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:35,640
have you guys ever been

1029
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,640
abandoned by your parents?

1030
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,640
Like, once or twice.

1031
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,640
Was it funny? No.

1032
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,640
No. Pretty upsetting.

1033
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:45,640
At, uh, at,

1034
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,640
I think, um,

1035
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:49,640
it was like, uh,

1036
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,640
I was in band, so I played the trombone.

1037
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:58,940
And we had dead Kennedy's. Yeah. I'm actually the guy who runs the account now. That's wrong. Oh nice

1038
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:00,760
It's not an interesting story

1039
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,640
I did let I was like a weekend like there was like we would do like weekend

1040
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:09,780
practice session or something like we'd have to do like some kind of band thing on like Saturday mornings and

1041
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,720
My parents forgot to pick me up after so I was just at school for a while

1042
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:18,360
My I was in elementary school. So it's not old enough to like walk home

1043
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:26,080
Yeah, my mom left me one time when she went on like an hour drive out of town and apparently I like it like

1044
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:30,560
Ruined my relationship with her for a couple months and I like talked about it all the time when I was a kid

1045
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,180
It's not I brought it's the only time I remembered and then I brought that up to my dad kind of recently

1046
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:39,000
I was like, oh, yeah mom left me at the house once I was a kid

1047
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,880
He's like she left you the house once you don't remember I used to do that shit all the time

1048
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:50,440
I used to forget you for like eight hours straight and he reminded me that he like left me in a Walmart twice

1049
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:55,500
He lost me at Busch Gardens once and I was like, yeah, I guess just you just had like a dad pass

1050
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:01,760
Like I just didn't expect any better and my brain just kind of didn't think about it again, of course, you know

1051
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,680
Number two things that all moms do is tell little white lies. Yeah

1052
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:09,440
Yeah

1053
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:14,340
Yeah, like he's just a friend positron wild talk has a comment here. Oh my man

1054
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:18,140
He's back quite easy for me to smell a rat when as a kid

1055
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,520
I had minor roles in school plays having only one line in the whole two hours of the production

1056
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:30,320
Alongside bigger kids with more actions and words to memorize and time perfectly and according to mom and dad I made the best performance

1057
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,920
Good for him dude. Sounds like a lie though. Yeah. Yeah

1058
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,720
Let's see anything else good on here. Yeah, so they tell lies about white people what?

1059
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,900
That's what sir Skeletor the third says damn that's some funny shit, where's my pillow?

1060
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:56,840
Grandma sat on the Sun and her cheeks suffer from claustrophobia and your pillow is the only cure

1061
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:05,280
when my grandma steals my pillow to unburn her cheeks.

1062
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,680
- Yeah.

1063
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,560
- And then my mom lies to protect her.

1064
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,180
- Dude, I would never let my grandma's ass

1065
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:12,280
touch my pillow, dude.

1066
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,440
- Blue Topaz Ice Vanilla comments,

1067
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:18,240
like saying we'll get candy if we fold the clothes.

1068
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,200
The amount of times I've been tricked by that,

1069
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,360
too many to count.

1070
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,000
(laughing)

1071
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,800
- Just stop and say, you know,

1072
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,800
if you keep getting tricked by it,

1073
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,800
you're not really getting tricked.

1074
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,200
- How many times can you get tricked by that?

1075
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:36,260
Totally I swear this time you're gonna get candy. Yeah, just pull in the football every time. Yeah good for them

1076
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:44,600
Number three throw away drawings and homemade gifts not really a white lie. Yeah. Yeah, that's that's a different thing

1077
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,800
I'm just a bad thing. Oh, that's a thing mom. Mom's - sorry

1078
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:49,800
I thought that it was a white lie list all of a sudden

1079
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,880
You thought it was a white lie list and number two was tell white lies

1080
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah, you know, yeah I did

1081
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:00,200
Yeah, moms do do that shit. Mm-hmm. Yeah

1082
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:03,840
Turkey asylum asks doesn't every mom do this?

1083
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:08,300
That's what the list is turkey. So I'm your fucking dumbass

1084
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:14,600
Yeah, my mom doesn't I don't have any like thing from when I was a kid

1085
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:20,240
I think it's all a goodwill probably still and she donated ten years ago. Yes. Oh your drawings

1086
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:25,040
Yeah, good. Well the by some drawings. Yeah, she would frame them and then donate them

1087
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,040
and so that people would think they were art.

1088
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
They should have a section in Goodwill that's just like a stack of papers.

1089
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,040
It's just like if you, instead of recycling papers, like if,

1090
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:35,040
'cause I like papers, you know, I like to look at them and see what's on them.

1091
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,040
Yeah.

1092
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:38,040
I could, like, they could be like forms that people don't need anymore,

1093
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
or like a drawing that they made, or like homework assignments.

1094
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:44,040
Yeah, I mean, why are you allowed to, why can you donate like photos,

1095
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:46,040
but you can't do paper?

1096
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:48,040
Yeah, just pieces of, like, receipts.

1097
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:51,040
Like, every, every thrift store has like a giant box of like old photos.

1098
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,040

1102
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:08,040

1104
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,680

1105
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,600
sorry around it sorry all my parking tickets got donated to Goodwill

1106
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,700
I couldn't pay any of that anywhere.

1107
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:24,540
You know what I'll do?

1108
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,100
I'll go there and I'll buy them for three bucks.

1109
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,140
- Yeah, you buy a parking ticket from Goodwill

1110
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:30,540
and then you get to pay it to save someone else.

1111
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,860
It's kind of like a pay it forward kind of thing.

1112
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,700
- That sucks.

1113
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,520
- Or you can buy it and put it on your car

1114
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,080
so they don't give you a ticket.

1115
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:38,620
- I buy it, I put it on the card.

1116
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:42,200
- No, they don't stop giving you tickets, dude.

1117
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:45,620
- I've never had a bad parking ticket.

1118
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,220
- Thinking that they stopped giving me parking tickets

1119
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,300
when I put one ticket on,

1120
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,300
You're like, no, this is all the same ticket.

1121
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,760
(laughs)

1122
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,480
I don't stack, dude.

1123
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,320
- I knew somebody in Boston who like,

1124
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,380
every time they parked their car,

1125
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:01,080
they would just put, they had a bunch of parking tickets.

1126
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:03,200
They would just put one of the envelopes on the car,

1127
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,920
thinking that that would fool the parking people.

1128
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,760
- Yeah.

1129
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,280
- No, in Boston, they put new tickets

1130
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,000
into the fucking envelope.

1131
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,420
- Yeah, that's one of the life hacks

1132
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:14,000
that people think will work, but it's a...

1133
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:14,840
- Does it?

1134
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:15,680
No, it doesn't work.

1135
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:18,480
- Yeah, it's so funny to think that that's the way you,

1136
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,960
I would smart the system like as if like,

1137
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,800
it's like everybody hasn't thought of that. Like a thousand,

1138
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:23,880
you know what I mean? Like,

1139
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,880
like as if the meter maid will walk by and be like, Oh,

1140
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,280
I guess I did give a ticket to this car.

1141
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:31,400
Like even though I just started my shift.

1142
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:34,120
That's what I do. Any, anytime I'm about,

1143
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,760
I think I'm about to get mugged by New York's finest use.

1144
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:41,040
I go ahead and put like a use a special effects makeup to put a stab wound on my

1145
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:44,040
stomach. No, I already, there you go. You already got it.

1146
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,040
You guys already, you guys must've forgotten. Yeah. There was a,

1147
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,000
there's a different crew

1148
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,460
and they got me

1149
00:50:51,460 --> 00:50:53,680
it works every time it's a life hack

1150
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:54,780
uh...

1151
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:59,180
use t_v_ and other screens as a babysitter

1152
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,860
there's nothing wrong with that

1153
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:04,540
not did what do you think they invented that shit

1154
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:05,360
exactly

1155
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:09,100

Yeah, now kids nowadays kids are in zoom school. Yeah, that's what I'm saying, dude

00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:26,500
Uh number six is slack on baby books and scrapbooks

1160
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,400
Whatever happened to soon school. It's 7 15. The bus is here

00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:41,200
Yeah, it is interesting not everyone's doing zoom school there's no more boom school

1163
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:44,380
Well, that is true. We got out of boom school.

1164
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:44,840
Yeah.

1165
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:45,340
Yeah.

1166
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,580
Goon school.

1167
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,540
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1168
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,540
That's a really good point.

1169
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:50,780
I'm trying to go to school.

1170
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,780
The way that the way that it's going nowadays,

1171
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,080
kids are sitting in their room school on Zoom school.

1172
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,040
Oh, my God.

1173
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:59,240
Instead of the school room on school for Foon.

1174
00:51:59,240 --> 00:51:59,580
Yeah.

1175
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:02,480
They're sitting on their Foon on Zoom

1176
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,740
and instead of being Hoom on school.

1177
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:06,800
Yeah.

1178
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,600
And then when you have to, you know,

1179
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,500
you got to go to Vroon school to get your license.

1180
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:12,820
Nowadays kids are on Zoom, whatever happened when they were going to

1181
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:13,320
screw.

1182
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,220
That's so true, dude.

1183
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:18,240
Yeah.

1184
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:21,540
You should go to, I think it was called scoom where you had all of your

1185
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,460
different books and you had lunch in the middle and there was different

1186
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:28,780
classes and there was a teacher, uh, and it was called scoom.

1187
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:29,480
Right.

1188
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,020
I heard that.

1189
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:31,960
Yeah.

1190
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:32,900
Heard that.

1191
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,660
Heard that.

1192
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:35,840
Uh, seven.

1193
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,620
This is one of Patrick's big complaints.

1194
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,200
Yeah.

1195
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,580
Um, skimp on bath time.

1196
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:46,260
The two comments here are, "It's a process, and sometimes we just don't have the time or

1197
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,260
energy.

1198
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,540
The bubbles, the toys, the mess.

1199
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,980
A spit shine or a once over with a baby wipe will do in a pinch."

1200
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,500
You're gonna spit on your kid?

1201
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:54,500
I spit on kids.

1202
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,500
What the fuck?

1203
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,500
What?

1204
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:57,500
What?

1205
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,500
What?

1206
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Everything, what?

1207
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,500
Why are you...

1208
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:01,500
I don't spit on kids.

1209
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:02,500
Do you shine them?

1210
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:04,020
You already said it.

1211
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:05,020
You can't take stuff back.

1212
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:09,540
You see a bald kid, you spit on his head, you shine it off, it's got a good polish.

1213
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,700
on it. You don't need to polish any kid, dude. You'd make that kid's bald head shine. Why

1214
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:21,700
does he need to shine? Listen, hey. Sun. My kid doesn't need any spit to shine. Sunlight.

1215
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:30,660
Sunlight? That's why he needs to shine? Sometimes you need your kid to be reflective. So you

1216
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:36,100
have to polish his head like a bowling ball. Mm-hmm. Look, if you're in a dungeon and there's

1217
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:38,380
- Three holes in a kid's head like a bowling ball.

1218
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,980
It would be so easy to put them in their room.

1219
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:42,380
- Yeah, that's what you can do

1220
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:44,540
with a newborn infant soft spot,

1221
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:45,380
is you can burrow your fingers in.

1222
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,580
- That's where they have it.

1223
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,420
- Yeah.

1224
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:48,240
- Yeah.

1225
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,120
- And then they have a cool like La Vida Loco thing

1226
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:52,900
on their back of their head.

1227
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,740
It's pretty neat.

1228
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,180
Number eight, lose their cool.

1229
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,640
- I hate that.

1230
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,900
- I hate when my mom loses her cool.

1231
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:02,300
My mom's so cool usually.

1232
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,620
She's always sitting on the couch,

1233
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:05,940
sunglasses and a saxophone.

1234
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:11,060
I misread it says we have all growled at our kids, but I misread it as we have all growled

1235
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:15,940
around our kids.

1236
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,100
Everybody's growled around their kids.

1237
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:20,220
Yeah, everybody everybody thought their kid was it was it.

1238
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:23,860
I caught my mom playing kickball and started growling in the living room.

1239
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:27,460
Yeah, just staring in the mirror, growling at your reflection.

1240
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:32,580
I'm just looking into the closet with your hair standing on end and just going,

1241
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:37,060
"Oh, hey, son. Hey, I didn't see you there."

1242
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,060
Yeah, I thought you were in the closet.

1243
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,940
Don't tell dad.

1244
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:44,020
Number nine, ration diapers.

1245
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:47,860
There's one comment that just says Asian parents in a nutshell.

1246
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:51,060
What?

1247
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,020
Do Asian parents just make you poop your pants over and over again?

1248
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:54,580
I don't know.

1249
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,900
I'm not changing that thing until it's hit.

1250
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,400
I don't, I mean, I don't have any parents yet.

1251
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,400
Yeah, you need a lowrider for me.

1252
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,500
Yeah, that's right.

1253
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,800
Otherwise, that's a waste of time.

1254
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,900
I want to see sparks.

1255
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:15,200
You know how it goes to do a butt sniff and a quick squeeze

1256
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:16,900
of the diaper to see if it warrants changing.

1257
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,500
If it is only half full, we'll let it ride for a while.

1258
00:55:19,500 --> 00:55:20,600
Two hours later.

1259
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,100
We realize the kid is soaked.

1260
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:23,200
Yeah, great job mom.

1261
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,900
Let it ride.

1262
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:28,420
Just let it ride for a while. Just let that thing play.

1263
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:30,420
Don't think we need to hold it yet.

1264
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:31,420
Run that shit back.

1265
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:33,420
Run that shit back, dude.

1266
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:36,420
Number 10 is skip pages in a book.

1267
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,420
I do this shit when I read to myself.

1268
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,420
Number 11, co-sleep with baby.

1269
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,420
Co-what?

1270
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,420
Co-sleep?

1271
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:52,420
One comment, at least the baby is protected in the arms of a nursing mother.

1272
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,420
That's not like a...

1273
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,260
Why is that like a thing that...

1274
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:59,660
Sleep with baby?

1275
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:02,260
It's very questionable to co-sleep with baby.

1276
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:04,260
Yeah, that's true.

1277
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:06,980
All moms do it.

1278
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:09,260
Be overprotective, throw away their kids' stuff.

1279
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:10,260
Roast their children.

1280
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:11,260
It's number 16.

1281
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:12,260
What's up, goofy?

1282
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:17,060
Hey, back from school, huh, goofy ass?

1283
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,620
You fail math class again today?

1284
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:19,620
Man, you stupid.

1285
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:20,620
Let me, come here.

1286
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,620
Your head's looking dusty.

1287
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:22,620
I'm going to polish that shit.

1288
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,620
Look at that hair loss.

1289
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:30,260
that hair line. Goofy ass hair line. Hitting your kid like a spittoon from ten yards away

1290
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:36,660
and it just goes ping really loud off the back of their head. If that shit don't ding, you're

1291
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,940
going to the doctor. Dude that's what the. We're going to shave that skull down. That's

1292
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,180
why when the baby has a soft spot you push it in so it makes a little hole you can spit

1293
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:53,420
into. True, yeah it's like a dip cup. Yeah. We should be molding them to have like hammers

1294
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:55,260
for heads or something.

1295
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:56,100
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1296
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:56,920
- Like I feel like they're like,

1297
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,220
make your kid wear some sort of like,

1298
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,980
like cookie cutter mold. - It's like.

1299
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:02,300
- So that like later in life,

1300
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,300
he has like a calculator on his head or something.

1301
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,660
- Yeah, they used to do that.

1302
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:08,060
And like, they would be like, they would like--

1303
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:09,860
- They used to put calculators in kids' heads?

1304
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:11,220
- They used to put calculators in kids' heads.

1305
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,980
No, like in like the Mayans or whatever would do,

1306
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,400
they would like shape their kids' heads

1307
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,060
to be like, look long like aliens.

1308
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:18,820
That's why they think they find alien skulls.

1309
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,660
Like they would do all this--

1310
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,540
- Oh, that's that?

1311
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,780
- Yeah, we don't do that anymore.

1312
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:22,780
It's fucked up.

1313
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,420
I mean, it can't be a downside to having a bigger head, right?

1314
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,060
It looks cool as hell.

1315
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:30,060
Exactly.

1316
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:35,620
Can you imagine walking around and having like the head shape of a xenomorph?

1317
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:40,140
Especially if your kid later in life gets into body modification, that's like a huge

1318
00:57:40,140 --> 00:57:41,140
head start.

1319
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,140
Even better if your kid doesn't, he's just an accountant.

1320
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,140
Exactly, yeah.

1321
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:49,020
And then he would be the most trusted accountant.

1322
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,580
He's got Charizard horns on the back of his head, dude.

1323
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,180
He works at Shake Shack.

1324
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,540
My lawyer must be really smart.

1325
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:01,260
He has a giant cylindrical skull that holds a very powerful math brain.

1326
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:02,260
Yeah.

1327
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:03,260
I don't know.

1328
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,580
I think probably your brain does get, it grows constantly, right?

1329
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,580
Yeah.

1330
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:08,580
It's either that or fingernails.

1331
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:11,140
So I can't remember which one.

1332
00:58:11,140 --> 00:58:12,660
It's probably the brain.

1333
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:13,660
I think it's brain.

1334
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,660
Yeah.

1335
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:15,660
It keeps growing after you die.

1336
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:16,660
Because fingernails don't really grow.

1337
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
You keep learning after you die.

1338
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,660
Yeah.

1339
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,100
You learn about like the underworld or whatever.

1340
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:22,100
Exactly.

1341
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:24,440
I'm putting a racing stripe on the side of his head, dude.

1342
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:26,060
That'd be kind of fucking cool.

1343
00:58:26,060 --> 00:58:26,780
A little indenture.

1344
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,820
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1345
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,620
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1346
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:32,420
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1347
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:34,220
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1348
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:35,820
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1349
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,420
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1350
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:39,060
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1351
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,700
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1352
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:42,300
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1353
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,060
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1354
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,700
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1355
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:47,300
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head.

1356
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:50,220
I'll put a racing stripe on the side of his head, dude.

1357
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:54,140
That'd be kind of fucking cool, a little indentioned racing stripe, and then turn it into a spoiler

1358
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:55,140
at the back.

1359
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:56,140
Yeah.

1360
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:57,140
Yeah.

1361
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:58,140
Oh my god.

1362
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,140
That'd be awesome.

1363
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,500
You could be confused for a transformer.

1364
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,060
Putting like a nitro booster on the back of my kid's head.

1365
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,060
Oh my god.

1366
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:09,700
But because of like, inertia, his feet don't move, so it just slams his head straight into

1367
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:10,700
the ground.

1368
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:15,740
I want to make my kid look like Minecraft Steve, put his head in one of those Japanese watermelon

1369
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,740
molds.

1370
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,740
Yeah, yeah.

1371
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:26,420
And then just have them walk around like, "Yeah, yeah, my dad loved Japanese watermelons."

1372
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,420
It's true.

1373
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:29,380
Why do they make them square?

1374
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,640
Is it just easier to cut?

1375
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:31,640
It just looks cool.

1376
00:59:31,640 --> 00:59:32,640
Yeah.

1377
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,580
Yeah, a kid, a guy with a cubicle head walking around just being like, "You would not believe

1378
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:41,220
what shape my mother's thingy was."

1379
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,820
Talking about box.

1380
00:59:43,820 --> 00:59:46,320
(laughing)

1381
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,400
- That bitch had a box on her.

1382
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:51,160
That's right.

1383
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:51,980
- Yeah.

1384
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,820
- My dad's a Lego man.

1385
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:54,220
- That thing had four quarters.

1386
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:55,060
(laughing)

1387
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:55,880
- Yeah it did.

1388
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,720
- That's right.

1389
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,680
- And four G spots.

1390
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,780
- That's right.

1391
00:59:58,780 --> 00:59:59,840
- Oh, come on man.

1392
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:02,400
- I would love like one of those Iranian barber videos

1393
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,540
where they like wrap around,

1394
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,640
they like take the towel off the guy's head

1395
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:06,840
and wrap around and show the cut

1396
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,000
and he just has a completely sharp edge.

1397
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,760
(laughing)

1398
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,360
Right, they're like sharpening a knife on that anvil.

1399
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:14,020
- Yeah, they're sharpening the sword.

1400
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,760
(laughing)

1401
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,320
- Oh, or you could give your kid an anvil head.

1402
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,920
- Oh, that'd be cool.

1403
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:22,240
- I mean, that's a lifelong hobby.

1404
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:25,800
- Or like a knife head, like a sword shaped knife head.

1405
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:28,040
- Straight up, my kid's got a blade for it.

1406
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,560
- No, not a cone, like a blade.

1407
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,600
- Like a really thin, wow.

1408
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,760
- That'd be awesome.

1409
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:33,840
- That might be sick, dude.

1410
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:34,680
- Yeah.

1411
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:35,800
- He has like a Wolverine style.

1412
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,040
It like keeps breaking his skin, but he like gets used to it.

1413
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,220
- Sure.

1414
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,680
- That'd be really cool. - God, that'd be,

1415
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,520
that'd be amazing.

1416
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,540
- I might have a kid now, like right now.

1417
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:48,460
- It might be time for me to have a kid.

1418
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,500
I might have a baby.

1419
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,580
- I'm gonna walk into the orphanage.

1420
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,620
So yeah, I know all these kids are all sad or whatever.

1421
01:00:53,620 --> 01:00:55,180
Which one do you think has the softest,

1422
01:00:55,180 --> 01:00:57,460
most moldable skull right now?

1423
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:59,300
- Who is the most malleable kid in here?

1424
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:00,540
- And the most, what's the,

1425
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,740
and who's the most expensive also?

1426
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:05,140
- Yeah, I'm not skimping out. - I'm not taking that one.

1427
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,060
- I'm not skimping on a-- - I'm not fucking skimping

1428
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:07,900
on a kid.

1429
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,460
- I will not be buying the cheapest kid here.

1430
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,020
Give me like the most expensive of the skimpy kids.

1431
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:13,780
Give me the most expensive and the least expensive,

1432
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,540
and I'm gonna make them both have sword heads

1433
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:17,100
and they're gonna battle at the end of the month.

1434
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:20,140
- Do you guys have like a PayPal pay-in-for kind of thing

1435
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:22,680
where I can use four payments to pay off my kid?

1436
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,680
- Do you guys take Best Buy gift cards?

1437
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,240
(laughing)

1438
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:27,080
- Yeah.

1439
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,280
I just need a payment plan for my adoption.

1440
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:32,260
Please.

1441
01:01:32,260 --> 01:01:36,060
Number 22, forget their kids in the backseat of the car.

1442
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:39,900
Well, that kills a lot of children, actually.

1443
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:46,020
Yeah, it's true. I feel like you hear two of those stories a year where it's like this guy was

1444
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:50,840
He went to work and forgot that he had his kid in his car and they came out the kid was dead

1445
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:56,220
It's like that kid's a pussy dude. Yeah, I could have survived. I just in a car all day

1446
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:02,540
Mm-hmm a hot car could not kill me. No, what is up with this kid? Why is he so easily easily killed?

1447
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:05,340
Yeah, you know, it's you know, probably saw like

1448
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:13,180
I'm scared or something. It's disgusting. It's disgusting that kids die in cars and they should they should get

1449
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:20,680
Should grow up, you know, you should do here's a way that car manufacturers Chevy if you're listening

1450
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:27,940
You know throw me a hundo. They could put a second wheel and gas pedal in the backseat

1451
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:36,280
So the kid can drive the kid. Can you do it? Yeah, they can escape or at least turn the fucking AC on, you know

1452
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,280
It's not a bad idea.

1453
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:39,280
Little toddler.

1454
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
Not at all.

1455
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:41,280
But then, yeah, the guy walks out of...

1456
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:45,280
Or like an ejector seat that launches the kid, like, into the air to get out of the car.

1457
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,280
Oh, that's a really good point, actually, yeah.

1458
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,280
Or like, um...

1459
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,280
Or maybe just like a TV they could watch, 'cause they don't afford them usually.

1460
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,280
Yeah, like a game. You could just give them a Game Boy.

1461
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:57,280
Yeah, that might be actually a cheaper, better alternative.

1462
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,280
But I also think maybe the...

1463
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,280
I mean...

1464
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:03,280
If they can find their way home, that's an even better story.

1465
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,280
You know, the dead kid, that's a pretty good news story.

1466
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:12,280
story but kid drives his way home. Kid dead from heat stroke lands in front yard of a

1467
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:19,280
parents house on a parachute. Yeah he was already dead his head fell over and hit the button.

1468
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:27,640
Yeah but at least he was home. Yeah landed, flew into the skylight and landed in his moms

1469
01:03:27,640 --> 01:03:31,000
cooking pot right in front of her.

1470
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:35,720
Alright, is that the end of the list?

1471
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,220

That's true.

1480

If it's a Saturday and you don't see that a teaser is posted for the premium episode,

1487
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,580
