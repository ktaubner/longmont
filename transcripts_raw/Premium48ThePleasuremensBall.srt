Alright, well, it's on now.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
You look- this is the most hobbit you've ever looked, bro.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,800
Mm-hmm.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,800
Oh, I looked like a hobbit as a child.

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,800
A lot.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,800
You were a hobbit child?

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I mean, you were short, I guess.

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
Oh, no.

12
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,800
Did you have really hairy feet?

13
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,800
No, I wouldn't wear shoes.

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
I wouldn't wear shoes anywhere.

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
So my feet were like constantly dirty.

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,120
I feel like the bottoms of my feet when I was a kid.

17
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,400
- Let me get a good look at these things.

18
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,840
Man, you have a long foot.

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,240
- Yep. - Yeah.

20
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,080
- What the fuck, man? - I know.

21
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,400
You know what they say about big feet.

22
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:41,760
- What size is that? - I kinda get it now.

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,300
- Stinky.

24
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:44,560
What size foot is that?

25
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,400
- It's an 11.

26
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,320
I think that's what it's size. - I think I wear an 11.

27
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,040
But that foot looks huge to me.

28
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,240
- Patrick's foot is a little bigger than mine.

29
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,120
- Then how do I fit in size 11 shoes?

30
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,680
- How do you fit in me with that big foot?

31
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,000
Put your foot up to mine.

32
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,240
I think my foot's long but my toes are tiny.

33
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:05,280
I think I might be a size 12 now that I'm thinking about it, or 11 and a half at least.

34
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,600
Can we just stay with our feet touching like this the rest of the whole show?

35
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,080
Let's see who's legs are up first.

36
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,320
Once Patrick realizes he can get us to believe he's a size 11, he's like, "You know, actually,

37
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,760
I think I might be a 12 or a 13 or a..."

38
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:17,760
I might be a size 20.

39
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,480
Now that I think about it...

40
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,560
My toes are tiny.

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,760
Look at how tiny my toes are.

42
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,160
You've got cute little piggies.

43
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,040
Everything about your foot looks big to me, man.

44
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
Look at that.

45
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,040
No lie.

46
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,040
Look at that.

47
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,040
That's fucking weird.

48
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,040
Your foot?

49
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Yeah.

50
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,400
I could make some money selling feet pics to weird guys.

51
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,400
To a weird fellow.

52
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
To a weird fellow.

53
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,160
A weird fellow on the web.

54
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,640
A weird fellow on the web made me rich.

55
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,480
I got high arches too.

56
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,480
Do you?

57
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,480
No.

58
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
You have low arches.

59
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:44,480
Oh, that's a low arch?

60
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,480
Yeah.

61
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,040
It's because you fucking wear skate shoes.

62
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,040
There's no arch support.

63
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,040
Yeah.

64
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,040
That's true.

65
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,040
You have almost flat feet.

66
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,040
Yeah.

67
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,040
That's true.

68
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,040
I do have flat feet.

69
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
Oh, flat feet is low arch?

70
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:04,240
I thought that's why I always wore some I stopped wearing skate shoes as a kid

71
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,760
because my mom said that I would lose my arches I think I'm a beautiful arches

72
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,200
yeah no no my arches yeah how is a weird fellow from the internet going to fuck

74
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,360
tighter if you didn't have the hole oh you're right it's it's better to flip the

00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,580

00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,940
Yeah, I don't I think I I think I'll never understand feet no matter how long I really try

00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:59,760

00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,520
My name is not Hitler gotcha way

92
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,800
This sucks. Can I take a shower later? No, I haven't showered in like three

93
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:48,440
Maybe I don't like this setup cuz I have to look right at the bright window to look at you

94
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,320
I have to look at the DirecTV satellite and it's sending messages to my brain.

95
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,320
What are you picking up?

96
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
It's telling me to kill someone powerful.

97
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
Do you have Comedy Central?

98
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
Do you have Comedy Central?

99
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
Start doing Chappelle's show.

100
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,320
Okay.

101
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,320
What if I was Chinese?

102
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
That's Mad TV.

103
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,320
You got it wrong.

104
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Remember he, no, in his latest special.

105
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Did he do a Chinese one?

106
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,320
In the latest Chappelle's special, there's this part where he says what if--

107
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,320
The George Floyd one?

108
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
No.

109
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Wait, never mind.

110
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Yeah, no, the George Floyd one, he went on a whole bit about what if he was Chinese.

111
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
I'm not sure if that's what he was saying.

112
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,320
I'm not sure.

113
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I'm not sure.

114
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
I'm not sure.

115
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm not sure.

116
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:19,080
yeah now the George Floyd one he went on a whole bit about what if he was Chinese

117
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:23,120
that's an interesting take

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,120
you have a clip of it?

119
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
Dave Chappelle saying what if I was Chinese?

120
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,120
were you there?

121
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,120
I recorded Dave Chappelle without his permission at one of his shows

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,120
it's really funny how mad they get about that shit

123
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,120
I know it's so stupid it's so fucking stupid

124
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Dave Chappelle said alphabet people

125
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,120
that's right

126
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,360
people. That's what his whole thing is like. Those are the people who say, "I'm LGBTQ,

127
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,560
A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V." It's like you already

128
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,480
used L, G, B, and T. You can't say them twice. You can't say it again. It makes no sense,

129
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:05,760
guy. You should do A, C, D, E, F, H, I, J, K, J, J, the jet plane. The plane. I am the

130
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:11,720
plane. I am JJ the jet plane. That's what they should be like. That's what the LGBTQ

131
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:16,680
acronym is I am JJ the Jet Plane. Pretty soon they're gonna probably start adding numbers

132
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,580
to that bullshit right? Can't stop looking at this hole in my pants. I know. Oh my god

133
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:26,180
it's hypnotizing. You're just jealous dude. It looks like the old monster trucks logo.

134
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,340
I've done stand up a lot of times where I like sat on a stool with a big hole in my

135
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:33,260
pants like this. Yeah it's pretty funny. Yeah. It's good. Yeah one time specifically at Improv

136
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,500
Boss and the stage manager told me as soon as I got off stage that I had a huge hole

137
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
my pants.

138
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
What if I was Chinese?

139
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:39,500
That's a good clip.

140
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
That's exactly what you promised.

141
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,500
What if I was Chinese?

142
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
That's the whole joke.

143
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
That's the whole special.

144
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Dave Chappelle.

145
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:56,180
He gets out on stage, he goes, "What if I was Chinese?" and then the rest of the hour

146
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,540
is just him being Chinese.

147
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,540
What if he was...

148
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,540
Perfect.

149
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,180
He's the best stand-up of all time.

150
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,180
Dave Chappelle.

151
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,180
You know?

152
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,180
Okay.

153
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,180
And he was Chinese.

154
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,180
What would be different?

155
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,180
First of all, he would be Chinese.

156
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,180
I can tell you the first difference.

157
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,180
Don't you say it, dude.

158
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,180
He would be Chinese.

159
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,180
That's what I was talking about.

160
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
Don't you dare.

161
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,180
You guys want to hold me down.

162
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,180
Dave Chinese.

163
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,180
We're trying to hold Patrick back because he's a truth teller.

164
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,180
He's not afraid of the political correctness.

165
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,180
I'm not afraid of the political correctness.

166
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,180
We'll give you one truth for this episode.

167
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,180
Here's one truth.

168
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:38,340
- If you go to a restaurant and it's got a tall toilet,

169
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,420
your meal should be free.

170
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,680
(laughing)

171
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,140
If the toilet's too tall and it's spicy food

172
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:53,300
and you go there to shit, it's a pack of opinion for Bill Hicks

173
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,800
and your toilet's too goddamn tall, comped.

174
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,940
- Do you have a problem where toilets are too tall for you?

175
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,720
- Have you ever sat on a tall toilet?

176
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,240
that's normal for me.

177
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,080
- Yeah, for you.

178
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,000
- I've sat on a tall, no.

179
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,480
I've never been like, my feet are always touching the ground.

180
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,680
- I got short legs, I got a very long torso.

181
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,800
- I've never, you don't have a long torso.

182
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
- I don't think any party is very long.

183
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,540
- Yeah, my torso's long.

184
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,280
My legs are really short, I have like a 28 inseam.

185
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,400
- That's adorable.

186
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,860
But the point is, there's no such thing as a tall toilet.

187
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,440
You talking about like a bar stool toilet?

188
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,960
- There are tall toilets.

189
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,800
- Where?

190
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
- What, yeah.

191
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,460
- I'm telling you.

192
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:37,980
have to jump to sit on? It's one at my mom's house. The one at your mom's house is too

193
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,860
large. How tall is it? Stand up and measure how tall it is. So, alright, so a toilet size,

194
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:46,780
like a toilet's usually like about that height. Okay, hold on, let me take a poop. Lift the

195
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:51,740
thing up. Okay, alright, you're pooping right now. Okay, so he's talking about a chair. So

196
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:57,580
you're saying a toilet that's like this, move down a little. Like that. If a toilet was

197
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,140
that tall, wouldn't you be uncomfortable? How tall is that, Caleb? Give a measurement.

198
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:09,260
about two and a half feet tall. You think that's crazy? There are tall toilets. I have sat on a

199
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,900
tall toilet before. There's no way there's a two and a half foot toilet in your mom's house. Yeah,

200
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:21,180
there is. Are you sitting on the tank? Are you doing an upper decker? That might be my problem.

201
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:27,740
You guys have never experienced a tall toilet is what you're telling me. I've never sat on a toilet

202
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,340
and been like, "Dan, this is a tall toilet." I've sat on toilets and been like, "This is way too

203
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:36,340
small I feel like I'm sitting on the ground that happens to me like a

204
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:41,140
locker room tall what are you in like an NBA locker room taking a shit I feel

205
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,700
like there's probably talk yeah yeah it's probably pretty big I don't know

206
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:49,340
that it's like this is I'm almost at the height of this oh you know what and

207
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,260
that's how I think this you know what you know what I'm lying it was a

208
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:59,900
handicapped toilet now it was probably a handicapped toilet wouldn't those be

209
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:05,740
sorter? No, handicapped people are huge. They are. Yeah. Oh yeah, because they can

210
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:09,420
use... they have... Well, no, a handicapped toilet is more flat. Because they can, they can, they can

211
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,180
like use their service dogs to step up to get onto the toilet. The dog shit for them. Yeah, exactly.

212
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm not talking about like a wheelchair... Yeah, they bounce off their service dog like Mario

213
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:23,180
to reach greater heights. I'm talking about a lady who paid to get her dog registered as a

214
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:30,020
service dog that's what I mean by handicapped what you say again I don't

215
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:34,340
even know it was a clean take on that okay somebody who registered their dog to

216
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:38,460
be a service dog yeah and what about them and what do you have to say I meant by

217
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,260
handicapped that's why they service dogs service dogs are funny I'm guessing that

218
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:46,260
doesn't work you can register an animal I mean I there are people there are

219
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,940
people who need them I will what the hell was that who's here doorbell I don't

220
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:57,100
I think that's actually my groceries. They'll have to wait. Yeah, that's okay. But I guess

221
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,620
service dogs probably work for some people, but I did get the cats registered as service animals.

222
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,060
Really? Yeah.

223
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,500
Did that cost a bunch of money?

224
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,700
It costs like a hundred bucks.

225
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,420
Cost a hundred dollars each?

226
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,020
Patrick's mom is here to pick him up.

227
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:11,500
Yeah, yeah.

228
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,500
That's what that doorbell is. Come on, Patrick, it's time to get on the tall toilet.

229
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,540
I wish.

230
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:20,380
We have to go home so you can use the tall toilet. Maybe that's why you feel so ill,

231
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,740
because you've been you've been shitting on my small toilet.

232
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,780
No, I...

233
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:28,460
Well, they need a tall toilet at the Patrick household to hold all the shit.

234
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:28,960
True.

235
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,000
Yeah.

236
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,900
I've been like... I honestly do... Every time I come to New York, I have this like weird feeling of like

237
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:40,060
I don't know this place and then I get like sick.

238
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,620
I think you're like a kid.

239
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,020
Yeah.

240
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,540
I think you might just be a kid.

241
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,740
I think that being at home all day, at least for me, being at home all like every day

242
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:53,900
during the pandemic and not going anywhere ever means that now if I go anywhere I get sick.

243
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:56,540
It might be a magnetic field.

244
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,700
I think it's just because I miss my mommy.

245
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,300
That's what I've been thinking.

246
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,340
I think it's that I miss my mom.

247
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,540
I miss my computer.

248
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,420
You know what?

249
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,260
I miss my computer and I miss my...

250
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:10,620
The only thing that's going to cure me is going home and Twitch streaming for all of my lovely fans.

251
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:12,700
All my lovely, beautiful fans.

252
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,180
All my beautiful, lovely fans.

253
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,580
So what are we going to do? It's the last day in New York.

254
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,580
We're going to make it the last day? Oh, we're going home today?

255
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,540
I don't know. We're going home today? Or I thought we were staying. It's either the last full day or

256
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:29,260
the last day. Yeah, that's true. What have you guys always wanted to do in New York City?

257
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:34,700
I don't know. I thought I was going to get pizza tonight. You thought? Oh yeah. That's not that

258
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,860
crazy. Yeah, I was going to get pizza with Peter. You could still probably do that. Now that's an

259
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,260
idea for a movie right there. Pizza with Peter? My pizza with Peter? My pizza with Peter. What

260
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,000
What would that do?

261
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:45,840
You eat it.

262
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,660
No, I don't do anything.

263
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:49,300
Yeah, we get pizza, me and Peter get pizza

264
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,960
with Wallace Shawn.

265
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,000
Yeah. Wallace Shawn.

266
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,840
And Wallace Shawn.

267
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,660
And we just keep making it,

268
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,680
and he's trying to talk to us about like,

269
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,840
existentialist stuff, and we're sitting there,

270
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,120
and we're like, and do Inconceivable.

271
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,400
Yeah. And do Princess Bride.

272
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,540
Do Princess Bride now.

273
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah, Wallace Shawn just being like,

274
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:10,240
I feel like I become the character is what I'm all set.

275
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,240
"This pizza is so good! Oh my god, I love a pizza more than anything!"

276
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,240
[Laughter]

277
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,240
Just farting.

278
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
[Laughter]

279
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
Guys!

280
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
"You see, the problem with everything is..."

281
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
Can you do all the shots?

282
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,240
"Oh my god, the pizza's good!"

283
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
That's the bald guy from The Prince's Bride?

284
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,240
Yeah.

285
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,240
[Fart noise]

286
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,240
[Laughter]

287
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,240
He played the, uh...

288
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
I can't really remember what he sounds like right now.

289
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,160
He played like the leader of the Ferengi in Star Trek Deep Space Nine.

290
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:42,660
Really?

291
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,160
He played the-

292
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,540
I'LL HAVE A PEPPERONI!

293
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,040
No, that's not him.

294
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,420
I will have a pepperoni!

295
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
No, that's not him.

296
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,420
I will have a-

297
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,420
*unintelligable noises*

298
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,800
No, that's like a cartoon snake.

299
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,300
Inconceivable!

300
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
He played- I'm not gonna- I'm not gonna say-

301
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,100
Inconceivable!

302
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:01,020
I'm not gonna say the name of the Ferengi leader because it sounds too similar to another word.

303
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,260
Ferengi?

304
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:06,560
The Ferengi leader is called the Grand N-A-G-U-S.

305
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,560
*snickers*

306
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,560
Nagus? Oh my god. That's his name. Oh my god. We got him.

307
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:17,400
That's not his name. You guys have been a honeypot this whole time. Yeah. Yeah, well that's, yeah,

308
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:27,080
there's a guy on that episode who says "Nagus" very weird. Yeah? And... Is it Dave Chappelle?

309
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:31,480
He says it with certain vowels changed around. He says it weird by changing the letters. He says it

310
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:40,440
the letters. He's not saying fast but he's asking can I say Nagus. He asked can I say it? I enunciated it so it

311
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,680
doesn't sound like I said it. Yeah but yeah he asked can I say. He does say.

312
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,680
So it's a kind of a coy joke. No it wasn't it wasn't meant to be a joke. They didn't have that word back then.

313
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,240
It was a very serious scene. They didn't understand that word back then they didn't have it yet.

314
00:13:53,240 --> 00:14:00,280
This is Star Wars? Fuck you dude. Fuck you. Whoa what the fuck. You don't respect anything I like.

315
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,280
I don't.

316
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
That's true.

317
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,840
I am cutting ties with Caleb Pitts because he has implied.

318
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,840
I'm sorry that I'm awesome.

319
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Caleb will be playing with Playmobiles at his house.

320
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,840
I'm sorry that I like almost stuff.

321
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,640
You want to go to the Playmobiles store?

I like stuff like Ultimate Frisbee.

323
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Caleb, I'm going to create a custom Playmobile figure of you and I'm going to flush it down

324
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,640
my toilet.

325
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,640
That first part, pretty flattering honestly.

326
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,040
It's going to cost me $150.

327
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Pretty flattering.

328
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,040

and they went there.

411

- Is it milk and metal?

423
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,860

God, dude, we gotta stop fucking...

461
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:16,300
We exhausted that bit like the first day we were here.

462
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,220
No, it kept evolving and changing.

463
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:21,340
The first day it was, "Would you cry to the most beautiful song in the world?"

464
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,940
No, first it was, "Would you cry if I hugged you?"

465
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,720
And then it was, "Would you cry to the most beautiful song in the world?"

466
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,720
And then it was...

467
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,060
"Would you dance if I asked you to dance?"

468
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,340
And then it turned into, "Would you throw it back on a sensitive thug?"

469
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,900
And then it turned into, "Could you ever be friends with a homeless guy?"

470
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,060
Could you ever fall in...

471
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,180
Would you ever lay with a homeless woman?

472
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:48,560
almost female yeah I think the sensitive thugs the best iteration yeah cuz the

473
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,500
sensitive thug and the sensitive that's got truth to it yeah I mean it's

474
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:55,060
sensitive playa he speaks truth in volumes you know and he has he has

475
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,120
different attributes could you ever fall in love with the sensitive gangster how

476
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:06,500
many thugs can cry that's some real shit huh how many gangsters how many gangsters

477
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,080
have incredible thoughts. How many gangsters really care? How many of my gangsters really

478
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:21,240
care? Can you imagine, what if a thug loved art? It's a fair question. Yeah. You know?

479
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:27,760
What if a thug could see a painting so beautiful it brought him to tears? Like I am right now.

480
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,860
Damn. Yeah. Damn. I'm imagining a mixture of the Mona Lisa and Starry Night. What if

481
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,500
If a thug had the biggest Playboy meal collection in the world.

482
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Playboy bill.

483
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Yeah.

484
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,380
But it is honestly sad to imagine.

485
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:46,380
When we say thug we mean like Caleb.

486
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
We mean like white guy.

487
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,820
You know, white hip hop fan.

488
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
No.

489
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:53,140
No, I'm thinking like a cool black guy with a gun.

490
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Oh, okay.

491
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,180
Yeah, and he's like looking at a painting and he's thinking of all his friends who have

492
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,180
died.

493
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:00,980
And he's like, I might have to shed my tears.

494
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,980
You know?

495
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,980
I might have to shed my tears.

496
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:03,980
I might have to.

497
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,020
- Excuse me, could everybody leave this art gallery?

498
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,860
- I'm gonna shed a tear.

499
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:09,420
- I might have to shed, you don't wanna see a thug cry.

500
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,500
(laughing)

501

Show me the most beautiful painting and empty the room.

503
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,740
- What if a pimp proposed to you?

504
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:22,140
- A pimp would never propose, that's against the pimp game.

505
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,500
As soon as a pimp proposes, he's no longer a pimp.

506
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,300
- Yeah, he's a wimp. - Caleb Pitts.

00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,260
- Mm-hmm.

512

- Would you marry my ass?

513
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,180

514
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,940

Yeah, I am a pimp.

518
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,060

519
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,900
- Yeah.

520
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,720

00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,720
Wisconsin pimp. He's trying to be a big-city New York pimp now. I'm just trying to be the

538
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,000

539
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,400
there was a flower in it.

540
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,440

- A pimp with a flowery thought bubble.

545
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,120
- A pimp just thought of a flower.

00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,240
(laughing)

547
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,520
Somewhere in this world, hey, somewhere in this world

602
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,400
have some experiences to talk about, you know? Because that's the only reason you become a pimp,

603
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,120
is so in 10 years, you could be a rapper. You have a story to tell.

605
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,520
The sensitive pimp is... I moved here two years ago.

606
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:55,080
I moved here two years ago. And this is my story.

607
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:59,000
And I started pimping a week ago. And I can't remember if I'm a pimp or a John.

608
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,520
I got sick from a sandwich.

609
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:13,160
Yeah, and that's my story. And that's my story to tell. So anyway, next. Happy to be here

611
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,920

612
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,760
that you were doing as a pimp was wrong, then you start rapping. Yeah. You know. If you

00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,640
this technique?

666
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,880
(laughing)

667
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,240
- Damn, it would be crazy to be a,

668
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,720
dude, being a medium is probably the easiest job ever.

669
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,060
- Probably the most fun thing ever to talk to.

670
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,900
- You have to have a gimmick.

671
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,160
- The easiest job is baby actor.

672
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:17,000
- Yeah.

673
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,820
- You don't even remember your job.

674
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,660
- That's true.

675
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,040
- Yeah, the easiest job is the one you can't remember.

676
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,880
- That's right.

677
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,080
(laughing)

678
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,560
- That's why I take Rohypnol before I go to work every day.

679
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,880
- A medium would be hard,

680
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,880
'cause you have to be an amazing storyteller.

681
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,720
And you have to wear a funny dress.

682
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
- You really just need a gimmick,

683
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,600
like the Long Island medium,

684
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,440
She's just like, she's from Long Island.

685
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,240
- Okay, I hear a ghost.

686
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,080
- Yeah.

687
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:38,920
- Ah!

688
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,760
- Ah!

689
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,280
- You can, ooh, you could be the fearful medium.

690
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,040
- I could be the medium afraid of ghosts.

691
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,520
- I'm hearing your grandfather.

692
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,460
- Oh my God, no!

693
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,380
Oh my God!

694
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,800
- Yeah, your grandpa says he loves you.

695
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,220
- Your grandpa says boo.

696
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:57,600
Your grandpa is saying boo.

697
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,480
He's just saying boo.

698
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,160
I think he really likes being a ghost.

699
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,480
- Does anybody here know a ghost?

700
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,680
anybody anybody

701
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,060

702
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:10,160
there's a ghost here looking for someone can anyone tell me if

703
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,200
there's a ghost behind me

704
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,040
is there a ghost in this room?

705
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:21,040
your grandfather says he loves you he's right behind me isn't he?

706
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:26,540
your grandfather says he's a big ugly idiot

707
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,360
and he smells bad

708
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,820
He fucking sucks dick.

709
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,820
And he's right behind you.

710
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,820
There's just a big weight levitating above his head.

711
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,820
Wait, is that a piano?

712
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:40,820
Hanging four feet in front of me.

713
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,320
Is that a ghost piano?

714
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
That's what ghosts do is they drop pianos on people.

715
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
Cartoon ghosts.

716
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
Casper's brothers.

717
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,320

Those guys were jerks.

721

They're not brothers by the way, they're uncles.

722

Oh, fuck.

723
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,320

Some of the baddest uncles in media. I forgot. They bad? They're the biggest bastards.

997
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:24,880
You know what I mean?

998
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:25,720
- Yeah.

999
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,040
- Just 'cause you wanna be darker than Hitler

1000
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:27,880
doesn't mean you will be.

1001
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,700
- Yeah, it's not, yeah.

1002
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,540
- I'm gonna be darker than Gordon Hayward.

1003
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:30,520
- Come on, you're a mediocre white man.

1004
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,440
- Yeah.

1005
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:35,600
- That's gonna take 10,000 hours of being like Hitler.

1006
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:39,000
- Lord, grant me the Hitlerness of a mediocre white man.

1007
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,640
(laughing)

1008
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,400
- That's so crazy that.

1009
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,400
- Lord, grant me the darkness of Hitler.

1010
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,240
- You're gonna get in trouble.

1011
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,720
- I didn't say that, that was something else

1012
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,720
Caleb's brother said. I didn't say, he's not here. He texted me. Oh he did? Yeah.

1013
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,880
You have a ten-year-old's phone number? Yeah, he's your brother. You're right,

1014
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,200
that's true, that's true. That's true. That's true. That's true.

1015
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,600
Pat, earlier when you said it's crazy that, were you gonna say something just

1016
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:12,920
like it's crazy that the Holocaust happened? I don't even remember. You don't

1017
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:16,800
even remember? I don't remember. Yeah, I don't remember. Yeah, I don't remember if I was

1018
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:20,960
gonna say that? God honestly. I think I was gonna say it's crazy that we're such

1019
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:26,320
great friends. Yeah it's crazy that I get to do everything with my two best

1020
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:31,440

1021
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:40,040
bike with three holes in it. So we can fuck it. Yeah. Exactly. We should get a girlfriend with three holes in her. We can all split her.

1022
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:48,380
No. No. That's some fucking freak. What the hell? I wouldn't find her attractive. I guess

1023
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:53,700
girls do have three holes. God. Yeah, the nose and the mouth and the ears, right? And

1024
00:50:53,700 --> 00:51:00,340

better if you don't actually try to eat it. It's been crazy yeah recently I've

1038
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:07,900
just been licking instead of biting it. Yeah it's odd. Yeah you don't even need a

00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,300
straw. It's worse for me. Yeah sometimes I still do it though low-key. Low-key you

1043
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:41,140
Pleasuremen, god damn it. What a weird group of guys. They're my crazy friends.

1044
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:44,980
It's so crazy that they actually exist. They're my crazy best friends. I can't imagine

1045
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:50,180
being a pleasureman. They're like the Freemasons. We dressed exactly the

1046
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,660
same as the Freemasons. It's so crazy. I think the pleasuremen

1047
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:57,500
started as an offshoot of the Freemasons. Yeah, exactly. You have to wear those

1048
00:52:57,500 --> 00:53:03,860
little hats. You gotta wear a little hat and you gotta wear a big dick. I would love to

1049
00:53:03,860 --> 00:53:08,000
eat pussy with the hat that the monkey wears in a hat. I would love to eat pussy with my

1050
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:13,380
pleasure men. Pussy with my pleasure men. Pleasure men laugh together and they eat together

1051
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:21,220
too. Whiskey for my pleasure men. Beer for my horses. Yeah, that's right. Whiskey for

1052
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:25,820
the pleasure men. Beer for the horses. I love to go to the pleasure men's balls. We raise

1053
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:32,180
all our glasses against evil forces and say whiskey for the pleasure men's balls. Beer

1054
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:39,180
for my horses. Beer for my hoses. Beer for my horses. Horses. We've gotten almost no sleep

1055
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:49,420
for days. What was that? I was talking in snake speak. That's exactly how it has been

1056
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:54,020
it's just noises. Yeah. Yeah. Just noises and you and hypothetical questions about

1057
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:59,740
sensitive thugs. Yeah. Yeah. And then we just ate chorizo and eggs. Yeah. Yeah. I

1058
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:04,100
think my cholesterol. You filled the house with smoke. You did. I did. It was like

1059
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:07,660
completely, I couldn't see. Yeah. There was no. You would be like, oh the smoke is

1060
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,980
clearing and then you would go into another room and come back and it's like

1061
00:54:09,980 --> 00:54:14,300
oh I can't. You left the gas on or something. You did leave the gas on.

1062
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:18,560
While you were driving to get us. Yeah. Maybe that's what's happened. Maybe we're

1063
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,680
just experiencing the residual effects of a gas leak. I think gas leaks make you

1064
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:27,080
happy. I've talked about this. Yeah. I feel like you fucking, I feel like a

1065
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:30,600
little bit's good for you. You know? It's good for the creative process.

1066
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,520
Anything is good in moderation, including gas. Including putting your head in the

1067
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:38,320
oven. That's what Sylvia Plath messed up. You don't put your head in the oven. It doesn't go in the oven.

1068
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,840
No, you sit in the oven with your phone and you watch movies with your phone.

1069
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:46,960
Yeah. I'm so cold. I'm so cold. I'm gonna sit in the oven with my phone and watch movies.

1070
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,960
Sylvia Platt turned the oven on?

1071
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,160
Sylvia Platt. She just starved. She just laid down, the oven was off.

1072
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,560
She laid down, put her head in the oven and she just fell asleep and died.

1073
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,560

I mean, if he says he eats a whole cake,

1134
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:18,920

He's not gonna stick to basketball.

1138
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:27,560

00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:39,960
- Jim Gaffigan, every time he goes for a free throw,

1145
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,440
he's like, "Oh, I hope I make it."

1146
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,600
- I hope he makes the free throw.

1147
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,320
- Free throw, free throw.

1148
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,200
Oh, he missed the three pointer.

1149
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,040

Send it back. Send that email back. Hit the reverse button on his email.

1215
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,020
Maybe that's not quite the right answer.
