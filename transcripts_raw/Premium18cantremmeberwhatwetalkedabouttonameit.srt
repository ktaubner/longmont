[laughter]

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
We need to get that out of your head.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
We can watch TV.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Patrick is obsessed with the idea that we can just watch TV during an episode.

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,800
Patrick's obsessed with TV. You just want to watch TV during everything.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
So?

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
What's so bad about that?

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I would say it's not conducive to a podcast, just to watch TV.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Absolutely. You guys, the men who want to do a watch along to the Grinch.

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,800
Yeah, that's different from an episode.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,800
That's watching a movie. That's not TV.

16
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
TV is where you watch a movie.

17
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Not true. No.

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
There's a hard line between TV and movie.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,800
There is not. There is.

20
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,800
My cord is stuck.

21
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
My cord is stuck.

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
My cord is stuck.

23
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Oh, I need to get this off.

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,800
I need to tell you guys this before I forget.

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,800

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:55,000
picking him up, not by the genitals, I was picking him up and this kid was

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,120
getting dropped off also at school, like this private school kid was getting

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,960
dropped off like in an escalade, like right next to where I was walking by and

37
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,240
he like opened the door and he like jumped out, he's maybe like 12 years old,

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,760
slammed the door like in a huff and started walking away and his mom rolled

39
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:16,320
down the window of the car and said "Alexander! Alexander! Alexander!" and then

40
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,200
and drove up next to him to like try to get his attention.

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,520
And this is like the coldest shit I've ever seen.

42
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,720
The kid turned around and looked his mom in the eyes

43
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,400
and said, "Drive," and then she peeled away.

44
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,240
- Oh my God.

45
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,080
- Oh my God, so fucking cool, dude.

46
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,560
I have not stopped thinking about this kid.

47
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,400
- Oh my God.

48
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,640
- He just said, "Drive," and that bitch was gone, dude.

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,040
She was, oh my God, dude.

50
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,860
- Whoa.

51
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,040
- Yeah, he was like the kid from the Twilight Zone episode

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,160
where he's God.

53
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
- Yeah.

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,820
- Yeah.

55
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,120
But yeah, I just had to get that.

56
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,400
That sounded like a guy.

57
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,400
Yeah.

58
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Yeah, there was a guy noise.

59
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,640
There's a guy in here somewhere.

60
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,760
There's a guy just going, "Ahh."

61
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,400
I can smell him.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
I smell guys.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
I smell guys.

64
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,960
Yeah, what have you guys been up to?

65
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,640
Can you tell the story again slowly so we can think of more funny things to say about

66
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
it?

67
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:09,080
She said drive and then Caleb walked up to the kid and said, "I'll drive you crazy with

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,080
my penis."

69
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,080
No.

70
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,280
I don't drive anybody crazy with my penis.

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,720
No, I mean I drive girls crazy with my penis.

72
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,500
You drive a guy, you drive a boy named Alexander crazy with your penis.

73
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,840
I've been getting so many gay direct messages on Twitter asking to see my penis.

74
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,840
It's because of your video.

75
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,620
Yeah, you know, it's really funny.

76
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,240
I never thought that uploading a video of me eating a condom and saying I'm going to

77
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,320
fuck you in the ass would warrant so many gay direct messages.

78
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,520
And then saying your fiancé with one e instead of two.

79
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:40,000
And then accidentally misspelling fiancé in a homosexual way.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Accidentally.

81
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It was an accident.

82
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
I didn't know that there was two ways to spell it.

83
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,120
I spelled it phonetically.

84
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,600
Right. I thought you didn't spell it phonetically because you would have written F-E-E-Y-O-F-A-E-E

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,640
We have different phonetics.

86
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,480
F-E-E-Beyonce.

87
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,320
Yeah, it might be Beyonce.

88
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,760
Fee Beyonce.

89
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,480
Imagine if her name was--

90
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,600
Wait, Beyonce only has one E.

91
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,080
Oh my god, she a man.

92
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,120
Beyonce is a guy.

93
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,640
Beyonce is a guy.

94
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,520
He-once.

95
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,640
He-once.

96
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,040
He-once. He-once.

97
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,600
That's like a New Orleans catchphrase, comedian.

98
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,200
He on say, he on say, and I say, he on say.

99
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,480
The bit loo to me out there, he on say.

100
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,040
The bit.

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
You're me.

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
I was looking at those New Orleans--

103
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,680
New porn pictures of babies?

104
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,880
[LAUGHTER]

105
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,680
Yes!

106
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,120
I got you back!

107
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:34,000
You can't fuck with me, OK?

108
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,200
I'm too speedy tonight.

109
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,120
You scared him.

110
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,600
Good.

111
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,480
He's a cat.

112
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,000
So--

113
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
It's not a him, he's a cat.

114
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,200
He's my friend.

115
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,400
No he's not, he's your slave dude. You have slaves.

116
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
I got little white slaves.

117
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,400
You have white slaves dude.

118
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:46,900
Yep.

119
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Damn bro.

120
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,900
That's how you know you got money.

121
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,900
That's how you know it's real, when you got the white slaves.

122
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,900
That's true.

123
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,900
That's how you know you're on top. Top of the game.

124
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Yeah you are on top.

125
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,900
Yeah cause I have a guy.

126
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,400
You're on top of a guy who's your slave.

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,400
Yeah you guys.

128
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:01,900
No.

129
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,900
Yeah.

130
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,900
We wouldn't have said it in the third person.

131
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,400
Yeah.

132
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,900
You're looking for a third person.

133
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
No you are.

134
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,400
For your gay marriage.

135
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:15,240
No, no, I don't have that. You're gay married to a man. Yeah, his name's Bobo Bubkus and he's a clown.

136
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,240
*laughter*

137
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,740
Yeah.

138
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,740
Bobo Bubkus?

139
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,740
His name's Bobo Bubkus and you're Mrs. Bubkus.

140
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:22,740
You fucking piece of shit.

141
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,240
No.

142
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:23,740
Drive.

143
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,240
No.

144
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:24,740
Yeah.

145
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,240
No.

146
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,740
I thought it would work.

147
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,740
All I did today, I set up a driveway out of the living room.

148
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,740
I set up a new board.

149
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:32,240
With a...

150
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,740
Well, a Chinese board.

151
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:34,240
Mm-hmm.

152
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,240
So you put a Chinese board up in your house?

153
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
Oh no, that's Japanese writing.

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,200
that's an old one. Those are both old boards that I got Cameron drew on one of them.

155
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:43,700
Cameron drew.

156
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,400
A cup?

157
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,520
Yeah, I got a little cup on it.

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,320
He drew the cup.

159
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,360
I drew the cup.

160
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,080
What did you draw?

161
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,200
I drew on the other side.

162
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
He drew a guy hanging. I want to see that.

163
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,880
A guy hanging from his feet because Patrick told me it was upside down right at the end

164
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,240
and I was like, "Oh, I don't know what to do now." So, I made him hanging from his feet.

165
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,160
So, the body's kind of not drawn well.

166
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,660
Yeah.

167
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,280
Oh, that's cool.

168
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Yeah.

169
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,400
He looks like a...

170
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,960
So guys if you guys are listening at home imagine a guy hanging upside down.

171
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
And then that's what he'll look like if he's hanging normal.

172
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,720
He looks like a raving rabbit.

173
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,720
Yeah.

174
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
No.

175
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,720
Yeah.

176
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
He looks like a raving guy.

177
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
What?

178
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:23,880
Yeah, I think we can't have Patrick on the podcast anymore after he said that.

179
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,880
Yeah.

180
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,880
You're kicked off.

181
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,880
What?

182
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
You're kickflipped.

183
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:28,880
That sucks.

184
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,880
I wish I was not kickflipped off.

185
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,920
Also, it's in my cruiser board.

186
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,120
It also glows in the dark.

187
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,640
so does Cameron, it's not that cool.

188
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,760
- I was telling Patrick about this.

189
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,960
I was saying, how the fuck does glow in the dark stuff work?

190
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,560
You like charge it up in the light

191
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,480
and then it like shoots out light in the dark?

192
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,960
That's crazy, it's just paint.

193
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,840
- Yeah, it holds the light, I don't know.

194
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,360
- Yeah, isn't that insane?

195
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,040
I never thought about that until today,

196
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,400
until Patrick was trying to get me

197
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,960
to look at his glow in the dark board.

198
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,240
- Yeah, and there wasn't enough,

199
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,080
there's not enough light in here

200
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,480
'cause I'm in a garden light.

201
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,480
- I know what you're talking about.

202
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,640
- Yeah, his penis is glowing.

203
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,920
- My penis is not glow in the dark.

204
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,760
- His board?

205
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,580
- Yeah.

206
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:08,720
- What is that, like his feet?

207
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,760
- I don't want to say it on the episode.

208
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,840
- He have board foot.

209
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,480
- Yeah, Patrick's feet glow in the dark

210
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
'cause of all the fungus.

211
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,080
- We should make a surfing documentary

212
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,360
like the Endless Summer or whatever.

213
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,580
- I don't know how to surf.

214
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,420
- Me neither.

215
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,600
- I actually know how to surf.

216
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,440
I could probably learn how to surf.

217
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
- Yeah, I know how to surf the web.

218
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,480
- Yeah, I know how to go on Reddit.

219
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,160
- Yeah, that's right.

220
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,720
- How many surfing, it's so crazy

221
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,920
can die while surfing I don't know that's interesting that's not I'd say no no

222
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,840
that's interesting no no cuz this means that Patrick doesn't know that you can

223
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,920
die doing anything no I know you can die whenever just imagine just imagine just

224
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,600
having just like a good time just like you're surfing like do you think it's

225
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,360
weird to die when you have your fun should protect you yes I just learned I

226
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,680
agree did you know you could die skate by all you yeah I know no I know you can

227
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,580
die do it I'm just saying it's you I just learned you can die at the movies

228
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,640
it's learned you can die when you get too old you can die at a country music

229
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:13,000
concert. Dan Bilzerian should have helped those people I thought that he was

230
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,800
if they if they gave Dan Bilzerian the AR he could have taken out Steven

231
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,440
Paddock. He would have no scoped him just for the walls. He would have spun in the

232
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,680
fucking air. He would have done a 360 off of fucking Kenny Chesney's big hat yeah

233
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:30,680
And fucking hit Stephen Paddock right between the eyes.

234
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,680
Yeah, red dot scope.

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,680
It's so strange, just like imagine you're doing something that you like doing and it's like,

236
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
"Oh shit, I'm about to die."

237
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,680
That's true.

238
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Like surfing is crazy because getting killed by water, like a wave.

239
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,680
Getting killed by water is like...

240
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
What?

241
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,680
What are you talking about?

242
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,360
Getting killed by a big wave is crazy to me.

243
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,820
You don't, well, I think, you know,

244
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,280
people do get killed by the big waves,

245
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,660
but I think they mostly get killed by coral

246
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,800
that like cuts their neck.

247
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,360
No, I thought that the wave, like the--

248
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,200
That happens to me.

249
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,020
The waves can crush them.

250
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,320
Yeah, I thought like, no, I'm saying like,

251
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,480
it's crazy to me that like a wave could break

252
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
somebody's neck or something like that.

253
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,020
Okay, so it took you so long to get to the point

254
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,680
that now you're saying you don't understand water pressure.

255
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,520
No.

256
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,640
Okay, that's, all right.

257
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,500
Yeah, I don't understand water pressure.

258
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
I think that's the problem.

259
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
I don't understand many things.

260
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,900
It's crazy that if you have water instead of air in your lungs you can die.

261
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Yeah.

262
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:33,580
It's just crazy that if you have fire in your lungs instead of air you can die from

263
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,580
that.

264
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:35,580
It's fucking bizarre, man.

265
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:36,860
What I said made sense in the head.

266
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,860
It made no sense.

267
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,860
It made sense in your head.

268
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
Yeah, it made sense.

269
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,860
I know the very end.

270
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,860
It made sense but I had to get there.

271
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:46,620
It also makes sense in your head to just keep buying skateboards and being unemployed.

272
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,620
No, I had those.

273
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,620
Oh, okay.

274
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Yeah, I got you.

275
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:54,980
that one I made when I was like 15. Oh you made a skateboard? You're a boardsmith?

276
00:09:54,980 --> 00:10:00,780
Well I just cut the shape. Okay that's not impressive to me. So it was a normal

277
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,860
skateboard and then you cut the shape? Yeah. That's not making a skateboard. Well

278
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,220
I cut the shape, I painted it, I put the glow-in-the-dark stuff on it.

279
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,700
But it was already a skateboard. What do you think the characters in

280
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:16,280
Rocket Power are doing nowadays as adults? They're probably smoking

281
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,580
weed no dude they're smoking nah dude smoke it power smoke it power yeah

282
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:27,320
what's rocket power you ever watch rock I haven't bought a skateboard since like

283
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,400
you only watch like PBS growing up yeah yeah yeah rocket power was a

284
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:36,200
sick Nickelodeon cartoon that was about people with backwards hats and kids who

285
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:40,200
were acting acting their age mm-hmm

286
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,680
it's the best description I think you're gonna get about that show yeah they

287
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,120
would kickflip and they had a big fat friend and he was good at roller skating

288
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,000
and being a goalie and he could see they played hockey for some reason yeah

289
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,720
street hockey they did like a lot of everything extreme yeah it's street

290
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,800
hockey is not that extreme um it was for them dude it's pretty cool

291
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,560
also yeah fun but it's not like not fun it's not like I think that shows why

292
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,520
like I kids thought it was cool to like just be a group of friends that just like

293
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,940
skateboarded and did nothing.

294
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,440
No.

295
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,560
Yeah it was that show.

296
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,060
No.

297
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,560
Yeah it was.

298
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,060
Well I mean skateboarding there's already like...

299
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:23,060
No but like that's why a lot of people got into skateboarding.

300
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,400
To the mainstream I guess I think that more...

301
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,260
Because it was like young...

302
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,760
More Tony Hawk if anything.

303
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,940
No but this that was for...

304
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,100
Rocket Power was for a younger audience than Tony Hawk.

305
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,400
Rocket Power was like elementary school.

306
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,440
That was like when I started like...

307
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,560
I was an inline rollerblader.

308
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,060
Ooh.

309
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,560
Yeah.

310
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,400
I think it was Most Extreme Primate.

311
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,200
Yeah that too.

312
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:41,700
What's that?

313
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:47,120
That's the movie where the monkey does... Is that the one with the skiing?

314
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,920
He does hockey.

315
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,760
The first one is hockey, the second one...

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,840
What's the first one? Vertical?

317
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,600
No, the second one is most vertical primate.

318
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,120
So the first one is extreme?

319
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,320
Yeah, MXP and then MVP.

320
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,160
But then MVP has... Bob Bernquist had a very...

321
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,320
Oh no, it's most valuable primate is the first one.

322
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,680
Yeah, and then most vertical is the second and then most extreme is the third.

323
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,800
Yeah, but most vertical is the one with Bob Bernquist.

324
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
Most valuable is the ice hockey one.

325
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,080
Who's Bob Bernquist?

326
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,960
Bob Bernquist. He's the guy, he was the guy who was always second to Tony Hawk in the Tony Hawk

327
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,280
games.

328
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,840
Oh, yeah.

329
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:26,640
So, alphabetically, there would be like Tony Hawk and then it would go alphabetical. So,

330
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:31,120
you know, like as a kid, I thought Bob Bernquist was just as famous as Tony Hawk.

331
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:31,760
As TH.

332
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,800
But he wasn't.

333
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,320
No, nobody was.

334
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,120
MVP, Most Valuable Primate, is a 2000 feature film that sparked the MVP franchise.

335
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,720
The film's title character, Jack, is a funny monkey. Citation needed.

336
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,040
Citation needed. Hey, that fucker's not that funny.

337
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,920
I'll add a citation. I'll be an expert witness.

338
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,000
Yeah, I saw the movie. It's pretty funny.

339
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,160
Yeah.

340
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:58,560
Yeah. You got like 20 citations. I watched this movie. I laughed at Jack.

341
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,360
Your name's Jack?

342
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,320
Yeah, just said that.

343
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,600
Go to most vertical.

344
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:03,920
All right.

345
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,480
Go to the Wikipedia page.

346
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,600
Why do monkeys get people names but dogs don't?

347
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Well monkeys are closer to humans than dogs. But they're not Jack close. Well

348
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:17,280
they're, I mean what about Jack the Jack Russell Terrier? That's a kind of dog.

349
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,040
Yeah but his name is Jack. He also has terrier in it. See if he was Jack Chimp.

350
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,680
Maybe. Jack Russell Chimp? Jack Russell Chimp. This one says the film's title character Jack

351
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,640
is a fictional chimpanzee. Oh no. He's a real chimp. He's fictional. Yeah. Is this the same

352
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,640
chimp from uh Duncan? Is this Duncan? No it's not Dunstan. Dunstan was an orangutan.

353
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,800
Really? Or whatever. I don't know.

354
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,200
Um, is he? I think he might be a chimp.

355
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,120
Yeah, he's a chimp. Dunstan was an orangutan.

356
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
Oh yeah, he's not a chimp.

357
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,640
Yeah, yeah, he's definitely not a chimp.

358
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,800
Um, wait, I'm trying to get to most extreme primate.

359
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,120
Wait, was Bob Burnquist not in the sequel?

360
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
Was he in most extreme? I don't know.

361
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,760
Which one has Bob Burnquist? I didn't see Bob Burnquist in any of them.

362
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,120
Uh...

363
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,840
Most extreme primate just brings you back to the other ones.

364
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,720
This is compelling.

365
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
What the F?

366
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,240
Bob Burnquist did the...

367
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm gonna freak out right now.

368
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:11,520
now. At an organic farm. Really? Yeah. It was cool. It was featured heavily in the Tony

369
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,480
Hawk's Project 8. The organic farm? Burnquist Organics was like a shoe you could wear. Tony

370
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,360
Hawk's, Tony Hawk taught me that farts were funny. Mm-hmm. Tony Hawk's Underground 2?

371
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,480
Yeah. The jackass one? It's the best one. Yeah, it is the best one. At the end you have

372
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,480
to escape Bam Margera's house. That's not his house, that's Skate-topia. No, it's his

373
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,080
house. No, he doesn't live in Skate-topia. Yeah, he does. Skate-topia's in Ohio. No, he

374
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,340
family's in Westchester. What was the why is the reason that it is exploding?

375
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:42,520
BAM put a bunch of fireworks in it. Just a classic BAM move. It was on the world

376
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:47,200
destruction tour. Oh that's what it was yeah. So the first mission you... On this tour we're

377
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,440
gonna destroy the world. Yeah you set up you you blow up Boston. Yeah yeah. You blow up

378
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,880
the Big Dig with the cannons and the Boston Common that's not it's next to the

379
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,240
Big Dig. That one pissed me off. The geography of Boston in Tony Hawk's

380
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,000
Underground 2 makes no fucking sense. They always fuck it up in video games. They did the same in

381
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,840
the new Fallout game. Yeah, like you can walk to Salem. The box of common is like as big as this

382
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:15,080
room. You can walk to Salem from fucking Concord. Yeah. That's fucked up. Yeah, come on Fallout,

383
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,800
get it together dude. Make it realistic. Yeah. And they got Skyrim, they nailed Skyrim. Also,

384
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,840
Fallout's wrong because there's a bunch of people in Boston. That's true. And the buildings all have

385
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,360
like windows and stuff. Yeah, they got the mutants right though. It was fucking horrible.

386
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,560
There is a ghoul in downtown Boston. There is. There is a literal ghoul. That guy with the

387
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:43,640
hobbling guy? There's a guy who looks like a Fallout ghoul who stole somebody I know's bike

388
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,320
and then the guy chased him down and he was like, "Can I have my bike back?" and the ghoul was like,

389
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:55,560
"Yeah." And he just gave it back. Yeah. That's pretty sick. Speaking of just the...

390
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:58,760
Just a ghoul move. He's like more of a prankster than a thief.

391
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,560
You guys ever deal with the really young homeless kid?

392
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,560
The real young homeless kid?

393
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,560
The real young?

394
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,560
The one who hangs out at South Station?

395
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
No.

396
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
No.

397
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Oh man, he's...

398
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
I don't go to South Station ever.

399
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,560
Yeah, me neither.

400
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,560
What does he do?

401
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
He, the first week I was there...

402
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Is he bugging?

403
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:21,720
When I was, yeah, the first week, I like, because I used to commute here.

404
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,360
I was waiting for like a train or the bus to go back home at South Station.

405
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,360
I was smoking a cigarette.

406
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,040
Then I gave him a cigarette and he was asking me for money for a ticket to Manchester and

407
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,720
I was like, "No, I don't have cash."

408
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,240
And then he tried to talk to like a clearly gay man.

409
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
And the gay--

410
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,240
What was so clearly gay about him?

411
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Yeah, what's up with that?

412
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
His shirt?

413
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,240
His penis.

414
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,400
His penis was out?

415
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,800
No, but he tried to talk to a gay guy and then the gay guy ignored him and then he went,

416
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
"Go paint your nails!"

417
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
Whoa.

418
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
It's like--

419
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Whoa.

420
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
Go paint your nails.

421
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:01,800
your nails. Go paint your nails F-A-G-I-T and then I went into the McDonald's.

422
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:07,800
If you just say go paint your nails that's like a five-year-old.

423
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:15,800
Go play with Barbie. Fucking doo-doo brain. Go play Mary-Kate and Ashley Switch 16 for PS1.

424
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:23,800
Yo I just found, I just found Janna's DS with all the bunch of fucking games. I'm about to play Brain Age and get fucking...

425
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,220
- My DS Classic is broken, but I still have my 3DS

426
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,060
in that pink pouch.

427
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,760
- 3DS is a good one.

428
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,320
It's pretty cool, it is pretty cool.

429
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,160
- Yeah, I have a flash cart for the 3DS,

430
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,720

431
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,160
I don't have a flash cart for the DS.

432
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,640
- It's a DS Lite, the one that I have.

433
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,960
And it's pink, but it's not like--

434
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,280
- It's pink like a polo shirt.

435
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,400
- It's pink, but I don't write about boys in it or anything.

00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,760

- Yeah, you remember Dick, dude.

485
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,340
you remember every single time it was the children's like dick that used to go

486
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:57,700
into your ass it was like a children's entertainment thing they like it was

487
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,260
the logo at the end of all the inspector gadget cartoons and it was like a star

488
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,300
it was like a star shooting star and then it goes into a circle and it's a

489
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,500
little kid's voice and he goes "Dick!"

490
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:17,700
Nice. Pull that up, pull up the dick logo. Dick logo? No, pull it up dude.

491
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:24,220
Yeah, pull it up. D-I-C logo. Why'd you go incognito?

492
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:32,780
Is your mom gonna check your browser history? I just don't like having that kind of stuff in my history, alright?

493
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:37,580
Dick logo. What were you really thinking?

494
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,580
Dick.

495
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,580
Okay, that was an edit.

496
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,580
That's Tourette's guy, yeah.

497
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,580
This.

498
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,580
Yeah, here we go.

499
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,580
Dick.

500
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,580
[Laughter]

501
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,580
Way funnier.

502
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,580
The original is way better.

503
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,580
Dick.

504
00:21:57,580 --> 00:22:01,580
That used to come on as a kid and I was just like, oh, they're just saying dick.

505
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,580
No, they say deek.

506
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,580
Deek!

507
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
It's actually a really old wizard saying it.

508
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,580
It's not a kid.

509
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,580
It's an old Brazilian woman.

510
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,580
Deek!

511
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,580

549
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060

00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,940
listen to this podcast. I don't want to have to interact with anybody.

551
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:00,540
Yeah, listen to this. Yeah. Yeah. Or at least the other way around. I don't

552
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,820
want people you interact with to also hear this weird dark side of you.

553
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:07,500
I don't want to talk. It's like talking about like Twitter in real life.

554
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:13,180
I had a bad experience with that recently. That sucks. What happened? Someone's girlfriend like...

555
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:21,700
Someone's girlfriend totally got at me. I know who you're talking about but that's such a funny way to tell the story.

556
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,620
Yeah they asked me what my tweets were and I was like I don't know.

557
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,180
They asked you what your tweets were? What's your tweets?

558
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:34,220
I had a comedian recently that like... Hey nice to meet you I'm a girlfriend and I want to know what your tweets are.

559
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:41,500
I had a comedian recently mention Twitter because to like Boston comedians it's insane that somebody would have more than 80 followers on Twitter.

560
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Oh my god, I know.

561
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,420
Stand up, people with stand up don't understand.

562
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,180
Boston comedy scene, everybody is just terrible at Twitter.

563
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:49,500
Well, because yeah, they're just like, they just don't think about it much.

564
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,780
They just, what am I handing you?

565
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:55,100
Yeah, they don't realize how you can like use social media to promote shows other than

566
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
Facebook.

567
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Yeah, they just post like.

568
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,300
They're all, every Boston comedian is 28 and mentally ill.

569
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,220
And they all, their most recent tweet is like, teeth hurt today.

570
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,220
Yeah.

571
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Like that's it.

572
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,260
Teeth hurt today are like, I need to like, here's like 60 reasons why I'm better than

00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
This is the thing I'm loud about.

615
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I was like, "Bang a gong?"

616
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
How you like that? No?

617
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
She was Asian.

618
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
Really?

619
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
[laughter]

620
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Okay, yeah. Maybe not a...

621
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
That might have made things worse.

622
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
That would have made things way worse.

623
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
She rings a bell, I bang a gong.

624
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
She's like, "Why'd you bring a gong?"

625
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
[laughter]

626
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:11,120
happened bitch I guessed okay a big bell I would have brought a bigger bell yeah

627
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:18,280
not a gong not anything yeah you're looking at the poster for Bonzo goes to

628
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,840
college a cool poster all new monkey shines he's a star of Bonzo - yeah it

629
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,600
doesn't have Ronald Reagan in it it doesn't even have this movie doesn't

630
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,680
even have Ronald Reagan. I thought Ronald Reagan and Bonzo were like a pair in the 50s. I was

631
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,880
watching the other night I watched like this video that was like all like the

632
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,200
greatest most memorable debate moments ever. Have you guys seen that one where

633
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:47,260
it's... Gore Vidal? No, no it's a Michael Dukakis one where they they open up the

634
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,840
debate and the anchor looks at... I mean Michael Dukakis he was anti death

635
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,520
penalty. Yeah. And the anchor looks at the camera he's like tonight the the

636
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,180
candidates have no idea what question we're gonna ask them tonight. They

637
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,600
haven't been prepared and they like have not been tipped off at all. And this

638
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,400
first question goes to Governor Dukakis. Governor Dukakis, if your wife Kitty

639
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,240
Dukakis was raped and murdered, would you be in favor of the death penalty? Really?

640
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,120
Yeah, it's the first question and he's just like, "Uh, no, I mean no, like I don't

641
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,200
know, no." It's so funny. It's the most gotcha shit. Oh it's crazy, yeah.

642
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:31,160
it's like so clearly they were in the can for Bush yeah but it's so it's just such

643
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:37,000
a great it's just I think about like if they asked like Elizabeth Warren that

644
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,840
tomorrow you know what I mean? Well she doesn't have a wife so it wouldn't work.

645
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:49,280
That's what I thought was funny about it yeah but Dukakis is uh they names like

646
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,240
part of South Station after him right? I don't know. Well you're obsessed with South Station.

647
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,240
yeah you love South Station dude, it's cause you love going South Station on a guy

648
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,240

00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,240

680
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,200
- I got the worst food poisoning of my life

681
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,280
at a Pizza Hut buffet.

682
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,120
- Really?

683
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,960
- In Hudson, New Hampshire.

684
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,140
- You wanna get worse?

685
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,320
(laughing)

686
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,160
I'll give it to you, baby.

687
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,480
- Worst food poisoning of my life was a cracker barrel.

688
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,520
- Worse for me was a poop salad that I ate.

689
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,440
- Worst food poisoning, so I got,

690
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,360
the second worst food poisoning was Pizza Hut.

691
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,400
First worst food poisoning, I found a thing

692
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,400
of frozen bacon wrapped scallops in my sister's fridge.

693
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,800
and I don't, they were, the package did say

694
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,520
they were still good.

695
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:51,280
It said Best Buy and it was like three weeks.

696
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,680
- No, they were from Best Buy.

697
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,120
- They were from Best Buy, they were electronic scallops.

698
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:55,960
I shouldn't have eaten them.

699
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:58,080
- No, they weren't from Best Buy.

700
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,800
- I shit and threw up.

701
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,240
I shitted and threw up.

702
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,760
- Oh man, same time?

703
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,600
Both holes?

704
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,420
- Yeah.

705
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,260
- I shit my ass yesterday.

706
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,200
- So we just moved into my house in Ware

707
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,760
and the bathroom was still very,

708
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,560
like it still had all the old,

709
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
the old toilet and like the old sink and stuff.

710
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,040
- Oh yeah, the old toilet.

711
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,360
- A hole, just a hole around it.

712
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,360
- It's like a old house, it's like very old.

713
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,800
- A wooden toilet.

714
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,400
- I was sitting on a wooden toilet.

715
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,240
- A wooden toilet paper.

716
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,400
- A steam powered toilet.

717
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,240
- A steam powered sink.

718
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,560
- A steam powered brass toilet.

719
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,240
- When you flush it, it's so hot

720
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,840
that you can't touch your ass to it.

721
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,960
- I said that because I forgot that you guys

722
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,600
have never been to my house in Wayne.

723
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,440
- Never.

724
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,280
- That's what I was making fun of at first.

725
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,120
- Fuck you.

726
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:40,940
- Gotcha.

727
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,860
- Yeah, it's like the bathroom is like really small,

728
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,740
so it was just me just shooting diarrhea

729
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,940
and then shooting just liquid out of my mouth.

730
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,780
- Oh, nice.

731
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:53,220
- There was a Chumlee poster in the bathroom,

732
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,860
'cause it used to be my younger brother's room

733
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,100
and that was his bathroom.

734
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,940
- Yeah.

735
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,760
- So I would just--

736
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,600
- And he loved Chumlee.

737
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,180
- I got him a Chumlee poster for Christmas.

738
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,860
- And he put it in his bathroom to jack off to?

739
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:02,700
- Yeah.

740
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,520
- That's cool.

741
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,060
- No, but I threw up and shit and I was looking up

742
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,220
and it was just Chumlee's fat face.

743
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,140
(laughing)

744
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:09,980
- Damn.

745
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,660
a friend when we were like 11 his mom got him, it's a weird family, his mom got him

746
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:20,540
a Sports Illustrated swimsuit like poster. Why would you get your kid--

747
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:27,380
He was 11 years old and he put it just on the back of his bathroom door.

748
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:32,740
What if he's gay? And so she just was like aiding and abetting her son, masturbating.

749
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:37,260
Yeah it's just a weird family. It's like when parents are like, you

750
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:43,900
can drink but you know you have to let me know how much you have.

751
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,060
That was for me when I was that started when I was like 16 and then it stopped

752
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:54,940
because I got to I was a naughty boy yeah and then my mom was like you can't do that anymore.

753
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,700
You can drink and drive as long as you drive home. I was really good at

754
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,460
hiding it. Yeah I was bad at it I would vomit all the time and I just wake up

755
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:08,180
and I'd be like hungover as shit and walk into the kitchen and my mom would just

756
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:14,340
like she's been a wild night huh no I would get I would go to talk to houses

757
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,500
and then my mom would call me cuz I'd free like she's like oh you can go there

758
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:23,060
but you have to check in with me and then like I get mom's love checking in

759
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:26,700

00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:48,020

765
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:01,600
brother helped me out. He was 20 and he was helping me smoke. I was 14.

766
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:09,760
That's responsible. It was very responsible. Stay thirsty, my friends. I was like bugging

767
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:15,080

769
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,520
answered and while she was like on the phone, like she could hear me, I asked

770
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,440
Josh, what do I do?

771
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,620
(laughing)

772
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:29,360
And then she was like, Caleb, are you there?

773
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,120
And I was just like, I'll be home soon.

774
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,640
But it was like the scariest.

775
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,400
My heart was beating out of my ass.

776
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,560
- Oh, the first time I ever smoked weed,

777
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,260
I went to, I smoked with these four kids

778
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,340
outside of the middle school gym.

779
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,180
- Nice dude.

780
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,000
- And they're all like in jail.

781
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,840
- Oh yeah.

782
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,660
- Yeah.

783
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,500
- Oh yeah.

784
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,320
- Now one of them's like a dad.

785
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,160
I don't know what's going on with them.

786
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I haven't talked to them in years.

787
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:55,160
but I forgot my cousins, my two six foot seven cousins

788
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,400
were on the basketball team.

789
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,240
- Nice, the Morris team.

790
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,760
- I always forget that that happens.

791
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,600
- I forget that.

792
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,280
- I forget what my huge cousins are on the basketball team.

793
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,840
- I forget about my humongous basketball cousins.

794
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
- And then I remembered and I freaked out.

795
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,680
- No, so I went to the game.

796
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,400
- My Harvill Globetrotter cousins.

797
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,520
I always just forget about them.

798
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,600
- I went to the game not expecting their mom to be there.

799
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,440
So I'm high as shit.

800
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,560
- Yeah, their seven foot mom?

801
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:17,480
- Their seven foot, no, their four foot,

802
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,640
five foot four mom shows up.

803
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,640
little bitch. 4 foot 5 foot 4. How tall is her dad?

804
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:28,280
He's like 6 foot 7. How tall is their dad? Their dad is 6 foot 7. My dad is 6 feet tall.

805
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,120
Your dad's 6 feet tall? Yeah. That sucks. Yeah. I didn't get any of that. No. No. I got my

806
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:39,080
mom's height. My dad is like 5'10" in sandals. Whoa.

807
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:39,920
- Whoa!

808
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,760
- Those are some big sandals,

809
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,420
'cause your dad is 5'3".

810
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,260
- No.

811
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:45,640
- Your dad's wearing platform sandals, man.

812
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,480
- Yeah, he looks cool, man.

813
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,600
- Seven inch sandals.

814
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,800
(laughing)

815
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,280
- Your dad's walking around dressed up like Bootsy Collins.

816
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,560
(laughing)

817
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,320
It's like Bootsy Collins at the beach.

818
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,160
- Yeah.

819
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,760
And his license says 5'10".

820
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,000
(laughing)

821
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,840
- 5'10".

822
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,440
- I think my license says 5'11",

823
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
which is just a blatant lie.

824
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,560
I was truthful in my license.

825
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
What does it say?

826
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
Mine is 69 inches.

827
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
What's that?

828
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
5'9".

829
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
Yeah.

830
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,560
Okay.

831
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,560
I don't know what my license says or how tall I am.

832
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,560
You suck.

833
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,560
Mm-hmm.

834
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,560
Yeah.

835
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,560
Gotcha.

836
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,560
Yeah.

837
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:24,560
I can't even check because it's over there.

838
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:25,560
So, it's a mystery.

839
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,560
I need to get a new license.

840
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,560
Mine is getting bad.

841
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
Mine's exp...

842
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:32,120
What do you mean like it's going to get expired?

843
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,120
It smells really bad.

844
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,120
It's turning...

845
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120

Knights of the Old Republic. My avatar becomes more and more like his red.

850
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,520

855
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:09,580
your sister you get is smoking hot in that you see yeah I'm serious

864
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580

like all Joey's thing was doing a Popeye impression. What? He was like, Joey's

981
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,300
like a stand-up comedian but then like you see him perform and it's just like...

982
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,180
I didn't even know he's just supposed to be a stand-up comedian. Yeah, his big thing

983
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:20,820
before he got a puppet named Woodchuck... Oh, I do remember the puppet. Yeah, before

984
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:25,180
he got the puppet all it was was like, "Oh, Uncle Joey's gonna do his stand-up

985
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:28,980
routine." And then he just does Popeye. You know, that's fine.

986
00:44:28,980 --> 00:44:33,060
Yeah, that's like, you know, that's pretty fun. That's better than what I do probably. Just a

987
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:36,460
guy in a blazer with a mullet just going "Eck, eck, eck, eck!"

988
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,460

00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,460
You should start wearing-

990
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:41,960
I hope I'm hosting and I show up and do Popeye.

991
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,760
You should start wearing blazers with like skinny ties on set.

992
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,960
Yes, dude. I love when a comedian dresses up.

993
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,460
Oh yeah.

994
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:49,960

00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:50,460
You know?

996
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,960
It's so funny.

997
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,960
I just always look like total dog shit when I do stand-up.

998
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,960
Yeah, me too.

999
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,460
I feel like a comedian dressing up is like similar to just like a suit guy in high school.

1000
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,460
Oh yeah, absolutely.

1001
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:00,960

They come with like six notebooks.

1003
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,860
I won't say his last name, but his first name was Alex, and he would come to Mooyah.

1004
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:08,860
Oh, I know him.

1005
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,580
Yeah, and he would, uh, he would, he would...

1006
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:12,740
He would come out of work, and he'd be in his work uniform.

1007
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:13,740
No, no, he was a student.

1008
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:14,740
He went to Harvard.

1009
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,740
Oh, shit.

1010
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:16,740

00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:17,740
Yeah, and he would come...

1012
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,740
Oh, shit.

1013
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:23,220
He would come and he'd be wearing like a, like a beautiful, like, blue, like Armani

1014
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
suit.

1015
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,220

1016
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:26,220
And he would just eat shit.

1017
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:29,380
And it was 'cause, I mean, just the goofiest thing in the world.

1018
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:33,620
I've seen him do stand-up a lot he always dressed like that really yeah.

1019
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:35,220
So great. Just awesome dude.

1020
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:37,220
Is it the same guy I think?

1021
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:39,720
Probably not. I think it was before you started coming maybe.

1022
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:40,220
Okay.

1023
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,020
It was a long time ago. I don't even know if he's I think maybe he's in Boston.

1024
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,620
He's probably some lampoon kid.

1025
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:47,420
The lampoon has such a cool building.

1026
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:47,920
Yeah.

1027
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,420
That's the only cool thing about them.

1028
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,220
Is that sometimes I drive by that building I'm like I want to fuck somebody in there.

1029
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,220
It looks like a castle.

1030
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,220
It looks like it yeah it looks like an evil base.

1031
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:56,720
Yeah.

1032
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:57,220
Yeah.

1033
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:01,140
It looks like there's a lot of things that went on in there that they didn't tell anyone.

1034
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,140
Yeah.

1035
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,260
It looks like that building could keep a secret.

1036
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:05,260
Yeah.

1037
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:09,460
They have a deformed lampoon member locked up in the attic who looks out of the window

1038
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:10,860
at night and wails.

1039
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:12,900

Yeah, hold on.

1041
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,260
It's the guy from Castle Freak.

Just doing goblin jokes. Sir, this is a Wendy's. Yeah, this is a Wendy's

1052
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:07,540
All goblins are from the bottom. That's just a thing that happens now.

1053
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:15,320
Yeah, so there I'm having a normal one. Yeah, I'd love that's every every Colin Jost joke is just that.

1054
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:21,220
Yeah, I wish Colin Jost was an orc. Me too. I wish Colin Jost wasn't alive. I wish he was nothing.

1055
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:25,220
I wish he wasn't alive but his brother Casey was still there.

1056
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,220
I wish his brother Casey was still there.

1057
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,220
I wish he was dust in the wind that had never reconstituted itself.

1058
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,220
I wish he was stardust in a distant galaxy.

1059
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,220
I wish he was dinosaur stuff.

1060
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,220
I wish he was Gallagher.

1061
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:37,220
Me too. He just does his shitty jokes and then smashes a pineapple.

1062
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,220
So yeah, that happened.

1063
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,220
Yeah.

1064
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:43,220
We should get Gallagher. What happened to you right there?

1065
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,220
What happened?

1066
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:47,220
You just cracked.

1067
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,220
Somebody reset Patrick.

1068
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:56,780
tinder just added 300 new genders. This is why, this is what's wrong with the

1069
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,700
dungeons in this country. He's conservative too, all goblins are

1070
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:03,440
conservative. You remember when people got really mad at Colin Jost for doing

1071
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,060
that tinder, that joke about tinder adding genders and then being like

1072
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:10,780
that's why the Democrats lost. Yeah. Oh. That was, I think that's way bigger in my

1073
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:14,340
mind because I just don't watch SNL. Yeah. But it was way bigger in my mind than it

1074
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:17,740
actually was but I remember people were angry at him for that. Yeah people were very angry.

1075
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,080
yeah people were in the streets people were right people there was a guy with a

1076
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:33,300
pitchfork like Shrek and he was asking for Joe's head yeah because he looked

1077
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:39,140
into the camera went I'm gonna basically the plot right true yeah bright bright

1078
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:43,940
but if bright yeah I've got a goblin on TV this is bright but if bright was also

1079
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:48,580
studio 60 on the Sunset Strip do you think bright do you think they're all

1080
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:52,260
the comedians and bright or goblins or orcs or whatever there's there's

1081
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:56,100
comedians and bright I'm saying if they're bored so you're saying in the

1082
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:03,300
Max Landis in the world world of bright Max Landis yeah the famous rapist yeah

1083
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:10,740
he so in the bright world I feel like all the comedians are probably like it's

1084
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:14,080
probably just there's probably like work shows yeah that's what I'm saying work

1085
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:19,780
comedy yeah yeah you have like Garflax da comedian

1086
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:33,860

00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:34,900
they have their own circuit.

1088
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:42,700
Because I mean allegory. Yeah, the whole allegory of his racism is racism. Then

1089
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,620

Shervy.

1097
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:15,140
My favorite one, the one, the poster that was getting me was there was one poster where

1098
00:50:15,140 --> 00:50:19,100
it was like there were three people stacked on top of each other and the first one was

1099
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:21,220
Shervy and then Mother Mabel.

1100
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:22,940
Mother Mabel which is like a guy in drag.

1101
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,940
Oh yeah, just a guy doing Madea.

1102
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:27,940
And then the last one was Kroby.

1103
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:35,900
be. It was just two people. And they're crowbeed when they're together. Oh my god. It was so

1104
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:43,660
funny. And then the host was Mr. Bring the Funny. Like it looked like a parody poster.

1105
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:50,260
Mother Mabel is so good too. And then that sketch I sent you guys that's just him pointing

1106
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:54,060
a gun at that lady. Did you guys watch that? Oh no I didn't watch that sketch. Oh my god

The Nonsense Sketch. Nonsense Entertainment presents Hood Pizza. It's so good, dude.

1108
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:09,340
It's like filmed on like an iPhone 3G and it's like a woman opens the door and she's like,

1109
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:14,380
"Yeah, is that my pizza?" and Nonsense is like, "Yeah, this is your pizza."

1110
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,060
Is that how he talks?

1111
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:22,060
That's how he talks. And she's like, "Yeah, let me just go get the money real quick." He's in

1112
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:26,140
in the other room and he's like "Oh hell no we don't do that no more" and he pulls

1113
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,420
out a gun, a real gun and points it at her and she's like "whoa whoa whoa" and then the

1114
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:34,900
rest of the time it's like two minutes of him just being, her just being like

1115
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,660
"man why are you putting a gun on my face" and he's like "bitch you better give me

1116
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:45,460
that, you better give me the pizza money" it's so good I'll put a link on Patreon, go watch it

1130
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:56,500

00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,820
- You can't leave an orc around a cat, dude.

1139
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,220
If I was an orc man, I'd be going orc mode on your cats

1140
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,060
every time I'm in here.

1141
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,380
I'd be chasing them around.

1142
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,220
(laughing)

1143
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:42,060
- Is that what you do already?

1144
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,260
(gurgling)

1145
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,220
- That's what you already do.

1146
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,180
- I don't do that.

1147
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,700
I don't like them, but I don't hate them

1148
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:47,940
or don't try to eat them.

1149
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:48,780
- You try to eat them.

1150
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:49,620
- I've never done that.

1151
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:50,780
- You literally tried to eat one today,

1152
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,380
starting with the penis first.

1153
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,220
- Yeah.

1154
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,420
- That's just 'cause you have to start with the smallest.

1155
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,540
- You saw he got a little bit of poop on his penis

1156
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,780
and you were like, "Ooh!"

1157
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:01,780
I'd seen the poop I've never even tried.

1158
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,780
No.

1159
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:05,780
That's how Caleb reacts when he sees a penis with poop in it.

1160
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,780
I don't make a Yoda sound.

1161
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:08,780
That wasn't Yoda, that was the Chamberlain.

1162
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:09,780
Kobold pits.

1163
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,780
The Chamberlain.

1164
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:11,780
Kobold pits?

1165
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,780
Kobold pits.

1166
00:54:12,780 --> 00:54:13,780
Oh, I need to leave.

1167
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:14,780
Who's kobold pits?

1168
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:16,780
It's like a kobold, it's like a type of goblin from the Legends of the Dragons.

1169
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:17,780
Oh, okay.

1170
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,780
I need to leave, I'm saying.

1171
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:19,780
Oh, what time is it?

1172
00:54:19,780 --> 00:54:20,780
I have to go.

1173
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,780
It's 724.

1174
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,780
I gotta bounce.

1175
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:24,780
Alright, we can finish the episode without you, I guess.

1176
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:25,780
Okay.

1177
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:27,780
Why don't you just, we can just stop it here.

1178
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:30,100
Well this is a premium, they're paying for this one.

1179
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,100
Right.

1180
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:32,100
Okay, well I'll just leave.

1181
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,580
But I also have to pee before I leave.

1182
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,580
Okay then go pee.

1183
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,580
You want to hear me pee?

1184
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:36,580
Yeah.

1185
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:37,580
I'm just going to keep talking.

1186
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:40,020
I think that cord is honestly long enough for you to go to the bathroom.

1187
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,020
It's definitely not.

1188
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,300
I'm not going to go pee in... no.

1189
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,500
Alright, let's talk about kobold pits.

1190
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:45,500
Okay.

1191
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,500
I'm going to go pee.

1192
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,500
I'm going to go pee.

1193
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:53,220
I'm using your bathroom as a sweat hut.

1194
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:54,460
Patrick Orkman.

1195
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:55,460
No.

1196
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:56,460
Yeah.

1197
00:54:56,460 --> 00:55:02,780
totally an orc dude. I'm not an orc. What happened today? There was a guy talking to

1198
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:07,700
himself on that. No, that doesn't even work well. Cameron Bosmer. No, it doesn't

1199
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:15,020
work well. Patrick Bosmer. I'm fine with that. Bosmer, Bosmer. Bosmers are very

1200
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:22,420
good at stealth. Khajiit Doran. You would totally be a Khajiit. No, I would not. Yeah,

1201
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:27,580
would you're you like to thief I'm not a steal a Bosmer is probably a better

1202
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:31,180
thief than a Khajiit really I don't even know what Bosmer's look like Bosmer's or

1203
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:34,660
the wood elf okay that I knew there's some kind of elf yeah I can't envision

1204
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:38,220
one in my mind a Khajiit I can imagine actually that was the only race I played

1205
00:55:38,220 --> 00:55:42,660
as in Skyrim was Bosmer's yeah yeah that's why you're Patrick Bosmer they

1206
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:46,540
have skills in archery and stealth of course I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do

1207
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:50,780
the Dark Brotherhood wait we're Bosmer's in Skyrim yeah were they called Bosmer's

1208
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:51,780
No, it was called Wood Elf.

1209
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:52,780
Okay, that's why.

1210
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:55,740
It's technically, like, if you look up, they used to be called Boswell.

1211
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:56,740
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1212
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
That's what I thought.

1213
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:58,740
I knew Boswell from the older games.

1214
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:03,900
They don't call them like Altmer or like Dunmer, like from the Dark Elf and the High Elf.

1215
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:04,900
Dunkirk.

1216
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:05,900
Dunston.

1217
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,900
You should be able to play as Dunston in Skyrim.

1218
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:07,900
You can play as a monkey.

1219
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:08,900
You just have no skill.

1220
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:09,900
Oh, that's a good mod.

1221
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:10,900
That's a good mod idea.

1222
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:11,900
You can't use any weapons.

1223
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,900
You're just a chimp.

1224
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Yeah.

1225
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:14,900
And you can't use any weapons.

1226
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:15,900
You're just a chimp.

1227
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:16,900
Yeah.

1228
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:17,900
And you can't use any weapons.

1229
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:23,900
use any weapons. You're just a chimp? Yeah. And you're just a- you try to talk to anybody

1230
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:30,620
and it's like, what is this? People just immediately attack you and then like at the beginning

1231
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:34,620
of the game where they're trying to behead you, it's just a chimp on the execution table.

1232
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:39,500
Yeah, they're just like, what? I guess we have to kill this chimp, I don't know. Cause

1233
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,940
I don't think like a chimp could realistically exist in Skyrim. Nobody will talk to you,

1234
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,260
We can't get any quests because we're having way more fun.

1235
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,260
Yeah, keep going.

1236
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:52,100
I'm parking my car in front of your house till tomorrow morning.

1237
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,100
Okay.

1238
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:58,260
They'll ticket you at like, I think it's like 6 to 6.

1239
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,260
6?

1240
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,260
Or 8 I think.

1241
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,260
Okay.

1242
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:02,260
6 to 8.

1243
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:05,260
Okay, could you just ask Dom to text me?

1244
00:57:05,260 --> 00:57:06,260
Okay.

1245
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,260
Thank you.

1246
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,260
Bye y'all.

1247
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,260
Bye.

1248
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,260
So finally.

1249
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,180
in time. Now we're getting into real Utilt Bosmer pits.

1250
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:18,420
Yeah, but yeah, you try to talk to people to get like quests and stuff as a chimp and they

1251
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:22,580
just go like, "You silly little chimp! You know you can't talk!"

1252
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:28,740
They just immediately put up a fire spell. They just start, "Ah! What is this?"

1253
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:33,340
Hit you with a rock. Yeah, no, you can have like a few things

1254
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:38,940
in your inventory, but it's like bananas. It's bananas and then like stones.

1255
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:45,820
Yeah, a funny hat because Dunstan loves hats. You can get all the hats. All of like the

1256
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:53,140
hats and all of the armor. You can wear, you get Daedric armor from the start. You can't

1257
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:59,620
have any body armor. What? It's Caleb. Is it Caleb? Yeah, it's Caleb. Are you sure? What

1258
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:07,100
if it's a mysterious man? I forgot my backpack. Oh, Caleb forgot his damn backpack. Alright,

1259
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:11,420
now he's leaving for right now finally can get back to some crazy fan is gonna

1260
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,820
triangulate the sound of outside

1261
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,580
this is a good

1262
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,700
you know we can tell exactly by the sound of the air

1263
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:22,220
i know you've located that you guys are in boston

1264
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,820
yes i was gonna find out we were in boston subway

1265
00:58:25,820 --> 00:58:27,940
yet the restaurant

1266
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,840
yeah there is a subway around here and i ate there

1267
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,500
it's the worst one yeah i was talking about the air

1268
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,140
it wasn't that bad when i went there

1269
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,620
Subway in general is just always a mistake for me to go to.

1270
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:38,620
I never enjoy it.

1271
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:39,620
I forget how to order there.

1272
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,860
I just forget that I always forget.

1273
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,700
I'm always like, "Oh, I guess I'll have Subway.

1274
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,700
It'll fill me up."

1275
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:46,300
And I just feel like garbage shit after I eat it.

1276
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,700
Jimmy John's is better.

1277
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:48,940
I've never been to Jimmy John's.

1278
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,420
Jimmy John's is better, however, their owner does kill elephants for sport.

1279
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:54,420
I don't care about that.

1280
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,420
Yeah, I don't care either.

1281
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:56,420
I do that too.

1282
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:57,620
But we don't even get any elephant meat.

1283
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:59,100
Yeah, that's true.

1284
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:00,100
Fucked up.

1285
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,100
What about Bosmer John's?

1286
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:03,100
Jimmy Bosmer?

1287
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,100
Jimmy Bosmer.

1288
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:08,540
me bosmer Jimmy bosmer's no there would be it would be an all vegetarian

1289
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:14,580
restaurant I feel like bosmer's don't eat meat do they I don't know hey hey I feel

1290
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:20,580
like a bosmer would not eat me I'm googling bosmer diet yeah shit I'm on

1291
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:27,420
the bosmer diet so what do the bosmer eat that's a reddit post let's see here

1292
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:33,620
okay they oh they're entirely carnivorous they're cannibals whoa they

1293
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:40,740
don't eat any vegetables so I was just way like furthest off you yeah okay what

1294
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:44,420
kind of what they don't eat plants it says there's a ton of vegetation

1295
00:59:44,420 --> 00:59:48,300
forestry and Valenwood they just can't harm it they are entirely carnivorous

1296
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:52,180
society cannibalism is acceptable and particularly commonplace for warriors

1297
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:55,940
okay that makes that guess that makes sense cuz like the Bosmer's whole thing

1298
00:59:55,940 --> 01:00:03,060
is that they were like born from trees or whatever yeah I took Prilosec and now

1299
01:00:03,060 --> 01:00:10,060
I've been burping a lot more, but my heartburn hasn't been as bad. Well. It's a solid trade-off isn't it monkeys paw?

1300
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:11,940
Yeah, exactly

1301
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:16,020
Dunstan's paw Dunstan's paw I would have been a monster special ability

1302
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,740
You can

1303
01:00:19,740 --> 01:00:24,540
Pa if you know how to make Skyrim mods. Yeah, we need we need like a team

1304
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:29,640
Yeah, we need to get the discord going to the Elder Scrolls 6 Dunstan. Yeah

1305
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:35,580
Dunstan checks into Skyrim. Or I feel like it'd be funnier to put Dunstan in Oblivion.

1306
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,580
Yeah, Dunblivion. Dunstanblivion.

1307
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:41,180
Yeah, Orangoblivion. Yeah.

1310
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:57,700

1311
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:58,540
Bye.
