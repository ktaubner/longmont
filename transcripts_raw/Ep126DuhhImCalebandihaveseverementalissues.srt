00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Podcasts for the mindless.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
We just start.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, yo.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What? Yo.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The Brussels sprout sandwich is back.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
At Clover?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
At McDonald's.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I just got a notification from them.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Have you guys ever had a McRib?

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
McRib, yeah.

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,640
I'm thinking of taking the plunge this year. I've never had it before.

14
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,360
Oh, it's good.

15
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,000
Is it?

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,560
It's so good.

17
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,520
I'm sure it's good.

18
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:34,840
Yeah.

19
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,440
Fucking rib sandwich? No shit.

20
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,880
Barbecue?

21
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:39,160
It's rib-shaped patty.

22
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,120
I like everything at McDonald's. I like the filet of fish.

23
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:42,920
I do too.

24
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,840
I get a double filet of fish when I go.

25
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:45,400
Yeah.

26
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,440
You get two filet of fish?

27
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,120
Yeah, dude. It's fucking nine dollars.

28
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,400
When I used to get real fucked up and go to McDonald's and get filet of fish,

29
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:57,640
it's the perfect food to sober you up because it's so gross.

30
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,360
You're wrong.

31
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,400
I don't know. People make fun of it for being gross. There's nothing gross about that to me.

32
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:06,440
It's no grosser than any meat in McDonald's. No, I know. All the meat there is gross,

33
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,120
but I think it's the grossest item on the menu. I disagree. I mean, it's really good,

34
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:14,520
but it's still gross. I think it's the grossest item on the menu. No. The salads are the grossest.

35
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,680
Have you had the poop? The poop? The McPoop? No, it's just poop. I didn't even try to name

36
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,160
it anything else. The McJuggerNuggets. Yeah, that's bad. Yeah, because his dad's going psycho.

37
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,760
What's the oldest chicken nugget you've ever eaten?

38
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,440
Ooh.

39
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,520
I ate a nugget off of the seat of my mom's car that I left there the day before.

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,800
Yeah, my cousins used to leave whole boxes of fries in the back seat of their car.

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,280
Yeah, that's not meat. Meat does not age well.

42
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,680
But I mean, the thing is, the McDonald's, it's not like the McDonald's meat is going to go bad.

43
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,120
No, McDonald's doesn't go bad. You can leave nuggets, you can leave chicken nuggets.

44
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,320
Most food doesn't go bad.

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,560
Basically nothing goes bad. Yeah, you can eat anything old. If it's cheese, especially cheese gets mold on it

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,160
Just cut the mold off. You're still good. Cheese is mold

47
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah

48
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,000
Horse, there's always in the middle of cheese. It's always fine. Yeah

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,480
Exactly. Yeah, you just cut around the more if it's if there's if there's flies and maggots in the meat you shake them out

50
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,800
It's green. Let it lean if it's yellow

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,480
That's a perfect cheese for a grilled cheese. And if there's maggots

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,480
it's

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
that's fucking right yeah

54
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,280
what do you guys think the best cheese in the world is?

55
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,280
oh god

56
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
shut the episode off now

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,280
we gotta figure this out before we go any further

58
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
i didn't pause anything

59
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,560
honestly i think just a smoked gouda on a grilled cheese

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,000
that's one of the nothing beats it

61
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
I'd say like a small piece.

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,740
You know what the best cheese is?

63
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,840
The best cheese is the Lando Lake slices.

64
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,720
That you get from the deli, the really buttery ones.

65
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,400
I'm a good old boy, I like a fucking Kraft single.

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
You like a confederate flag shaped cheese.

67
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
No!

68
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I'll eat a Kraft single, I'll fucking...

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Kraft single's fine.

70
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,400
It's good.

71
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,400
I'll fold it up.

72
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,960
I used to not like it when I was a kid.

73
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
You know it'd be great.

74
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
But I grew up.

75
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,480
This is like a really expensive bread with a Kraft single grilled cheese.

76
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
You know what would be really good?

77
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,480
Awesome.

78
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Like the greatest sandwich in the world.

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Yeah.

80
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
Wouldn't that be so good?

81
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Yeah, you know what would be great is like...

82
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,480
Like the best ingredients, everything is the best.

83
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,800
Five star, five course meal.

84
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,880
Did you see that Burger King tried to get a Michelin star?

85
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
They did?

86
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
Yeah.

87
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:41,520
And I don't think the new, the quarterly like Michelin guide has come out yet, so they may

88
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,520
have gotten one.

89
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,520
Wow.

90
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,520
Damn.

91
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
Yeah.

92
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,560
were like please go review these locations they're fire yeah Michelin man

93
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:57,680
there if you live near a Burger King yeah yeah that's that's how you people that

94
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760

95
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:10,520
yeah he's wearing sunglasses and yeah yeah my name's David yeah I'm here

97
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,560
bunch of tires. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And can you serve it to me on these tires? He can

98
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:28,440
only eat off a tire. Can I get a possible whopper? Yeah, oil. Yeah, they only give

99
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,720
you go to a four star Michelin restaurant. Everything's car themed.

100
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:36,040
What the fuck is this man? Best filet mignon in the world. Yeah, they put like

101
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,440
the pickles on the side of the burger like a tire.

102
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,240
You're like, "Oh, okay, now I get it.

103
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,840
Yeah, that makes sense."

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,340
The, uh, when you, if you live near a Burger King,

105
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,940
your apartment just, like, you can smell Burger King

106
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,540
from a mile away.

107
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,840
Yeah, man, you can smell the paint that they put on the burgers.

108
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,940
Dude, whatever that fucking, like, car exhaust they use

109
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,340
for their chargrill.

110
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,340
Dude, Subway has the number one fucking,

we're pumping it out.

112
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,440
They're polluting the earth with smells.

113
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,140
Yeah.

114
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,140

00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,100
there's so many subways in the thing is that where they do a lot of like

118
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,100
fat poor people they do secret missions yeah the headquarters

119
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:28,020

00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,060
into the bread without people finding out

121
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,980

124
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,100
they just hand up a sandwich to him and he chews it up and breathes out of the vents.

125
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:54,500
That's how they do it. He's never brushed his teeth. He only eats the bread, he's never brushed

126
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:00,100
his teeth. Yeah. Hold on. Hold on. Hold up. How many Subways are there? Because there's that one

127
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,860
that's in like the corner, the one like in government center by the uh the subway near the wax museum.

128
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:10,420
The one I used to I used to work at that wax museum. Did you know that? Oh you worked there?

129
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,780
Yeah. You worked there for like one day. I worked there for one day. Wasn't it owned by like some

130
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:20,020
Brazilian like mob guy? Yeah. It's like a complete tourist trap. It cost $30. I worked there for one

131
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,740
day and they made they said that you can't take a bathroom break and you have to stand outside for

132
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,740
eight hours and just sit next to a wax Peter Dinklage while like Chinese

133
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:32,400
tourists come up to it and they're like this is Matt Damon and you're like no

134
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:38,740
this is Peter Dinklage. Yeah he shrank. It was a little bit hot outside. The way I quit, we ran out of

135
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:44,060
wax so we had to make them small. The way I quit was I just an hour before my shift

136
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:48,540
ended I just took off the shirt and left it on the counter and I just

137
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,020
left. I never paid before it. I just I was like this is the worst job ever I'm

138
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,900
not fucking doing this. Yeah. Yeah, I've heard nothing. I was really, really poor in Boston.

139
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:03,140
Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty awesome. How much were you getting paid there? At the wax museum?

140
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,300
Yeah. Zero because I didn't. Well, how much would have you, would you? I think it was

141
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,460
minimum wage, just like 15 an hour. It would have changed my life. I didn't, I mean, I

142
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,540
never had any money in Boston, but especially not like then because it was before I started

143
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:18,980
working at the gym. Oh yeah. And that's when I... I remember going into that interview

144
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:24,660
at the gym. Oh yeah, I recommended you. And he was like, "I'm not fucking hiring that guy."

145
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,860
I went in and he was like, "Oh, so you know Caleb from Improv?" And I went, "Yep,

146
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,460
exactly. That's exactly where I know him from."

147
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:38,500
That dude rocks. I loved him so much. He would just fucking...

148
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Yeah, you said he had so much CTE.

149
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,700
He got hit in the head so many times doing Jiu Jitsu that he would talk to you and he'd be like,

150
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,460
Yeah, so you need to fold the...

151
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,620
the towels.

152
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,340
I should have just used that.

153
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,980
And then he would drool. He would drool while he was talking to you.

154
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,060
I should have just used that to my advantage in the interview.

155
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,020
Yeah. I mean, it was like stopping time. You can use him like a click remote.

156
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,380
You can just snap right at his face and he just freezes for a whole minute.

157
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:08,100
You can use him like a remote and click, and when he's frozen you could punch him in the

158
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,500
face a bunch of times and fart on him. Yeah, and then just come back.

159
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,420
Yeah, confuse him because he doesn't know where the sound's coming from.

160
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
him.

161
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,420
Yeah.

162
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,180
Just if you just point behind him, he'll turn and look for 10 minutes.

163
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,180
He was one of those guys.

164
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,500
Wait, the oscillating fan.

165
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,380

traditional sleeve and then the other was just like stuff where he's like yeah my

182
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,900

183
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,540
always cool when you can like tell somebody got the tat their tattoo from

184
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:28,620
their cousin I miss having just like a stupid boss yeah you know it's fucking

185
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:33,660
awesome all my every boss that I had was like very cool when I worked I've never

186
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,460
had a terrible work experience. When I worked at the museum at MIT I had a great

187
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:43,820
boss but all my co-workers were like crazy old women and one of them was I

188
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,340
mean they're all just like hippies who are like artists that can't make a living doing art

189
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:51,540
so they work at a museum and one of them she never she always was connected to a

190
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:56,580
wire that was connected to the ground and she was like I was like one day I was

191
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:00,660
like are you like plugged in like what the fuck is that she was like oh so

192
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,120
basically what happens is your ions when you're not touching the ground because

193
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,940
you have rubber soles on your shoes they disconnect you from the earth and so

194
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,320
what I have done is I have a wire that goes into the ground and I attach

195
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:22,460
myself to it. How have you never talked about this person? I don't know. But yeah she was always connected to a wire. What the fuck?

196
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,860
Yeah and she offered to buy me one of the wires she was like they sell them

197
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:30,180
online they're $180 but I can get them really cheap because I know the guy who

198
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:35,220
makes them and that's so sick. I mean she claimed it like changed her life.

199
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,980
She claimed she broke her back and then being plugged into the wire healed it.

200
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:45,460
That's so sick. That's like that's I would find websites for like you could

201
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:50,100
buy order like a chakra detector for $800 and it's just like it's like a it's a

202
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:54,180
thermometer yeah instead of saying a number it said it just says like it says

203
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,620
like sacrum clogged. It's like the time travel machine in Napoleon

204
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,300
dynamite. Oh yeah with the crystals. Like that shit like I mean that shit gets sold

205
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,020
on eBay all the time. People just sell toaster. Maybe we should just

206
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,740
start doing getting into that. We could sell to people like my grandpa. Yeah we

207
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,820

That you're going over and over.

233
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:18,820

- Yeah, that you keep going over and over.

236
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,700
We'll put a diagram up.

237
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,700
Yeah, with the episode.

238
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,700
You know what, we'll just do it to Pat, so some people have an example.

239
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,200
One time we duct taped my friend to a couch in high school.

240
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,700
We used to duct tape my little brother to the wall.

241
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,200
Yeah, dude, that's the best.

242
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
He would like fall asleep.

243
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,700
Levi was like the fucking heaviest sleeper.

244
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,700
And so when he would sleep, he could do anything.

245
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,700
Like you'd like pick him up and use him like a puppet.

246
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,700
"Honey, come on."

247
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:49,700
And we duct taped him to the wall and he just woke up just like screaming one night.

248
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,700
He was there for like an hour.

249
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,880
there's we did we duct tape my friend kevin like we wrapped it around a bunch

250
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,420
of inducted into the couch

251
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,540
and there's a video of him dislike thrashing around going

252
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,140
s

253
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,540
and my brother friend was sitting on the reporting on one time i was a ran

254
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,420

but i couldn't move i just got out of the worst when you get like you it

256
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,740
not being able to remove yeah

257
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:18,420
in a prank horrible i got my cousins uh...

258
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,080
my cousin's dad had like a boat

259
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:23,080
And I got stuck in like the-

260
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,400
- You went all paralyzed from a prank.

261
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,200
- Yeah, I got stuck inside,

262
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,760
there was like a small room with like bunk beds in it.

263
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,160
Like I don't remember what the fuck it was,

264
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,440
but there was like a hole in the floor.

265
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,600
It was like a perfect square.

266
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,120
And I tried to like, you know when you're a little kid

267
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,200
and you try to like fit into a spot?

268
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,240
- You can fit in anything.

269
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,160
- You can fit, yeah, but you try to like fit like,

270
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,800
oh, like I'm gonna like see if I can like

271
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,960
perfectly fit into the glove seat.

272
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,440
- Yeah, in my brain I can't.

273
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:56,560
Yeah, yeah, so I tried to do that but ended up getting stuck and like freaked the fuck out cuz I didn't know how to get

274
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,880
Up. Mm-hmm cuz it's like the boats moving

275
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:06,580
So I that's scary shit. Yeah, especially cuz the like if fucking boats rocking and I can't move

276
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:12,240
Yeah, yeah when I was 11, we put my cousin into an iron maiden and killed him. I

277
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:19,360
Know a kid who got stuck in his family's like elevator in his house got chopped in half. Yeah. Yeah

278
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,360
Yeah, yeah, I didn't know him, but my parents.

279
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
And his top half and his bottom half both grew back separately.

280
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Yeah, and then they were sexy twins and they did porn.

281
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
Yeah, and they're called the elevator twins.

282
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,360
Now that was a real kid then, I shouldn't say that.

283
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,360
My cousin had elevator buttons on his closet.

284
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,360
I actually don't know if he got chopped in half, that's what I assumed as a kid.

285
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:46,360
I just knew that a kid died because he got trapped in like Final Destination style as the elevator was going down.

286
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,360
He had a dumbwaiter?

287
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Why did he have an elevator in his house?

288
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,360
That was my question. I was like, "How rich is this fucking kid?"

289
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Yeah.

290
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Maybe he just lived in a hotel like Suite Life of Zack and Cody.

291
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
He could have been Zack or Cody.

292
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,360
That's the origin of Zack and Cody!

293
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
That's the twins! Oh my god!

294
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,360
Here I am in your life, here you are in mine.

295
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Yes, I got chopped in half by an elevator.

296
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,360
That one time.

297
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,360
But that was fine.

298
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,360
That one time.

299
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,360
But it ended up fine.

300
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,360
It's not a crime to die.

301
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,000
It's a crime to kill yourself, isn't that weird?

302
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
No.

303
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
No, it's not weird.

304
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They should be punished.

305
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Yeah.

306
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Yeah, they haven't been through enough.

307
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
That's true.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yeah.

309
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Well, now that your son's dead, he's going to jail.

310
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,920
Yeah, if your son ever comes back to life, let us know.

311
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:34,600
Yeah, they should bring the dead bodies to jail and let them use them for arts and crafts.

312
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Or as like a fuck puppet.

313
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,600
No.

314
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,600
That's disgusting!

315
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,600
Come on!

316
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,600
Oh my god.

317
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,360
It would cut down on sexual assault and genital--

318
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
They should kiss--

319
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,360
No.

320
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,760
and go on dates with them. They should be buried, but they should bring the ashes to jail. They

321
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,440
should have to be in love first. Yeah. They should have to fall in love with the dead

322
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,960
body. Yeah. No, they should cremate them if they request it, or bury them. How would they

323
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,200
request anything? They're dead. If you're cremated, look, if I'm cremated, do whatever

324
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:05,320
you want with my ashes. I don't care. You want to be fe- fe-melted. What? You want to

325
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:12,320
be turned into a girl. You want to be creme-ulated. Okay. You want to be creme-pied. We did that.

326
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,760
(laughing)

327
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,000
- We did that like yesterday.

328
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,840
- All right, we gotta switch gears.

329
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,440
We're just gonna do that episode again.

330
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
Fuck.

331
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,680
- Yeah, let's restart that episode.

332
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,520
- Okay.

333
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,280
- You don't have any floss sticks here,

334
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,120
I just remembered that.

335
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,600
I gotta get this thing out of my dad's tooth.

336
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,840
- Dude, I told you, use a piece of paper.

337
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,160
- Do you have that, is that fork still up there?

338
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,840
- You're not gonna use a fork in your tooth.

339
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,680
- Why, a plastic fork?

340
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,920
- He has like a hole in his tooth.

341
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,760
- Yeah.

342
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,760
- I don't know if the fork's still up there.

343
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,760
- Yeah, dude, my tooth has just been like,

344
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,320
I was supposed to go to the dentist on Monday,

345
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
the Monday that I came down here.

346
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,400
- Sorry, I'm moving to New York City to follow my dreams,

347
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,320
so I can't really come to the dentist.

348
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,120
- I'm gonna follow my dreams for three days.

349
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,880
- For my life-saving operation.

350
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,040
- Sorry, I can't get my fillings and shit.

351
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,880
- I hope it's one of those things

352
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,520
where it gets an abscess in your tooth

353
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,360
that infects your brain and you die.

354
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,040
- Yeah? - You hope that?

355
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,680
- I guess I don't hope that, now that I think about it.

356
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,520
That'd suck.

357
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,720
- There's probably an abscess in my tooth.

358
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,560
- Yeah.

359
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,280
- There's an absence in your heart.

360
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,280
- There's an absence in my Maryland ancestry.

361
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:17,720
in your tooth. What the hell? Turn this light on. I can't even see you guys. Turn that off.

362
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,740
Absinthe is the one that people think. It's the one that like Anthony Bourdain made an

363
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,900
episode of his fucking show where he was like, "Absinthe gets you high." Yeah, like people

364
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:30,400
say that absinthe is like hallucinating. You just get fucking, I mean it's just alcohol.

365
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,800
There's nothing else. You don't actually get. It's just like hot, it's like moonshine. Yeah.

366
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:41,400
Some people got like, some people hallucinated but that was because of something in the barrels

367
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,800
or something that the absinthe was being kept in.

368
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,800
Really?

369
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:45,800
Yeah.

370
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I didn't know that.

371
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,800
Do you guys drink Everclear?

372
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Would you drink Everclear?

373
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
I think I have before.

374
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,800
I would drink anything.

375
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,800
Do you have some?

376
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I think I have.

377
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,800
How was it?

378
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
No, I did drink Moonshine though.

379
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,560
It tasted amazing.

380
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,560
Moonshine is not that crazy.

381
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,140
I drank Apple Pie Moonshine.

382
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,400
It never tastes like what they advertise it as.

383
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,400
No.

384
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,640
Yeah, it's like how all fucking vape flavors taste like electricity.

385
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:10,640
You tasted like apple pie at first and then you do the rest of the shot and then

386
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
The rest of the shot? You sipped a shot?

387
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,640
It was a shot glass of apple pie moonshine.

388
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,640
Yeah, so you shoot it.

389
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
Yeah, I took it like a half a sip. I'm not gonna do a whole shot of moonshine.

390
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
And then you did the other half.

391
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,640
No, I gave the other half to a friend.

392
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,640
You shared a shot with a man.

393
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,640
No, it was a girl.

394
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,640
*Burp*

395
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,640
*Laughter*

396
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,640
You drank with a girl?

397
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Oh my god.

398
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,640
Oh my god.

399
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,200
That's like you're kissing her.

400
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,200
I think.

401
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
I don't even remember.

402
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I don't feel so good.

403
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm gonna blow chunks.

404
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
You know what?

405
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,320
I drank moonshine so I don't fucking remember what happened.

406
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:47,960
You drank one sip of moonshine and just blacked out completely.

407
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,680
It was like hangover too.

408
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,680
Yeah?

409
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
Yeah.

410
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
Zacky G was there?

411
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Yep.

412
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,960
Zach Galifianakis was kind of just like you mixed with Zach Galifianakis.

413
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,960
What the hell?

414
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
Mmhmm.

415
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,160
I'm bringing that song back you guys.

416
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,280
We're gonna do a cover of Hot Shell Ray, that's the next sensitive gangster track.

417
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:08,800
You know the la la la whatever.

418
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Oh I know that song.

419
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,200
Going at it tonight!

420
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,280
Oh wait I forgot that song makes me so angry.

421
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Why?

422
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,560
I don't know.

423
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:21,080
That song is like one of the worst songs of all time.

424
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,520
I feel like- It's probably tied with every song you'll ever make.

425
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,760
Oh my god.

426
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,520
We made a song today.

427
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,360
True, that was some- That joint was fire.

428
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,880
That'll be like three weeks ago for you guys.

429
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Yeah.

430
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,360
was actually so fire though. Yeah. We don't miss. You don't miss. Musically. Please cap

431
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:45,080
straight up. We're like the. Please, please pot of Ls boys. Just cap one time. Oh my god.

432
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:51,640
Just cap even one time. Sorry bitch. Yeah. We're true to the game. We don't do crap. We don't do

433
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,800
crap. We're not putting out this mainstream bullshit. Yeah. We're underground. We're

434
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,360
underground. We're underground. We're weird. We're weird. So what? We're the weird podcast. So what

435
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,640
But if we're weird, we're weird, we're guys, we have three microphones and we're here to

436
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,440
tell you some weird crap and you're gonna...

437
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,560
We're gonna fucking convince you abortion's murder.

438
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,560
Uh-huh.

439
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Yeah.

440
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,560
And that's a weird take.

441
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Yeah.

442
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,560
Uh-huh.

443
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,560
That's a weird thing to say.

444
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,560
But it's ours, especially Patrick.

445
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:18,560
It's not mine.

446
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
Patrick got all this into that.

447
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,560
I have no opinion on abortion.

448
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,560
None?

449
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,560
No.

450
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,560
Then you're complacent.

451
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
I'm complaining about them.

452
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,080
Then you should at least give the fetus a chance to run away first.

453
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,080
Yeah.

454
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:33,080
I'm going to give you a 10 second head start here.

455
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,080
It's not a bad idea.

456
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,080
You'll be playing tag with this giant drill and you're it.

457
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Have you seen those videos that get shared around Christian Facebook groups where it's

458
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:50,080
like, "The doctors pulled the baby out limb by limb."

459
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,080
Yeah, it's like a behind the scenes footage of the thing where the animatronics are malfunctioning.

460
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,800
Like this is a fetus at 5,000 weeks and they aborted him.

461
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,600
And now he's a nudely, now he's a fucking spider.

462
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,600
That's kind of cool man.

463
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,360
Maybe we should keep doing that.

464
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,680
If E.T. had a baby.

465
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,260
E.T. got aborted?

466
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:17,400
Very different movie.

467
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,400
You could already do the movie.

468
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
It wouldn't even happen.

469
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,400
It would be called Elliot.

470
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,400
Yeah, exactly.

471
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
It would just be about the lamest kid ever.

472
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,400
It's kind of weird how ET is the first and last letter of Eliot.

473
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Wow.

474
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Think about that.

475
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,400
That's my favorite argument that people have against abortion, where they're like, "That

476
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
ET?"

477
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,400
No.

478
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:41,400
But people will be like, "Well, what if Martin Luther King Jr. had been aborted?"

479
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Yeah.

480
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,400
It's like, "He was."

481
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,400
I mean, "Sure."

482
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,400
Yeah.

483
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,400
"What if Jesus Christ had been aborted?

484
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,900
Would you be pro-abortion then?"

485
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
Yeah.

486
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
Yeah, dude, because I wouldn't be a Christian.

487
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,340
Look at how many problems he caused.

488
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:58,220
He caused a lot of problems for a lot of people. Yeah, you know when people say

489
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:02,380
something bad, when something bad happens people say, "Oh Jesus Christ."

490
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:06,140
So say Jesus H. Christ. What's that H stand for?

491
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:11,580
Hitler. That's kind of weird to say. I don't think so.

492
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:15,260
That's your name. Why did you catch it? That was my, the side of my

493
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,500
body that I lost all control of. Oh okay. Yeah. It does anything,

494
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,780
anything I don't want it to do.

495
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,980
Oh, he just got a toothache.

496
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,700
You're like that lion from that movie.

497
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:27,020
Yeah.

498
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:27,180
Yeah.

499
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,900
You need a mouse in your mouth for real.

500
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,140
Yeah.

501
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:33,340
Damn, I need a mouse in my mouth tonight.

502
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:33,820
Damn.

503
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,460
Ooh.

504
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,420
If I get a little mouse in my mouth.

505
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,380
Damn, I'm lonely at home.

506
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,580
Would you eat a mouse?

507
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,060
Yeah.

508
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:38,620
Yeah.

509
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,180
A mouse?

510
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,340
I mean, I thought when we had a mouse problem,

511
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:48,940
I was like 50/50 either wife that thing up as my pet or just fucking eat it.

512
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,340
But you can't, you can't wife up a city mouse.

513
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,040
A field mouse, maybe.

514
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,740
A field mouse you could probably take and make a pet.

515
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,940
What are you talking about?

516
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,440
A city mouse? Are you kidding me?

517
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,240
A city mouse is used to being in the city.

518
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,840
Yeah, a city mouse is used to being in the city.

519
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,840
You're saying a field mouse, one that, one that's used to

520
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,040
roaming wild, I could put it in a cage?

521
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,140
Fucking no way.

522
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,540
No way.

523
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
You could put it on a leash.

524
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:11,340
What?

525
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:11,940
No.

526
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,540
I'm done talking to you for the day.

527
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,640
You're in timeout.

528
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,240
No, I'm not.

529
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,440
Let's play the silent game, Pat.

530
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:16,940
Okay.

531
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,440
Yeah.

532
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:23,440
I hate this so much. Please talk. Please talk.

533
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:38,440
One time I was walking around Harvard Square with Aaron and we saw a mouse, we were just walking down the sidewalk and we saw a mouse run really fast across the sidewalk in front of us and it ran right into a sewer crate.

534
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:44,440
It just ran, just went into the hole and just fell in. Just like literally like half a second.

535
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
Just wily coyote-ed?

536
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,040
crazy I think it's like burned into my brain forever one of the funniest

537
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,240
physical things I've ever seen missing a mouse disappear yeah cuz it just like it

538
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,280
appeared and then it just like went into a hole and it was gone it didn't even

539
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,800
make a noise when it hit the bottom of it like it's still falling yeah it's

540
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:08,200
vanished it's an endless sewer I'm gonna tickle Patrick do you think you think of

541
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:16,340
mouse had hollow bones like a bird it could fly? Yeah. Do you think if a bird didn't have

542
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:24,620
wings it couldn't fly? Yes. Okay. I think the trick to flying is hollow bones. And wings.

543
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:28,660
Let's hollow those things out dude, come here. I'm taking that, I'm sucking that marrow out

544
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:35,920
of you. Yeah. That does reduce my risk of bone cancer. Bone cancer? Oh yeah, that's when your

545
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:38,640
bones get spiky. That is the scariest cancer.

546
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,160
That's the scariest kind of cancer.

547
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,600
Because your bones, they just...

548
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,600
fucking, you get spiky bones.

549
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,280
What the hell?

550
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,320
The scariest cancer is ghost cancer.

551
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,120
True.

552
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,080
Vampire cancer.

553
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,520
It's where you grow a ghost in your body.

554
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,880
Freddy Krueger cancer.

555
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,000
Yeah.

556
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,720
Ah!

557
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,200
Yeah, the scariest cancer is when your fingers grow blades.

558
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,360
It's when you find out you have cancer on Halloween.

559
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,480
That's the scariest cancer.

560
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,480
That is... I mean, what's scarier than that?

561
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,440
Yeah.

562
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,160
Would you rather find out you have cancer on Christmas or Halloween?

563
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:08,660
Christmas.

564
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,040
Halloween I'd be like, "Yeah, what else is new?"

565
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,680
But Christmas I'd be like, "Am I even going to open my presents?"

566
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,880
Well, Christmas you would have the presents first.

567
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,920
What?

568
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Oh true, I guess you'd find out on Christmas Day and you already opened the presents.

569
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,960
No, you'd find out on Christmas Eve.

570
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,680
Well, you didn't say that.

571
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:32,720
The next day you have presents to look forward to, but hopefully it's nothing like vacation in five years.

572
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,120
Yeah.

573
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,520
True.

574
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,480
You get a bunch of presents.

575
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
You win a lifetime supply of candy.

576
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
Yeah, yeah.

577
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Of hair dye.

578
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Yeah.

579
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,480
Dude, awesome.

580
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Yeah.

581
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,480
This is gonna fucking rule.

582
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
Yeah.

583
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Oh.

584
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Christmas should be about winning.

585
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
It is.

586
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,480
No, it should be like you should have to--

587
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
In America-ca-ca.

588
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,480
You should have to win something to get a present.

589
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,480
You think Christmas should be a game show with you and Santa Claus?

590
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,480
Mm-hmm.

591
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Wait.

592
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,480
Yes.

593
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Sorry, did I just accidentally spit the most amazing idea of all time?

594
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,480
Yes, you did.

595
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,480
Okay.

596
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,080
Okay. It could be called...

597
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,640
Christmas with the Thanks.

598
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:10,680
Uh...

599
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:14,240
Christmas with the Thanks? Because you're thanking them for giving you the prize.

600
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,020
Uh...

601
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,540
Well that is technically just regular Christmas.

602
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,620
Shut up.

603
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,400
You shut up. What about Chris...

604
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,020
Uh... What about Chris Rock with

605
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,620
Tom Hanks?

606
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,680
Chris San...

607
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,960
Chris Sanx. Chris Rock with Tom Hanks instead of Christmas with the Cranks.

608
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,560
Chris Rock with Tom Hanks? Uh-huh.

609
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,760
That could be a good movie.

610
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,260
Yeah.

611
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:34,760
Yeah.

612
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,060
We just have to figure out a different title.

613
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,860
Yeah.

614
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
They were in a movie together, right?

615
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,160
Chris Rock and Tom Hanks.

616
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,060
They were in Madagascar.

617
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:45,260
Was Tom Hanks in Madagascar?

618
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,160
He's on the island, and then they find him on the island.

619
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,660
Dave Chappelle is in You've Got Mail, but he plays like a--

620
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,960
he's like-- that was in the '90s when he was like 19,

621
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,660
doing all these movie roles.

622
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,560
And he's supposed to be like 35 in that movie.

623
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,660
Yeah, dude, he was like 25 when he made Half-Baked.

624
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,900
he was he was nineteen and he did uh... at the role in uh...

625
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,000
men in tights

626
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,580
really yeah

627
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
he was nineteen on letter to you

628
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,460
for twenty

629
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,120
we got a list of really got a driver's license

630
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
well yeah can you believe that

631
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:20,220
that's what you say can we have a list of their for our own idea

632
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,720
so halfway through it uh... top ten

633
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,020
things parents need to stop doing

634
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,900
pay parents

635
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,660
or soon to be parents reading this

636
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,980
I'm a 13 year old so you probably won't listen to me, but you should.

637
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:36,380
I'm trying to help you be better and don't do these to your children.

638
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,020
Number one, abusing their children.

639
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
Big facts.

640
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Yeah.

641
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,020
I'm going to go on record.

642
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:44,020
We spot the lie here.

643
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,340
I'm going to go on record and say I never hit a kid unless they deserve it.

644
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,140
Please miss when you try to hit your kids.

645
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,140
Yeah.

646
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,140
Yeah.

647
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:57,460
I think this is wrong.

648
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:00,840
I think you shouldn't hit kids, but I think you should beat the shit out of your dogs

649
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:05,640
Why cuz I

650
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:12,740
Don't know cuz I'm bored. It's like yeah, I'm just bored. I

00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:56,600
Yeah, he said something rude to me, and I was spanking him to show him not to say that again. I spanked him with a gun

659
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,940
I

- Your mom was trying to eat poop out of your butt.

666
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,700
- There's a famous video about it.

667
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,140
- Yeah, two guys hit you with a hammer.

668
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:21,460
- Two guys were hitting me with a hammer in this video.

669
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,740
Yeah, it's pretty fucked up,

670
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:25,380
but it happened to me and it's the truth.

671
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:29,460
I was just hit with a spoon, a wooden spoon,

672
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,900
and then one day my mom cracked it in half on my butthole.

674
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,560

- She was trying to eat poop out of your butt, dude.

677
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,500
- Yeah.

678
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,340
- True, she was missing.

679
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,160

687
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:24,420

when my dad became Batman my dad would hit me with all of my dad

690
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,540
- I had to join the army, that bandolier.

691
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,420
One time the shotgun shell from his bandolier went off.

692
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Chipped my shoulder.

693
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:47,980
- I saw my mommy hitting my daddy with a belt.

694
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,820
- Yeah?

695
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,660
- Yeah.

696
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,380
- Yeah, daddy was wearing a ball gag.

697
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,940
- Yeah.

698
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:57,020
My mommy was wearing the belt and hitting him real hard.

699
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,540
- Yeah, just hitting him real hard in the butt.

700
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,380
- And she was wearing a belt.

701
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,220
- And she had a funny belt buckle on.

702
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,700
- And the belt had a wiener on it?

703
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,980
They'll have a very hilarious book along.

704
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,980
Yeah.

705
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,500
Number two, trying to control their children's life.

706
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Hehehehehe.

707
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,380
What is that?

708
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,940
That's like a super villain parent.

709
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,940
Yeah.

710
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:14,940
He's trying to do mind control.

711
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:15,940
Oh, okay.

712
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:16,940
That's kind of what I was going for there.

713
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Let me try it again.

714
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,940
Hehehehehe.

715
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,340
Now that I have the context, the laugh makes sense.

716
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,900
I found this video about how to control your child's life.

717
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:30,100
I found a video where this woman, she's like, "Yeah, I'm a hypnotist and I've been hypnotizing

718
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,380
my children to do their homework and they did like a news story on it and then

719
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:36,580
that the like she just talks about and the children like yeah we love it it

720
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,020
helps us be better and more productive and that the end she's like and I also

721
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:46,420
hypnotized my husband and it's like a 30-second like I have no idea what she's

722
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:55,420
doing to her husband. I hypnotized my husband to chase down a senator. Yeah I think I mean

723
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,660
That shit's funny when people are like,

724
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,740
have like very strict, serious kids.

725
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,580
- Yeah.

726
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,060
- You know, like they read like that Tiger Mom book.

727
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:04,900
- Oh yeah.

728
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,540
- Like I knew some kids whose lives were just fucked

729
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,100
because their mom read the Tiger Mom book.

730
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,900
- Oh yeah, the fucking Tiger Mom book is just like a--

731
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,340
- Did you guys read the Tiger Mom book?

732
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,180
I read the Tiger Mom book.

733
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,000
- No, I'm waiting to tell my mom.

734
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,540
- It's just a guide to abuse your kids.

735
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:17,380
- Yeah, yeah.

736
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,200
- It's crazy.

737
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,460
- At the end of it, like, the daughter,

738
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,100
the like rebellious daughter,

739
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,220
they're at like a restaurant

740
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,140
and the mom is being crazy to her daughter

741
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:26,720
and the daughter just like smashes a bunch of glasses

742
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,220
and plates from the restaurant and is just like,

743
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:30,780
fuck you, I'm not gonna ever do what you tell me again.

744
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,060
And then leaves and then it's like,

745
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:36,300
and that was the crazy story of how I raised my daughter.

746
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,980
It's like it clearly didn't work.

747
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,340
- What are those girls are doing now?

748
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,340
- Yeah, it's like, oh, that's just an anomaly.

749
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,180
- Yeah.

750
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,000
- One's probably--

751
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,840
- Usually it works, but sometimes.

752
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,680
- Yeah, sometimes--

753
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,140
- One's probably a cop and one's probably like

754
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,880
in a very expensive escort.

755
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,500
(laughing)

756
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,800
Like that's what you get with the tiger mom lifestyle.

757
00:32:53,800 --> 00:33:00,800
Yeah, it's very expensive because, you know, tigers don't come cheap.

758
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,020
You want to fuck a tiger?

759
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,520
That's going to cost you. Keep going.

760
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:11,440
Look, I've seen Tiger King, I've seen Joe Exotic.

761
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,680
I know, I know.

762
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:16,500
We got the bastard Carol Best.

763
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:20,880
Yeah, she's a tiger mom.

764
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,640
I just want to see the tweets, "Carol Baskin dies."

765
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,520
I want to see half of the people going, "We fucking got her!"

766
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,240
And then half of the people going, "She was actually a real person with a real life."

767
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
Right.

768
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,840
Yeah, I'd probably put something like, "I guess her husband, her dead husband, what

769
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,480
did he feed her to the tiger?"

770
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,440
What, she accidentally used sardine oil?

771
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,800
"Oh, I guess she fed herself to some tigers."

772
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Yeah.

773
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
It's like, "No, she overdosed."

774
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,800
She opened those.

775
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,800
I was imagining the tigers.

776
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,800
She was chasing the tiger.

777
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
Chasing the white tiger.

778
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Yeah.

779
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,800
That's how she died.

780
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,800
Carol Baskin.

781
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,800
Carol Baskin died of tigers.

782
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,800
Carol Baskin died of tigers.

783
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
Carol Baskin died of a tiger attack.

784
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
Carol Baskin died of a tiger attack.

785
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,800
(laughter)

786
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,800
It sucks how much...

787
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I miss Johnny.

788
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,560
Carol Baskins on this show yeah as a joke and then it's morphed into just us

789
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:26,240
talking about Carol Baskins in our regular life that might be a you probably

790
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:33,320

805
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,240
Okay

806
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,180
It's so cool. If you ask like a kindergarten or what they want to be when they grow up

They'll be like I'm gonna be a frog. Yeah. Yeah, that's like a spider-man. Yeah, I'd be evil. Yeah

Yeah, but then I'm gonna invent some sort of like I'm gonna invent like so skeleton

812
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,240
Some octopus arms jump in in front of a ray

813
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:38,500
Space mission and get hit by rays in space basically what I'm trying to do is work

814
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,840
Around or with gamma as much as I can

815
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,040
Try to just get as close to gamma as possible

816
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,400
But not so close it kills me but close enough that it makes me kind of like an evil

817
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,960
Yeah, it makes me kind of like a soup that can turn into like anything. I think of yeah

818
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,880
I want to have rocks for a body when I get older. I'm playing on being the blob

819
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,720
Yeah, cuz then I'd be anything the what the blobs only power is that he can run really fast

820
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,720
The blob was just a thing.

821
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,720
Yeah, it was just an unstoppable force.

822
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,720
Yeah, whoa.

823
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Are you talking about the blob like...

824
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Oh, I thought you were talking about X-Man blob.

825
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,720
I didn't even know there was a blob.

826
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,720
He's a supervillain.

827
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,720
He's just really fat.

828
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,720
That's his power.

829
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
Nobody could like knock him down because he was too fat.

830
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
What did you do to power?

831
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,720
Made McDonald's?

832
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,720
Radioactive?

833
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,720
He got bit by a radioactive ember.

834
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,980
The blob what did he eat a tiger? No?

835
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:40,560
My fucking my god Cameron you've really done it this time

836
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:45,520
Would you find would you fall into a fucking falling some grease the blob?

837
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,260
What is this guy named Bob and he added an L in his name tag?

838
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:51,040
Yeah

839
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,620
You had a misprint yeah, I should call him the typo

840
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,760
All right number four spanking children

841
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:06,900
Which we've already covered we talked about that. Yeah, we already talked about that. What are the comments here hold up?

842
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:15,760
Horrible punishment it causes injury by breaking the capillaries and causing burn trauma, so it's an overrated punishment. That's been taken to her

843
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:22,280
It's my biggest complaint about spanking is it's overrated big red baboon ass. Yeah, I got spanked as a kid

844
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,200
Yeah, I was a swollen giant sexy ass mm-hmm

845
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:32,280
Bad punishment, it's just as bad as taking away their things I

846
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,440
Think one of them

847
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:39,400
Think one of them is a lot longer

848
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,920
Taking their chance away to me is way worse

849
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,480
When I was a kid you guys do so much rather just like get spanked and get it fucking over with you guys ever play the

850
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,980
Trick where they're like I'm gonna take away your favorite toy, and you're like oh my favorite toy. Yeah

851
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,060

00:38:56,060 --> 00:39:01,120

854
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,180
touch it.

855
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:14,300
I was just playing with my homework, but secretly I'm gonna go back under

856
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,540
my favorite play. My favorite toy.

857
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,020

858
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,100
- Yeah, my favorite toy, dad's,

859
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,300

860
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,540
and buy something nice for yourself, sweetheart?

861
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,260
I think you might have a better attitude.

862
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,340
- Hey, mom, my favorite toy is a bouquet of flowers

863
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,180
just for you.

864
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,980
(laughing)

865
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,260
Yeah, so if you wanna take that away, be my guest.

866
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,820
- Yeah, you wanna take that, throw it in the trash?

867
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,660
Oh, okay.

868
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,700
My favorite toy, $100.

869
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:40,980
- My favorite toy's my penis, mom.

870
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,660
Are you willing to go to jail for your fight?

871
00:39:42,660 --> 00:39:43,500
(laughing)

872
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,820
I don't think so.

873
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,100
- That would never happen.

874
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:51,960
number five putting pressure on their children like you like john cory

875
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,980
i think that the president of the board of the

876
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,400
my son

877
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,140
you send walks into the dinner party with anvil on his head

878
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,260
uh... under the futon

879
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,460
but it was a take turns it not been a bit of a about it i'm on the other

880
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:12,020
spill the last one hundred

881
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,100
and i think he likes let them know it

882
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:20,480
he ate too much cereal yesterday and we're punishing him

883
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,120
with the comments on this one

884
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,240
uh... there's one about asian parents

885
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,920
okay don't even

886
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:29,880
i hope there's no there help there's new ones that causes major anxiety and can

887
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,680
lead to serious issues later on in life

888
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:37,280
big facts parental pressure is just as bad as peer pressure is the like parent

889
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,880
like i i honestly think ninety nine percent of like

890
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,160
adults consider their childhood trauma is just their parents just

891
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
not even fucking realizing what they're doing.

892
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Oh yeah, for sure.

893
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Like none of it's on purpose.

894
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:51,240
People always blame their parents for, they were like, "Yeah, they fucking bought me the

895
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,760
wrong skateboard as a kid and made me gay."

896
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,640
It's like, you, I don't know.

897
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,240
It's such a crapshoot raising kids.

898
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Yeah, yeah.

899
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,240
You know?

900
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,520
Yeah, they just said something that they, and then they didn't think about it.

901
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,760
Yeah, my dad gave me too much stuff and you know, now I'm really traumatized because-

902
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,920
My dad had too much swag and it made me feel inadequate.

903
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:16,520
My dad gave me a Nintendo and I wanted a Sega.

904
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,800
I broke grandma's arm.

905
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,120
Now I'm a murderer and it's his fault.

906
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,880
I broke grandma's arm.

907
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,560
I wanted a Sega and my dad got me a Nintendo and a Sega.

908
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,320
So I threw the Nintendo out the window.

909
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,040
I swung it around and I hit dad.

910
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:34,160
Dad say hello fail block.

911
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,600
I hit dad in the head and now he's in a wheelchair forever.

912
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,600
My mom is still in the fail block.

913
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,840
And it's so traumatic having a crippled dad.

914
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,760
Isn't that the plot of Garden State?

915
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
I haven't seen that.

916
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,760
Me neither.

917
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:51,000
Like, the whole thing in Garden State is that, like, Zach Braff's character is like, "Oh,

918
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:57,280
I have so much childhood trauma because I accidentally pushed my mom over, like, the dishwasher would

919
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:01,600
open up sometimes, and I pushed my mom one day because I was mad at her and she fell

920
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:08,320
back and it paralyzed her for the rest of her life, and my dad always blamed me."

921
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:13,520
So yeah, that's your fault. Your fucking fault right there. Yeah. Yeah, you deserve to have trauma for that.

922
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,820
I call him Zach Math, fucking boring ass actor.

923
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,920
He's boring as hell.

924
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,820
It's like watching someone do math in front of me.

925
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,420
Dude, Gordon State?

926
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,520
Gordon State?

927
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:24,320
That movie sucks.

928
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Again, I have not seen it.

929
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:26,820
Yeah.

930
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,020
Take that, Zach Braff.

931
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,620
I'm coming for you.

932
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,920
I'm gonna punch you in the face, dude.

933
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,220
Zach Braff, I'm gonna expose you.

934
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,220
For beating up that 12 year old.

935
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,120
Have you ever seen that footage?

936
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:41,280
Zach Braff beating the shit out of a 12 year old kid

937
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,120
because of pumped.

938
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:42,960
- You told me that.

939
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,080
- Yeah, dude it rocks.

940
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,080
- Yeah, super swag, very sick.

941
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,920
Number six, let their kids smoke/vape.

942
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,960
- I would let my kids smoke.

943
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,800
- Didn't your parents let you smoke?

944
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,280
- Kinda.

945
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,360
- But you're cool.

946
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,660
- When I like, towards like my 18th birthday

947
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,000
when they found out I smoked cigs,

948
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,460
my mom did buy me cigs.

949
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,440
- Nice.

950
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,160
- So when I was like 17 my mom bought me cigs.

951
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,720
- But she bought you like kid cigs.

952
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:07,280
- She bought me Camel Blues, so yeah.

953
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,920
- Yeah, whoa, controversial dude.

954
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,880
- They're the best cigarettes though.

955
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,600
- Yeah, all cigarettes taste like dirt.

956
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,320
- Yeah. - Yeah, there's no difference.

957
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,340
- I think I might've had like,

958
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,920
I might've been hypnotized or something,

959
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:23,080
like if I smell a cigarette now,

960
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,560
I feel like I'm gonna puke.

961
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,040
- I got straight Hitler-tized.

962
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,240
- I got Hitler-tized, exactly.

963
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,760
Like I'll try to smoke a cigarette when I drink and like--

964
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,960
- And you do not like it?

965
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,040
- No, I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

966
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:36,320
- That's funny.

967
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
I smoked cigs forever.

968
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Yeah, that's an odd thing to all of a sudden...

969
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,820
Yeah.

970
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,320
Yeah.

971
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,820
So I've heard sometimes if you get like the flu or something and you like...

972
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:51,320
Like sometimes people will get the flu and then like quit cigarettes because like it fucked up their taste buds or something.

973
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Woah.

974
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,820
Oh yeah, there's something like if you...

975
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:57,320
Yeah, if you get the flu like yeah, and then you like eat a certain food...

976
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,820
Like eat your food... a food you like during having the flu like you won't like it anymore.

977
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:01,320
Exactly.

978
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:06,840
I can never eat collard greens again because I ate collard greens and then got like the stomach flu really bad

979
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:11,140
And I just vomited them for like yeah, two days that happened to me when I was a kid

980
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:13,480
I I like loved hot dogs

981
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:17,140
And then one time I had hot dogs and I like got really really sick, and I was like oh

982
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:23,080
I can't eat hot dogs anymore, but then eventually I can't eat cheese poofs cheese poops cheese poofs cheese poofs

983
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,120
Only this place puffs cheese poofs

984

Cheese poops cheese poofs cheese cheese pucks cheese pucks

991
00:45:02,920 --> 00:45:07,280
Fucking bummer now whenever I throw up think about hot dogs number seven

992
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,100
Telling children what music to listen to that's actually true. Yeah, that's what my dad did with me, and I'm fucking

00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:18,880
Lovely skinnered till I die well ordin lightfoot fuck. Yes. Oh, yeah

Today today is the anniversary of the end of the admin Fitzgerald damn, dude

00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:30,820
This isn't gonna be released on that day. So a load of iron ore. Yeah, it's their ears not yours

996
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:35,780
Everyone swears sex is a normal part of life and people can sing about whatever they want

997
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:42,300
My mom was pretty stupid about like me listening to rap girl. Yeah, I couldn't I the only rap I could listen to was like MC

998
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,300
Hammer. Yeah, she my mom. Yeah that

999
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,860
The phrase ballin had something to do with sex. Yeah, so any song that they all in the ball

1000
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,020
That's that's yeah

1001
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,380
That's why I got so into

1002
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,460
into new metal right is because I'd listen to like Green Day and Linkin

1003
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,940
Park and my parents were like iffy on that you know but then I go online and I

1004
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:02,940
find like All in the Family by Korn and I'm like "Oh my God!" "Friend Durst you need to rehearse!"

1005
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,300
Yeah, where they call each other gay for like five minutes and

1006
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:10,340
yeah they just say like "Oh your sister is gonna suck your dick" and I'm like

1007
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:13,700
"Holy shit I didn't know music like this could exist." I didn't know white boys could be

1008
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,340
so crazy. Yeah. Damn. Yeah I think my mom listened to like Without Me or something

1009
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,100
and she was like, just forever, she was like, "Eminem is okay to listen to in the house."

1010
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:27,660
My mom caught me listening... Do you remember Music Choice on the Comcast channels?

1011
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:28,860
It's like the...

1012
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,140
Oh, yeah.

1013
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:34,860
It's like the channels that would just play music. And my mom caught me listening to Fat Joe

1014
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:39,500
on it. She came into the house. She was outside doing something. She came back inside. I was

1015
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:43,980
dancing to Fat Joe in the living room. And she was like, "You cannot listen to this!" And turned

1016
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:49,500
on classic hip-hop and it was literally just playing "You Can't Touch This." I was like,

1017
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:57,820
"This sucks compared to that." One time my nana unplugged my iPod touch that I was borrowing

1018
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:02,140
to listen to "Lean Back" by Fat Joe. Yeah. And then she just turned it off and I'm like,

1019
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:08,060
"I don't think she'll ever use it again." Yeah. Yeah. My mom still does it. Like a year ago,

1020
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:13,580
I was listening to Young Thug, that one song where he says, "She sucks my dick on the plane,

1021
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:20,540
so I call her Airhead and my mom just says, you know, she does the, she does what on the plane?

1022
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:27,180
So he calls her what? Oh my, uh, come on mom. I'm vibing down here in the basement. I'm just trying

1023
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:34,300
to hang on my slat right now. Yeah, and you're fucking, fucking messing it up. Mom, I'm sliming.

1024
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:40,620
I'm sliming, mom. Chill, mom. God, I'm gonna need to sip some codeine to take the edge off.

1025
00:47:40,620 --> 00:47:48,020
Parents are gonna yeah, that's one thing about now like like like rap like playboy cardi and shit his parents can't understand anymore

1026
00:47:48,020 --> 00:47:52,040
Yeah, to get angry. Yeah, my parents were never able to understand rap. Oh, yeah

1027
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:59,060
My mom would listen to like fucking like Kanye and she'd be like, it's like he's speaking a different. Yeah. I know it's very funny

1028
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:01,860
Yeah, it's uh, did something about rhythm

1029
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:09,920
Nailed me with a rubber band god damn. Are you so good at that? I don't know the second time. They just hit me in the eyes

1030
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:17,200
eyes. The rubber band. God damn it. Fuck that. I hate that you know how to do that, dude.

1031
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,800
I'm hiding all the rubber bands next time you come to my house.

1032
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,240
Those are from the chicken. Really? You didn't have those?

00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:29,840
Hey, did you give my friend rubber bands? I'm going to have a stern talking to.

1035
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:32,640
They put rubber bands in Patrick's chicken. Yeah.

1036
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:36,960
They're like, this guy looks like a guy who likes to digest rubber.

1037
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:42,820
I was speaking my fucking I just remembered this around Christmas time in like 2012

1038
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:48,900
when doing ass by Big Sean was big yeah my aunt freaked the fuck out cuz my my

motherfucker hammer time she went like oh my god and like ran over it shut it

1042
00:49:03,100 --> 00:49:10,020
They always pick the funniest lyrics to get a man. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah fucking rules, dude. I mean that sounds fucking annoying

1043
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:14,280
Yeah, so I feel like the overreaction was just cuz she didn't want to hear that song

1044
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,820
I remember my mom got mad at me for listening that Eminem song

1045
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:25,140
Rain, man. Yeah where he talks about who's that guy used to play Superman and like the 60s Christopher Reeve

1046
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:28,860
Yeah, he like makes fun of Christopher Reeve. She's like, that's just wrong

1047
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:36,180
It's like that's Superman right yeah, and I would listen to like kill you by him where he talks about like raping his mom

1048
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:38,660
Yeah, he's like. I don't even understand what he's saying

1049
00:49:38,660 --> 00:49:43,100
This black fellas talking way too fast

1050
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:48,420
Yeah number eight take away children's electronics

1051
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:54,100
Evil that you should do that. I think my kids will not have any access to

1052
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,260
I'm sorry, but I'm just saying.

1053
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,260
Jesus Christ.

1054
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,260
I'm giving a preview.

1055
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:03,260
My kids will not have any access to electronics, including the microwave, until they're like 18.

1056
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,260
Yeah.

1057
00:50:05,260 --> 00:50:07,260
I have weird little fucking freak kids.

1058
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,260
I think the perfect age to give a kid like a phone

1059
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:11,260
is like

1060
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,260
16, but like I'll let them be on

1061
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,260
the computer and shit.

1062
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:17,260
My kids will never touch a computer.

1063
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,260
Yeah, no, that's...

1064
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:21,260
Yeah, I'm worried about my kids becoming alt-right.

1065
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,260
My kids are.

1066
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:27,540
have to end up like me yeah that's how I'll talk to my kids yeah like yeah I

1067
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,900
just fucking playing runescape and I'll be like you're making all the same

1068
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:37,460
mistakes your pops made I'm doing this for you I'm doing this for you I just

1069
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,780
cut the Ethernet cable for you I'm throwing my own computer in the trash

1070
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:48,460
this is for you trust me it impacts your 3m yeah you go back outside

1071
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,980
- Yeah.

1072
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,860
- Trust me, it impacts your children negatively.

1073
00:50:54,860 --> 00:50:56,740
It impacts me negatively pretty much.

1074
00:50:56,740 --> 00:50:57,880
It doesn't work at all.

1075
00:50:57,880 --> 00:50:59,780
It just makes things worse and puts pressure

1076
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:02,300
on your children and gives them anxiety.

1077
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,600
- Taking away my phone gave me anxiety.

1078
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,540
- I mean, that's how people be--

1079
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,300
- What if I missed a TikTok?

1080
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,060
- I mean, that's seriously how it is these days.

1081
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:13,860
What if I missed a coupon from the McDonald's app?

1082
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,900
- No, kids don't even use coupons anymore.

1083
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:16,740
- No, kids hate coupons.

1084
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,560
- And that's a problem.

1085
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,400
- They use QR codes.

1086
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,820
- Kids think that coupons--

1087
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,020
- Oh my fucking God, dude.

1088
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:23,220
Kids think that coupons are life hacks now.

1089
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,420
You know what kids think?

1090
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,340
Kids think a coupon's a groupon.

1091
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:27,500
Yeah, that's right.

1092
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:29,940
And they don't even know about Great Poupon.

1093
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:31,260
That's right.

1094
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:33,720
I'd like to take a Poupon Groupon.

1095
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:35,900
Hey, you guys ruined coupons.

1096
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,740
(laughing)

1097
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,780
You piece of crap.

1098
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,900
You guys destroyed the coupon industry.

1099
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:41,740
Yeah.

1100
00:51:41,740 --> 00:51:42,580
By making it digital.

1101
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:44,740
Nobody's ever gonna be able to sell those books anymore.

1102
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:46,060
Do you remember the fake coupons

1103
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,740
that they used to have on 4chan?

1104
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:49,700
Nah, I think so.

1105
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:54,100
It was like people would make like scannable like fake coupons and it was like

1106
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,700
manufacturer's coupon one free Xbox 360.

1107
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1108
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,700
And people would try to use them.

1109
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:00,700
They would work.

1110
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,700
That's the thing.

1111
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:06,700
There's a guy who got sued for like two million dollars of like lost revenue.

1112
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,700
Because people...

1113
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:08,700
Alright, fine. I'll pay it.

1114
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:09,700
Here, take this coupon.

1115
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:12,700
[Laughter]

1116
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:13,700
Yeah.

1117
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:14,700
What do you mean?

1118
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:15,700
What do you mean?

1119
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,700
This coupon for Lamborghini Murciélago is not good?

1120
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:19,700
Yeah.

1121
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,700
Well, thank you for the coupon.

1122
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,700
Court adjourned.

1123
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,700
Wait a second.

1124
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,700
Haha, double jeopardy.

1125
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:29,660
You already said court adjourned.

1126
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:32,020
Number nine, giving little kids cell phones.

1127
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,020
Yeah.

1128
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:34,020
Wait, that's...

1129
00:52:34,020 --> 00:52:35,020
We've already covered this.

1130
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:36,700
Yeah, we said it was good, right?

1131
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,060
I don't remember.

1132
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:39,180
We said it was the best idea.

1133
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,180
Well, how are they going to listen to this podcast?

1134
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:42,180
Exactly.

1135
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,420
My mom said she will give me my phone when I'm 15.

1136
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,260
Turns out I got it when I was nine.

1137
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:47,260
LOL.

1138
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,260
Swag.

1139
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:49,780
Six years early, dude.

1140
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:50,660
Yeah, 'cause that's the thing,

1141
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,340
I mean, you gotta teach your kids online etiquette.

1142
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:55,620
Yeah, like for me, I mean, just immediately,

1143
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,460
I was trying to have sex.

1144
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:58,260
Use the lick emoji a lot.

1145
00:52:58,260 --> 00:53:00,100
When you're responding-- People love it.

1146
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:00,940
People love it.

1147
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:03,580
People love when you ask them to throw that thing back.

1148
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,100
If your teacher ever texts you,

1149
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,140
reminding you about homework, lick emoji.

1150
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,740
Yeah, water.

1151
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,460
Water and eggplant.

1152
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:12,300
And licking.

1153
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:13,120
And licking.

1154
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:14,420
Water, eggplant, lick, fist.

1155
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,580
It means I'm at dinner right now,

1156
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:16,420
I'll text you back later.

1157
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:21,620
means I'm licking an eggplant at dinner and I'm drinking water and I'm staying hydrated.

1158
00:53:21,620 --> 00:53:27,860
Teachers want to know if the kids are hydrated. Do teachers text their kids now? I don't know.

1159
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:32,980
Teachers, I have like friends from high school who became teachers and I see they post on Instagram

1160
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:38,660
like, "Oh look at this funny email my kid sent me." And it's like, "I am chasing the cat around

1161
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:43,460
the house and my parents are gonna get me." Just like stuff you know just stuff like that or like

1162
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,300
- I would just be like--

1163
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,140
- It's a bunch of crazy emojis and shit.

1164
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:47,700
- I would just respond to all those and be like, cool.

1165
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,600
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1166
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,540
- It's always weird when a professor in college

1167
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:52,400
gives out his phone number in class.

1168
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,340
- Yeah, and if you need to text me for anything,

1169
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:56,700
and I mean anything. - Exactly.

1170
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,900
- A lot of people at our college

1171
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,460
got beers with their professors.

1172
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,560
- Yeah, that was weird.

1173
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,900
- Yeah, but the thing is, in college, you're all adults.

1174
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:05,740
- Yeah, yeah. - That's also true.

1175
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,860
- That's all fucking suck your teacher's dick, who cares?

1176
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,620
- Yeah, that's true.

1177
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,420

Oh man, you 40.

I don't think I've ever had a single hot professor in college.

1182
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:20,340
I think I did.

1183
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:21,340

How was that bad?

1199
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,300
Children.

1200
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:40,300
Children.

1201
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:41,300
Ben Trilden.

1202
00:54:41,300 --> 00:55:05,620
Ben Trill had a moment.

1203
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,140
If it's showing their skins, then no.

1204
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,260
Not to kids in 8-12 years old.

1205
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:14,660
pedophiles will increases the chances of sexual harassment to them do that at the

1206
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:19,020
start of seventeen to twenty three years old now you're seventeen years a bikini

1207
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,500
it's all you're allowed to wear

1208
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:25,260
yeah now that you're how you're safe from pedophiles no way you ever be assaulted

1209
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,900
sexually in your life

1210
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:30,300

1214
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:45,060
they exposed their midsections and legs. Pedophiles ain't touching this family.

1215
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:51,300
That's a number one rule a family has to make. The first reply is but they're uncle is.

1216
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:59,620
Oh my god. What are you doing? Have you seen that documentary about that the family who they had like a

1217
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:04,340
neighbor who was like a pedophile who like fucked everyone in the family. Oh

1218
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:05,620
Oh yeah, on Netflix?

1219
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:08,220
And they kept like kidnapping their daughter and they were just like, "Sorry!"

1220
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:10,420
He made the dad give him a handjob or something like that?

1221
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:12,420
Yeah, the dad fucking blew him or some shit.

1222
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:14,860
He fucked the mom and he kidnapped the kids.

1223
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,860
Yeah.

1224
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,220
And it's like, "Damn dude, he's 100%ing that family."

1225
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:27,260
Every situation that the dad describes, he's always like, "Well, I don't know what happened,

1226
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,260
but eventually."

1227
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:31,420
Yeah, it was very confusing how he fucking caught my daughter with a butterfly net.

1228
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:32,420
Yeah.

1229
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,420
I had no idea what was going on.

1230
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,780
(laughing)

1231
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:35,900
- Yeah, it's such a weird one.

1232
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,220
- He just had, there was something magic about him.

1233
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,340
He was so charismatic.

1234
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:40,940
- Yeah. - Yeah, so.

1235
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,460
- Hey family, I'm gonna be taking your daughter.

1236
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,660
I'll be back in a year or two.

1237
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:45,660
- Yeah.

1238
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,180
- I mean, how do we say no?

1239
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,180
He's so charming.

1240
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:50,060
- I left $20 on the stove.

1241
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:50,900
- Wink.

1242
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,340
- Oh, he left the stove on.

1243
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:54,180
(laughing)

1244
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,980
$20 burned up immediately.

1245
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,740
I didn't even think it was $20.

1246
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:00,380
I think that was printer paper.

1247
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,700
- He's fucking, I mean, it's just so funny

1248
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,420
just have a kid that just keeps getting kidnapped by the same dude.

1249
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:06,420
Yeah.

1250
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:10,780
Just being like, I mean, what can we possibly do?

1251
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:11,780
He's our friend.

1252
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,780
So weird.

1253
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:16,900
Yeah, if they go to the police, they'll make fun of us for being friends with them.

1254
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:20,620
You guys are weird.

1255
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:21,620
Skip around here.

1256
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:22,980
Spoiling children.

1257
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,980
Yes.

1258
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,660
Yeah, you do not want to spoil your child.

1259
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,460
My kid's way past his expiration date.

1260
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:28,460
I wish I had spoiled.

1261
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:29,460
He's spoiled.

1262
00:57:29,460 --> 00:57:31,540
Number 13, drinking.

1263
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:35,220
Joeljohns249 says, "Agreed, and not just minors."

1264
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,300
I don't think even college kids should be allowed to drink.

1265
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:45,380
My mom was so obsessed with her tiny bit of Italian heritage that she really wanted me

1266
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:46,700
to drink wine when I was 10.

1267
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:47,700
Oh yeah, my parents...

1268
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:50,060
She was like, "Come on, you can have a glass of wine at the table."

1269
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:51,060
My parents did that too.

1270
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:52,060
We weren't Italian though.

1271
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,540
And I would have it and I'd be like, "This tastes like fucking dog shit."

1272
00:57:54,540 --> 00:58:01,060
Yeah, my parents offered me wine one time and I smelled it and I was like, "No!"

1273
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,780
I remember my dad being like you want a sip of beer. Yeah, that's we go

1274
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:08,160
My dad tells a story about how like when I was a kid

1275
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:12,180
I like he when I was like a young kid like three or four

1276
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,860
He gave me like a sip of his beer

1277
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:19,820
like as a gag and then I went to school the next day and I like sucked on a Lego and I was like this tastes

1278
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:21,820
Just like beer

1279
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:27,580
It's pretty cool number 16 is stop reproducing and there are two really good comments here

1280
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:33,740
First comment is I think it should be illegal to have more than one child because when people have more than one they hardly ever get

1281
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:39,460
Along just because the parents didn't use a condom when they had sex the first child gets stuck with a nosy loud

1282
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:46,980
Destructive and attention-hogging sibling which basically ruins their life in good times. I might you do one child policy. Let's go

1283
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:52,580
Let's do it. Yeah, let's do it. Neither. You guys would be born. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, and that's the point

1284
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:59,460
You should put that on a mean I bet it blew your mind. Yeah. Well, what if I don't even want to be alive man?

1285
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:04,060
Yeah, god damn. I'm cool. That's so cool to say other comment on here

1286
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,940
You read Nietzsche for the ones who already had kids you would bring more evil

1287
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:12,980
By the way, if you're saying legendary bands like Slayer and bring me the horizon should be banned

1288
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,700
Maybe you should be banned from living you inconsiderate monstrosities

1289
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,900
It's funny though because they're brothers

1290
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:28,380
Their brothers. I mostly hate single children when I meet them. Yeah, I like children who are in relationships

1291
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:34,320
No, I think there's like I think I only have like three or four friends who are

1292
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:41,660
Single childs. Yeah, they're just usually bad people, right? It's just it's like if your parents like a barrier

1293
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:45,860
You can't cross. Yeah, it's like you were fully loved. Yeah. Yeah, exactly

1294
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,900
Exactly, you were loved the most in your family.

1295
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,400
Yeah, it's like you got so fucked.

1296
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,400
Like you don't even know how much that fucked you up.

1297
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,400
Yeah, oh yeah, yeah.

1298
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:58,900
Like the perfect kid has 50 siblings and all of them were raised by their grandparents.

1299
00:59:58,900 --> 00:59:59,400
Yeah.

1300
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:00,900
And they like never saw their parents.

1301
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:02,400
You never had to act out for attention.

1302
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:02,900
Yeah, dude.

1303
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:03,900
What the fuck's wrong with you?

1304
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:04,400
Ehhh.

1305
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:04,900
Yeah.

1306
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:07,400
That's gross to me.

1307
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,900
Yeah, you never put glue on the dog to get your dad to say something to you?

1308
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,400
Yeah.

1309
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,900
Can't relate.

1310
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,900
You never shaved like part of your head?

1311
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:18,620
Yeah, eighth grade exactly exactly you don't get it. Yeah

1312
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:24,240
Number 23 demanded grandchildren. Oh, yeah, I hated that in high school

1313
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:28,220
number 24 thrusting their babies in other people's faces

1314
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:31,540
What's that comment weird wording?

1315
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:35,900
Yeah, that's right. Yeah, that's right. That's right

1316
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:41,460
Gimme being anti-vaxxers being it's actually cool. Yeah, that's cool to do

1317
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:45,780
Showing embarrassing baby photos to people without their children's consent

1318
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:51,940
That's right putting them on birthday cakes also counts comment by the dutty gal

1319
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:55,100
the dutty

1320
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:01,540

01:01:15,020 --> 01:01:19,020

We wanna hang out with you right now.

1342
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:35,180
Yeah.

1343
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,180
Oh my god.

1344
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,180
He's here.

1345
01:02:37,180 --> 01:02:38,180
Hey.

1346
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:40,180
Oh my god Cameron, Andy Dick's in there.

01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:41,180
Oh my god.

1348
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,180
Hey.

1349
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:44,180
Hey Andy Dick.

1350
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:45,180
What's up?

1351
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:47,180
How are you doing?

1352
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,180
I'm...

1353
01:02:48,180 --> 01:02:49,180
Hey.

1354
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:50,180
How did you get here?

1355
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,180
I went to the toilet.

1356
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,180
You don't sound like that.

1357
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:53,180
He does sound like that.

1358
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,180
It's your Griffin McElroy voice.

1359
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,180
Yeah.

1360
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:57,180
Okay.

1361
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,620
I don't know what he sounds like.

1362
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:00,620
He's generally high.

1363
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:01,620
You made Patrick cry.

1364
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:05,020
Cause he's scared of Andy Dick too.

1365
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,700
I was so happy for a moment and then I realized it wasn't Andy Dick it was Caleb.

1366
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:12,260
I'm sorry I can't make all your dreams come true.
