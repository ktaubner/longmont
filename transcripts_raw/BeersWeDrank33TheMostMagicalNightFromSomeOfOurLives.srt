1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
and theme songs.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Oh yeah.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I like that sound.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Mmhmm.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I love that sound.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I like that shit.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh shit.

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I love it this--

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
What's up all my chuggers?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm trying to get that burp out.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
This is a Johnny.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Into--

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:57,680
I hope you're keeping tab of what episode we're on.

14
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,640
I am, this is episode 100, welcome to beers we drank.

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm having myself a Voodoo Ranger, a juicy, hazy IPA.

16
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,920
Guys, this is one of the funny beers that you can have in this white world and I'm succumbing

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:18,920
yet again to one of the coolest cans on earth.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,920
Cheers, my friends.

19
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,680
I know we've talked a lot about making our own beer.

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,880
We should start our own bottle making company and it's a bottle that just makes a little

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
noise when you open it.

22
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,880
Um...

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,880
It's in there like a...

24
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,880
Sun Chips.

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,880
This is 7.5%?

26
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,600
I don't think I've actually ever had one of these.

27
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
That is...

28
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
That is insane.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,600
This...

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,080
I mean it doesn't even taste like an IPA hardly.

31
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
Yeah.

32
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,080
It's really...

33
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,080
What flavor is it?

34
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,080
It's certainly...

35
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,080
Certainly juicy.

36
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,480
Well it's Juicy Hayes IPA, I already said that.

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,480
I'm getting notes of...

38
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,480
Hold on.

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
Beer.

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,480
You're getting notes...

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,480
Mm-mm.

42
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Wait, remember what we learned last week?

43
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:58,120
You gotta, you gotta, you know, stroll around and smell it.

44
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:04,120
[BLANK_AUDIO]

45
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:08,360
>> I'm gonna say notes of some kind of wood.

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,880
I'm not quite, every time I try to do that,

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,960
I feel like I'm almost, I almost found a word that could describe one thing.

48
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,200
But I'm not quite there.

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,520
My super taster genes are still laying dormant in my tongue.

50
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,600
>> Yeah. >> But this is a good beer, guys.

51
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm gonna give this the exact same ABV, and that's a lesson to the good people over at

52
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,320
Voodoo Ranger.

53
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,080
If you make a 10% ABV, I might give you a 10.

54
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
This is 7.5.

55
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:42,960
This is a 6'8.5" small forward who's probably in his third year.

56
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:49,480
He's out of his sophomore slump and he's rising to kind of, you know, borderline all-star level.

57
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,760
I like this shit, man.

58
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,000
This is a very decent beer.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I understand why people do it, why people do this one in the car.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's good.

61
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yeah.

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Um, you wanna go next, Rex?

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Sure.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So, this is a beer I did not buy.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It was in my fridge already.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Free beer.

67
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
And that is a Coors Light.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh my god.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's give it up one time for the Coors Light.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh.

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I love this beer.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I could drink this beer.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
This is basically water.

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
That's the best beer in the world.

75
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,560
I mean, put another notch in your belt because this is a beer that you will drink every day

76
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,560
of your life.

77
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,560
Yeah, I could drink this literally all the time.

78
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
This is amazing.

79
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Give me the review man, give me the numbers.

80
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,120
I need to hear, you know me man, I'm a numbers guy.

81
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:43,280
I'm like 538, I need to hear the projections.

82
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,680
This is like a 7.58 out of 10, but because it was free, that's a 10 out of 10.

83
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
true

84
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,280
and i would like to say this right now

85
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,660
all free beer is a ten

86
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,500
that's right every free beer is a ten that is a rule on this show

87
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,120
if a beer is free

88
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,220
it gets a three plus

89
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:07,900
two plus a seven

90
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,540
ten some might call that

91
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,520
but i just like you know i like rhyming

92
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,220
and now you my mousy little friend what do you have for me

93
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,220
I don't look like a mouse, first of all.

94
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Today I...

95
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,220
Why don't you put those big buck teeth back in your mouth and stop talking to me.

96
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,220
Let's pile on.

97
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,220
He's having the worst week of his life.

98
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,220
Sorry.

99
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,220
I'm gonna get back to that later.

100
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,220
Today I am drinking a... I think it's called Tempus?

101
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,220
Uh-huh.

102
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,220
I don't know, it's like some artisanal beer.

103
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,220
It's a cerveza artisanal.

104
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,220
It says that it's a cream stout.

105
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,220
And I read that on the bottle and I was like, "Oh."

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:58,660
the

107
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,140
Let me get Phil, like put it right in the middle.

108
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,140
Okay, a little closer.

109
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,140
Does that not look like the awning to a strip club?

110
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,140
Yes.

111
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,460
Yeah, Tempest does sound like a bad strip club.

112
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,580
Tempest Cream Stout, and with the color and everything.

113
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,580
This actually-

114
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,580
43%?

115
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:22,180
I feel like I'm walking into one of the most midnights of my life.

116
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:25,740
It looks like the label on like a chocolate bar.

117
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,740
Yeah.

118
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,980
With the Milka.

119
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:34,420
It looks a little bit too elegant for this show, I'd go and say that.

120
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:40,100
I read Cream Stout on the label and I was like, "Oh, that's going to taste like dessert."

121
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,980
I just took a swig of it and it's just a dark beer.

122
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:50,820
Yeah, I think the Cream Stout is like milk washed or something.

123
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:56,100
Yeah, so it's on the side of one of the ones that I don't much like because I really don't

124
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,040
like dark beers but it's okay I think it's like light enough so I don't

125
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,540
completely hate it like I have other beers other dark beers so you know what

126
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:13,460
this one gets to gets a 5.8 okay and in the AVA scale he didn't make the league

127
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:20,780
Wow okay that bad 5.8 I feel like is that's kind of interesting he's 5.8 out

128
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,780
of 10 didn't make the league. He's 5.8 and he didn't make the league. Oh okay all right gotcha

129
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:38,100
the

130
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:42,100
I'm gonna freak out and start knocking things over.

131
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Let's get down to business.

132
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
I am a victim.

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
I am a victim of rudeness.

134
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
Everyone here in this room.

135
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,100
What have I ever said about you that is even remotely rude?

136
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Two minutes ago you called me a mouse and you said I had bug teeth.

137
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Which I don't.

138
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:04,100
Even though that's more of a rat kind of thing.

139
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:17,740
that

140
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:24,620
You couldn't stop talking about it, you dressed up for it, you appeared in front of my eyes,

141
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,260
dressed like a gentleman, and then you guys just went while I was stuck in a different

142
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,340
country and I got facetimed by Rex twice.

143
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,460
And Rex said some pretty rude things, did he not?

144
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:42,740
And he said some rude things, he said "we're enjoying our night so much I wish you killed

145
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,740
yourself."

146
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,580
He did not say that I don't think.

147
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,880
She said something like that. I think that was the second time we called.

148
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,380
The first time we called...

149
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,480
The first time we called it was like, "We're in the Uber, we're on our way there."

150
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,480
It was like, "Okay, well, I'm at home."

151
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:57,280
No, we were in the Uber on the way-ar.

152
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,580
In the way-there.

153
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,280
On the way-ar.

154
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,280
On the way-ar.

155
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,080
We were on the way-ar.

156
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,580
We came on the way-ar.

157
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,080
We were on the way...

158
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,680
-ar. -and...

159
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,380
Nella...

160
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,580
Got a bunch of followers, and clearly...

161
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,780
You were shit-talking us...

162
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,560
Well we weren't there to defend ourselves.

163
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:25,960
Wait, I can explain this and everyone in this chat can actually back me up.

164
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:30,840
Because I was playing the Long Drive with Cam.

165
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,320
We were playing the game and we were talking about Thanksgiving.

166
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,720
We were talking about "Oh, it would be so much fun if I flew out to New York on Thanksgiving.

167
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,960
It would be so much fun."

168
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,880
And then we started talking about awesome dinners and plates and how full some plates

169
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:53,240
are during Thanksgiving and our famous plate was not much full.

170
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,160
Not so full that plate.

171
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,720
So we were talking about it and I just like, you know what, I have this fond memory of

172
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,520
looking at this picture and laughing so much because my friends were having such a good

173
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,720
time I want to relive it right now.

174
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
And that's why we posted it.

175
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:13,360
was not talking shit on Noah or either any of you guys but you still not even me

176
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:18,720
not even Caleb who I think it made all that food and that please yeah I did not

177
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
make the plate he made the plate I'd like to clarify that he filled up on strudel

178
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,280
before he came to Thanksgiving he said he ate two strudels he filled up all he

179
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:33,120
put on his plate was two pieces of ham and a little bit of stuffing yeah but

180
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,100
that's beside the point I want you to get to the second phone call the second

181
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:42,500
phone call I think it was you guys as you guys were already done with the meal uh-huh and

182
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:50,100
you called me and you're like we had such an amazing time that that meat was delicious

183
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:58,940
oh so sorry you missed it you started I recall this you you Rex held out his phone and all

184
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:03,780
four of you Brian, Noah, Rex and Caleb all pointed at the phone and started laughing

185
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:10,780
at me. And I was like, "Oh, okay, thanks." So I just hung up. I was like, "What the fuck

186
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:16,660
am I gonna say?" It's actually, it's worse than that, because

187
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,140
we were laughing at you, like, kinda as like a joke, but I was in such a good mood that

188
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,860
I just couldn't stop laughing. Yeah.

189
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:31,860
And then we hollered at a passerby to take a photo of all of us while we were on with

190
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:39,540
on with you and then I looked back at my phone after we took the photo and you were gone.

191
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:43,520
Yeah we had it, we wanted to get a photo that was the four of us having the best night of

192
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:51,660
our entire lives and then you on a phone in the middle of it. Oh my god, I will say, yeah

193
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,580
it didn't, there was no mal intent with that phone call dude, that was just the kind of

194
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,860
mood we were in. Yeah, we just wanted to talk to you. We were gaking you, we just wanted,

195
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
We were like, you know, this is an amazing night.

196
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,260
What would make this night even better?

197
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,540
What if Julio was here?

198
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,660
Oh, wait, he's on the phone.

199
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,180
Ha!

200
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,820
That was our thought process personally.

201
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,900
- Why don't we, you know, let's just strike back

202
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,340
and talk about this legendary night.

203
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,020
How did it go?

204
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,580
- Well, man, it started like all amazing nights should.

205
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,620
We went to an absinthe bar

206
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,580
and spent about an hour and a half waiting on our drinks.

207
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,380
- Yeah.

208
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:30,780
- Let me tell you, these were divine.

209
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,940
I had somebody tell me, "You have to get the martini at this place.

210
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,940
You have to get the martini.

211
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,940
It's the best thing there."

212
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
I don't like martinis.

213
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,580
I don't even like barely anything, right?

214
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,500
And I say, "Let me have a martini, please."

215
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,220
And they say, "Oh, amazing choice, sir.

216
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,220
It's this kind of place."

217
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,860
"By the way, oh, wait, I got to get this out."

218
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,740
Noah that night said, he had told us all before, he was like, "We're all going to wear suits,

219
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,740
man.

220
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,860
We're all going to wear suits and dress up, and we're going to look amazing."

221
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,960
and i was like it would be kind of funny if we all wear suits just to go eat

222
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,660
barbecue yeah we'll do that

223
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,880
thinking it would be really funny if all four of us wear suits or at least if me and

224
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,720
noah wear suits

225
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,240
i get to brian's i'm dressed in the suit that i got married in

226
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,140
noah is dressed like a

227
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,080
like an old navy mannequin

228
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,120
he had

229
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,480
wait what?

230
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,680
he had blue chinos on

231
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,700
and a blue

232
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:29,140
shirt that he claimed was a suit jacket

233
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,340
on top of his uh... of a polo that he was wearing. Do you have a picture of him?

234
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:37,140
There's a picture of him I'm sure.

235
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,300
But this pissed me off to no end and it was made much much worse by the fact that we

236
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,820
got to the Absinthe restaurant and I was dressed, the only one in the entire

237
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,020
building who was sitting at a table

238
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:51,540
who was dressed exactly like the men working at the restaurant. Yeah.

239
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,940
Like the same fucking suit.

240
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,900
The same banana republic suit we were all wearing. Yeah.

241
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,540
so i'm telling my my coworker

242
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,140
yeah i'll have a martini and he says amazing choice sir

243
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,360
and then he leaves he comes back forty five minutes later

244
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,940
and the manager

245
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,900
so i didn't know that this is what they do but they come to the table with a

246
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,700
tray

247
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:17,900
one guy just holds the tray and then a lady

248
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:23,140
makes the martini off of the tray as the guy serves as a human table

249
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,980
in front of me and it took so long it was like the first time she ever made it

250
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:50,980
at

251
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,980
I mean it just sucked.

252
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:53,980
My drinking break.

253
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,980
It sucked.

254
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Yeah, we ate one oyster each.

255
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,980
We had one oyster each.

256
00:13:58,980 --> 00:13:59,980
And one drink.

257
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Mmhmm.

258
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,980
And it cost $200.

259
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,980
It was, it was insane.

260
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,980
What?

261
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,980
I didn't pay for a single thing, thank god.

262
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Thank god.

263
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:16,980
Anyway, so, from there, we realized we're pretty close to a place in Brooklyn called Barcade

264
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:36,600
of

265
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:40,080
mug and then you shoot the mug and it explodes.

266
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,600
And it's, you have to see it to believe it.

267
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,260
This is the greatest arcade game of all time.

268
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:51,160
And we went, we Ubered over to the barcade to play this game for maybe 10 minutes and

269
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,080
then we had to leave to go make our great barbecue reservation.

270
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,080
Yeah.

271
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,160
Because we spent 30 minutes on the bridge.

272
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Yeah.

273
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:06,120
And then we got there, man, and I honestly don't even know what to say.

274
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,640
Ryan asked me a question, then two days later I saw him, and I was with my wife, he was with

275
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,640
his girlfriend, we were getting dinner, and he pissed me off more than anybody's ever

276
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,760
pissed me off in my entire life.

277
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,480
He said, "I've never eaten anything like that, I probably never will again in my life."

278
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,360
That was like a once- there's a reason I felt okay wearing the suit once I was there, because

279
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,040
I was like, "This is as important as my wedding.

280
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,040
There is no way that I will ever eat anything like this ever again.

281
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,040
This is fucking insane.

282
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,320
It was like a Korean Wagyu place?

283
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,920
It was Wagyu only Korean BBQ all you can eat.

284
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,200
And I sent a picture of the meat if you want to show people.

285
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,880
Yeah, I'll pull it up on my phone.

286
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,040
I believe it's in the discord as "this beef was different".

287
00:15:53,040 --> 00:16:00,520
I butcher in house and they serve you every cut of the meat.

288
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
They serve you like 16 different cuts.

289
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
I think I found it.

290
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:10,520
You look completely red.

291
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:16,520
I didn't say slightly edited photo.

292
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:22,520
I found it.

293
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:27,040
Brian asked me two nights after having this meal that was like completely mind-blowing,

294
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,200
two hours of eating this, look at that meat dude.

295
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,200
That's insane.

296
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,320
That's hella meat.

297
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,480
It's hella meat and it's completely white.

298
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Yeah.

299
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:41,360
He sat, we were sitting down making small talk and he asked me, he's like, "Oh yeah, that

300
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:47,120
Korean BBQ thing the other night, did you like it?"

301
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
And I was like, "What did you just say man?"

302
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,920
He was like, "Yeah, did you like it?

303
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,200
Were you into that?"

304
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,840
And I literally pounded on the table like this.

305
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:05,160
And I was like, "Don't you ever ask me anything that stupid again as long as I fucking know

306
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,160
you."

307
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Yeah.

308
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,640
That was the best meal of my life and you knew it.

309
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,880
And now you're making fun of me because I'm poor.

310
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Yeah.

311
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:24,520
So, two things we're leaving out, which is that we get there and then you can just buy

312
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:31,280
nice soju and like sake, and we got like seven bottles.

313
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
What?

314
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,520
We had at least seven bottles.

315
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:40,600
Our waiter did a shot with us, it was amazing.

316
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:45,600
And when I tell you that I had one of the worst hangovers of my entire life, I'm not exaggerating.

317
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Having so hungover the next day, I strained my calf just like stretching the next morning.

318
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
That's the opposite of what's supposed to happen.

319
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Yeah, it was horrible.

320
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:06,600
But I wanted to stop drinking at a certain point because we'd done beers we drank, drank absinthe,

321
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,600
went to the barcade, drank seven days.

322
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:19,160
For those who don't remember, he had already loaded up on samples at the store.

323
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:24,080
I didn't bow, but everyone did this to me when they drank their-

324
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,800
We looked away in reverence to his age.

325
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:35,360
And I wanted to skip one, and the waiter was like, "Well, you are the oldest."

326
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,080
So you have to drink.

327
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,240
You got- I mean, you're not up for shut up, man.

328
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:43,440
If you wanna really be about this Korea shit, you gotta play by the rules, big daddy.

329
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
You're not in Korea, you're in fucking New York.

330
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,040
No, this was Korea.

331
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,200
This was- we were put in- it was amazing.

332
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,920
It was fucking amazing.

333
00:18:51,920 --> 00:19:00,620
So yeah, we were- that's why we got outside after this amazing meal, all this liquor,

334
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:05,040
and then we call our friend and we just can't stop laughing because we're so joyous.

335
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,600
Yeah, it really was- I mean, I was-

336
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,600
I had a giggle fit.

337
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,520
Yeah, basically yeah, had a giggle fit.

338
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,920
And then we went back to my place and we gambled.

339
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,920
And we gambled.

340
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,360
This is the most amazing night of my life.

341
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
Most amazing night of my life.

342
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,240
It's basically just like a perfect night.

343
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,720
I got home at 3 in the morning and I honestly felt like I went home early.

344
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
Yes.

345
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,760
I got home and I was like, you know what, in another world that could have been a thick

346
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,720
7am type of night.

347
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Yeah.

348
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Yeah.

349
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
It was really nice, man.

350
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:44,720
here

351
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:53,120
express or something like that. Maybe we could go to a Brazilian steakhouse. That's a great

352
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,520
idea actually. See, ok now Rex has finally gotten his revenge on you, not on me, I got

353
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,920
to be in both. Yeah, that is true. That is my revenge for the Brazilian steakhouse. I

354
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,560
got to do foie de chow with Julio and I got to do life changing Korean BBQ with Rex, which

355
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,080
by the way, love Fogo de Chao, not even,

356
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,520
this was a hug to Fogo de Chao.

357
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,920
This was, Fogo de Chao was nothing compared to this.

358
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,680
So Rex cannot be mad at anyone.

359
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,000
- I'm not gonna rehash this,

360
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,660
but we all know whose fault that night was.

361
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,500
And it was-- - It was Cameron's.

362
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,760
- It was an afternoon. - It was an afternoon.

363
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,600
- And you kept letting the cops into our place

364
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,520
and got us kicked out.

365
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,240
- Dude, I think I stopped Airbnb being able

366
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,280
to operate in New York altogether.

367
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,660
i think that was me

368
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:43,620
it was it was the last that was the last airbnb rented in the house as soon as

369
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,320
you left there were like you know what no more b_n_b_'s in in all of new york

370
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,640
they're completely banned because we found

371
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,920
the most insane

372
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,380
airbnb in fucking in brooklyn

373
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,620
so no one gets to do that anymore

374
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,840
i walked by it today and it still had the

375
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,600
uh... vacate immediately sign on there yeah i'm sure that guy doesn't even care

376
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,800
he's not going to do anything to it

377
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,800
to get food grants at some point you know who knows also has risen in the world

378
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,560
posters

379
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,100
his team can with this is gonna piece three in there

380
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,040
he doesn't need

381
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,760
forking for three dollars and register system

382
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,800
yeah that is true

383
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:25,040
you know that he has three came out closer to the n_e_s_ and

384
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,360
yeah i bought a p_s_ three like two thousand seventeen so that i could play

385
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:30,280
two k

386
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,160
and it was amazing

387
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,160
And then I played Ratchet and Clank.

388
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:40,160
And I was fully... you could have convinced me it was a brand new system.

389
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:45,160
I would have believed you. It was so... I mean, that's gotta be... that's probably...

390
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,160
Top five all time.

391
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:52,160
It's impossible to call the PS3 like a retro system because it looks...

392
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Because graphics stopped improving around there.

393
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,160
Yeah, exactly.

394
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,160
Like I've been playing, I don't know if you guys know this, I've been playing Persona 5.

395
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,160
Is that true?

396
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,160
Which is a PS3 game.

397
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Yeah, which is a PS3 game and it looks like it came out yesterday, dude.

398
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,160
Did they stop making Persona games after 5?

399
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:19,160
Well, they have, they, they, don't even get me started, but the next one, just basically the leaks are that it's gonna come out in 2026.

400
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,160
Uh, I wouldn't hold your breath on that.

401
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Persona 6?

402
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
Yeah, Persona 6.

403
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,160
Dude, listen, we can't talk about Persona, we're not doing Persona talk anymore, man.

404
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,540
Let's get into the nitty gritty.

405
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:32,080
The NBA preseason has began.

406
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,320
Victor Wimbenyama is dominating these games.

407
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,080
He's a monster on the pick and roll.

408
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,640
He can shoot to three.

409
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,920
His defensive game is something to be amazed by, is it not?

410
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,320
Guys, what are the takes we have on the preseason games thus far?

411
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:50,840
I think--

412
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,480
I watched them.

413
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,040
Yeah, I--

414
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,120
Watched them.

415
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,840
OK, now Julio, I'm going to need a little more than watched them from you.

416
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,680
I haven't been able to catch up on that because I've been catching up on last season of the

417
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
NBA.

418
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,680
I've been binging it.

419
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,240
You've been binging the NBA season?

420
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
Every game?

421
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,240
Yeah, last season.

422
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,920
Huh.

423
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:21,440
Well, what game are you on right now?

424
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,800
What part of the year?

425
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
The first one?

426
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,800
March.

427
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,800
The first game.

428
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,000
You're watching an NBA debut, which is probably Warriors at Lakers, something like that?

429
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Yeah, that's what I'm on right now.

430
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
You're on that?

431
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Mm-hmm.

432
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Okay, um...

433
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,400
Yeah, we can talk about anything else, you know?

434
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,320
We don't really have to talk about that.

435
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
Worlds is starting tonight.

436
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,360
Are we all excited or what?

437
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
Worlds what?

438
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,360
League.

439
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Nah, I know.

440
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,720
No, I know, I don't want to talk about that either.

441
00:23:55,720 --> 00:24:00,960
How about we talk about how because we did liquor we enjoyed, guys I have stepped up my

442
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,240
fashion game for this.

443
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,120
I mean I don't know if you can tell but I went through every article of clothing I have

444
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,840
in my entire under my bed because I'm not allowed to have a closet.

445
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,840
Yeah.

446
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,200
I haven't really talked to you guys since we recorded that.

447
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,920
I know, Loki I miss you man.

448
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:17,760
I did want to ask you guys.

449
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,960
What?

450
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,960
You miss me too?

451
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,500
I did want to ask you guys, so that you know, I've been good. Yeah, I miss you too. I've been doing this

452
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:31,880
You know the streaming for a whole month type of thing and someone recommended that I that I do a

453
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,120
You know one of those like you laugh you lose type type beats

454
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,920
but

455
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:42,360
It's if I laugh at something I have to like make myself a drink with my mask out that potato still have

456
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,280
Cuz I'm not when am I ever gonna drink that?

457
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,280
And I wanted to see if any of you if either you would like to come and join me

458
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,280
On what?

459
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,280
A drinking game?

460
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Yeah, just a drinking game with whatever you have.

461
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:59,280
And what are we watching while we drink?

462
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,280
Just funny videos.

463
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,280
Probably TikToks.

464
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
Funny videos, you laugh, you lose? Yeah, I can do that.

465
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,280
I still have about a fair amount of...

466
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,280
I don't even know how...

467
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,280
I have a lot of that proper 12 left

468
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,280
from liquor we enjoyed.

469
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,280
I had one night where I tried drinking it

470
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,280
and it hurt my stomach so bad.

471
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:23,720
And even though I was drinking like, I would put like half of an ounce in a tall glass,

472
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,920
like 16 ounce glass of water to try to dilute it.

473
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,560
And it just didn't work, man.

474
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:30,560
How about Coke?

475
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:34,600
Here's what I don't like about that shit, man.

476
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:41,780
I think that if you drink rum and Coke or Jack and Coke or anything like that, that's okay

477
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,460
if you're going to drink two drinks.

478
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:51,120
But if you are like me and you're going into the what some might say mastery kind of level,

479
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,700
the advanced levels of drinking where you're drinking 6 to 10, I'm not gonna drink fucking

480
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,220
120 ounces of soda.

481
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,220
I guess that's true.

482
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:02,220
Straight up.

483
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,220
I guess that's true.

484
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Straight up.

485
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
That's why you need diet coke.

486
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
That's still soda man.

487
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:11,180
I'm not, that's enough aspartame to, you could sprinkle it.

488
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,980
So I'm not doing that.

489
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,580
I don't know. I've seen pros just drink so much soda.

490
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:20,140
You know? Professionals.

491
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,580
Pro what?

492
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,700
The answer there is you just need to use coke as a chaser.

493
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,460
There.

494
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm also not gonna chase stuff, dude. I don't do that shit.

495
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:33,180
I don't do chasers. I don't do limes with tequila.

496
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,380
You should.

497
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,340
Why?

498
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,180
It's delicious.

499
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,780
It's supposed to feel... You should have an instant regret every time that you put alcohol in your body.

500
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:47,780
That's why beer is so amazingly dangerous.

501
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:50,780
Because you need these- liquor is supposed to taste bad.

502
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:57,420
If liquor tasted good, that would be- then people would have some kind of drinking- like

503
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,780
some problem with drinking I guess is what I would call it.

504
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,780
Some kind of drinking problem?

505
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,780
Yeah, they would have some kind of problem.

506
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,200
But because it tastes bad, people don't.

507
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
You know?

508
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
That is true.

509
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I see.

510
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,780
Yeah, I think I see your point.

511
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,060
Yeah, so yeah, I would mix something...

512
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,780
I agree, you can't drink 15 mixed drinks, that's not...

513
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:19,140
I do remember one of the first times I ever hung out with Brian, this is when I knew that

514
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:26,260
he was a real one, he ordered a double Jameson and water.

515
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,400
Yeah.

516
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:33,460
I was like, let me buy a drink, he's like yeah, let me have a double Jameson with water.

517
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,260
I was like, what?

518
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,180
With water?

519
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,300
Yeah.

520
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,100
and he's completely right dude that's the only way to drink whiskey

521
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,780
because otherwise it tastes disgusting

522
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:48,060
yeah well you're supposed to like water down

523
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:51,300
no you're not you're supposed to drink it i've been watching this fat guy on

524
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,300
uh... on youtube

525
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,480
his name

526
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,340
don't know his youtube channel name

527
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,460
bruzel

528
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,960
look it up b-r-e-w-z-e-l-e

529
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,540
kind of an application style name

530
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,020
he drinks so much whiskey out of a uh... they call it a glen

531
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:14,460
clay glen claren a glen caron

532
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,000
or a glen claren one of these two

533
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,700
well basically it's a cup

534
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,240
but it's very expensive

535
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,500
and he goes

536
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,560
like this and he smells it

537
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,820
and then he takes a sip and he'll drink in one video that he records at maybe

538
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,120
eleven a_m_

539
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,360
he'll drink probably

540
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
end of these.

541
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,720
Is he like reviewing the whole bottle or is he reviewing the bottle?

542
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,240
He's reviewing, he'll pour one of each bottle and be like, "Let's compare a Crown Apple with

543
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,140
Jack Tennessee Honey."

544
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,920
And then he'll take all of them.

545
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,020
And this guy's completely unfazed.

546
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,520
And this is the level I want to get to.

547
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,480
I want to be, this guy's easily 400 pounds or 500 or maybe 600.

548
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,620
He can barely move.

549
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:06,900
He looks like he's 70, but he's probably in his early 30s.

550
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,700
And he is drinking so heavily every single day for his job, and this sounds like paradise

551
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
to me.

552
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:19,020
Yeah, well, you know, to talk about drinkers and how you're completely right that people

553
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:26,580
hate drinking so much, that most of the world, I don't know if you know this, is a sober gopher.

554
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:32,820
So much so that they'll have complete events where they don't even have an ounce of drink.

555
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,900
What are you talking about?

556
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:42,700
So a day or two after you guys had the most legendary, most drinking awesome liquor, eating

557
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:50,420
awesome meat night, my presence was needed at this wedding.

558
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:53,580
Oh I forgot about this.

559
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,780
Christian wedding between a Christian woman and a normal guy.

560
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
A normal guy?

561
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,780
Yeah, he wasn't anything.

562
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,780
So he was also Christian?

563
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,780
No, he was really scared about most of the event, I was told.

564
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:15,780
They didn't allow anyone to bring their significant other, I was told.

565
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:18,780
No one was allowed to bring their kid.

566
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,780
And you were not allowed to drink.

567
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,180
And also I found out later that you also are not allowed to dance, which is crazy.

568
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,780
What are they, Mormon?

569
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,980
That's not a wedding, man.

570
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,740
I know. And I got there and first of all-

571
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,740
I'm fighting you in a celebration, that's a punishment.

572
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,020
I was really sad about this because I had rented a suit for this and I didn't know we're doing

573
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,820
suits for Liquors We Enjoyed until two hours beforehand and it was like a day before I got

574
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:49,140
my suit so I was like, "Fuck, I can't do anything about this so I'm just gonna do a funny joke."

575
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:56,660
So I got my suit, it fit weird because I don't have any thing in this apartment apparently.

576
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,980
What? It fit weird because you don't have any thing?

577
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,660
I don't have a belt, I don't have a-

578
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,300
Yeah you know the thing.

579
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,460
I don't have fresh shoes, I don't have socks.

580
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,420
Oh okay, oh I see.

581
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,140
I don't have like an undershirt for my-

582
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,020
You just rented the suit?

583
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,060
Yeah, pretty much.

584
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:19,300
Well I asked for shoes and they were like, "Okay, what's your size?"

585
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,980
I tell him I was like, oh no, we don't and I still have to pay the full amount even though

586
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,860
the I didn't get any shoes.

587
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Which was really sad.

588
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,520
But anyways, like that's beside the point.

589
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:30,520
I get there.

590
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:32,580
I'm going to kind of uncomfortable suit.

591
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:36,100
I'm going to make it a goal next year that I'm going to actually be a grown up and buy

592
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:40,660
myself a suit that actually fits me.

593
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
We get there.

594
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,660
The place is really nice.

595
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:46,460
It's like a like a in a building that you wouldn't really think that's like an event

596
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,540
venue building.

597
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:54,380
It's in a complete building, it's at the top of the building, you can see the awesome city.

598
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,340
And we get there, well the ceremony is still going on, so it's a little quiet, a little

599
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,340
hush.

600
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:06,820
And then it starts and the only thing that happens during the wedding is they opened

601
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:10,420
like this, like the dessert table, and all the kids that were actually brought to the

602
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:18,060
wedding, everyone like ignored that, just rushed in and just ate a bunch of candy basically.

603
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:25,100
TV host type event host type beat showed up and just like quizzed the the the

604
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:28,500
couple and then we had dinner and that was it.

605
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,000
Oh dude. That was the entire wedding and then a crazy monster came out and

606
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:44,140
scared me. What? Wait really? It was the monster that I sent you guys. A monster scared you? At the wedding?

607
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,260
He did.

608
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
That's awful.

609
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,940
Yeah, so basically, I had just a horrible night.

610
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
There's a monster.

611
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,580
Oh wow, it's the mask.

612
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,620
Yeah the monster was coming after me.

613
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:00,940
Yeah, so the mask came after me and I didn't drink anything.

614
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,540
I just had made dinner and we left.

615
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,100
I was like, wow, that was so much fun.

616
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,260
Thank you for the update.

617
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,340
I had a question.

618
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:10,180
I did not know that you took that photo.

619
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,540
You sent it to us and I thought it was just a photo you found.

620
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,540
Yeah.

621
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,900
Can you send me that that might be one of the funniest pictures I've ever seen in my entire life

622
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:21,000
The fact that they that Mexican wedding

623
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,380
They have no drinking but they hired somebody to come dress up like big head Tony Hawk Pro Skater big head version of the mask

624
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,640
Yeah, and they you know, there was there was like no dancing like throughout the night

625
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,700
But then I'm the little like the band and like the show came in and was like, oh, yeah

626
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:42,380
Let's just start dancing a little bit while this is happening. But this was this like started like midnight

627
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:49,340
When the Tony Hawk big head guy came out and the wedding was over at 1 a.m

628
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,300
So it was like it was like the last thing

629
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:59,620
Or one hour that was what they had for fun is for one hour. They had the mask come out. Yeah, did he say anything?

630
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:02,140
No, he was just dancing

631
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:09,060
He was the only one allowed to dance no, no everyone's like get up and dance because it was like a band

632
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,420
Okay, so they said no dancing as a prank.

633
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,540
Yeah, I don't know. It was a really weird event.

634
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,980
Alright, which wedding was better, that one or mine?

635
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:23,300
Definitely yours. Yours was so much fun.

636
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:28,020
Oh my god, most of my friends were there. Best wedding ever, yeah?

637
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:32,020
Most of my friends were there. Best wedding ever!

638
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:36,140
The burgers were delicious. We had burgers on my... Listen, I'm working class.

639
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:41,140
The celebs as far as the eye could see. There were so many celebs that left after half an hour.

640
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:46,140
But it's whatever. Yep, they had to go man. They had to go. They can't be seen with people like you.

641
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:50,140
Yep. Brian almost fought a celeb that actually stayed the entire night.

642
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:54,140
We're not going to go into detail on who that was. It was Adam Friedland.

643
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:58,140
He always fought him because over the DJing rights.

644
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,140
The rights to DJ. Ok, I'm actually going to... Because Brian wanted to play real music

645
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:05,140
and Adam wanted to play Cha-Cha Swing.

646
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,400
(laughing)

647
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,080
- So Caleb test Adam--

648
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:13,340
- Brandon Widdle was not invited to my wedding.

649
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:16,260
- So Caleb test Adam Freeland with a playlist

650
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,180
with the DJing of the wedding.

651
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,020
And Brian--

652
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,140
- Which by the way, he called me,

653
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,900
can I just say, he probably called me

654
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:25,380
in the three days before the wedding 25 times.

655
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,300
- Yeah.

656
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,300
- Because he was like so stressed out about DJing,

657
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,380
about making a playlist for the wedding

658
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:36,380
and i said man it's ok we already have a playlist you don't have to really even make one

659
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,580
i was just joking he was like no dude

660
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:44,700
like what kind of music are people gonna wanna listen to what's gonna get people on the dance floor

661
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,260
there was no dancing at your wedding either to be honest

662
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,360
none

663
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,860
there was more of a hangout

664
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,500
it was kind of like a hanging out

665
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,060
chilling type beat

666
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:03,560
Everyone just got drunk really fast because Noah didn't tell anyone to water down the drinks that he made.

667
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:10,560
Noah made it. Noah poisoned everybody. He made two drinks. One which was delicious and one that tasted like cough syrup.

668
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,560
And he said water it down at the beginning of the night and then everybody showed up and he forgot to tell them all.

669
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:21,560
Yeah, I guess he told you and your wife. He never told anyone else.

670
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:27,160
He would just watch people pour it and you would have your glass with the drink and some

671
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,160
ice in it and he would be like "Yo, what are you doing?"

672
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,160
I'm like "What?

673
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
I'm trying to drink the thing."

674
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
He's like "You're supposed to water it down."

675
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:37,800
I'm like "Oh, okay, why am I doing this?"

676
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,080
So we all got poisoned.

677
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
This is like the second time.

678
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:45,440
We all got drunk and then there was a line for burgers.

679
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,440
We were so good.

680
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
That was so fire.

681
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
Because everyone was so drunk already.

682
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,560
Everyone got drunk in 20 minutes, they were all hungry.

683
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:59,560
And then there was a big beef over the DJing rights.

684
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:06,120
Well it was not so much the DJing rights, it was Brian got drunk and he brought a really

685
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:14,080
shitty Chinese speaker and then everyone was drunk, Adam was drunk, he wanted to DJ on Brian's

686
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:18,400
speaker he thought he called it a piece of a Chinese piece of shit and he hit it

687
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,760
with his foot and that got Brian so hit it the entire night Brian was so

688
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:32,280
mad I was like fuck this guy that has a fucking piece of shit and I'm with

689
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:36,840
Brian and his girlfriend and he's like yeah he called this shit he called my

690
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:41,160
speaker like a Chinese piece of shit I mean he's right it is but like you can't

691
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:46,160
say that about my speaker and then Brian just displayed the most insane like

692
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,160
Houston rap that I've ever heard in my entire life. In the Uber on our way to the bar after the wedding.

693
00:37:53,160 --> 00:38:05,080
That's what he does man. But yeah man, I think that's if you're gonna have a wedding man, weddings are people show up to weddings wanting good food and free drinks and

694
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:10,040
unlimited free drinks so that's really all that you need to a wedding is not for

695
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:14,240
you. You are not doing a wed... there's no reason to do a wedding for yourself. The

696
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:21,560
core thing is enough for you. So the wedding is about have making... basically

697
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:25,160
paying back your friends for all the times that you had to bring your

698
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,600
girlfriend to stuff and they didn't know. And then now it's your wife so they

699
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,360
can't say anything. So you're paying them back for that. Exactly. That's basically

700
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:38,720
what a wedding is. So you're saying here's a bunch of free food, here's a

701
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:50,800
a bunch of free alcohol. And if I can bring my wife anywhere I want now. And also please

702
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,040
get me a gift. By the way, Brian, best gift of the night. Fake Rolex. Best gift of the

703
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,120
night man. Well, it's really big and I'm embarrassed to bring it into one of the people to try

704
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,920
to get the size change. And also I don't want to get robbed. I don't want to get killed in

705
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:13,920
a robbery for a fake Rolex. It really introduced a lot more anxiety into my life than anything

706
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,840
else.

707
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:20,920
Also during this legendary night that was your wedding, you also walked up to me, the night

708
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:25,920
was almost done, you walked up to me, I think it was your cam, I can't remember now, I was

709
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,760
so drunk. Someone walks up to me like, "Yo, we voted and you were voted the second worst

710
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:38,760
per

711
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,760
Yeah, that is really funny.

712
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,760
That is really funny.

713
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
He was dressed up like a scarecrow y'all.

714
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
That's not true.

715
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,760
He was on some Halloween shit.

716
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,760
I was not.

717
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,760
Who was worse?

718
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,760
What?

719
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,760
Cause he said he was the second worst.

720
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,760
Worse than him? I don't remember.

721
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,760
Probably...

722
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
Hmm.

723
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,760
I don't know actually.

724
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,760
Do you remember who was worse?

725
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,960
I just know I wasn't, I was voted top bottom two.

726
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,400
I didn't even remember that Julio was like that badly dressed.

727
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,400
I don't even remember he was there.

728
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
I was there.

729
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,960
Yeah, I mean, first time hearing about it, but it sounds fun.

730
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Yeah.

731
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,040
Well, I'm glad I went to your wedding.

732
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,880
That was the best wedding I've ever been to.

733
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:36,120
But you know, it was also, it's also a horrible memory for me because it brings back so many

734
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,120
When are you gonna get married? When can I come down to Mexico and give a best man speech?

735
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:42,120
You can go to Mexico whenever you want, basically.

736
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,120
No, I'm only coming for a speech.

737
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:47,120
You can give a speech whenever you want.

738
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,120
Alright, I would give...

739
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,120
I would give... Oh my...

740
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,120
I would give such an amazing best man speech.

741
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,120
I would give the most amazing best man speech.

742
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
Yeah, there you go.

743
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,120
I would say, "This guy...

744
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,120
I'm his best man.

745
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:07,520
I met him about two years ago.

746
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,000
We used to play video games together and now he's in the ultimate video game marriage.

747
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,240
He's lost the video game of life.

748
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,240
He is completely lost.

749
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Hey, here's what I would say.

750
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,240
I would say, yeah, me and this guy used to play video games.

751
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,520
Hey buddy, it's game over for you.

752
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,520
Boom!

753
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,520
I thought you were married.

754
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,520
Ball and chain.

755
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:29,560
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.

756
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:45,560
That's

757
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,560
I was.

758
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,560
I also didn't give a speech.

759
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,560
And the worst dressed, but the best man.

760
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:02,560
You're wearing a huge sombrero that you bought on the way there.

761
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,560
I'm wearing a wedding dress. I'm trying to upstage your fiance.

762
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,560
Yeah.

763
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:12,560
And basically, I mean, if I gave a best man...

764
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,560
Dude, best man speech is the kind of thing that, to me personally, I would knock out of the park.

765
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,560
Yeah. Have you ever done it before?

766
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:25,560
No. I think I probably will do one at my brother's wedding, and I'm already kind of generating ideas for that.

767
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,560
Mm-hmm.

768
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:29,560
I'll probably do about 45 minutes at my brother's wedding.

769
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,920
I think it would be really funny to have you guys come out to Mexico and make you mingle

770
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,040
with my real life friends and family.

771
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:42,480
Yeah, I mean I can learn Spanish.

772
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,340
I honestly think if I tried really hard I could be completely 100% fluent in Spanish in about

773
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,720
three weeks.

774
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:52,800
So if you give me three weeks notice, I could study really really hard.

775
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,880
I could give you three weeks notice of when I'm getting married?

776
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
Yeah.

777
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,880
That's what I did.

778
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,500
seemed to work out fine. That is true. That is pretty much what I did.

779
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,300
You were like yeah I don't fucking know. I didn't know I was getting married man.

780
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:12,960
It was a fun time I'm glad I came out for that. But I would love to talk to your

781
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:21,560
abuela. Sure you can do that yeah. Yeah dude she's fine ain't she? Nope she's old and

782
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,360
She's tiny.

783
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,480
She's so small.

784
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,520
Here's how I go.

785
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,240
Hola abuelita.

786
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:33,400
Tu eres bonita.

787
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,040
Tu eres...

788
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,680
No butthole. You're not fat.

789
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,800
My dad speaks no English.

790
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,320
I think my sister speaks English.

791
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:48,440
My mom understands English. I think she also speaks it.

792
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,240
My godfather speaks English.

793
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:55,240
My dad, zero English, just nothing.

794
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,320
I think it would be so lovely to try to watch you talk to him.

795
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,160
- Hola, papacito.

796
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:04,280
Tu eres guapo.

797
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,880
- No, you don't get to risk

798
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,000
every single person in my family.

799
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,840
- Why not?

800
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,000
- You have to talk to him about normal stuff.

801
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,380
- Like how guapo he is.

802
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,680
That's normal?

803
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,520
- Yeah.

804
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,560
- That's the kind of, it's a love language.

805
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,060
that's a good conversation to have

806
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,000
in a romance language that's what it's called not a love language love language

807
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,560
is gift giving

808
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,140
yeah

809
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,820
I do that too

810
00:44:28,820 --> 00:44:31,320
you know what I'd bring him?

811
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:35,360
a big ass bottle of Don Julio and Yeho

812
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:39,120
and I would say listen man let's break down these language barriers right now

813
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:39,960
you and me

814
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:41,720
we're finishing this bottle

815
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,480
he doesn't drink

816
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,440
you and me right now he doesn't drink?

817
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,920
That's not my fucking bi- and he will- he will take one look at me and say, "You know what?

818
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,720
Tomorrow, I begin another sober gopher journey."

819
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,600
And he will say this in perfect English, "Tomorrow, my sober gopher journey re-begins."

820
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,000
And he's a very poetic guy.

821
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,280
"Tomorrow, my sober gopher journey re-begins, but tonight, this white boy is about to teach

822
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,520
me the secrets of the universe."

823
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,080
And me and him would sit under the stars, the Don Julio kind of sitting between us, we're

824
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,960
kind of tugging over it because we're so addicted.

825
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,960
Are we at the beach? Am I having a beach party?

826
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:22,960
Uh, yeah, you probably would. You'd probably go to Cabo. That's in Mexico.

827
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,960
It actually is, really? Yeah, it is.

828
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,960
Wait, I'm actually smart as fuck.

829
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,960
We would go to...

830
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,960
Hmm, Puerto Escondido. That's where we'd go. That's another place I know in Mexico.

831
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,960
Okay.

832
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:41,960
And me and him would sit there on the beach, and slowly his fingers would start climbing up my thigh.

833
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:48,960
and

834
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,620
in a major way

835
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,460
and then

836
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,860
you guys would be back at the wedding going

837
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,400
where's Caleb? where's my dad?

838
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,580
what the hell's going on here?

839
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,220
you come back

840
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:04,400
uh... he's he's kinda like grabbing

841
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,500
i have a wig on by the way to make him like me more

842
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,160
and he's like grabbing my hair and kinda like

843
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,940
he you know i there's no way to say this in a way that's not crass he's face fucking me on the

844
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,520
beach and i'm kinda like gagging

845
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,700
and uh...

846
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,700
Yeah, I mean the wedding would pretty much be over at that point.

847
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,700
I think I'm gonna have a Mexican wedding and a US wedding.

848
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,700
You don't want me hanging out with your daddy?

849
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,700
Not anymore, no.

850
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,700
Why the fuck not?

851
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,700
I don't want you to get yourself involved like that, in that type of way.

852
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:39,700
You think it would ruin my marriage, you are looking out for me, that is what a best man does.

853
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:41,700
That is why you're my best man.

854
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,700
Yep.

855
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,700
Thank you my friend, I appreciate you.

856
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,340
what would your American wedding be where would it be would it be a Bucky's yeah

857
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,840
Bucky's that'd be Vegas dude you got to do Vegas if you do yeah I heard really

858
00:46:55,840 --> 00:47:00,020
bad stuff about Vegas Vegas is is falling bad stuff about Vegas Vegas is not

859
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:05,620
falling nothing bad has happened in Vegas for a lot of decades bad stuff is

860
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:11,140
happening in Vegas Vegas is no over like what formula one is coming to Vegas and

861
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:14,340
and they have completely... no wait hang on

862
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:19,340
they've completely destroyed the strip. It's horrible to walk around it or even hang

863
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:19,860
out at it

864
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:25,860
at it at it. A lot of casinos are getting attacked by cyber hackers and getting

865
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,860
destroyed and exploded

866
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:30,620
That happened to one casino man! There's so many strikes about

867
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:33,820
working strikes about some shit I don't know

868
00:47:33,820 --> 00:47:38,020
You could probably talk to them in their native tongue and get them to get back to work

869
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:45,020
the

870
00:47:45,020 --> 00:47:48,140
I like, I don't know why people are hating on that dome dude.

871
00:47:48,140 --> 00:47:49,140
That dome is cool man.

872
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,660
That's one of the coolest things ever made.

873
00:47:53,660 --> 00:48:00,260
Easily, easily and that's something that in 50,000 years when society is completely over

874
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:04,580
and rebirth, people will be arguing about how we built that.

875
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:06,540
Like as if we do with the pyramids now.

876
00:48:06,540 --> 00:48:12,700
I'm gonna be so sad when the sphere gets destroyed by a jihad attack in a week.

877
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,700
The what gets destroyed?

878
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,700
Are you being racist on the show?

879
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:19,700
Are you taking my bit and being racist to end the show?

880
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,700
No, you can do it. You can do it.

881
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:26,700
I will say I saw one of the craziest headlines of my entire reading career today.

882
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,700
Which was, uh...

883
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:35,700
It was, "Israel confirms that missile was of Islamic origin."

884
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:39,700
I was like...

885
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,700
What?

886
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:46,700
It is crazy that they're like, yeah, this is from some new guy.

887
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,300
It's called Islamic Jihad.

888
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,300
Islamic origin?

889
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,300
They can tell?

890
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:56,740
They can tell what religion the missile was?

891
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:57,740
Anyway, I'm sorry.

892
00:48:57,740 --> 00:48:59,660
I don't want to go into all that.

893
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:00,660
This is an awful tragedy.

894
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:01,660
Yeah, let's talk about all that.

895
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:04,740
But it's completely awesome that's going, that war zone is happening in real life.

896
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:12,260
I will say, man, I picked a bad week to quit the national defense business to start doing

897
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:19,260
sketch comedy. I said this week, I said to my wife, I said, listen, I said last week,

898
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:25,540
there's been no wars in so long, this is a bunk ass, boo boo ass industry, I'm getting

899
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:31,500
out of this shit. I'm moving over to sketch comedy. There's no future in this shit. Wars

900
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:38,500
are over man, we have AI doing insane stuff. And she said, okay, you can quit your job.

901
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:43,020
and right as I do man, shit pops off.

902
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:44,420
I'm sorry man.

903
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,500
I could have been rich man, I could have gone back to the Korean BBQ place but for now I'm

904
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,980
gonna have to settle for...

905
00:49:50,980 --> 00:49:55,220
You know those General Dynamics guys were looking at their phone popping cigars on the golf

906
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,380
course the moment they saw...

907
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:02,500
They're like looking at that video of like the Hamas guys coming down and they're even

908
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,420
more excited about it than the 17 year old lad on Twitter.

909
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:11,940
For them it's King Kong vs Godzilla in the reverse sense. Whoever wins we win.

910
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:15,420
Yeah. Whoever wins we win because it's great cinema.

911
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:19,420
Yeah, exactly. Because we get a bunch of cool movies out of this basically.

912
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:25,420
Have you seen the cool dope ass Godzilla or King Kong game?

913
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:27,420
The new King Kong game?

914
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:31,420
I saw the one like for everybody about it that there's a at some point in like a cutscene

915
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:38,420
the

916
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,420
Popped out with the White Claw Surge Blood Orange guys.

917
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:43,420
Highly recommend this flavor.

918
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:46,420
Um, yeah, people are saying, guys...

919
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:51,420
You know I try to stay away from incendiary topics.

920
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,420
Yeah.

921
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:53,420
If there's one thing you know about me.

922
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,420
That is true.

923
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,420
But, people are saying this King Kong game is the new Gollum.

924
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:01,420
Yeah, people are saying that.

925
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:05,420
And apparently Gollum was some other game that looked pretty awful.

926
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,420
Yeah.

927
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:18,860
a

928
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:23,060
made a video about who should kill themselves. Dream.

929
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,840
That's true. That's true.

930
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,640
That guy should kill himself.

931
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:33,140
I do think, honestly, I think that Dunkey is probably one of the ten best culture critics

932
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:35,840
of the last twenty years.

933
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,760
He's got a certain...

934
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,320
He has a certain funny voice he does.

935
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:48,560
He's got kind of a funny fat guy voice that is very distinctive.

936
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:55,840
I love him dude. He's gotta be the only guy that I liked when I was 13 that I still like 10 years later.

937
00:51:55,840 --> 00:52:04,240
Have you seen his videos where his girlfriend or his wife just makes him be in her videos and they're playing like tea?

938
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:06,460
Tea?

939
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:12,080
Yeah, they're just playing around with a tea set and he's like "oh whatever" being cute. Have you never seen those?

940
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:16,240
I've never seen that. I do not want to muddy my image of Dunkey.

941
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:18,240
After I saw that I was like, you know what?

942
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,640
Dunkey's over for me.

943
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,840
I'm moving over.

944
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,040
I like to imagine he is like fat Yoshi.

945
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,740
He's kind of like that.

946
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,740
He kind of is, yeah.

947
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,740
He's full he is, yeah.

948
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:31,740
But he's got a soft side that he never lets on

949
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,240
on his sharp critique videos

950
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:35,740
of like fucking...

951
00:52:35,740 --> 00:52:37,740
He bodies games left and right, man.

952
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:38,740
Yeah.

953
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:41,740
If you're thinking of making a bad game,

954
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,740
you better think twice

955
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,740
because Dunkey has you in his crosshairs

956
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:46,740
And he's a damn good aim.

957
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:50,740
I've moved past Dunkey. I think he's cringe now. I watch different shit.

958
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,740
Don't you think Dunkey is cringe?

959
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,740
I think Dunkey is cringe. I watch different shit.

960
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:56,740
What are you watching now, dude? Don't tell me you watch Nakey Jakey, man.

961
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,740
No, I also think he's cringe.

962
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:01,740
He's kinda, he's cringe, yeah.

963
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,740
I watch Yonskas.

964
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:03,740
What are you watching now?

965
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:06,740
He watches Yonskas.

966
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,740
I don't watch Yonskas.

967
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:17,640
been watching this YouTube channel called Game Ranks which is just some guy, it's one

968
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:25,820
guy but he pretends it's like a website like IGN and I love when guys are, it's a YouTube

969
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:31,020
channel with one single dude and then they keep saying like, yeah we over here at Game

970
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:37,580
Ranks are gonna give this game a 3.

971
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,580
That's awesome dude.

972
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:47,580
and

973
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:54,020
I'm watching the lovely channel where he talks about the drama.

974
00:53:54,020 --> 00:53:55,020
What is it called?

975
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:56,020
Mogul mail man.

976
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:59,740
I've been thinking about making one of these YouTube channels.

977
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:00,740
You should.

978
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:02,600
I love your takes on the news.

979
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:06,380
Whatever the biggest news story that is not a news story.

980
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,380
That's the thing.

981
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:13,580
The last couple of days I've been watching opening up my YouTube and oh a hospital gets

982
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:19,160
completely destroyed 500 people are dead in Gaza and I open YouTube top thing

983
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:25,620
some ordinary gamers is like this is officially the worst game ever

984
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,620
I love that guy, that guy is so funny

985
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:36,620
I think there might be something maybe slightly more important that you could make a video on right now

986
00:54:36,620 --> 00:54:40,120
I love how he can go like over like 30 seconds without going like

987
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,120
Ladies and gentlemen, this fucking sucks.

988
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:45,120
Ladies and gentlemen, this game is just complete shit.

989
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:47,120
I think that I can make these videos, man.

990
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,120
Give me any topic, I'll make a video on it right now.

991
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:53,120
Um, the war on Ukraine.

992
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,120
It needs to be the kind of thing that they would handle, though.

993
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,120
It needs to be like, Blueface and Krushan broke up.

994
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,120
That type of shit.

995
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,120
Okay, so the King Kong game looks like shit,

996
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:05,120
and people are calling for its cancellation.

997
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:09,400
uh... some what's up youtube it's caleb

998
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:12,360
pits nineteen ninety seven back here with another video

999
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:13,800
right after this intro

1000
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,760
uh...

1001
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,480
uh...

1002
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,340
i want to say

1003
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:20,760
i want to interrupt

1004
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,880
intros are done

1005
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
intersects now

1006
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,920
uh...

1007
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,240
is that true

1008
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,640
i'm not so sure

1009
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:33,280
this youtube channel called mom reviews movies it's

1010
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:34,560
It's this old woman who...

1011
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,840
You would be watching bomb reviews movies.

1012
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,720
No, hang on. Wait a second.

1013
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:42,240
She is an old woman who lives in Vegas

1014
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,880
who records all her videos through Zoom.

1015
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,720
So you can see on the corner of her video,

1016
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,240
there's always her full name.

1017
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,720
That's sweet.

1018
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,720
With horrible audio, horrible like Zoom audio.

1019
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,480
She's talking about the sound of freedom.

1020
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,880
Be like, "Oh, this movie was so inspiring," or whatever.

1021
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:00,680
And she has an intro that is so loud.

1022
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,200
I really want to reach out and be like,

1023
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:08,120
Like you know what, you're doing great, I love your takes, especially on this pedophile movie.

1024
00:56:08,120 --> 00:56:09,120
Drop the intro.

1025
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:13,160
I think she stands to gain so much if she just drops the intro.

1026
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,800
And we can talk about the zoom and all that shit later.

1027
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,280
The intro is cringe now.

1028
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:18,280
Intros are cringe.

1029
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:24,600
Why does everybody, everybody seems to have YouTube algorithms that show them funny videos

1030
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:28,760
of people making disgusting food or people who don't know how to use a computer.

1031
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:35,120
In my- all the videos that I get on YouTube are actually made for 10 year olds.

1032
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:39,720
Like I don't get anything- there is no skibbity- I've seen every skibbity toilet and I'm up

1033
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
to episode 56.

1034
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,880
Well that's probably why.

1035
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:47,880
Every single- everybody I know is like "dude check out this video I found earlier of a

1036
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:54,120
guy who's trying to fuck a watermelon" and I'm like "oh man that's cool, let's check

1037
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:58,720
out my YouTube" and it's like "top 10 times Naruto was out of pocket".

1038
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,720
What is wrong with me?

1039
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,720
Why is it only my videos that are like this?

1040
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:06,720
It's you.

1041
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,720
No, I know it's me, that's what I mean.

1042
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,720
It's an awful reflection of the kind of thing that I watch when nobody's around.

1043
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:17,720
When I went back to meet my girlfriend's family,

1044
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,720
her brother's best friend got a DUI, college, couldn't get a job,

1045
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,720
and so his job now is making those videos.

1046
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,720
Really?

1047
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:33,240
He's like very clearly like kind of ashamed about it.

1048
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,560
Here's mine dude, here's my YouTube front page right now.

1049
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:43,640
10 games that died trying to expand their audience.

1050
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:46,640
Historic food preservation, potted salmon.

1051
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:51,280
Make tortillas like a Mexican grandma.

1052
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:54,140
The story of America's most corrupt cop.

1053
00:57:54,140 --> 00:58:01,140
I went bourbon hunting for old Forrester birthday bourbon.

1054
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,260
What is this?

1055
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:06,700
I don't want to say that one.

1056
00:58:06,700 --> 00:58:07,700
Say it.

1057
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:11,060
You have to say it now.

1058
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:15,780
Six common pitfalls in healing childhood trauma.

1059
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,100
What are you looking up on YouTube man?

1060
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,100
Nothing dude.

1061
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,100
See, this is more me. Mortal Kombat 1 Official Omni-Man First Look.

1062
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:29,100
That's my kind of thing. I'll click on that. I'll click on that shit.

1063
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:34,100
I've got "Family Guy Season 15 Episode 17"

1064
00:58:34,100 --> 00:58:38,100
Okay, so we're on the same page then, you and me.

1065
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:42,100
I had a feeling it would be you and me on the same exact...

1066
00:58:42,100 --> 00:58:45,100
Hot potato, thunder kick, new slot, first look.

1067
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,100
Yeah, well I skipped a lot of slot stuff, I'm gonna be real.

1068
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:54,720
Yeah, I got a sky bounty was one that I had got a lot of music got some like tft videos wait

1069
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,640
Actually now that you brought this up. I remember that you're a big family guy big Rick and Morty type of guy

1070
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,760
What is your official review on Rick and Morty season 7 episode 1?

1071
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,700
It's actually funny you say that because I did watch the episode really

1072
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,560
I

1073
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:14,660
Haven't watched it in so long that I couldn't tell the difference

1074
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,260
Really? Wow. You didn't even tell that it wasn't even Justin Roiland and the other guy?

1075
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,760
I didn't think about it that hard because I don't care.

1076
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:27,060
I did think it's funny that it says that he did make the show. He's still in the credits.

1077
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:31,260
Because they're like, it's like created by Justin Roiland.

1078
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,760
It's like created by Justin Roiland. Yeah, literally.

1079
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:35,260
Separate the art from the artist.

1080
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:38,260
The episode was not very good.

1081
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,920
It's just it kind of just seems like they're on the downswing on the show.

1082
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:50,640
Yeah I just I saw through the people were complaining and I saw that it's got a really bad

1083
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:59,120
audience score on Ryan. Well it's just not a very good episode like if I was for me Rick and Morty

1084
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:07,040
means like I smoked weed I got too high and I need something to like pacify me and if I got

1085
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:21,720
to

1086
01:00:21,720 --> 01:00:24,600
This is the last motherfucking thing I- you know what I used to do?

1087
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:25,600
I'm not kidding.

1088
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,680
For two months in college, I used to rip a vape pen every single night and watch alternating

1089
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:34,880
Borat and Freddy Got Fingered.

1090
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:36,880
Every single night.

1091
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,400
Every fucking- every single night for two months.

1092
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,160
I watched Borat and then I watched Freddy Got Fingered.

1093
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,400
And then I watched Borat and Freddy Got Fingered.

1094
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,040
And I would do that- and I would do this thing where I would laugh so hard at a joke in one

1095
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:55,080
or the other that I would miss 30 minutes of the movie because I would fall off of my bed

1096
01:00:55,080 --> 01:01:00,400
laughing so hard and then I would get back up and watch. I've seen both of those movies

1097
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,920
30 times at least. In my head, I was picturing this, you were just watching like 10 minutes

1098
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,760
of Borat and then be like okay, now the other one. Then you watch it like 5 minutes and

1099
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:15,840
then going back. I probably did that 4 or 5 times too. That's awesome. I probably did

1100
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:29,520
I'm

1101
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,520
I stopped watching TV in the shower as well.

1102
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:32,520
My whole life is just...

1103
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:33,520
Woah!

1104
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:34,520
What?

1105
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,120
I'm not saying "Why'd you stop?"

1106
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:40,520
But what as if you were watching television in the shower?

1107
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,020
We've been over this multiple times.

1108
01:01:42,020 --> 01:01:43,020
Why did you stop?

1109
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:44,020
I don't remember this.

1110
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:45,020
I just kinda just stopped.

1111
01:01:45,020 --> 01:01:47,020
It just doesn't feel right anymore.

1112
01:01:47,020 --> 01:01:48,520
Oh man, I'm sorry.

1113
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:51,020
It was such an enjoyable thing.

1114
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,520
I think I don't like my shower this much here.

1115
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:55,520
Do you have a bath?

1116
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:56,520
I do.

1117
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:59,020
I highly recommend baths, my friend.

1118
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:02,500
Yeah, I might do that because it's just been...

1119
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,500
I...

1120
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,700
When you bathe in New York City, and then you get out of the shower...

1121
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,780
You feel dirty already.

1122
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:18,060
Man, don't blame the city you live in, please, because you have a disgusting apartment.

1123
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,060
Wait, what does that mean?

1124
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,060
Is your phone in your fucking room?

1125
01:02:22,060 --> 01:02:24,060
No, it's like you go outside...

1126
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:28,060
Because I get out of my bath and I say, "Oh, I've been transported to some kind of 19th century home."

1127
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:35,060
the

1128
01:02:35,060 --> 01:02:36,060
you're already dirty.

1129
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:37,060
What's wrong with your bed?

1130
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:38,060
What are you talking about?

1131
01:02:38,060 --> 01:02:39,060
What's wrong with your bed?

1132
01:02:39,060 --> 01:02:40,060
You're not sweating in your sleep?

1133
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:41,060
No!

1134
01:02:41,060 --> 01:02:42,060
Not in fall, not in October.

1135
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,060
Oh, you're just at the perfect temperature all the time, I'm sorry.

1136
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,060
No, maybe I'm a little cold, but I'm not sweating.

1137
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:45,060
You want to sleep cold rather than sleeping warm?

1138
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,060
Yes, of course I want to sleep cold.

1139
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,060
You sleep better when you're cold.

1140
01:02:47,060 --> 01:02:48,060
I want to sleep cold.

1141
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:49,060
I love sleeping cold.

1142
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:50,060
Yeah.

1143
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,060
I love sleeping cold.

1144
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,060
I love sleeping cold.

1145
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,060
I love sleeping cold.

1146
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,060
I love sleeping cold.

1147
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:55,060
I love sleeping cold.

1148
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,060
I love sleeping cold.

1149
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,060
I love sleeping cold.

1150
01:02:57,060 --> 01:02:58,060
I love sleeping cold.

1151
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,060
I love sleeping cold.

1152
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:00,060
I love sleeping cold.

1153
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:03,060
Yes, of course I want to sleep cold. You sleep better when you're cold.

1154
01:03:03,060 --> 01:03:05,060
I want to sleep cold. I love sleeping cold.

1155
01:03:05,060 --> 01:03:08,060
I leave my windows open all winter, man.

1156
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:11,060
Yeah, you're being a little odd, Rex.

1157
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:13,060
You are being odd.

1158
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:25,060
You're saying that the city is so disgusting that you get out of your bath into your bathroom, by the way, which is about three degrees removed from the city, and you feel dirty.

1159
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:33,340
dirty? No, what I mean, first of all, I shower like in the morning or like midday.

1160
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:39,820
Okay. Maybe I shower after I get off work, but it's before going out.

1161
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:44,820
And then I go out and I'm like, you know, I'm all dressed up.

1162
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,740
I'm either too cold or I'm sweating.

1163
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:53,580
Do you have like a winding down routine when you're in your day?

1164
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:58,100
like brush your teeth, uh, no, look at the clock for like two hours.

1165
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,740
I would never brush my teeth, but I probably would watch a YouTube video called

1166
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:06,900
"The Dark History Behind Skibbity Toilet". It's about four and a half hours long.

1167
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,860
Fall asleep to that every night. Yeah, I do...

1168
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:18,180
what I do is I walk into my bedroom, uh, and I say, uh, "Alexa, turn off my light.

1169
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:22,900
Alexa, turn on American Dad." And then I dance to that. I've seen you do that.

1170
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:23,400
Yeah.

1171
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,000
I've seen you do that. It's honestly a miracle of modern technology.

1172
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,700
It's probably my favorite thing in the world.

1173
01:04:28,700 --> 01:04:30,300
Wait, why have you seen him do his wind-down routine?

1174
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:33,400
When I went over there the other night, he said, this was his...

1175
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,000
He was like, "You wanna see my room?"

1176
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:36,000
I was like, "Yeah, dude."

1177
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:41,000
We walked in and he immediately said, "Alexa, turn off the light. Alexa, turn on American Dad."

1178
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,000
And I was like, "That was too automatic. This is... He does this every single day."

1179
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:47,400
Every single day.

1180
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:49,300
It's the best, dude.

1181
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:55,100
You could say, "Turn the lights at 20%."

1182
01:04:55,100 --> 01:04:56,300
It does it for you.

1183
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,600
Turn the American Dad at 110.

1184
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,600
Yep. Turn the volume up. Turn the lights to green.

1185
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:03,600
Turn the lights to green. Turn the weed on.

1186
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,100
Turn that motherfucking American Dad all the way up. Crank that shit.

1187
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,600
Yeah, make the TV really bright.

1188
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:13,600
Yeah, well I had to stop. I had to wait on Family Guy. I'm on season 15.

1189
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:20,100
I'm catching up. I gotta get to at least where they replaced Cleveland Brown with a black man.

1190
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:26,740
season 20. They replaced him with the guy who sang the the Cleveland. That's one of

1191
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:31,140
the most amazing come ups of all time. Kudos to that guy. That guy's the GOAT.

1192
01:05:31,140 --> 01:05:37,500
I was talking about this the other day which is that like that song is amazing.

1193
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:45,540
Which song? That's just a thing you can make with AI now and it takes 30 minutes.

1194
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:49,660
Yeah I was gonna ask you do you think that Rick and Morty is one of the

1195
01:05:49,660 --> 01:05:52,860
shows that can just be written by AI and no one would notice?

1196
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,860
It probably already is.

1197
01:05:54,860 --> 01:05:56,860
Yeah.

1198
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:58,860
They probably, I feel like

1199
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:00,860
most stories now,

1200
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,860
forever,

1201
01:06:02,860 --> 01:06:04,860
will, I mean I guess they

1202
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,860
did sign that like agreement or whatever

1203
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,860
but like anything that's not

1204
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,860
under that, like any book

1205
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:12,860
from now on, you're just gonna put

1206
01:06:12,860 --> 01:06:14,860
in your little plot points

1207
01:06:14,860 --> 01:06:16,860
and then you're just gonna have it

1208
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:18,860
spit out filler and then

1209
01:06:18,860 --> 01:06:21,780
you're just gonna edit it and ship it out.

1210
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,100
- Yeah, it's that simple.

1211
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:24,940
We should be doing that with this podcast.

1212
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:25,780
- We should. - We should.

1213
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:27,500
- I think we could.

1214
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:28,420
- All right, next episode,

1215
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:30,860
a fully artificial intelligence episode.

1216
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,660
We're gonna get a script.

1217
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,020
Or maybe at least the beers.

1218
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:35,780
We'll at least have AI pick the beer.

1219
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:36,940
Can we agree to this?

1220
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:37,780
- Okay, yeah.

1221
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:40,940
AI picks the beer and rates the beer.

1222
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,340
- Okay, sounds good.

1223
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,340
- All right.

1224
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:47,580
Thank you for watching. - Okay, my feathered friends.

1225
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,140
I do outros and intros, but very nice try, Jubio.

1226
01:06:50,140 --> 01:06:51,140
Oh, okay.

1227
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,140
[laughter]

1228
01:06:52,140 --> 01:06:57,020
Thank you to all of my drinking friends, all of my sober gophers.

1229
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,180
I love you all.

1230
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:02,140
This has truly been one of the greatest experiences of my short life.

1231
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:09,100
I hope all of you have an amazing weekend, and what can I say but keep drinking.

1232
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:11,460
And thank you all for watching, and see you next week.

1233
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,960
Nope, nice try.

1234
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:13,960
Thank you all for watching.

1235
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:14,960
We'll see you next week.

1236
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,660
And thank you all for watching, and see you next week.

1237
01:07:16,660 --> 01:07:19,060
Okay, I'm just gonna thank you for watching.
