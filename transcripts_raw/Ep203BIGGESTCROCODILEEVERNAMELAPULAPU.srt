1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:10,020
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,840
(laughing)

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,040
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,880
- Okay.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,700
- Okay.

9
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,000
- I'll stop riding my bike here before we do this.

10
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,960
I come in here and I'm just like drenched in sweat.

11
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,280
- I looked at the, I looked at your bike

12
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,680
when I was walking in earlier.

13
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,520
- Yeah.

14
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,640
- And it was sitting so, the seat,

15
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,480
the black leather seat was sitting so perfectly in the sun

16
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,560
that when you sit back down on it,

17
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,000
it's gonna brand the logo of the bike seat into your ass.

18
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
- Good, I need that.

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,040
- It's gonna get so fucking hot.

20
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,880
- Yeah.

21
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,680
- You are gonna have a red, pink ass.

22
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,000
- Good. - No spanks.

23
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
- I need that right now.

24
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,640
- You're gonna have a pink ass, no spanking.

25
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,000
- Dude, I'm so sweaty.

26
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,360
Or like, it just started hitting me.

27
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,840
- It's so hot outside.

28
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,320
- We need an AC in here.

29
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,700
- I gave up on being clean yesterday.

30
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,040
I just sweated up.

31
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,160
- Yeah.

32
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,840
- I sweat through my headphones.

33
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,680
- Me too.

34
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,200
- My headphones have a canvas outer thing

35
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,520
and it started to smell like a gym sock.

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,000
And so I think I might have to throw away my headphones.

37
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,120
- Damn. - Yeah.

38
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:07,600
- I think you can easily replace that.

39
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,840
- No, I think they have to just completely

40
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,720
go into the trashcan pretty soon.

41
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,540
- Yeah. - I went,

42
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,040
I skated yesterday for like three hours

43
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,040
and I don't think I've ever felt

44
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,800
the back of a pair of shorts so wet.

45
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,720
- Yeah.

46
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,720
- Like it was like wet and they smelled salty.

47
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
You ever do, you ever sweat through a pair of jeans?

48
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,720
Dude, yeah.

49
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:30,720
That's hard to do.

50
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:34,960
Before the show on Thursday, I had to change my pants.

51
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,960
I have a photo.

52
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,960
Hold up.

53
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,200
I hope it's not mid-change because I do not want to see this goober's penis.

54
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,200
That sounds freaking disgusting.

55
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
It's not that.

56
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,160
No, it's just the back of my jeans and they're completely, it looks like I pissed out of

57
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,160
my ass.

58
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,160
Stop sagging.

59
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,160
It's disrespectful.

60
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,160
I'm not sagging.

61
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Look at how high those pants are up.

62
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,480
It's way too low, man.

63
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,480
Yeah, those are sagging.

64
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:56,480
You're completely sagging.

65
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,780
those are sagging doing a pale like halfway down your crack. Do you know

66
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,980
what that you know what that means in prison having a completely wet ass what

67
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:06,920
means that you beat yourself really haven't heard no I mean you were

68
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,240
standing with another guy and he peed he peed himself okay and it got on to you

69
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,680
yeah or that you sat in a puddle or you were sledding I would hate you know

70
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,840
what's the worst part of prison I hear is dropping the soap yeah yeah I hear

71
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:22,000
that that's not I don't remember why then you can't get clean because I just

72
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,800
hear that I hear that a really big problem in prison is just seriously just

73
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,100
dropping the soap on the ground. Yeah, yeah, because I the thing is it gets

74
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,320
soap completely dirty, because they don't have like body wash or anything.

75
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,040
Yeah, so you know you could take a shower. I don't have cells in blue and

76
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,400
I heard that I heard on prison. They don't wash themselves with soap. They

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,000
wash themselves with rope. Yeah, I heard it's rope. You think of soap on a

78
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,160
rope? Yeah, I heard they use the rope part. I heard if they're cleaning

79
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,760
that, and they're still like a watch. That's why they're incarcerated. It's

80
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,240
like a wash cloth. Oh, if it's a bad enough prison, like if it's like Alcatraz

81
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:57,040
like sing sing they make you wash yourself with an onion really is that

82
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,840
true I would hate to get a boiled onion trash I need to shut Alcatraz down I

83
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,040
know it needs to go it's fun you imagine I saw it can you imagine being in Alcatraz

84
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,720
right now you're you're so you're eating these horrible meals you're locked up

85
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,520
you can't get a family and then and then wash yourself excuse me Patrick and then

86
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:16,720
on top of that you are haunted by Al Capone's ghost yep that's right I would

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,240
like to they need to give those guys the Alcatraz needs one of those guys who has

88
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,480
iPhone in prison and makes TikToks. I saw the island. They used to have mac and cheese in the

89
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,120
food court, but it's COVID right now, so now they don't. They're just talking about prison and stuff.

90
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,400
I saw Alcatraz when I was in SF. I saw the island there. We all did.

91
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,840
We all saw Alcatraz. Oh yeah, we all did. Well, I went more recently and I saw it. It's changed

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,800
since then. The island's way bigger. It's changed since then. No, no, there was a dark cloud over it.

93
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:54,240
As if that's stands for what seriously fearsome for serious felony that he

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:59,360
commanded you in Alcatraz. Yeah, how did you wait? What were you doing around that Alcatraz prison?

95
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,200
Investigating the dark cloud likely story. What had it look like from behind bars?

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,240
You should there should be you should be able to do like a prison exchange program where you can

97
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:14,400
choose one like really cool prison you want to go to for like a month or so if you're like

98
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,080
imprisoned already yeah and you're in like a lame you if you're like a state

99
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:21,760
penitentiary yeah that'd be cool I want to go to Alcatraz for like a few days

100
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:28,520
where is sing sing I've heard of that in movies sing sing I don't know what

101
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,360
singing in Rikers and stow away Rikers Rikers is just like a reference or a

102
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,920
joke you're making that I didn't know no I don't know what sing sing is you they

103
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:47,000
should reopen Alcatraz as like the drunk tank we're like if you go they put you

104
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,840
on a raft and send you to Alcatraz for the night. That would be such a better

105
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,440
deterrent. Oh, Sing Sing is in New York. I would completely stop drunk driving in San

106
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:04,560
Francisco. It's in Austin-ing New York. Sing Sing? It's a maximum security prison.

107
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
I could get in.

108
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:14,960
Sing Sing's name comes from the Indian phrase "Sin Sink" which means stone on stone.

109
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,000
The thing about maximum security prisons is that it's stupid to call it maximum security

110
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,800
like you would never hear someone call a prison a minimum security prison.

111
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,520
We're sending you to minimum security prison.

112
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,420
Also I think that we need a further, we need an ultimate security prison.

113
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,300
says here in 1901 three years after Edison introduced the electric chair at

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:40,380
Sing Sing I didn't know he made the electric chair. He made everything electric.

115
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,420
Do you think he made the electric chair by accident?

116
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:49,260
You think he was trying to make like a... He was like okay let's see electric light bulb

117
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,220
yep okay telephone got it I guess like he's running out of ideas I guess a

118
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,060
it's a chair. Well, originally it was a plug in a chair. It was

119
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,620
just

120
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,560
chair.

121
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,560
He's looking at things around his room. I turn that electric. I

122
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,460
turn that like it killed the copyright royalties. Just really

123
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,900
start just drying up. We have the electric chair. Electric chair

124
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,700
ended up being a lot more useful than the electric table, which

125
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,420
was the other thing he invented the same day. You really it

126
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,900
really is like a like table that keeps your food hot, keeps it electric. It

127
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,220
kills anybody who's sitting on the

128
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:33,100
yeah, it's like a deterrent for cats. Yeah, it is so funny that electricity is

129
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,180
how they kill people. Yeah, that's yeah

130
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:41,700
like you might like what just do like a why not you just put them in a pool and

131
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:46,740
like put throw like a toaster in there or some electricity must feel cool,

132
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:47,060
though.

133
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:52,540
yeah I think you're electrocuted well you know I like you I've got a serious

134
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,020
electric you mean it kills you so you actually haven't been electrocuted

135
00:06:56,020 --> 00:07:03,940
oh in six grade up when we were learning about electricity my teacher mr. stith

136
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,660
mr. stiff yeah mr. stiff shit mr. stiff and he had like Tiffany he had like

137
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:16,860
moles on his head oh he's a nice guy I didn't know why I brought up the moles

138
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,120
(laughing)

139
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,460
But he taught us how to make,

140
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,780
it was like an electric hot dog cooker

141
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,300
and it's literally a piece of wood with two screws

142
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:30,540
that you drill two screws and then you take a frayed cable

143
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,100
and then put it on the screws.

144
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,580
And when I was in, I made one at home,

145
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,800
even though he told us not to, and I made it at home

146
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,980
and then I was trying to move the,

147
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,420
I think I touched the hot dog,

148
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,420
or I was trying to take it off of the thing

149
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,260
and then I touched both--

150
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,360
- Does it mean you were trying to eat it?

151
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,400
Yeah, no, I ate it after.

152
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,160
I'm not denying that I ate the hot dog.

153
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,040
No, no, I was trying to get the hot dog off so I could eat it.

154
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,440
And then I touched both of the screws and then went like,

155
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,280
(imitates gun firing)

156
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,320
and then like, it literally was as Looney Tunes as it could.

157
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,320
- Yeah, that happened to me with my Game Boy charger.

158
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
I touched my Game Boy charger prongs.

159
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,040
- When my dad had an outlet that was completely detached

160
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,560
from the wall for a really long time,

161
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,520
and one time I touched like the back of it,

162
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,760
and yeah, I remember just sitting there,

163
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,360
I remember it felt like a full minute of me just like,

164
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,360
huh, this is interesting.

165
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,080
I can't move my body at all.

166
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:18,920
And I'm--

167
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,600
- Dude, it's the craziest feeling.

168
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,960
- Yeah, I just feel like (mimics electric motor)

169
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,360
I'm seeing all my bones.

170
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,120
- Yeah. - They're blue.

171
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,320
- I had for a split second, I was like,

172
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,040
if anyone saw me do that,

173
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,560
would they have seen my blue bones?

174
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,920
- I think they do, right?

175
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,740
- Yeah.

176
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,180
- How much electricity needs to go through you

177
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,240
to see your blue bones?

178
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,120
Cameron, since you're such a fact lord.

179
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,120
- Yeah, well, I have to defend the word electrocution

180
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,480
it's the coolest word ever. No you don't. It means it's literally the combination of electro and

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:55,240
execution. Nope. And it's so cool and people trying to dilute that word. It needs to be awesome and it

182
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,040
needs to just mean that you are literally killed by electricity. You think Edison like advertised

183
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:05,160
the electric chair with like like it's like a like big like flyer in a newspaper. I don't think

184
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,000
it is. I think that thing sells itself. It's like like the word all the letters are like

185
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:14,840
lightning bolts. It's like electrocution! The new way to kill prisoners!

186
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,960
Yeah, you could send one dollar in this ad to one Thomas Edison Road

187
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:31,560
in Edison, New Jersey, and we will send you a full Nickelodeon video or Nickelodeon film.

188
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,880
A dollar would get you a prisoner back then, I think.

189
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:39,640
Yeah, well, you send them a dollar, they send you a Nickelodeon film strip of just a man just

190
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,800
just getting killed by the electric chair. I don't play that little like

191
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,000
doodoo. I don't believe that Thomas Edison invented electricity. No, it's

192
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,840
Nikola Tesla. It was Ben Franklin. I think that it was actually the ancient

193
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,000
indigenous people of the Aztec world. Yeah, yep, and I think that they

194
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,960
probably stored it in their hand. I think it was actually the electrians

195
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,600
that is that who I'm thinking of yeah, they were yeah. They were they're

196
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,880
basically things are made out of electricity really. They were indigenous

197
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:13,020
an electro land. Oh, and was that it's an electric island? Oh, okay, that's what we

198
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:17,120
call it nowadays. Yeah, the old name is something we can't even pretty much

199
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,700
because it's an electries. Yeah, they used to be called in their language. It's

200
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,020
called zip zap yeah and they and their own language. They call themselves

201
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:25,540
Pikachu.

202
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:31,900
What yeah yeah, they look like Pikachu. They do yeah, they just like my kind of

203
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,920
One of the most famous electrocution...

204
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
You know there's a country where...

205
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Electrocutors, what were they called?

206
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
What were we calling them?

207
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
Electroids.

208
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
One of the most famous electroids was a guy named...

209
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,920
And did you guys see there

210
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
who won the presidential

211
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,920
electrocution

212
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,920
electraction?

213
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Over there? Who?

214
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
Hal Sparks. Yeah.

215
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Just a guy.

216
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,880
yeah yeah that's not a real place. I really want to I would love to explore

217
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,580
every country in the world. I think I would really I think that we should go

218
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,280
to I don't know what there is there. I think we should go. I've been I've been

219
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:17,080
reading a book about about you guys to go camping in in like virgin forest or

220
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,580
whatever is where there's like no one has ever been. I feel like we should go

221
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:23,780
to an island or a forest where no human has ever set foot before and all of

222
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,380
can we plant a flag in it? Yes, okay, but then what if we discover a new animal

223
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:32,180
That would be incredible. But what if it has a million teeth? Then we would get it.

224
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,420
But what if it's a complete eater? Yeah, what if it's like a cat with a shark's mouth?

225
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,980
We could eat it before it eats us. Or we could bring a box to put it in.

226
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,020
Can we walk slowly at it like Elmer Fudd? Yeah.

227
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,180
And kill it? Well, if we've discovered a new--

228
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,300
Would you-- if you found a one-of-a-kind animal, would you kill it for no reason?

229
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,700
If it's running away. If it looked like a different--

230
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,500
If it looked like a different animal but then it turns out it's like a rare breed of some

231
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:07,300
like like it's like a deer with like okay a third antler it has giant giant eyes right

232
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:12,660
and a really sad face like it it's always like a frowner it always wants something

233
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,180
it's four legs and it's so cute it has it has a big big head and a little little tiny body

234
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:25,060
and he's covered in hair and he has no teeth is he running away from me and he's running away

235
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:29,860
and he's screaming for help. I kill him. Was that animal you and Simon made up? The

236
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:34,700
surpriser? The surpriser? Yeah. Yeah. Surpriser. I would not kill a surpriser.

237
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,180
You couldn't kill a surpriser because the surpriser would run away. Yeah you can't

238
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,780
kill a surpriser. It's pretty much impossible. It would run away to surprise you again. Yeah. I think I

239
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:49,300
would have been a way better God. Yeah. Than God. Yeah. I should play Spore. Spore

240
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,580

256
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,260
get that every day. Get you people try to kill me every day. I've talked about

257
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:14,940
Yeah, I've found a video of a guy. I found a YouTube channel where a guy

258
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:19,100
actually I think he's actually getting gang stalked. Yeah, because he what

259
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,580
he's posted video the other day of a guy who dresses a cowboy just following him

260
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:27,700
around. Damn, that's crazy. It's so crazy and he and then he went up to talk to

261
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,260
him and he was like hey man is there any particular reason why you've been

262
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:36,540
following me and then the cowboy guy goes I think you've been following me.

263
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:43,200
So genius. What? Yeah. This guy's actually getting gang stalked. That's crazy. I think gang stalking is real.

264
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,400
That'd be crazy if they're both accidentally gang stalking each other.

265
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,200
Well that's just normal stalking. I think you need a crew. True. To gang stalk.

266
00:14:52,200 --> 00:15:00,200
Yeah I guess it's the operative word there, huh? He had a great video where he just videoed a Mercedes Benz on the side of the street and nobody's in the car.

267
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,700
And he's like, "Gang stalking must pay pretty well, huh?

268
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,280
"Mercedes Benz."

269
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,480
That's it.

270
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,700
Yeah, they're cool.

271
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,160
- Yeah, I wonder what would break in my mind,

272
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,640
'cause I feel like I'm pretty susceptible.

273
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,480
- Successful?

274
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,440
- Susceptible to becoming-- - Probably like canceling

275
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,880
a favorite television program or something of mine.

276
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,480
- I feel like you know what would really get me?

277
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,220
A bunch of people online saying,

278
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,400
"Look at this crazy gang stalk guy."

279
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,080
- Yeah. - Yeah, that might actually

280
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,920
make me go completely insane.

281
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,320
Definitely. Yeah. Yeah. I mean either I would never like follow any of these

282
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:39,520
people online and like check their every move every day.

283
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:44,120
But I do it is a weird. Yeah, it is a weird phenomenon because like you get

284
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,920
fascinated with the people who are being gang stalked and then you yourself or

285
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,120
are actually driving them to suicide.

286
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,720
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see. It's insane. The way the way I see people interact with

287
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:58,620
people like that. I don't I don't understand how you know, I know the worst

288
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,020
is like the people the people who like reply and they're like oh I'm in your

289
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,580
walls like don't do that you're you yeah you're going to be responsible for so

290
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:12,660
many deaths right this person's gonna kill 15 people yeah but it's still funny

291
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:19,180
to look at them I would like yeah I mean it's just it's just like good I don't

292
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,060
even know I don't I used to I understand what the bad thing about gang stuck isn't

293
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:26,700

294
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,460
popular. Nobody's like oh the gang stalkers hurting me it's always just

what you're talking about,

325
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,720
you ask if they've seen Lapu Lapu.

326
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,620
Yeah, when he ate that chicken it was insane.

327
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,860
- That was fire, Lapu Lapu.

328
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:46,560
- Thank you, partner.

329
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,440
- Walking up to somebody who thinks

330
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,080
they're being gang stalked and being like,

331
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,080
Hey, Lapu Lapu.

332
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,080
Speaking in fucking Simlish at the...

333
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,080
It's all...

334
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
Follow, follow, going on through.

335
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,080
(Laughter)

336
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,080
It's making everything worse.

337
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,080
How many people do you think you need

338
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
involved to just make one

339
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,080
person, like an actual, a sane person

340
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,080
just lose their mind? Like how many different

341
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,080
people talking in Simlish in

342
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,080
one day before you actually just fucking go crazy?

343
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,080
I feel like two. Two in a row?

344
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,080
Two isn't that... Two in a row, two in a row you're like

345
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:23,440
like all right what the fuck is going on. I'm fragile. Three. If you talk to if you say

346
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,840
good morning to someone, I mean the rule of threes and then you go to if you go to somebody

347
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,920
else you're like that guy's speaking Simlish to me and he's like yeah then yeah that would

348
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:39,040
be bad. I would you know what honestly I think that I think that maybe culture has gone far

349
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,560
enough that I would just assume I was on a prank show. If prank shows didn't exist my

350
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:46,480
mind might. I know that's what I'm saying it's prank shows. I feel like they've ruined

351
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,800
they've ruined completely shattering people's minds.

352
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:54,000
You're right, because truly that is what I would I would I think a person who's

353
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
not schizophrenic, you know, yeah, you do something like that to them. They're

354
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,560
immediately be like, okay, where's the camera? Yeah, you're looking around for

355
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:06,360
that funny magician. Yeah, Carbonaro effect. The funny one from Netflix. I'm

356
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,440
thinking of a different around like, okay, I know that it's probably the

357
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
I know there's a funny magician here.

358
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Yeah.

359
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,440
There's also, what's the, the JFL, Montreal.

360
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,440
Oh yeah, that's coming up.

361
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,440
People, people are, no like the prank show they have.

362
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
Oh, I thought, oh no, I don't know that.

363
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Where it's like, oh like, one person walked into this port-a-potty and now 16 people are walking out.

364
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,440
I would have just assumed group sex.

365
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Yeah.

366
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,440
Yeah.

367
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Or a multiplier.

368
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Those videos actually are funny as hell.

369
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:44,000
Yeah, it could be a multiplier a cloning pod. I might assume I might up assume so I

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,360
pulled up lapu lapu here you guys just want to refresh your memory about lapu

371
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:51,120
lapu. Yes, I think is maybe the video that could heal every gang stalking

372
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,040
victim in the world and every gangster. Yeah, he's chosen the street instead of

373
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,760
let me fast forward to when I'm here. I'm sorry. I was out of town. So yeah,

374
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:03,680
it's called biggest crocodile ever named lapu lapu and he's feeding him a

375
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,840
complete chicken I think it's an entire chicken is it like a raw chicken?

376
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,320
it looks like it's I don't think it's cooked. Nope, they cook it. Look at this thing.

377
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,480
Whoa that's a big gator. Just wait to wait till he comes out. He's coming out. Remember we went to

378
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,040
alligator adventure? That was so sick. Look at this fucking thing dude. That is too big.

379
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:25,120
Those are that's just a dinosaur. I think literally it look how gigantic that thing is.

380
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,000
Crocodiles and like Komodo dragons it's just like how the fuck do I exist at the same time as you?

381
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah, crocodiles are insane.

382
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Going through...

383
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Dude, look at that, they can't even walk, dude.

384
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's so big.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,300
Dude, going through the fucking...

386
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,400
Going through Alligator Adventure and seeing like that big one...

387
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
Oh yeah, like...

388
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
That big white one that had its mouth open...

389
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,400
Uthar or something.

390
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,920
Yeah.

391
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
That was just like...

392
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,480
Just looking at a crocodile's mouth, I was like, "If I ever got eaten..."

393
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
If I ever was in there, I would be eaten.

394
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,560
If I got eaten by that thing, I deserve it.

395
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:53,560
I'm lower...

396
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
I am completely lower on the food chain.

397
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,520
I was far from scared there.

398
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
I was not scared.

399
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,600
I was scared me the most the tortoise the tour airs you yeah me to the tourist.

400
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,640
Oh yeah, yeah, because of their fat body and jibber jabbering about this and

401
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,080
that yeah talking about let's keep it silent and admire. Can you just enjoy

402
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,560
the fucking millions of years of nature that are unfolding before you and the

403
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:20,280
tortoise to oh my instagram filters broken that's what they're talking about

404
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,600
the whole tortoise with the tortoise snaps one day and he gets really fast.

405
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,860
(laughter)

406
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:31,440
- People don't think about that.

407
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,040
- Oh my god, he's going crazy.

408
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,880
- Oh my god!

409
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,000
- He's a fast turtle.

410
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,480
- It's a 300 year old tortoise and he's running at top speed.

411
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,520
- You could, that's the thing, you look at that tortoise.

412
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,360
- If a tortoise--

413
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,280
- I will say, I had a, the reason, okay,

414
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,000
petting that tortoise is why I got a dog.

415
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,840
- Yeah.

416
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,540
- That was the most insane animal experience

417
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
I've had in my adult life.

418
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,360
- I didn't want to pet it, I got, I was like--

419
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:59,020
he's too strong in the connection. I almost fell in love with him. I sat there and I just

420
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:07,740
touched him and he just looked at me. And I was like, "Animals are all alive." I had

421
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,500
that thought. I was like, "Oh my God, animals are not just pictures. They're actually real."

422
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
And they can breathe.

423
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,700
That was one of the best animals ever to touch.

424
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,820
Yeah, that was a great one.

425
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,420
I know why it freaked me out.

426
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
Did you end up touching it?

427
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,420
It felt like a boot.

428
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,420
It felt like wood. It was like a tree.

429
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,180
I think I was just like too scared to touch it because I thought I was going to get a

430
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,180
disease.

431
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,500
I thought you were going to get some kind of turtle skin disease.

432
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Yeah.

433
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,500
I got probably cause I got turtle pucks.

434
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,500
I grow a shell.

435
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Oh.

436
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,500
Oh.

437
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Oh.

438
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,100
I am the most susceptible in this room to grow a shell.

439
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,140
I was, yeah, you out of the three of us, you would look the coolest with a shell.

440
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,380
Okay, so obviously it's impossible.

441
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,540
Actually, Caleb would look pretty cool with a shell.

442
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:47,260
Don't say that I would look, I'm not, it's not master disguise.

443
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Stop.

444
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,260
No.

445
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,260
I think he would look the best with a shell.

446
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
I'm not doing, no, there's no master of disguise.

447
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,260
No.

448
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:59,300
you know that's not that's no that all fours okay eating a big head of lettuce.

449
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:06,020
I wouldn't eat an entire it's too much food for me. I will say watching a turtle eat lettuce

450
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:13,780
pretty cool. It is impossible to grow a shell, but I do think that probably if out of the three

451
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:18,500
of us you are the most likely yeah maybe just some kind of like calcium build up or something

452
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:23,180
around your back. Yeah. And I think it'd be pretty good for you. I think you might learn

453
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,080
a lot about yourself if you grew a shell. I think I, well it would ruin all of my break

454
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,780
dancing. No, it would make it way better. Are you fucking stupid? Are you kidding me?

455
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:37,160
I go on the back, if I get on my shell I can't get back up without help. So you'd just be

456
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,820
part of a crew. Yeah, that's the whole point of fucking break dancing. I was watching this,

457
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,380
speaking of break dancing, I was watching this interview with Bucky Lazik from Tony

458
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,340
Tony Hawk and from Tony Hawk, the from the Tony Hawk video games. Oh and

459
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:58,240
skater yeah. Oh, so you okay. I was watching this interview with him and

460
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,440
they're they're asking him about like from Tony Hawk. Well, it's a it's a

461
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:09,080
franchise series. Yeah, it's like saying Madden. I was playing yeah. I saw an

462
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:14,940
interview with LeBron James from NBA 2k, but I saw I saw this interview and then

463
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:19,860
And he was like, they were asking him about the special tricks and they were like, "What

464
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
was the idea behind it?"

465
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,020
And he was like, "I don't know.

466
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
I was really into breakdancing at the time.

467
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:30,420
So they recorded videos of me in the Neversoft kitchen breakdancing and then put them into

468
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,420
the game."

469
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,980
It's so fucking funny just being like, "Yeah, this is what I want my special trick to look

470
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,980
like."

471
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,620
And then just doing a head spin in the kitchen.

472
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,740
Games really use mocap and stuff.

473
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:46,820
I was watching a bunch of like making of like mortal combat making up and they

474
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,900
use like a their whole thing was like they use mo cap for all their like

475
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,740
characters and stuff and it's so fucking funny because they have to like to mo

476
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,020
cap that like a lot of it is like not mo cap. They kind of like scan it in or

477
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:00,520
whatever, so they just have people like dress up like the characters and then

478
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:05,860
just like pretend to fall over and go like oh, like get pushed like it'll be

479
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:10,100
just like one guy who's in full like like you know, like shalcon armor yeah

480
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:13,640
and then they just have like a just a one random guy who works there's like a

481
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:17,240
nerd with like these really thick glass and he just pushes them over.

482
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:22,600
How do they mocap the Mortal Kombat fatalities? They actually kill those people?

483
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:27,880
They practice it on lizards. They pull a green spine out of Ronda Rousey's back?

484
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,320
Yeah, it's really fucked. Oh, they put her in Mortal Kombat, right?

485
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:34,440
She voices Sonya Blade. And there's a nude hack.

486
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,920
That's the other funny thing about the old mocap stuff and the way that worked

487
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,180
is like yeah they just would just hire women to dress up like that for their

488
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,320
good for the good like cuz they were just like taking they were just like

489
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:47,160
like okay you have to wear like a ninja bikini and you have to jump up and down

490
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:52,920
for an hour for our video game. They did that they did that mocap stuff for Tony

491
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:57,120
Hawk's Project 8 and you could just like watch like the like people doing tricks

492
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,520
and it's just like so good to have to like wear like a big leotard with like

493
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,680
like little like balls on it and like they're like all right now like go into

494
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,440
to this warehouse so we can like you can like skate for an hour. It's like

495
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,580
sweating through like this little fucking like latex suit seems like hell.

496
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,640
I think for a mocap if I was a mocap actor see it like you know if I was like

497
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,680
Andy circus and I was doing like say like the apes from planet of the apes

498
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,760
yeah, those are like I feel like somebody seeing the video of me doing

499
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:34,040
that where it's not cgi all over me will be worse than someone seeing me naked

500
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:39,880
definitely because it's just like a big part of that is that in those mocap

501
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,440
suits everybody can see your penis yeah so your little tiny pieces of my body

502
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,840
now and it's more about I don't want to see anybody see me act perfectly like a

503
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,360
monkey it's so embarrassing how accurate it would be yeah yeah and also the way

504
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,240
I would look at you in public because I feel like a banana I see I've seen video

505
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,760
like for they did mocap stuff for some of the new Godzilla movies and like I've

506
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,200
seen videos of the like a mocap actors like pretending to be King Ghidorah I'm

507
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:11,120
like you should be dead. I feel like that's a seriously hard one. Yeah. Why are they doing

508
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,120
mocap? It looks cool. I mean, it comes out well. It's strange that they do it, but it's

509
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,560
because they use suits and stuff for the old stuff. So, they try to keep the human physicality.

510
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:26,400
Okay. I was just thinking about the Tony Hawk mocap because I remembered I would like watch

511
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,200
that to try and learn how to do the tricks when I was younger. And fucking Mike Valleli

512
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:37,560
literally like he got in that mocap suit and did a fucking flamingo on flat ground.

513
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,280
I don't know what that might-

514
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:45,400
That's literally you kick the board into like up into your penis and then like twist it sideways.

515
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:50,680
I was like gee like think about when I was a kid I was like that's sick now that I know

516
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,760
like that's just kind of like a weird like a like a old 80s trick it's like man you wasted

517
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,520
those mocap artists time that is insane.

518
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:06,120
We should get a whole mocap set up in here. That would be so sick. I never heard mocap

519
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:11,240
than when I talked to you two. What the fuck? Holy fuck. What? I'll get a mocap set up, yeah.

520
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,280
Yeah, that would be tight. What's that cost? A hundred bucks? Ten thousand. Nah, that's too much.

521
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:20,520
Oh, if we wanted a really good one. I don't want a weird, we're not going to use it. Can we get one

522
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:26,360
that just covers the entire office so we can walk from one side to the other and it's all recorded?

523
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,920
yeah and it's just and we just we leave it on all the time and then release a

524
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,000
movie called our life in the office okay it's just cgi like pixar characters

525
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,600
versions of us walking around talking with no audio sitting for an hour

526
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,240
yeah at a table okay that would actually be really a really good experimental

527
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,000
film if how does that how does andy circus act

528
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,960
like a monkey hey how the fuck does he do that i'd

529
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:53,560
rather he just knows how to do it somehow i'd rather see a monkey at the

530
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,520
circus how does he does he it's like arms down

531
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,640
it's all in the it's the the face is the most important the face is not the most

532
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:03,200
important part of the month you're fucking talking your ass notice no the

533
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:06,680
most important is putting your hands making your hair that's a simple as far

534
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,160
around

535
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,040
okay who looks more like a monkey okay

536
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,760
near you

537
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,180
well i can do either i can do the face thing

538
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,080
you look well a lot like a monkey now you did that they didn't before for

539
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,240
yourself with you guys watching

540
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,160
some of the picture of their

541
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,280
that's a flamingo say some of the bitch

542
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,240
so it gets causing

543
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,620
son of a gun

544
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,780
that's a cool trick

545
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:31,300
doing that in a mocap suit though it's like okay you can do anything

546
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,220
and we can make you do anything when you're in the mocap suit what would

547
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,560
what would your signature trick be in tony hawk i would fall over

548
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,700
uh...

549
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,280
flying up

550
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,800
flying up a hundred feet flying up flying up yet back to the

551
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,400
it's just sitting in the mocap suit doing like this

552
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,080
Yeah, then you guys will put me like a hundred feet in the air while I do this

553
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,520
trick. I hit I hit like left right B and then I just go like you just fly up and

554
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:04,160
then you die from fall damage. Yeah, yeah, flying up, you know, digging down

555
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,980
digging down is good using the board is it's like a going left, but you're using

556
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,600
the board as a shovel. Here's what I would do China. I would I would say my my

557
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:18,280
trick is that I have to like I'm being handed like a million dollars. So we

558
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:22,200
we need mo cap. Do we need to do that and then the hand me the million dollars

559
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,660
and I go actually I actually shockingly surprised you a trick to you and I'm

560
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,300
going to keep this for a freaking freaking plot twist and now my freaking

561
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,820
plot twist. Andy circus was playing the million dollars yeah and now my second

562
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,200
and also my second special trick is actually going to be putting a million

563
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:43,320
dollars in my car and then also eating a pretty good lunch yeah and then my

564
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:45,380
- My third trick is not being here.

565
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:49,300
- Oh, I just remember Chad Muska had a special trick

566
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,600
in that game called the Ghetto Blaster

567
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,560
where he just pulls out a big boom box

568
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,900
and does like a five-oh.

569
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,960
- What a dope name.

570
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,900
- Chad Muska.

571
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,920
- Chad Muska is a cool name.

572
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,500
- It's so funny, he's one of these vandals.

573
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:08,840
He does graph, he does graffiti, he's a writer.

574
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,880
Isn't that crazy?

575
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,240
If you do graffiti, they call it writing.

576
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,080
- What?

577
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,960
No, they call if you write articles and books.

578
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,120
- No. - That's writing, yeah.

579
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,920
- Graffiti, these-- - Graffiti's a crime.

580
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,000
- These vandals consider what they do

581
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,640
on the side of buildings writing.

582
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:26,360
- Okay, but at least they don't think it's art, right?

583
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:27,760
(laughing)

584
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,600
- Buddy.

585
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,620
Buddy, these guys who do graph.

586
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,720
- I hate graph.

587
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,080
- Chad Muska, he writes-- - I will say--

588
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,740
- If you look around like Tompkins Square,

589
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:40,640
you can see Muska just everywhere.

590
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,680
- Next time I go to Tompkins Square, I'll check it out.

591
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:48,120
The only good graffiti is stuff that says Lindsay was here and shit that's sick,

592
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:52,240
but if you do like I like I like the graffiti, I have a curvy version of my

593
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,440
name. I like that graffiti. They do where it's like at a manhole cover. It's like

594
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,200
an X or like an arrow. Yeah, that's good. Oh my God. Have you seen the guy here?

595
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,680
The guy who does lines in the middle of the street that guy's like so fucking

596
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,280
prolific fucking everywhere. Yeah, yeah, sometimes he fucks up and it's like

597
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:11,880
weird. He like skips parts of the line. I saw one that's like a six or and

598
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,960
somebody wrote over it my friend got mad there's a bunch of zexors. Zexors

599
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,200
are everywhere in Brooklyn. Yeah. Yeah I see a million of them. And I guess it buddy

600
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:26,120
I'm scared of his alien name and I don't want to meet him so I don't like zexors.

601
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:29,880
It's so late since moving here I've been like learning about like

602
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,600
graffiti and stuff I've been like. There's some stuff that you just

603
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,640
shouldn't admit. Yeah that's another no-kiss thing to say. I have friends who do it and

604
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
- That's another thing you shouldn't admit.

605
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,780
- And their names are, and they're full legal names.

606
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:44,280
This is a sting operation.

607
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,960

00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,460

surgery fails of Hollywood and it says it is good to take care of you, but

638
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:30,360
sometime excess of everything is bad true as some Hollywood celebrities are

639
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,680
so much concerned about their beauty and looks that they have gone through plastic surgery

640
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,340
to enhance their beauty but instead of becoming attractive they lost their charm and surgery

641
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,720
proved to be a disaster.

642
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
Oh, okay.

643
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
Yeah.

644
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,720
That's actually fucking...

645
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,720
It's tragic.

646
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,720
Tragic, yeah.

647
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,720
That's very sad.

648
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,720
It's really tragic.

649
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,440
It does make me sad when like a, like a, like those fucking like...

650
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,440
When a woman wears shorts.

651
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,440
When a woman wears shorts.

652
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,440
What?

653
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
It makes me sad.

654
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Yeah.

655
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,040
Yeah, that's like, cover it up.

656
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
Yeah.

657
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,040
I don't want to see that.

658
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:59,160
I don't want to see your, your, your bobby pin tattoo.

659
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:04,360
for your husband. Your knees are your husband's thing. It's not for me to see.

660
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:11,240
Like the Bogdanoff twins? I hate some guys. And then they got all these fillers in their

661
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:17,040
face that made them look like a puppet. I thought that they looked cool. The thing is

662
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,600
if you look like that by yourself, you look stupid, but if you're twins, it's like, so

663
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:27,720
like check us out. I can see the life behind that. The thing about that is that twins are

664
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,240
like already inhuman monsters yeah you might as well they're already

665
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:36,600
mutants yeah a twin twins you get arms like you know thinking about that it's

666
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:42,240
so sick that they were like scientists they were really bad scientists yeah

667
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,240
they were like terrible scientists they they know their other stuff was just

668
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:51,520
like I plagiarized a bunch of shit right everything stuff up they were and they

669
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,440
were French too so they like sound weird man if I do seeing them in person like

670
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,680
seeing that guy looks like a lion walking up to you and then he starts going like

671
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:09,440
"I'd fucking lose it. I'd nut instantly. No hands, full prostate nut."

672
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,040
A French guy with a cushion in his face. I would nut my prostate out of my penis. Yeah exactly.

673
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:20,840
And it would just be sitting there on the ground. It's squirming away.

674
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:26,960
Yeah. Trying to get into that guy's mouth. Yeah. That's exactly what

675
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:30,720
would happen. Nutting out your prostate. I've never even thought about trying to do that.

676
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,360
Is that what kegels are for? Yeah. To nut your prostate out? You can like, so what you do

677
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,640
is you nut it out and then you slurp it back up like it's a sticky hand. How does that

678
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:44,640
fit out of your urethra? You can train it. It stretches. You can stretch your urethra?

679
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,160
Your urethra is one of the most stretchy parts of the body, like the butthole. Yeah. You

680
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:55,560
you can teach it to gape. Yeah, it's like a yeah, you flex it. Yeah, really your

681
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:55,960
brain.

682
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,460
That's a crazy thing here. That's nasty. Oh my God. I made my aritha huge. Those

683
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,660
guys who are like those guys who get like like

684
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:10,060
they train their butt to like become like a manhole

685
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:19,660
to be big to be big. So they can frame somebody's whole foot in there. I don't

686
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:24,200
understand because that's got to hurt. It's got to hurt, but like a little

687
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:27,960
something in your butt. They seem to like it more than anybody in the world. A

688
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:33,020
normal sized thing in your butt, probably pretty beast, but something that's as

689
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:37,400
huge as like a fucking... Like a parking cone? Yeah, yeah. The square side of a

690
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:42,840
parking cone in your asshole, that hurts. Yeah. That really hurts. I think for me,

691
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:47,020
the limit of my asshole is probably like sweet potato sized. Yeah.

692
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:54,180
that's I mean like absolute limit like that's a big as I could go. Sure you're

693
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,940
thinking of that. He's thinking of that sweet potato. He took the like three

694
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,560
years ago.

695
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,380
I looked exactly like a cock. Yeah, you're like a piece of paper

696
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:10,060
yeah folded infinitely eight and a half, but a piece of paper. I can probably fit

697
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:10,420
this.

698
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:15,380
You think you can put this in your ass with enough training? I could probably

699
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:19,300
so if you can't this is a big training doesn't count. This is what I'm talking

700
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,660
about right now. Anybody can write anything in there with enough training

701
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:26,740
so sweet potato for me is is it would probably take me like an hour to work

702
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:31,460
for me probably probably a strand of horse hair. The thing is I don't I'm not

703
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:35,060
opposed to like trying that though, even though I don't feel like I would find

704
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:39,060
much sexual gratification from it. I think a whole sweet potato in your I

705
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,100
feel like it might just be like a fun thing to do one day is like try to put

706
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,980
something in my ass. Yeah, you know a lot of people feel that way. But I don't want

707
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,780
to... There's this app where guys can help you out with it. Really? Yeah. Is it Fiverr?

708
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:56,940
It's called Ass Trainer. Ass Trainer? Yeah. Like Duolingo? Yeah. It's exactly like

709
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:01,420
Duolingo. Really? You have to do it every day. Okay, I guess I'll do it every fucking day.

710
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:07,780
Number one, Jocelyn Wildenstein. Yeah, Wilden out on your damn face.

711
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:15,140
more like it. Yeah and ste... I can't... Oh I hate seeing you. Yeah. Go ahead and read

712
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:22,000
this here. She ruined herself because of her husband. She wants to look like cat

713
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,300
because her husband loved cats but her expensive attempt has turned herself in

714
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,500
something like look like a dragon but at least now. I mean she does look pretty

715
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:39,100
bad yeah she was so what exactly like fucking brown bunny what's her name

716
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:45,660
Finns and gallo the girl from the movie close vignette yeah yeah she looks just

717
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:51,020
like her and now she looks like a dragon but yeah which is a serious yeah great I

718
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,620
would say a dragon's go I don't know if she looks like a dragon I don't know if

719
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:58,100
I'd say that no I don't know I wouldn't say dragon I think she is I think she

720
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,540
does look like Ron Perlman in Beauty and the Beast. She doesn't look like a

721
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:07,780
dragon, but I would believe that she lives in a cave. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, and

722
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,580
maybe guards something. Yeah, yeah. Number two is Lolo Ferrari. Oh my god. What's wrong

723
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,560
with this? She's actually fucking insane. This lady has undergone such a craziest plastic

724
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,620
surgery that became reason of her death. No, she's dead. She had firstly make her

725
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:25,460
lips look bigger, and then she put some extra, she put extra, some really extra on

726
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:31,160
on her breast. She was known as having hugest boobs in the world. She even died

727
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,540
because of suffocating due to those huge boobs. She is named as Catwoman wait

728
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:38,900
suffocated like she got her boobs so big that they covered her face. She might

729
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:42,580
try to sleep on her Mr. Incredible in the completely black bubble room yeah

730
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,840
whoa,

731
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,560
but she is named as Catwoman. That's like my dream way of dying yeah yeah.

732
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:54,160
Having cute be by your own your own breasts well yeah, and I would probably

733
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:59,000
sweet potato into my asshole. But yeah it sounds pretty good to me.

734
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,000
Michael Jackson, this is rude. That's fucked up. That's the king of pop.

735
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
Go ahead. Jinx, you owe me a pop.

736
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I thought I had one in front of me but it was completely empty.

737
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,880
I have to go. I am taking about plastic surgery and how can I forget the name of

738
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:22,120
one of the top pop singer king of music Michael Jackson who has completely

739
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,260
changed himself through plastic surgery. Black Boy turned to White Fellow by the

740
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:31,760
grace of plastic surgery. After that he has gone through a lot of plastic surgeries that have

741
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,960
made him look like a man of plastic.

742
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Black Boy turned to White Fellow by the grace of plastic surgery.

743
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:46,960
Holy shit. What a sentence.

744
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,960

He does look like a man of plastic.

748
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,120
A black boy turned to white fellow by the grace of plastic.

749
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:05,280
I was watching, oh yesterday I saw the sickest car out in front of here.

That sounds sick.

757
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
This is the coolest thing I've ever seen.

758
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,520
I love that there's so many good cars in New York.

759
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Yeah.

760
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
There's incredible cars.

00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Here it is.

762
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
It's a van called Cool Blue.

00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,520
Oh that's dope.

00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
Yeah that's sick.

770
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,360
There's one near me that's a van where and these people lost their dog like four years

771
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:57,760
ago and the entire van is wrapped in like have you seen this dog.

772
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,080
Like my Instagram photos.

773
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
It's so dope.

774
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Yeah.

775
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,080
That is cool.

776
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,080
I would just do that.

777
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,600
I want to just like buy that car now.

778
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:05,600
Just roll it over.

779
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,960
There's a car on my street with the license plate Gapin.

780
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:09,960
What?

781
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Gapin.

782
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Oh, okay.

783
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:12,960
Gapin.

784
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
But it's G-A-Y-P-I-N.

785
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,600
You're very into gaping today.

786
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,600
I don't know why.

787
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,960
See, I don't feel like...

788
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,040
Maybe it's because I keep seeing that every time I come to the office.

789
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,320
I feel like it's more of a...

790
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:29,680
Somebody is psychically driving me to get my asshole gaped.

791
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,720
See, but I think that gaping your asshole is not sexual at all and it's something that

792
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,720
we could do in a funny jackass way.

793
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,720
It's, yeah.

794
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,720
I'm serious.

795
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,560
Or like a physiological research study.

796
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Why is it sexual that we see how many big things go in your butt?

797
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,920
Like that's funny, like farts.

798
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,280
Or scientifically.

799
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,000
it's funny it's not funny then it's scientific we're doing in a funny

800
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,800
scientific way so yeah just like this what about this no because this is wider

801
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,280
than it is okay wider it's wider then but then the calf this is a deal okay

802
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,800
we'll start by the way my mic the cap would clip my what's the biggest thing

803
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,480
in this room that would go in your ass. My own penis. XLR cable.

804
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:19,000
cable that would fit that's going higher like yeah like the chain video okay wait

805
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,360

820
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,560
might have the biggest tushy here based on how many things you're saying hey

821
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,960
Gil s I mean the whole there's more room for

822
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,520
you have a sinker has more room in it all right there's less number for

823
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:39,640
Donatella Versace I thought that was a ninja yeah I don't know who this is

824
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:44,560
Versace's that's Donatella Versace's like the heir of Versace's

825
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:49,480
Like other stars she has also made a stupidest mistake of

826
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,280
undergoing plastic surgery at old age she wants to remain young and look

827
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:57,960
beautiful however she was truly very beautiful and oldness could make her

828
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:03,760
prettier but now she turned into an awful and ugly fellow. Looking at that woman and

829
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,600
calling her a fellow is really funny. This person likes the word fellow. Yeah. Number

830
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:15,320
five is Mickey Rourke. Holy shit that's not a picture of him. Yeah that that looks insane.

831
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:21,320
Wait go back up to Donatello Versace. He looks exactly like Jim Carrey Grinch. That's not him. He doesn't look like that does he?

832
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,200
The only thing that changed about her is her lip.

833
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,360
No, there's other stuff.

834
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,120
Like the lip and then she's just doing a darker eye makeup.

835
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,120
That's really it.

836
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,120
She doesn't look that terrible.

837
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,120
What the hell?

838
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:35,120
How'd you notice she had makeup on?

839
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,120
Okay, okay, white knight.

840
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,120
Yeah.

841
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,120
Why are you--

842
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,120
Oh, no, she also has some like cheap stuff done.

843
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,120
She's not gonna fuck you, Pat.

844
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:43,120
Yeah, she's not gonna put your mouse in your ass.

845
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,120
Mickey Roy, please, please don't fucking blow this for me.

846
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:47,120
He failed in lifting.

847
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:51,020
and lifting. Lifting has indeed made him look a younger, but unnatural and like

848
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:55,100
plastic. He lost his charm as he looked unnatural and artificial, although luck

849
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:59,100
is blessed upon him as he was nominated for Oscars. However, people thought that

850
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:03,680
his career has ended up. I think he looks fine. He looks like he went a hundred

851
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:04,740
miles down the road.

852
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:09,720
He looks like your miles per hour really. It looks like he looks like he has like a

853
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:14,440
clip on the back. Yeah, I think he looks or simpson thing. He just got off a

854
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,380
motorcycle yeah no helmet Melanie Griffith

855
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:20,980
From

856
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,980
Plastic surgeries that have made her beauty lost for forever

857
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:28,500
She has had many lifts on her face that are made her face look like wild animals

858
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,620
I feel like I could get some plus I could stand to get some plastic surgery

859
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:36,580
I want to get I was telling my girlfriend that I would I was gonna get some plastic surgery

860
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,580
I think I would look really good with a really pointy chin. Yeah

861
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:49,180
like like hacker from from cyberchase

862
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,260
like the uh like the guy with no other changes at all the guy in crash box

863
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:56,220
who just draws the pictures just a perfect i don't know i never watch

864
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:00,380
crashing i'm sorry just chin that just it's so sharp

865
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:03,980
his chin so he draws with the pencil and then his chin looks like the tip of a

866
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,220
pencil oh okay yeah like that i would have a

867
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,340
pencil chin yeah yeah i think that i might well it's

868
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,740
because he has a goatee there too i think i might get my eyes opened yeah

869
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:18,300
permanently in the morning. I think maybe I'd get some big ass like Chloe Cherry

870
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:25,740
Lips. Who's that? It's the lady from Euphoria. She plays Eve or something, I

871
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:30,820
think. She sounds pretty stupid. I saw her on the train the other day. Really? Yeah.

872
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,180
Do you push her over? No. Into the tracks? I saw her on the train and I was like,

873
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:42,060
New York City is a beautiful melting pot. There's me, for instance, a podcaster and

874
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:45,100
and then there is an actress yeah that is crazy.

875
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:52,600
Wow, Lil Kim, she has made great experimentation with her body and as she

876
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,420
has made some lifts on her face, made her skin whiter and implanted her breast. I

877
00:48:57,420 --> 00:49:00,840
can bet you that whatever she has done with herself, she definitely scare

878
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,720
herself when she look in the mirror. That's just mean she did that on

879
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:08,280
purpose. So she's a big she's a big horror fan. She said you heard that yeah

880
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:11,660
it's not about her appearance. It's the loud noise. She makes yeah. You heard

881
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,660
her album like the first track on one of her albums is a skit where she's just

882
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:26,940
sucking dick. That's freaky. It's fire. I'm gonna do that on my half-hour special.

883
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:32,580
Number eight is Tori. Tori Spelling. Well it doesn't say last name. It just says Tori.

884
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,180
I know that's Tori. This could be a different person. She doesn't really look

885
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:40,300
all that abused by surgeons. No. Well it says many people think that she is only

886
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:43,480
in Hollywood because of her father, but she has invested money in plastic

887
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,040
surgery to transform her breast. Her boobs have gotten so huge that she looks

888
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:49,040
pathetic.

889
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:55,800
She looks pathetic and she's unable to inspire people.

890
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,880
She has uninspiring tits. Her boobs have gotten so huge that she looks

891
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:00,880
pathetic.

892
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,440

Gilbert Gottfried roast humor. Yeah. Priscilla Presley. I just saw a movie

902
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:52,260
about her. Have you seen anyone loosing their beauty for the sake of expensive

903
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:56,260
and costly ugliness? Presley has done exactly the same thing. She has

904
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,740
experimented with plastic surgery of her face and has lost her beauty and has

905
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:06,740
turned into a witch. That at the end kind of tacked on. Buried the lead a little bit.

906
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:10,740
Yep, she's completely ugly from plastic surgery. She also turned into an actual

907
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:16,740
witch. Yep, she's into warlockery. Yep, it's not all that good. She was, is it

00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,540

Tara, read it.

927

she is a bit slow. It says it says she is bit slow fellow as I am saying such

928
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:04,360
words because she has just ruined her body by herself. She undergone a lipos

929
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:07,880
surgery that put a lot of extra skin on her body. She thought that she can

930
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:11,800
overcome by making another stupid mistake and she got plastic surgery of

931
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:16,560
her chest. Now she looks awful. Now I know where this is she's right there

00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:50,520
News website on my grandma's computer and I would go on the Fox News website and somebody would say

938

00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:50,320
2012 say experts their views. I've already seen the end of the world two

963
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,640
years to go December 21st 2012 the date which is going on our minds at is as it

964
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,840
is reaching nearer and nearer that we all know that something is going to be

965
00:54:57,840 --> 00:55:01,640
happening on December 21st 2012, which might takes us to the end of the world,

966
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:05,440
but is it really going to be end of the world? If it's so what might be happen

967
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,840
on that day? All these questions might be going in the minds of all at one time

968
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,040
or the other and then I'm going to skip ahead here to what might be the real is

969
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:17,900
And on December 21st, 2012 or on August 13th, 2012, whoever knows but both the scientific

970
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:21,520
as well as religious beliefs are prevailing in the minds of the people on this issue.

971
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,460
The science, technology and the scientists behind this are saying that the hyperspace

972
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:29,100
that contain our universe is also showing signs that something strange is happening

973
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,480
in our universe.

974
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,580
Even it was said that the global and solar polar reversal peaks are coming within three

975
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:37,700
weeks of that day, December 21, 2012.

976
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:41,060
But according to some scientists, it is possible that another universe is slowly starting to

977
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:44,240
claim in our physical universe and according to religious beliefs they

978
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,900
believe that the earth will be destroyed or cleansed by the wrongdoers and those

979
00:55:47,900 --> 00:55:51,080
that believe in their God will be saved or brought to heaven. My my first

980
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,060
girlfriend in high school broke up with me on December 21st 2012. Really? Mm-hmm.

981
00:55:56,060 --> 00:56:01,620
Wow. Like on purpose? Yeah not on purpose not she didn't know that that day was

982
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:05,500
the end of the world. Why did you remember it? I remembered it because I was like what if the

983
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:15,060
world ends - this year says another phenomenon that is making society more

984
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:21,360
conscious of the date December 21st 2012 is the movie 2012 I think sick-ass movie

985
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:26,220
right John Cusack I never saw John Cusack not it not a not respected enough

986
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:33,020
as an actor he's a beast dude dude and his sister's a Fox which Anna Joan Joan

987
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,900
I don't know who Ann is.

988
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,740
- Ann Cusack?

989
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:36,580
- Never heard of her.

990
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:38,100
- I'm just, you've probably seen her

991
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:39,540
and didn't know she was a Cusack.

992
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:40,380
- Really?

993
00:56:40,380 --> 00:56:41,200
- Yeah.

994
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,920
The Cusack family, very talented.

995
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:44,760
- Use my sack like a--

996
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,300
- Welcome on the show anytime.

997
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,140
- Use my sack like a cue--

998
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,420
- Don't say, now they're not gonna come on the show.

999
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:50,900
- Use my sack like a cue ball.

1000
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,740
- They're not gonna come on the show now.

1001
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,220
- Shoot it all, bing bing bing bing bing bing ping ball.

1002
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:55,060
- Better off dead.

1003
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:58,720
- Ping ball with my dick and my sack, I mean.

1004
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,820
- High fidelity, gross point blank.

1005
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:05,180
He's just had a string of just nothing but banger. I want to do something gross

1006
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,180
to him point blank.

1007
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:12,380
Dead ass dead ass. I'm just scrolling through. I don't want to read this whole

1008
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,020
thing because a lot of it's kind of boring, but I did just see I was skimming

1009
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:18,260
through it and I did see this line that's just in the middle of it. I'm sure

1010
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:20,660
many of you have heard of Merlin the magician.

1011
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:27,060
And it starts talking about Merlin for the last few. Do you think Merlin has

1012
00:57:27,060 --> 00:57:29,780
something to do with this? I think Merlin could have had something to do. I

1013
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,180
I think Merlin might be an actual evil psychic force.

1014
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:35,580
You know what is funny about the movie, the movie Better Off, I'm still on the Q-Sec thing,

1015
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,940
the movie Better Off Dead, Dan Schneider plays the villain in that movie and he also is a

1016
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,140
villain in real life.

1017
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,140
The Nickelodeon guy?

1018
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:44,140
Yeah.

1019
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,140
He's an actor?

1020
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:47,500
He is in that movie as the fat neighbor.

1021
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,500
That's getting a...

1022
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,780
The fat neighbor with a...

1023
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,780
It's getting a little weird to me that he has not been...

1024
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,780
Yeah.

1025
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,780
Like...

1026
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,780
It's crazy how protected he is.

1027
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:57,980
There's no like TMZ story.

1028
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:02,140
was it that you never McCurdy thing that just came out every day some some new

1035
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,620

1036
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:43,300
the all the stories of him being like like they'll finish a take and he'll be

1037
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:48,100
like kid. You nailed that joke about seventh grade algebra. Do you want like a

1038
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:53,460
glass of champagne to sell yeah and they were like yeah fuck it yeah yeah it's so

1039
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,280
crazy. Yeah, it's one of those guys right just assumed that he was that

1040
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,980
something already happened with it like that. They are. That's why everyone

1041
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:03,880
just it's all anyone ever talks about with him. I hated those shows growing

1042
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,980
like iCarly and shit like Zoe 101. I was like those are like I hate them

1043
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:11,480
because they were they're so fucking gay. They were honestly mad gay. They

1044
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,480
were gay as hell. They were like and then I'm only proven right as an adult

1045
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:21,680
the humor was like lacking to it wasn't a song was not a banger. It wasn't

1046
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:26,000
funny our Carly was not as funny as Comedy Central's premium blend definitely

1047
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,320
not did Comedy Central's premium blend had Daniel Tosh watch listening to

1048
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:35,600
Howard Stern on Sirius XM right Demetri Martin's first special yes like that was

1049
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,560
that was the kind of shit that me as a nine-year-old was watching because I was

1050
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:45,320
so it I was so funny that was real real fucking TV mm-hmm right yeah I was the

1051
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:49,560
cloud was the real class clown because I would actually will Ferrell SNL I did

1052
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:54,600
actually that was good I was on a lot that's real TV I'm not gonna watch as

1053
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,680
told by Jinger no come on I'd rather watching South Park

1054
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,080
Pokemon down South Park gonna see yourself on time

1055
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:07,960
Yu-Gi-Oh yeah real - yeah growing they had this this thing on Nickelodeon before

1056
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:11,800
they were playing on showtime before they would play as told by Jinger mm-hmm

1057
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:15,600
and it was like a wheel and I like I didn't realize that that was like it was

1058
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:19,320
like a wheel and then it spins and it's like what show is gonna be on next?

1059
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:22,220
You thought it was real? I thought it was real I didn't realize that that was just like a

1060
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:26,000
bump. That's okay. That they would play before the schedule. How old were you? I was like

1061
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:30,160
six. Okay that's okay. And I got really mad because it would always almost land on

1062
01:00:30,160 --> 01:00:34,120
Cousin Skeeter. And then it would go to As Told By Ginger. And I

1063
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:42,400
remember one time we were all in the living room and I just like got up and I was like God damn it!

1064
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:50,080
don't like gambling yeah wow yeah I got up and I was screaming and then like my

1070
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,500
room and he would leave and then I'd watch Estelle by Ginger yeah because it

1071
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:21,520

01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,500
- Next Saturday.

1092
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:20,340
- They're going fast.

1093
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,580
I heard there's only one ticket left.

1094
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:22,420
- (gasps) There's only one ticket.

1095
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,860
- But maybe there could be extras

1096
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:25,340
if you're going as a group and you might be able--

1097
01:02:25,340 --> 01:02:26,180
- But definitely, yeah.

1098
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:27,000
- If you are going.

1099
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,840
- Somewhere between--

1100
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:29,020
- There's as many people are you thinking of going with,

1101
01:02:29,020 --> 01:02:29,860
there's that many tickets left.

1102
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:32,020
- And it's not, it's a normal show.

1103
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:35,340
It's not a live, one of these shitty live podcasts.

1104
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:36,580
It's an actual good show.

1105
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,780
Yeah, we're not gonna go up there and just go, "Mah!"

1106
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,480
But yeah, what's up everybody?

1107
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:44,440
We're Chopo Trap House, and we're doing fucking,

1108
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:47,700
yeah, you see Donald Trump's in the news again?

1109
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:48,540
No. That's not us.

1110
01:02:48,540 --> 01:02:49,380
We're gonna go up there. We are gonna do

1111
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:50,980
the Donald Trump in the news again, though.

1112
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:55,040
When we do our live show, we don't do the podcast at all.

1113
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:56,860
We piss all over the stage.

1114
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,420
We do some weirdo Andy Kaufman crap.

1115
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:01,060
I fucking love Andy Kaufman.

1116
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,580
He's fucking random. He's cool.

1117
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:04,660
He makes me cough, man, from laughing.

1118
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:07,860
The way that he treated girls was hella sarcastic and I appreciate it.

1119
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,860
