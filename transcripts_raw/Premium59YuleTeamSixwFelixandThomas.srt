00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:11,600
Exterior, Duluth, Minnesota, Duluth Mega Mall day.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,720
Scene opens up on an establishing shot--

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,280
establishing shot-- great start--

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,360
of the Duluth Mega Mall.

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,760
Text on screen reads, December 23, 1255 PM.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,280
Cut to interior, Duluth Mega Mall, same time.

8
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,080
In the mall, every inch is filled to the brim

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,440
with Christmas decorations.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,800
The holiday music is lazily spilling out of different stores.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,600
Children smiling and laughing, munching on food court goodies.

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,320
The centerpiece of the mall's holiday cheer can be found by the life-size Hungry Hamster

13
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,120
Nativity Scene, where the 14th annual Mall Santa Wet T-Shirt Contest is just about to

14
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,600
kick off.

15
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,560
The crowd is packed around the contest stage, upon which an announcer bellows about the

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:54,160
beauty and sex appeal of seven of the nastiest, sluttiest, fattest, ugliest, and hottest mall

17
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,160
Santas in the city.

18
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,160
And here are your gorgeous mall Santas!

19
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,160
Look at those Saint Nicks!

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,160
Ouchie Mama, ladies and germs! Sensational!

21
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,160
The camera lovingly pans over the Rubenesque bodies of these fine Santas

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:12,160
who pose seductively on stage for the crowd of onlookers

23
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,160
and ho-ho-ho it up by doing twerks and a sexy dance.

24
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,160
Like a super sexy, sexy dance.

25
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,160
And one of them is stuffing pennies under his foreskin.

26
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,160
Above them is a giant pig trough filled to the brim with eggnog

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,720
attached to a candy cane colored string that, when pulled, will drench these

28
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,160
Santas in that eggnog. Also present are a group of

29
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,560
handsome, strong, tough, buff men that seem strategically and tactically

30
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,700
staggered among the crowd in order to blend in with the civilians. As the

31
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,880
announcer continues vamping, the camera punches in on one member of the crowd in

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,880
particular, Sergeant Jack Frost, with his awesome blue hair and kind of blue face,

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,360
dressed head to toe in regular clothes, an MK-16 SCAR, 12 Apostle Bandolier, and Kevlar vest,

34
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:02,960
easily blending in with the crowd. He puts his finger to his earpiece. "Yukon. Any sign of the

35
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,640
HVT?" Over intercom, we hear a barking prospector's voice. "That be as a negative, J.F." We cut to

36
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,560
Lieutenant Yukon Cornelius, a nine-foot tall beast of a man wearing Oakley's, and a t-shirt that says,

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,560
This isn't a beer belly, it's a fuel tank for a sex machine, and nothing else.

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,560
He's standing right in front of a mall directory nearby, completely blocking an elderly woman's view.

39
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,560
"The insert's been clean since the R.O.N. took point last night!"

40
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,560
"Okay, stay frosty, Yukon. If you get a whiff of him, grease the fucker where he stands."

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,560
"Amen, Sergeant!" Yukon begins absentmindedly licking his gun as the old woman slinks away.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,560
We cut back to the wet t-shirt contest.

43
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,420
Now who wants to get these Santas? Who wants to see them get wet? The crowd erupts into thunderous cheers like the Beatles

44
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,780
All right

45
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,040
So we have a very special contest winner this year that will get a chance to dredge these Santas in that sticky icky nog

46
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,900
This young man was a 1 millionth customer at the Duluth Mega Mall Big Lots making him our Dunkaroo of the year

47
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:06,200
Come on out Sullivan the Frog! A meek dapper little frog waddles up to the stage and smiles sheepishly at the crowd

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,720
Sullivan, are you ready?

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,560
"As ready as I'll ever be, I suppose."

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,400
"That's the spirit! Okay, Sullivan, pull that string!"

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,220
The crowd starts chanting, "Pull that string! Pull that string!" as the Santas mug for everyone,

52
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,580
twisting their tiny, hard nipples and gaping.

53
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,060
Sullivan reaches for the string, but he's a tad short.

54
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,260
He's swatting at it.

55
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,320
Finally, he jumps up and yanks the string.

56
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,800
Everything slows down to bullet-time speeds.

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,000
We hear nothing but a steady heartbeat,

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,640
and cut to the Santas, pushing their hairy tits together and making kissy faces.

59
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,420
Cut to the Milky Eggnog sloshing around in the trough above.

60
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,580
Cut to Sullivan the frog, feet dangling as he haplessly pulls on the candy cane string.

61
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,740
Cut to the crowd, screaming like wild apes.

62
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,740
Cut to the announcer, dramatically gesturing to the scene.

63
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:49,460
And finally cut to Sergeant Jack Frost.

64
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,980
His face, ever focused, ever stern.

65
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,980
We punch in on his eyes as they scan the scene.

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,020
We cut to his point of view.

67
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,100
We glance over the crowd, then back to Jack's eyes.

68
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,820
Back to the crowd.

69
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,540
What's that?

70
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,620
That man there in the bomber jacket.

71
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,500
Cut to Jack's eyes.

72
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,580
Cut to the eggnog, about to spill over the Santa's.

73
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,300
Cut to that man.

74
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,260
Who is that?

75
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,700
Is that a tuft of green hair?

76
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,140
Back to the Santa's.

77
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,860
To the eggnog.

78
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,860
About to land on them, to the tuft of green hair!

79
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,860
Poking from a man's black beanie!

80
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Cut to Jack's eyes widening.

81
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,860
"Looook ouuuut."

82
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,860
But it's too late.

83
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,860
It was over the second Sullivan pulled the string.

84
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Splash goes the eggnog, click goes something else.

85
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:23,860
Boom, time resumes.

86
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,860
The stores and the mall all explode, one by one in a row.

87
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,860
Boom boom boom boom boom boom boom.

88
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,860
The stage, too. Boom.

89
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,860
Out shoots fire, and rotten eggs, and slime.

90
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,860
Yuck!

91
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,860
Destroying the beautiful holiday displays across the mall, and killing hundreds.

92
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,660
Chaos in the crowd outside the contest, the Santas maimed beyond belief, the eggnog stinging

93
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:43,900
their wounds, Sullivan turned to a green paste, the Hungry Hamster nativity scene covered in

94
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:49,140
blood and viscera, the Hungry Hamster model in Jesus' manger, its head blown off.

95
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,900
Jack gets up from being knocked by the force of the explosion, but his target has already

96
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,140
dashed away, halfway across the mall, addressing his team.

97
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:59,860
"Red Alpha, get on my 916 and take point to Dago, Blue take Charlie to Guinea and meet

98
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,340
Red on WAP, insert South.

99
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,580
Yukon, you're with me, move move move."

100
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:08,160
Meanwhile, the sing-songy baritone of the Grinch theme croons eerily throughout the mall as

101
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,140
our hero sprints through the catastrophe, the injured and dead littering the floor as they

102
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,460
try to catch up to their target.

103
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:16,540
"You're a mean one indeed, Mr. Grinch," Frost thinks.

104
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,660
All three teams finally meet at the front of the mall and charge through the front doors

105
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,660
together.

106
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,300
Exterior, Duluth, Megamall Day.

107
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,860
The Spec Ops Holiday Unit piles out, their scars ready, scanning the horizon for that

108
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,340
cackling bastard.

109
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:29,900
Frost, knowing better, looks up.

110
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,540
With his beanie gone, his full green nudity revealed, and his awful, terrible smile haunting

111
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:38,820
his face. The Grinch flies with his Hello Kitty backpack helicopter some 1,000 feet in the air,

112
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,140
carrying a massive sack of presents for good little boys and girls. "Maybe next time, Jack Frost."

113
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,300
Jack stares at the sky, lowering his scar, completely defeated. Suddenly, kablam,

114
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,820
something in the sky explodes. The troops cover their eyes from the bright light of the fiery

115
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:59,540
explosion, only to look up a moment later to see the final insult to injury. Spelled out clear as

116
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,620
day in rotten, stinky, lump of coal black smoke. It reads, "This time I'm gonna fuck the presents."

117
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:13,140
"Jack, what are we gonna do?" says Yukon. "I need to get the team back together."

118
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,500
Cut to main titles. Yule Team 6.

119
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:25,940
Wow. Beautiful. Christ. You really outdone yourself. I hope so.

120
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:33,580
So, now we're exterior. Ethiopia's Danikil Depression Day.

121
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:39,880
The scorching sun beats down the horrible salted sulfuric ground of the Danikil Depression in northern, a far region of Ethiopia.

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,180
Did I pronounce that right? There's no way to know. The most uninhabitable place on Earth,

123
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,980
a collision of tectonic plates creating deadly sulfuric hot springs.

124
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,180
The depression is surrounded by volcanoes and is literally the hottest place on Earth.

125
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:56,180
There are forms of bacteria found in Ethiopia's Danikil Depression that exist nowhere else on Earth.

126
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,980
It's been used to study how life may form on other planets, like Mars, or other Mars.

127
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:05,380
The irony is, some paleontologists believe that depression to be the cradle of civilization.

128
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,980
Maybe that's why the world's greatest killer, Soldier's Wrath, has retired here.

129
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:16,480
Sergeant Jack Frost saunters up to his cave where he lay, where he's, you know, he's there.

130
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:22,380
"Soldier. Soldier's Wrath. Are you here?"

131
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,580
"Oh, I'm here."

132
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,780
Why don't you tell me a little bit about Soldier's Wrath?

133
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,280
*laughs*

134
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:28,780
Okay.

135
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,780
I've gone by many names in my lifetime.

136
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,780
Darkness the Destroyer,

137
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,780
the Shinjuku Master Lord,

138
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
the wickedly evil demon.

139
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,780
But now folks just call me Soldier's Wrath.

140
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,780
I can be found wherever there's conflict.

141
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:48,780
A menacing mercenary bringing death to all who oppose my employers.

142
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,780
On the lower half of my face I have a Bane mask,

143
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,780
and on the upper half I have Splinter Cell goggles.

144
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:59,980
snake plissken eye patches over two of the lenses. I have the cape of Todd McFarlane's

145
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:06,140
spawn and the strategic mind of Seth McFarlane's Stewie. I'm wearing Morpheus sunglasses and

146
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:10,700
my boots have spikes on the bottom like the scary guy from the Spongebob movie and I have

147
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,540
Boba Fett chest armor with a Mario color scheme and I'm wearing Hulk shorts. I have the knuckle

148
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,100
tattoos from Night of the Hunter but instead of love it says hate and instead of hate it

149
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:26,620
says tactical. The last thing my enemies ever see is my machine gun which is named Destiny's

150
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,140
Fate and it shoots bullets which are named Insanity's Predilection.

151
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:38,740
So uh yeah, Soldier's Wrath. Jack Frost tries to begin the conversation again.

152
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:45,900
Soldier's... Wrath. It's gonna be tough. I think we're also both gonna sound like this

153
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:53,820
it seems like we both sort of never mind we need you America needs you the world

154
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,620
needs you Christmas needs you the Grinch is back huh I thought this might happen

155
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:11,820
you okay tell me just one thing frost is there gonna be killing oh is there gonna

156
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,820

161

162
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,360

164

Okay, good.

00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,500
It's like Mexico City.

292
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,940
Right, now I'm picking up on it, yeah.

293
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,140
Before I was like, that's weird, but then I was like, there are a lot of cities like that.

294
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,620
Yeah, like Oklahoma City, sort of, you know.

All right, yeah i'm gonna we're now we're now we're somewhere else exterior Ann Arbor, Michigan

300
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,180
Hype house is come and go, but the go blue house never dies.

301
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,820
Here's where superstar Lieutenant Clargon has been chilling since it was a halfway house

302
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:13,620
for Ann Arbor rich kids who got addicted to pills.

303
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:18,700
Clargon manages the house, all the influencers in it through hard work, dedication, and creating

304
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,980
15 separate fan accounts to hype him up, one for each race, he says.

305
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,540
Clargon is a talented warrior in his own right.

306
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,340
With his insanely stupid and impractical bolt action rifle, there isn't anything he can't

307
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,340
do.

308
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,700
Sergeant Jack Frost with his team knocks on the door of the Go Blue house.

309
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
Glargon!

310
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
Identify yourself.

311
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
Oh no.

312
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:45,460
You are going, you like, right now, right now, like by knocking on my door, you are telling

313
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,860
me you don't care.

314
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,900
Like my family doesn't live here, they live somewhere else.

315
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,940
They actually live like, uh, here, here, uh, Auburn Hills, actually.

316
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,940
Like they just moved there.

317
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,940
I haven't been by there.

318
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:59,180
It was like a whole fucking thing would happen where, like, I didn't clean the grill and

319
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,940
and it's like I helped pick out the grill.

320
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,660
I would like way to get the fucking new house

321
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,880
off on a bad foot.

322
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,220
Like, oh yeah, I'm gonna clean the grill.

323
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:11,060
I told you what fucking grill to buy.

324
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,460
But anyway, like if my family was here

325
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,660
and they opened the door and you were like a type

326
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,780
of criminal that would shoot them.

327
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,600
- Right.

328
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,540
- How the fuck like kill me every day, all day,

329
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,380
anytime, anywhere.

330
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,340
- I'm following you.

331
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,440
Yeah, go on.

332
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:32,220
Like, you have a lot of fucking balls coming to my house when you could potentially could be a BTK.

333
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,220
Look, Qlargon, I know the Grinch mission didn't end well, but I got the team back together.

334
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,220
We need to fight the Grinch again.

335
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,220
We need you. We need your bolt-action rifle.

336
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:50,220
Yeah, honestly, like, I have a lot of, like, PCD and all types of stuff from the last mission,

337
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,060
And it's like, I would never be the type of guy who goes out there in the world and fucking talks about like,

338
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:01,020
"Oh, you know, I have this problem, I have that problem, you know, I feel bad for me, I'm not responsible for what I do."

339
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:06,380
But like, honestly, since that mission, I cannot tell right from wrong.

340
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,360
Oh.

341
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:13,140
And it's responsible, it's the reason why I've done so many bad things since then.

342
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,000
Right.

343
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,320
Well, Argon, he's gonna fuck the presence this time.

344
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:20,540
And wait till you hear what he's doing. Oh, fuck you stole it.

345
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:30,380
You know, honestly, I got to say I'm the last person who I ever thought would hear myself

346
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:37,020
saying this. But one man's terrorist is another man's soldier.

347
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:43,180
I'm asking you to be a terrorist for us. I mean, or a soldier. I'm actually a little

348
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:48,620
confused now I'm sorry. Whichever you want to be you can be that. Yeah honestly I never

349
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:56,300
thought about it that way. I'll do it on like one condition. Name it. Let me say goodbye

350
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:00,500
to these people at this influencer house who have been like basically my family, my real

351
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:08,680
family ever since the mission. Yeah who's in the house with you? Yeah we got my boy fucking

352
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,680
Chadster Jake.

353
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
What's up?

354
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,680
Yeah.

355
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,680
Oh shit, there's two of us.

356
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,680
We're twins.

357
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
No, you're Chadster, I'm Jake.

358
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
What's up?

359
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,680
Jake Joshin.

360
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:29,680
And my girl, like I never thought there'd be a girl in this influencer house, but honestly,

361
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,360
she's been like, she shows that like women, like at least half the time can be the same

362
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,360
as men.

363
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Clarissa, Clarissa Smuckers.

364
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,360
Hey.

365
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,960
Hey.

366
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,520
So I know for a fact that I'm the most important person in all of your lives.

367
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,240
I don't know, until this moment, I didn't know if you were the most important people

368
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
in mind.

369
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,520
But sometimes to be someone who's important in someone else's life, to be who they meant

370
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:00,320
to be for you, you've got to be who they are for them.

371
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,080
And sometimes the, you know, they say like, if you love something, abandon it.

372
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,560
And that's what I'm doing right now.

373
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,800
Stay clean, don't take pills you find on the floor.

374
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,160
Only take them if a doctor or someone who got them from a doctor took them and could

375
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,560
verify it for you.

376
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,560
And just be yourself.

377
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,680
I love you guys.

378
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,160
If I die on this mission, please tell my family it was their fault.

379
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
Will do.

380
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,160
Sounds good, Skipper.

381
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:33,600
Dude, honestly, yeah, you're the realest fucker ever, dude.

382
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,280
I know I don't know what we would have what we would do without you, but you know, I guess we're like

383
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,280
We're probably pretty bad. Yeah

384
00:21:40,280 --> 00:22:01,080
I will I will remember your life forever. Keep doing

385
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:08,080
the

386
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,400
the

387
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:24,520

Unfortunately, we may never know.

416
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,980
But it gets me in whatever it is.

417
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980

You're so right.

00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:54,580
So yeah, we get Chris Pratt out of the white people's zoo after signing some paperwork.

448
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,580
I slam my head against the plexiglass until there's a crack in it.

449
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:04,580
And yeah, you guys, the team is back together.

450
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:06,580
My voice is cracking.

451
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:15,580
And we are now, so the team now goes to, Sergeant Jack Frost brings you all to the Holiday HQ.

452
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:18,940
HQ, United States Secret Holiday HQ, which is underneath the

453
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,820
Senior Frogs in Times Square. And after passing through multiple security

454
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,940
checks, retinal and rectal scans, a ping test,

455
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,460
two-factor authentication, you reach a final massive

456
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:36,460
like Krabby Patty vault-sized door. And Jack Frost says, "The password is

457
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,660
'Ding, fries are done.'" And the massive vault

458
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,980
turns open and you see a state-of-the-art facility of all,

459
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:47,540

steel and metal in computers and call graphic technology

467
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,340

uh... and there's also of course the holiday deck

476
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,140
which is where any battle simulations can be played out in real time

477
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,460
uh... everything that happens in their

00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:44,100
- Let's debrief the team here on Operation Tokyo Melanoma.

493
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,240
And Cortana pulls up a hologram and presents the mission,

00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,120
briefing information with maps, video clips, audio.

495
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,040
She presents it like Vanna White.

496
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,280
Jack Frost says, "You know your target by now,

497
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,340
"it's the Grinch.

498
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:58,160
"We thought he was done when Zohan threw him

499
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:01,500
"in the volcano in Portugal, but it seems like he lived.

500
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,140
"We have ample reason to believe he carried out

501
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,060
terrorist attack and do it with mega mall and he's gonna strike again before Christmas Day.

502

505
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:32,780
Protest in in Ann Arbor. I started the the uh the fucking Ann Arbor chapter of Black Guys and

506
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,020
Are you saying there are black people?

507
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:49,260
No, it's more like, okay, so there's in the world, there's a lot of societies and in those societies, there's this thing called police, police mutality.

508
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:55,220
And it's basically like I was I just had seen enough. I was like, let's end it.

509
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,340
Oh, respect, respect.

510
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:02,060
Thank you. Um, so like, we got to get black Santa back, especially,

511
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,140
especially black santa

512
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,340
yeah agreed

513
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,820
now that there is a good black guys friend in the oval office is like more

514
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,420
important

515
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:14,700
uh... it couldn't agree more clark on

516
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,460
and that gives us a president

517
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,860
uh...

518
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,360
our sources tell us the grinch is holed up in the back of stan

519
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,120
and in the capital city of who did that

520
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:29,500
and another one of our sources a double agent who came to our side claims they

521
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,500
They know exactly where the Grinch's Bahambug Fortress is located.

522
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:36,500
You'll be dropping in the Candy Cane Forest outside of the city.

523
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:41,500
You'll be met with resistance fighters, gumdrop mines, missile tows, and things we can't even predict.

524
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:45,500
If you move quickly, it'll take you about half a day to get in the city. We can't drop you any closer.

525
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,500
We don't want you to get caught. You'll be assuming new identities once you're there.

526
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:52,500
And then you're going to go to a safe house in South Hooterdad.

527
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,500
My contact, Charlie Brown, he owns the place. He'll let you in for the mission.

528
00:31:57,500 --> 00:32:00,300
He's a civilian, so don't make too much trouble for him.

529
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,420
When you reach his house, he'll greet you outside.

530
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,900
He'll say, "One, cut a hole in the box."

531
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,460
You'll say, "Two, put your junk in that box."

532
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,860
Then he'll say, "Three, make her open the box."

533
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,860
And then together you'll say, "And that's the way we do it.

534
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,300
It's my dick in the box."

535
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,820
That way he'll know it's you for sure.

536
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:18,940
Once you're settled in there, you'll put on your disguises

537
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:21,740
and meet our special friend, the double agent codenamed Rudolph

538
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,540
at the Jollibee's Bar and Grill in the center of Hooterdad.

539
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,500
He'll give you the location the blueprints of the Bahamut fortress

540
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:33,740
After that, you'll storm the fortress and you'll do whatever you you know, you know, you'll kill the Grinch probably

541
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,860
any questions

542
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,020
Yeah, can you repeat all that? Okay

543
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,860
I'm genuinely running out of gravel in my voice and it's my fault

544
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:49,660
I didn't know there was a finite amount until now

545
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,620
Uh, which part do you want me to repeat the whole thing?

546
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,140
The whole thing. You know what I can do? Here, I've got a PDF. Just, do you have a phone?

547
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:05,180
No. I can airdrop. They took my phone in the zoo. Okay, well I'll get something printed out for you

548
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:09,820
later. Okay. Does anybody else have any questions about this mission? Can you repeat that thing

549
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:16,380
about the PDFs? Hold on. Anybody else have any questions about this mission? Yeah, what,

550
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,780
can you repeat that last thing you said? You are the same person. You know that, right, Chris?

551
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:29,780
Okay, so we're gonna in 100 hours we're gonna commence training at the holiday deck.

552
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:34,780
So get suited up, say hello to old friends. I trust you all to remember where your old gear is.

553
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:43,780
Let's get to work. You're free to roam the headquarters and then we'll just meet up at the holiday deck and you'll do a training session.

554
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,780
I started doing P90X.

555
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:58,860
the

556
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,860
that pretty easily. What are you doing there?

557
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:08,860
Um, first thing I do is clog the toilet.

558
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:20,860
I haven't used a real toilet in years and just the act of wiping excites me too much.

559
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:25,860
I'm sharpening my bullets using like a cool stone.

560
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:31,980
I sit down crisscross applesauce in the middle of the floor and put my head in my hands hoping

561
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,980
that a girl will notice.

562
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:43,300
I just keep offering a dowry to like any woman who walks in.

563
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:48,300
You guys all harass somebody in some way for the remainder of your time and you get some

564
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:53,580
Christmas hams and some cookies and you guys show up to the holiday deck.

565
00:34:53,580 --> 00:35:01,340
water overflowing out of the toilet. I'm laying in it and I'm doing like snow angels. I'm

566
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,180
rebaptizing myself! I'm rebaptizing myself! The water is flowing and you literally end

567
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:12,260
up swimming. It just floats you down to the holiday deck. It's like the shape of water

568
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:20,900
where she fills up the bathroom with the water. You guys enter the holiday deck and Jack Frost

569
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:25,500
sort of talks you over intercom. He says we need to make sure you guys are all up to snuff.

570
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:30,840
It's been so long since you've been in combat about a few months, I guess. The holiday deck

571
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:36,480
has improved quite a bit. So Cortana load up Fred Claus and you see right away just a perfect

572
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,580
Fred Claus shows up in front of you guys. He's a shoot him. Let's go. Okay. Yeah, roll

573
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:47,420

574
00:35:47,420 --> 00:35:50,540

577
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:09,900
sounds it's so hard I tried to learn an impression it's not possible I have a

578
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:13,340
certain quality Vaughn's libertarian right yeah I think he's something like

579
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:20,620
that. Age of consent is bullshit. Yeah, yeah and he says that and then he gets completely lit up by

580
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:26,540
your minigun and you see Jack Frost go, "Not bad, now what do you think of this?" and he loads up

581
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:33,980
15 Fred Clauses in front of all of you and everyone's gonna roll for initiative for this

660
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,980
actually just for swag points i i uh... because i'm the zone out of the on and

661
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,340
then every skilled

662
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:12,860
yes i i i i i build a uh... a bill a small sort of like sheet rock wall

663
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,300
in front of the guy

664
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,300
and i'm attacking and i kick through that

665
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,740
into his face and i got it

666
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,780
probably killaments did you build the while you're building the she rock wall

667
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:39,460
the

668
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:45,460
Vince Vons turns and they're gonna try to swarm you uh uh Zohan since you're up on them um let's

669
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:51,540
see how they do okay yeah a few of them do get some land some punches on you uh you take uh

670
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:57,700
these Vince Vons are pretty weak you take three damage that's it from the punches um and it's

671
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,180
just like a few of them just like jumping on you and just and doing their their kind of uh yeah

672
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:05,020
Incredulous improv that Vince Vaughn's do and

673
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:08,300
Now it is

674
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,820
Yeah, it's your turn

675
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:18,300
Oh wait shit. No, Thomas got a yo Thomas. You're up. Oh, no, it's not. It's sorry. It's Patrick. So Chris fucking pick whose turn

676
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:22,700
Man this is the most unprofessional thing I've ever been

677
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:27,540
What do you do Chris

678
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,740
All right, so they're all I mean

679
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,420
No, and Vince Vaughn, he's probably

680
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:40,760
Distracted right now talking to the other Vince Vaughn's. Yeah, they're all agreeing with each other. You were so nice. You were so good in dodgeball

681
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:49,860
Hey, you were so good that remake of psycho underrated

682
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:54,980
Yeah, so while there's like a group of them together, I'm gonna throw

683
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,200
What's this blinded by is that a flashbang? Yeah, it's a flashbang

684
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,080
Then I'm gonna throw the Molotov slushy at him. Yeah, go for it

685
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:08,640
Yeah that fucking that hits them and

686
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,120
Wow shit, you're gonna do a lot of damage to them. Yeah

687
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,640
Okay. Yeah, it's just a bad role

688
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:22,880
But you still like get slushy on like ten of them and they also now can't move like they're they're fucking like frozen from the

689
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,880
slushy explosion

690
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:31,760
Yeah, okay. All right, then uh, I have another attack. I'll just go Tommy boy gun while they're frozen. Yeah, do it

691
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,900
Yeah, that's a crit roll for damage

692
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:40,020
11 yeah, you just care we go. Yeah, that's beautiful. You just killed like

693
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,860
16 of them. How do you do it?

694
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,860
Very carefully. Yeah, okay great and

695
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:48,600
Thomas you're up

696
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:54,060
Let's see, I've got this this terrible ak-47 and I've got this

697
00:42:55,120 --> 00:43:01,260
I've got a character carved into it and I say it's Arabic for joy, but it's clearly like maybe Chinese

698
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,600
And I'm just gonna I'm just gonna pull that out and start spraying

699
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:10,040
Yeah, do it it might jam, but we'll see

700
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,960
Yeah, that hits for sure

701
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,460
Yeah

702
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:19,180
You did one of the ones that were that were like that was fucked up with by the slushy and you could attack again -

703
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,840
If you want to attack again or I'll probably do some of my traditional Afghani martial arts. Mm-hmm

704
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:28,840
which involves

705
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:34,200
Yeah, what does that involve? It's a good question much what you'd expect. Okay, you know cuz say no more

706
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:38,320
It sounds clear to me. Yeah, um, it's

707
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:44,100
It's like how you'd react if you just like we're attacked by like a medium-sized dog

708
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,000
yeah, it's just like a

709
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,120
throws and then

710
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:54,320
I've got it. I may or may not have a turban on depending on what

711
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,480
And if I do which maybe I don't

712
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,320
Then maybe I sort of whip with that like I have a little hook on the end of it. It's right. I

713
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,840
Can pretty much do whatever I want

714
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:14,600
Yeah do that so I probably do that like a million times

715
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,480
Yeah, I forgot to put that in there but you could do that a million times but you're right

716
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,160
Yeah, I'll probably a million times. Yeah, yeah, yeah roll for it. Hey, maybe

717
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,840
Yeah, yeah, it doesn't hit it's a seven

718
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:38,440
And Clark God you're out

719
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,800
All right

720
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:47,640
So like I don't want to use my bolt action. It's fun. It's obviously very important to Clark on right

721
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:50,720
Like God got me through a lot of tough times

722
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,440
so I'm gonna take out my scar and

723
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:57,400
I

724
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,560
I lied down on my back

725
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:07,200
But like I sort of like put my it's like you have your head to propped up on a pillow. Yeah, it is actually

726
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:13,640
It actually hurts my windpipe, but in my mind, I think that's the most accurate way to shoot

727
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,000
a gun.

728
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,440
So I just sort of try to line them up.

729
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,440
Yeah, you look like your tummy's full after a big Thanksgiving meal.

730
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,320
Yeah, yeah.

731
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:32,760
And I have something to say to Vince Vaughn, and it is, hey, you may have done the breakup,

732
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,080
but now we're breaking up.

733
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,080
My favorite that's color guns favorite movie of all I don't know. I don't know what you're talking about, you know the breakup

734
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:45,800
I don't even see that movie. Yes, you know, they're just vamping. They don't know they're they're AI they're hurt, but they don't know why

735
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:51,800
Just yeah, I feel like I'm getting blown off and it makes me really mad

736
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,800
So I'm just gonna start firing. Yeah

737
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,040
Rolling nice as a critical one

738
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,040
I'm so my aim is so fucking good. I start going like

739
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:17,320
Nice to catch one of them like like but like you catch one of them in the shoulder somehow, but yeah, otherwise just I

740
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:22,280
Instantly turn to the group in any theoretical girls, you know, honestly

741
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:28,360
I probably have the most bodies in every sense of the word in any war I've ever been in but

742
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,920
you don't really feel PSD or

743
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:39,580
TSD or or ODST until you fucking have to fire on someone who is once a friend as

744
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:45,120
is Vince Vaughn. And the Jack Frost you see him he's like he's like all right

745
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,280
this is all I can already see how tough you guys are I'm gonna turn up the

746
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:52,700
bonds meter more and he turns it up and you see like 500 Vince Vaughns and then

747
00:46:52,700 --> 00:47:01,420
you see everything go completely dark and he's like and Cortana's like like

748
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:08,460
power off you know with joshie says and uh the lights come back on oh my god am i [ __ ] dead

749
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:13,100
all the vince vons are dude no i see the [ __ ] light at the end of the tunnel

750
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:19,020
oh my god oh my god wait god wait god is e from entourage

751
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:24,620
my favorite character of all time finally i can go to hell

752
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,940
and all the vince vons have the grinch face and they stare at you all blankly and then they make

753
00:47:34,940 --> 00:47:41,020
the creepy ass grinch smile and you see jack frost from behind the the plexiglass in the holiday deck

754
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:45,660
he's like i don't know what's going on this isn't in the simulation cortana what's going on run

755
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,220
diagnostics and she said i already did run diagnostics you're right this isn't in the

756
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:58,220
simulation hey run it again okay she starts running it again meanwhile you see uh the grinch

757
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:04,060
Space says, uh, well, it looks like the whole gang's back together.

758
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,160
How do you know?

759
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,760
Because I'm looking at you.

760
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,560
We could have an extra guy that you don't know about.

761
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,960
There could be a new guy.

762
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,660
You could have got a new guy.

763
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,160
Oh, yeah.

764
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,260
Where is he?

765
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,360
He's in the bathroom.

766
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,960
You all said that at the same time.

767
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,860
So that makes me really suspect.

768
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,660
Yeah, that just means it's more true.

769
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:35,300
Honestly, the odds of everyone coming up with the same lie at once are very low in odds,

770
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,500
and it's only happened to me two or three times in my life.

771
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:42,420
I guess I'm thinking about it, I can see both sides of sort of what I'm saying.

772
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:47,540
Look, I'm infiltrating your base to tell you to come and get it.

773
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:52,860
You're never gonna stop me, and I know you're coming for me, and I'm gonna stop you when

774
00:48:52,860 --> 00:48:54,580
you try to come for me.

775
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,020
You try- if-

776
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,660
Listen, listen here you fucking green cocksucker.

777
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,300
Oh shit.

778
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:06,100
If you try to stop me when I'm stopping you to start what you started before you stop it,

779
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:11,460
and I stop it when you start me, well you're gonna be ending a whole new thing that you're

780
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:12,180
fucking starting.

781
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:16,340
You can fucking- you can fucking tell anybody that.

782
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:18,500
You tell your fucking boss that.

783
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:22,100
I'll tell my boss that and then I'll tell him that you tried to stop me from starting to

784
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,820
to stop on you and that's when you're gonna really feel it.

785
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:25,780
'Cause that's what's gonna happen

786
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:27,240
after you start stopping me.

787
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,740
We try to start doing that.

788
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,980
That's when it's up.

789
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,800
- Hey, you know what?

790
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,640
You know what?

791
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:33,460
That's fucking fine.

792
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:34,300
That's fucking fine.

793
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,300
- All the Gritches are saying this.

794
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,340
All the Gritches are saying this at the same time.

795
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,700
All 100 of them.

796
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,100
- All of you, all of you,

797
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,340
I want you to remember this right now.

798
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:44,700
- Go for it.

799
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,180
- I didn't start this,

800
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:49,500
but,

801
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,820
fuck.

802
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:53,820
How does this usually go?

803
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,820
Oh yeah yeah yeah!

804
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:56,820
No, I didn't start this.

805
00:49:56,820 --> 00:49:58,820
But when it ends...

806
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:00,820
I'll be the one that started that ending.

807
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,820
Roll an intimidation check with advantage.

808
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,820
Yeah, you're right. That was cool.

809
00:50:07,820 --> 00:50:11,820
You see the Grinch?

810
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,820
You see beads of sweat on the Grinch's forehead.

811
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:18,820
You think, "Well, I've got something to do anyway, so..."

812
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:22,740
I think that, I think these AI Grinches just peed.

813
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,260
That's not real pee, that's, that's the-

814
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:25,260
I'm seeing pee!

815
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,260
Yeah.

816
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,260
That's the holiday Dexter's filling up with AI pee.

817
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,260
It's a hundred-

818
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,980
Just ones and zeros, it's not real pee.

819
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:37,660
Oh, oh, it's, it's, I hate this.

820
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:39,020
I hate this so much.

821
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,900
I'm, I'm gonna get out of here.

822
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,420
I'm gonna go lube up my, my penis to fuck the presents.

823
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:45,700
To pee some more?

824
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:48,380
No, that's not what lube is for, I think.

825
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:54,380
using P as lube? No I'm not. Stop putting words in my mouth. It's totally fine if he does,

826
00:50:54,380 --> 00:51:03,260
like P is sterile. I wouldn't do it, but hey, you know what? If it's recommended by my team,

827
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:08,060
I might try it. I love you guys. It's not bad for you, I love you too. You're the realest

828
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,940

831
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,380

832
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:21,340

833
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:23,000
under the ground

834
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:23,960

836
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,740

843
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:54,300
infiltrating that's not ok

844
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,940
that should not be sacred sacred train

845
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:58,360
damn right it's not

846
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,780

00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:04,420
uh... i am i am holding your shit accountable

848
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:07,340
you know what this uh... the second time that's happened to me today and i'm

849
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,760
learning

850
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,380
i'm growing in learning and i have ten more tweets about that in a second

851
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:16,700
but first they used to use to eat longer dot com

852
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,020
uh... it longer dot com what's that

853
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:24,740
this is a great website that she tweeted more than a hundred forty characters

854
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:28,720
it's really how is it possible to donate to them

855
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,180
that's right so on how is that possible more than a hundred and forty characters

856
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,020
How is it possible on Twitter.com?

857
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,340
It just drops a link for you.

858
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,580
Oh my god.

859
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,420
That's amazing.

860
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,660
Maybe I'll have to try it later when I apologize

861
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:47,020
about something I said about hungry or something.

862
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,780
(laughing)

863
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:52,060
It is, there's nothing better to use than twit longer

864
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:54,260
for when you're accused of something you did not do.

865
00:52:54,260 --> 00:52:56,500
Yeah, it used to be, it used to be pay spin,

866
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:58,420
but now I don't know where that went.

867
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:01,940
Too many people who were actually guilty used pay spin.

868
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,100
(laughing)

869
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,100
But all the innocent people use TwitLonger.

870
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:14,100
Yeah, that's why some of our famous clients like Harvey Weinstein, Louis CK, Alan Dershowitz,

871
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,100
David Geffen all of you use TwitLonger.

872
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,100
Can we not talk about Alan Dershowitz?

873
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:23,100
He was like the godfather at my confirmation.

874
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,100
I'm sorry about that.

875
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:26,100
Cherokee confirmation.

876
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,100
He's a really good guy.

877
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,100
Once you actually get to know him.

878
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,600
We'll take that out of the ad read I'm sorry about that

879
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,640
He's a guy who helped me hide the Malaysian Airlines

880
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:46,640
So, please, have some respect.

881
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:47,640
Goddamn.

882
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:59,640
Yeah, I heard he hid it in Pharrell's hat.

883
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:01,880
(laughing)

884
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:07,240
- That's just a rumor I heard.

885
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:09,180
- That was so 2014.

886
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,620
(laughing)

887
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:14,220
- Chris, I wish I had a FameStar cup I could give you.

888
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,520
(laughing)

889
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:18,220
- Thanks for the cup, darling.

890
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:20,460

00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:25,920

00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:14,860
plane

915
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:17,180
into the candy cane forest

916
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,500

Okay, we could circle a few more times.

921
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:32,780
I'm like shaking like a junkie because this is the longest I've ever gone without having sex.

922
00:55:32,780 --> 00:55:34,780
[Laughter]

923
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:38,780
Look, we all offered to do something for you, Zohan,

924
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:41,780
but you turned us down, so I don't know what to tell you, man.

925
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:47,780
I just leap out of the plane instantly without saying anything.

926
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:49,780
Okay, uh...

927
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,780
Everyone should jump. Everyone should jump now.

928
00:55:53,780 --> 00:56:00,780

929
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:01,620
Oh, nice.

930
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:02,460
Yeah, everybody roll athletics.

931
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:03,540
I'm so not sure if I got a turbine or not,

932
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:05,620
but if I have a turbine, I'm using it as a parachute.

933
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,580
You have a huge turbine.

934
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:10,540
You have the biggest turbine, like a Ben Garrison cartoon.

935
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,300
Just like a, a huge turbine.

936
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:17,060
Oh, for me, it's a normal sized turbine, from my culture.

937
00:56:17,060 --> 00:56:18,500
Oh no, Caleb.

938
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,320
So hot.

939
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,300
I gotta crit one, dude.

940
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,660
What are we rolling here?

941
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,780
Athletics.

942
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,700
Yeah, what are we rolling here?

943
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:27,000
I think I clicked the wrong button or something.

944
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:33,140
say you are dropping down here rushing past you as you fall through the sky

945
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,200
uh... you know

946
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:39,620
the temperature starts to drop i could get used to this all over again

947
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:46,300
and uh... you start to see the massive candy cane trees coming into view

948
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:48,260
uh... chris pratt

949
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:50,700
you fuckin

950
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,700
you've missed this so much it's so much better than a zoo

951
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:56,940
it's so much more freedom than you've ever had in a long time

952
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,580
This feels nothing like a cattle prod, I'll tell you that.

953
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:05,440
You know, with the 21 you're just like flipping around, you're doing all kinds of fucking

954
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:07,460
sky tricks.

955
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:08,460
It's a cool time.

956
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,940
Do you remember the intro scene of...

957
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:11,940
This Power Rangers movie?

00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:12,940

980
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,980
*laughter*

981
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:32,980
There's no cable.

982
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,980
*laughter*

983
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,980
Oh no!

984
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:38,980
*laughter*

985
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,980
I'm so sorry.

986
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:42,980
*laughter*

987
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,980
I noticed this light wasn't blinking.

988
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:46,980
I was like...

989
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,980
Oh no!

990
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,980
That explains why you're kinda quiet.

991
00:58:50,980 --> 00:58:52,980
It does explain your audio, like a lot.

992
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,980
I did just like, expect

993
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,980
that Thomas would just not know how to

994
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:58,940
how to like set up his microphone

995
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,540
and that's why it sounded so bad.

996
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:01,380
(laughing)

997
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:02,220
- It's literally, dude,

998
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:05,500
I literally just have to plug this cable into this.

999
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,980
It's plugged into the computer.

1000
00:59:06,980 --> 00:59:08,780
- All right, let's see it.

1001
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,620
- I'm so sorry. - Let's see what happens.

1002
00:59:09,620 --> 00:59:11,340
- This is gonna sound amazing, dude.

1003
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:13,180
- Plug my cable in and see what happens.

1004
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:15,420
(laughing)

1005
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,500
- Magically.

1006
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,340
- Oh my God. - Oh my God.

1007
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:19,020
- Oh my God. - So much better.

1008
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:19,860
- Really? - Yeah.

1009
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:21,700
- So much better.

1010
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,180
- You have to keep this in, Cameron,

1011
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:25,260
so that everyone can experience it together.

1012
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,460
- Yeah, I'm so sorry.

1013
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:28,100
No, it's rocks, dude.

1014
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,860
It adds to the narrative.

1015
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:31,020
Yeah, absolutely.

1016
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:32,380
Every time I talked, it was like,

1017
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,580
y'all were struggling to hear me.

1018
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,580
And I was like, I'm right next to the microphone.

1019
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:38,740
(all laughing)

1020
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,220
I don't get why I'm doing, my audio is great.

1021
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,340
And then I look and it's not plugged in.

1022
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,700
That's like, Thomas had a,

1023
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,220
he was trying to get like an ethernet cable

1024
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:51,840
ran up to his computer for like so long

1025
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,740
so that we could play games together.

1026
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,620
And then he sent a picture of the back of his computer

1027
00:59:56,620 --> 01:00:00,020
in a group chat and he had a wifi card the entire time.

1028
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,340
(laughing)

1029
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,380
- Yeah, it was like a seven month wait.

1030
01:00:03,380 --> 01:00:04,540
(laughing)

1031
01:00:04,540 --> 01:00:05,980
- It was so long, dude.

1032
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:11,460
- Well, back to it, I guess.

1033
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:13,060
(laughing)

1034
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,540
- We are better equipped than ever.

1035
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:17,380
- Yeah, definitely.

1036
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:18,580
This is only a good thing, dude.

1037
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:19,420
It's been fun already.

1038
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,420
- We're like an hour and a half into this.

1039
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,540
- Yeah, imagine if the opposite thing happened.

1040
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,800
(laughing)

1041
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:30,060
- Klargon, you're killing it, falling from the sky.

1042
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,420
This is easy for you.

1043
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,580
- Yeah. - You've done this before.

1044
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:36,380
- Yeah, I was born into a parachuting family.

1045
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:39,600
So this is really like whatever for me.

1046
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:40,800
- Yeah. - This is, yeah.

1047
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:43,140
Like no problem, no problem.

1048
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:48,140
- And Afghanistan, Mr. Afghanistan.

1049
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:50,840
Vlad. - Yes.

1050
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,320

1051
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,000
uh... you know you prize get your sea legs back a bit it's been a while since

1052
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,100

1053
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,300

and uh... yeah

1056
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,200

01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,860
and uh... when did correct

1058
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:09,960
uh... yeah you know that it's

1059
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,440
it's a a plan on

1060
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,260
yeah

1061
01:01:13,260 --> 01:01:14,520
i think uh...

1062
01:01:14,520 --> 01:01:16,880
she kept it is a little bit on the grounds

1063
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,240
and says though i don't know in a moment

1064
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,040
so on you are just like we teach it a refund not fucking to get this right

1065
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,580
here at the details

1066
01:01:24,580 --> 01:01:27,140
in yeah i'm just like screaming

1067
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:31,360
like i think i don't even realize that a parachute on i think it's a jane sport

1068
01:01:31,360 --> 01:01:32,520
the and

1069
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:36,460
i'm just free falling and i hit the ground but my penis lands perfectly in a

1070
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,800
hole in the ground

1071
01:01:37,800 --> 01:01:42,440
yeah uh... yeah and you you uh... uh...

1072
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,900
take and you were fully healed by the way but uh...

1073
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,640
you're gonna take

1074
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,680
uh...

1075
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:52,920
to damage from just falling uh... everybody else felt kinda perfectly

1076
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,860
uh... he has all landed in the candy cane forest

1077
01:01:56,860 --> 01:02:01,780
everything sticky in there's like the snow on the ground is like sugary powder

1078
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:02,980
and uh...

1079
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:04,900
uh...

1080
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,020
i need now so on unusual stealth check though

1081
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:10,020
only landed pretty hard

1082
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:13,700
i did

1083
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:24,860
Okay, 23. So you hear some rustling in the woods and you hear some people talking, but

1084
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:29,940
they don't notice you. And you all sort of, everybody roll a perception check now. Zohan

1085
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:36,980
with that 23, I mean you guys, Zohan you get a clear sense of where the insurgents are.

1086
01:02:36,980 --> 01:02:42,460
You know exactly where they are. You can communicate that to your team members. You guys have a

1087
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:49,500
a chance of I'd say with that crit you have a chance of everybody else rolled solo.

1088
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:54,260
Everybody else is not quite sure where anybody is but Zohan for some reason you know where

1089
01:02:54,260 --> 01:02:56,980
everything everyone is where all the insertions are.

1090
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:59,660
His penis went into the ground so he can feel the vibration.

1091
01:02:59,660 --> 01:03:00,660
Yeah exactly.

1092
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:01,660
Footsteps.

1093
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,660
I also immediately came.

1094
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:08,700
Just the friction of my penis entering the ground made me come instantly.

1095
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:11,700
This planet is Zohan tree.

1096
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,700
Let's see if it glows.

1097
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:15,700
And uh, yeah.

1098
01:03:15,700 --> 01:03:17,700
But I'm also like, I'm also like,

1099
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:19,700
you guys go ahead, I'll stay here.

1100
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
[Laughter]

1101
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:23,700
You guys, I'll catch up with you later.

1102
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,700
You could take point too,

1103
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,700
Zohan, now. So, uh,

1104
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,700
you can lead the group through the woods

1105
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,700
if you want to. Dude, I'll do it.

1106
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,700
Okay, cool.

1107
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,700
So what do you say to them? What are you guys planning on doing? You guys know there are

1108
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:37,700
insurgents around you.

1109
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:39,700
What's the strategy? Are they,

1110
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,100
do we like the insurgents or do we hate them so much?

1111
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:43,900
you hate them, they're Grinch insurgents

1112
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:46,900
insurgents is just a catch all word for something you're not supposed to like

1113
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,700
I say uh, follow me's

1114
01:03:48,700 --> 01:03:53,000
and then I start, I start swinging on the candy canes like monkey bars

1115
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,100
yeah, you guys follow him?

1116
01:03:54,100 --> 01:03:55,800
no, I start licking the candy cane

1117
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:58,300
no, dude, no, you can lick them all the way

1118
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:02,400
okay, if I can lick them all, what if I swing by my tongue?

1119
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,700
which is just a normal sized...

1120
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:06,300
yeah, of course, yeah, no problem

1121
01:04:06,300 --> 01:04:07,000
okay

1122
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:10,440
I'll let you try and you can roll an athletics check.

1123
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:11,440
Okay.

1124
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,120
Got an eight.

1125
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:15,680
Yeah, no, you just, you hurt your tongue.

1126
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,240
It's too, it's too spiky.

1127
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:28,680
It's a classic Christmas story joke.

1128
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:29,680
So uh, suck, suck, suck.

1129
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:30,680
suck.

1130
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:31,680
I said suck!

1131
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:37,120
I can't suck because my tongue got stuck in my teeth and it's not fun to sit.

1132
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:43,760
And with that expert perception check though Zohan too, I'm going to give you all advantage

1133
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:51,560
on your stealth roll and you're going to have to together be stealthy enough to avoid dealing

1134
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:52,880
with insurgents.

1135
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:58,080
But because Zohan got that crit on knowing exactly where they are, everybody rolls stealth

1136
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:02,800
role and you'll just take the highest number of the two. It is interesting to me that you made

1137
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:12,640
the only Jewish character. He has he has advantage in stealth and deception. I didn't that's just I

1138
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:17,120
just find that interesting. Nope that's the character of Zohan. He has a place in finance?

1139
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:23,520
That is well but he only had his own business he's a business owner in the movie.

1140
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:28,120
The only character played by a Jewish person is awful at deception.

1141
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:32,220
But that's a good point, but does it constantly?

1142
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:36,700
Well, you know, that's I'm just sort of figuring out what the

1143
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,900
right way to not get cancelled is so that's just sort of

1144
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:41,920
fine-tuning that it's a science.

1145
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:44,020
We have Thomas with his turban.

1146
01:05:44,020 --> 01:05:46,500
So we're all just sort of figuring it out together with

1147
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:48,320
all kind of working off that right now.

1148
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:48,820
Yeah.

1149
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,520
Yeah, that's the foundation.

1150
01:05:50,520 --> 01:05:52,720
Yeah, Thomas is sort of the touchstone here.

1151
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:57,040
Exactly. I'm texting Thomas tons of ideas.

1152
01:05:57,040 --> 01:06:03,920
I'm just sending him lines from the boondocks and I'm like, you should do this.

1153
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:08,240
It's the first hour and a half. My mic did work, but they blurred out the audio so you

1154
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:13,600
couldn't hear what I was saying. I'm like, oh, oh, now I can talk. This is cool.

1155
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:19,600
Okay. And so they're going to see if they hear you. Let's see.

1156
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,120
Chris Pratt, you are, you figured out you can't use your tongue, right?

1157
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,600
And so you've been just sort of swinging on the candy cane vines.

1158
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:38,400
But you see sort of a cluster of gumdrop berries nearby and you just go ham on them.

1159
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,200
And you stop what you're doing and you just go ham on them.

1160
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:43,520
Okay.

1161
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:46,240
and uh...

1162
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,720
one insurgent

1163
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:50,460
here's some ferocious eating

1164
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:54,400
uh... interns to look over and we give you one chance to stealth role because

1165
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,640
it was very close

1166
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:59,420
uh... i've rolled intimidation because i was intimidating gumdrops

1167
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:01,440
to intimidate gumdrops

1168
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,880
i got a sixteen

1169
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:05,400
they're incredibly scared

1170
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:08,720
you i thought you know what i thought because it's like a christmas

1171
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:09,760
stellar's

1172
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:12,000
i'd just wanted to explain my reasoning

1173
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:15,840
that's i thought that because it's a christmas universe that the gumdrops

1174
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:19,680
would have a personality like the fries at mcdonald's

1175
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,880
so

1176
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:22,600
all god he's

1177
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:24,520
and they are at thank you

1178
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,780
and i think you need to hear anytime i got a nineteen for stealth

1179
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:32,400
okay cool yes so insurgent sort of wanders over

1180
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,520
he's looking around it's a who needs police gun

1181
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,520
and uh... use of crutch behind the bush of gumdrops

1182
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:42,080
you're still nibbling at them

1183
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:43,360
but he can't hear it

1184
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,560
he's just like, meanwhile there's a gumdrop just going

1185
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,960
"AHH"

1186
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,600
he just comes over and he's like

1187
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:57,320
"huh, i guess the gumdrops were eating themselves again"

1188
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,600
damn, damn gumdrops and yeah so you guys make it through

1189
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:04,520
uh... avoiding the insurgents, avoiding an ensuing fight

1190
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:05,460
uh...

1191
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:08,840
and you guys make it a bit further now in the woods so it's been a few more hours

1192
01:08:08,840 --> 01:08:13,100
uh... you guys traversing uh... the candy cane forest

1193
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:16,720
and uh... you come across what looks like

1194
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,280
uh... a large yeti

1195
01:08:19,280 --> 01:08:21,480
and uh... you see it

1196
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,120
uh... intimidating

1197
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:28,200
what looks to be a a a a group of of local who's

1198
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,960
and uh...

1199
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,000
they're like all

1200
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,680
is that he has yet he plays and uh... the the yeti

1201
01:08:34,680 --> 01:08:36,440
is just like

1202
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,080
so you can see that sort of in your periphery

1203
01:08:39,080 --> 01:08:41,040
but uh...

1204
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:46,220
that he will you want to do this is so he has played the games of all games

1205
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:50,180
as a lot of moral yeah yeah i a m it's it yet or like

1206
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:53,720
uh... nice field republicans in my head yeah right

1207
01:08:53,720 --> 01:08:54,240
all right

1208
01:08:54,240 --> 01:08:55,760
uh...

1209
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,400
so my reading on it is late and it's really like

1210
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:04,800
you know i see injustice as i said that's a new part of my personality last year

1211
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:07,700
i can group

1212
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:11,080
this is the reason i joined blackwater in the first place

1213
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:15,160
the protect the week from the strong

1214
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:17,660
we have to do something

1215
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,280
i do in the yeti steam

1216
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:20,160
uh...

1217
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:21,620

1218
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,080

1219
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:25,680
i'm i'm in the bush just

01:09:25,680 --> 01:09:30,480
for i'm going to town on these fucking gumdrops

1221
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:34,440
i see i i see the opportunity to kill a big monster i just a great

1222
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:37,040
but i will never have a lot of

1223
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:38,440
and running towards it

1224
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:40,320

he's frozen

1228
01:09:48,680 --> 01:09:51,060
this difficult question

1229
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:53,960
It's a very difficult question to answer.

1230
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:54,460
Yeah.

1231
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,560
Are you going to join the Yeti?

1232
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:57,560
Vlad, what about you?

1233
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:58,260
How are you feeling?

1234
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:04,060
I think I'll probably follow around the Zohan because I'm trying to figure out what his deal is.

1235
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:06,060
Oh, okay.

1236
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:06,360
I'm back.

1237
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:06,860
Sorry.

1238
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:10,960
I thought dude, we thought you were just sitting entirely still.

1239
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:12,260
I was like,

1240
01:10:12,260 --> 01:10:14,560
Damn, he looks good at being still.

1241
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:15,560
I didn't know.

1242
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:16,660
I was like,

1243
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:17,760
It was pretty weird, man.

1244
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:20,160
No, I got, I got owned by Spectrum yet again.

1245
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:22,160
(clears throat)

1246
01:10:22,160 --> 01:10:23,760
- So, are you joining the Yeti?

1247
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,800
- Yeah, I joined the Yeti

1248
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:30,520
'cause he's kind of like the stronger, bigger guy.

1249
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:32,120
And it seemed like the Hoos are,

1250
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:34,880
kind of have it coming.

1251
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:35,720
- Okay, yeah.

1252
01:10:35,720 --> 01:10:37,480
So you guys square up on this scene.

01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:38,440
Play this scene out for me.

1254
01:10:38,440 --> 01:10:40,680
Like you guys are now on opposing sides

1255
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,320
in this random Yeti Hoos.

1256
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,360
- I'm on the Yeti's shoulders like he's my dad

1257
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,400

Joey looking guy with a just glowing red nose that he claims is rosacea, but

1437
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:49,220
And so you see that but you have to lie to everyone else about whether or not you've seen it or not. I

1438
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:52,400
Don't see anything

Sort of like says something back to him shakes his head and he says um, they only have cylinder ice cubes

1455
01:21:29,440 --> 01:21:33,980
You know that kind it is so fucked up what the Taliban did to you guys

1456
01:21:33,980 --> 01:21:40,160
I go up to the waiter and I grab him by the shoulders and I say

1457
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:46,020
Give me whiskey and then I get really close to my say a lot of whiskey

01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:38,200
when Genghis Khan was doing all that

1510
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:42,080
he destroyed their sides books told them how to do that

1511
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,600
no you fucking did it

1512
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:45,400
you see like

1513
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:46,720
in one guy's like

1514
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:50,360
yeah

1515
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:54,200
and uh... uh... while you're getting that speech you see a couple other folks

1516
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:57,880
start turning the face you one of them is a giant snowman

1517
01:24:57,880 --> 01:25:01,320
and he looks at uh... the people sitting by the table and rudolph is like

1518
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,080
fuck fuck fuck fuck and he holds up his

1519
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:04,580
puts up his collar

1520
01:25:04,580 --> 01:25:06,880
and uh... the snowman guys like

1521
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:09,280
I'll recognize you folks.

1522
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:12,080
Where'd you say you're from? Where you from?

1523
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:13,880
Don't worry guys.

1524
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:14,880
I got this one.

1525
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,480
I say that really loud in front of him.

1526
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:19,080
Yeah.

1527
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:19,480
Yeah.

1528
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:20,580
Yeah, of course.

1529
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,580
Greetings.

1530
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,280
You don't know my name,

1531
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:25,580
but you definitely don't know my story.

1532
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:32,260
I come go like yeah, I come from the land where they invented

1533
01:25:32,260 --> 01:25:34,880
Christmas Michigan's Upper Peninsula.

1534
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:37,140
(laughing)

1535
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,400
- All right.

1536
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,340
- I was born in a hobby lobby.

1537
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:47,700
I was born amidst the mail mail cables,

1538
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:52,460
the Christmas lights, the cutouts of snowflakes

1539
01:25:52,460 --> 01:25:54,340
and things of that nature.

1540
01:25:54,340 --> 01:25:58,640
I was born looking forward to December 25th every year.

1541
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:02,020
I may be a man with two legs,

1542
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,480
third leg some would say, just kidding.

1543
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:07,140
(laughing)

1544
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:10,760
And a lot of experience.

1545
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:13,840
I've seen the life leave the eyes of others.

1546
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:16,000
I've seen life be put into a baby's eyes

1547
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:17,620
when he is born from his mother.

1548
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:21,280
- You see the snowman's bobbing his head too

1549
01:26:21,280 --> 01:26:22,680
while you keep going, yeah.

1550
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,800
- Start snapping.

1551
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,840
- But even though I am in your country

1552
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,780
in an invasory type deployment,

1553
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:39,420
I respect the desire for Christmas as it is a part of me, as it is a part of you.

1554
01:26:39,420 --> 01:26:43,320
Just like a carrot is put on your nose, it doesn't make you smell any less.

1555
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:48,400
Just 'cause I'm not made of snow doesn't mean I don't drink the nog.

1556
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:58,480
So let's forget the stuff I was yelling, and I'll buy what you're having for myself.

1557
01:26:58,480 --> 01:26:59,480
you know what?

1558
01:26:59,480 --> 01:27:03,080
Clark got Felix Roll persuasion with advantage.

1559
01:27:03,080 --> 01:27:05,840
That's such a fashion speech.

1560
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:07,480
Let's see if you can calm this guy down.

1561
01:27:07,480 --> 01:27:08,320
Okay, you have--

1562
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,240
- Yes!

1563
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:11,320
- Yeah, thank God, yeah, that's not bad.

1564
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:15,920
Yeah, snowman, Frosty the snowman, some would say, goes,

1565
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:17,400
- You know what?

1566
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:20,240
I don't know what the fuck Michigan is, but you're all right.

1567
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,460
(laughing)

1568
01:27:22,460 --> 01:27:25,480
- I think you're, you're, you're just,

1569
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:30,680
I just met you, I can tell you're a real fucking dude

1570
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:32,640
and one of the realest fucking people I've ever met

1571
01:27:32,640 --> 01:27:35,920
and you will be one of my best friends.

1572
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,520
- Brother, you know what I try?

1573
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,320
I try every fucking day I get up in the morning.

1574
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,520
It's cold out, I'm cold inside and out,

1575
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:44,520
but you know what?

1576
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:49,040
I got a lot of love and I see a lot of love in you.

1577
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:53,040
You know, as far as the stuff about my carrot nose,

1578
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:53,880
that's fine.

1579
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,360
I just got that.

1580
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,420
it

1581
01:27:58,420 --> 01:28:02,240
i don't know that was uh... racially changed remark now and i know what you

1582
01:28:02,240 --> 01:28:05,420
know what it's your new year man and you you

1583
01:28:05,420 --> 01:28:06,600

1585
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:10,840
story worry about it

1586
01:28:10,840 --> 01:28:13,840
i can uh... i i i don't mind one bit

1587
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,760
and uh... the frosty sort of dislike shuffles away

1588
01:28:16,760 --> 01:28:19,360
and uh... you see rudolph is a

1589
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:22,640
and uh... the waiter comes over brings you guys your drinks

1590
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:25,840
and the real dislike

1591
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:30,000
I just want to make sure you guys understand what's happening because there seemed to be a lot of confusion before

1592
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,920
So I

1593
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,920
was was was

1594
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,460
Previously so not currently and currently

1595
01:28:41,460 --> 01:28:51,720
Because you haven't yelled yet, but the other ones do so I just okay. What do you mean the other ones?

1596
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:55,560
What do you mean by you guys

1597
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,720
Don't do this. I will just hand you a USB with the information if this continues

1598
01:29:00,720 --> 01:29:03,520
Is that what you want? I have one question

1599
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,340
Okay, where is USB?

1600
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:17,680
He's just like stares blankly his eyes are like rolling in the back

1601
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:22,280
Yeah, you you go Slavia that's

1602
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:24,280
the

1603
01:29:24,280 --> 01:29:26,280
the

1604
01:29:26,280 --> 01:29:28,280
the

1605
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:30,280
the

1606
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:32,280
the

1607
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,280
the

1608
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:36,280
the

1609
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:38,280
the

1610
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:40,280
the

1611
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:42,280
the

1612
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:44,280
the

1613
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:46,280
the

1614
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:48,280
the

1615
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:50,280
the

1616
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:57,960
So I'm gonna give you guys the blueprints and he just slides over the

1617
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:07,560
blueprints to the Bahambug fortress and you guys look at them and you see that

1618
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:18,440
he starts pointing out really I'm sorry I couldn't do anything about it it really

1619
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:23,560
It was like there's about there's a five minute stretch during Felix's speech where I was like, when's it gonna come?

1620
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:30,340
And he says so there's three entrances, okay

1621
01:30:30,340 --> 01:30:35,980
There's the the chimney. Okay, that's gonna get you into the ventilation system

1622
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:39,860
Not many people know that but I know a way to get up there

1623
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:46,240
Then there's a front entrance. I don't recommend it unless you want to face the eat miser and snow miser themselves

1624
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,360
That's gonna be tough

1625
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:53,820
The other way around this is to go through you have to go through frosty's den

1626
01:30:53,820 --> 01:30:57,680
So that guy who just talked to you frosty the snowman

1627
01:30:57,680 --> 01:31:03,540
He's a drug kingpin around here works with the Grinch you can go through his den. It's around back

1628
01:31:03,540 --> 01:31:07,300
It'll lead you right into tunnels or get you into the bah humbug area

1629
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:13,360
But you're gonna have to again go through a whole drug den you could do it sneakily you could fight your way through it

1630
01:31:13,360 --> 01:31:20,260
But again, don't recommend recommend the chimney, but if you fuck that up keep in mind, you'll be surrounded

1631
01:31:20,260 --> 01:31:22,260
You guys played Metal Gear Solid

1632
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:26,120
Here

1633
01:31:26,120 --> 01:31:29,120
I'm I grew up in a tent you household

1634
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:35,760
The way the Metal Gear Solid treats military service is frankly disgusting to me. It's one of the worst things ever

1635
01:31:35,760 --> 01:31:41,640
It's disgusting the way they try to you know, they they try to complicate it. It's horrible

1636
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:47,860
Can you repeat all that don't do this a trick out of character

1637
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:59,120
So look I leave this in your capable hands now I gotta go figure out why my nose is glowing

1638
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,860
fucking ridiculous and

1639
01:32:01,860 --> 01:32:06,420
He sort of puts up his coat again. He says hasta luego and

1640
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,940
He walks out of the bar

1641
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:15,180
So you guys have these blueprints in front of you three separate strategies to break in to the bah humbug fortress

1642
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:17,620
You can certainly split your teams up

1643
01:32:17,620 --> 01:32:20,640
and try to do a multi

1644
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:27,660
Approach or you can just work all together. But yeah, you have the chimney which leads to the air vents

1645
01:32:27,660 --> 01:32:30,860
Give the front door which is sort of a guns blazing approach

1646
01:32:31,100 --> 01:32:35,420
Many of the den which is a sneaky approach but requires some complicated

1647
01:32:35,420 --> 01:32:40,340
Making sure you can get into the drug den making sure you can work your way through it may lead to a shootout

1648
01:32:40,340 --> 01:32:42,540
But those are your three approaches

1649
01:32:42,540 --> 01:32:49,900
So I feel like I feel like Felix already sweet-talked this this snowman. Yeah, so well, why not capitalize on that?

1650
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:53,020
Yeah, yeah, I think I could probably

1651
01:32:53,020 --> 01:32:57,220
Like extract some concessionaries out of him again

1652
01:32:57,220 --> 01:32:59,860
Yeah in a verbal entanglement

1653
01:32:59,860 --> 01:33:07,060
Yeah, that's makes sense to me. So he's he's he's still at the bar.

1654
01:33:07,060 --> 01:33:10,260
So you can still talk to him for sure there.

1655
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:11,760
He's got like his crew around him.

1656
01:33:11,760 --> 01:33:17,260
There are other there who's and other Christmas creatures and

1657
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:20,960
critters that just are sort of like buzzing about him.

1658
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:26,760
So yeah, do you want to do I like I push Clark on towards him like

1659
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,760
Like a timid boy approaching his crush.

1660
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:30,760
Yeah.

1661
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:33,760
Come on, go talk to him.

1662
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:34,760
Alright, alright.

1663
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:35,760
Alright.

1664
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:42,760
So, how's the night treating you?

1665
01:33:42,760 --> 01:33:48,760
Ah, the tough guy himself, Mr. Sweet Talk.

1666
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:50,760
Well, you know, it's going alright.

1667
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:55,760
Just here with my crew, sipping on some soju.

1668
01:33:55,760 --> 01:34:07,040
just enjoying the cool Hubekistan air. Oh, Hubekistan. I mean.

1669
01:34:07,040 --> 01:34:13,760
Someone's had a lot of sake.

1670
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:23,280
Just kidding. Hey, that's a good one. Thank you. So, look man, we're thinking about

1671
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:29,080
taking this party back to my den keep it going get some girls there maybe some

1672
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:34,080
uh maybe some Cindy Lou's if you know what I mean all grown up wink adult

1673
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:42,800
women is what I mean that's my favorite type of woman Cameron can we keep that in

1674
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:50,560
yeah honestly like there's nothing that like puts me into the Christmas spirit

1675
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:57,320
like some tuna around my thing. Hey I know what that is. Yeah. I got a carrot down

1676
01:34:57,320 --> 01:35:01,720

(laughing)

1684
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,040
- I threw a flashbang under the table,

1685
01:35:41,040 --> 01:35:42,480

1686
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,640
(laughing)

1687
01:35:43,640 --> 01:35:45,880
So this whole time I haven't been able to see anything

1688
01:35:45,880 --> 01:35:46,920

1689
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,320
(laughing)

1690
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:51,600
- That happens every single time Clargon talks

1691
01:35:51,600 --> 01:35:52,440
for more than two minutes.

1692
01:35:52,440 --> 01:35:53,280
(laughing)

1693
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,240
Someone around him throws a flashbang at him.

1694
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,360
(laughing)

1695
01:35:57,360 --> 01:36:00,360
- And Frosty sort of looks over your crew,

1696
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,840
sort of sees this motley group of everyone wearing

1697
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:05,340
Groucho Marx glasses.

1698
01:36:05,340 --> 01:36:08,540
And he says, you know what?

1699
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:10,240
The more the merrier.

1700
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,440
Come on, let's head over there.

01:36:20,940 --> 01:36:22,140
You see there's a guy in front of it

1706
01:36:22,140 --> 01:36:24,940
with his hands over his crotch.

1707
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:28,940
And he says, Frosty, you hear Frosty say,

1708
01:36:28,940 --> 01:36:30,540
"Ding, fries are done."

1709
01:36:30,540 --> 01:36:33,340
And you hear the guard go, "I've got to run."

1710
01:36:33,340 --> 01:36:35,380
and he's moved out of the way

1711

grenades did you hear that

1787
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:31,820
i think i did you know that it

1788
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:36,140
a bandolier of just grenades

1789
01:40:36,140 --> 01:40:39,540
i'd i'd tell you what i was making the character and i was thinking like

1790
01:40:39,540 --> 01:40:42,740
or whatever i get patrick is going to something stupid but

1791
01:40:42,740 --> 01:40:45,980
so what i just think it would be a like to have a map grenades like i was like

1792
01:40:45,980 --> 01:40:46,900
whatever

1793
01:40:46,900 --> 01:40:50,940
you know what you're wrong to find that i was wrong again so

1794
01:40:50,940 --> 01:40:53,820
uh...

1795
01:40:53,820 --> 01:40:58,380
a are you doing this on purpose you are or is it on accident be it's it could be

1796
01:40:58,380 --> 01:41:03,520
a it's an accident every time i'm trying to i'm trying to white

1797
01:41:03,520 --> 01:41:04,700
uh...

1798
01:41:04,700 --> 01:41:08,220
whatever and whatever crew to take a look at it

1799
01:41:08,220 --> 01:41:11,940
i think that i'm trying to get off my shirt and i hit my bandolier and the

1800
01:41:11,940 --> 01:41:13,340
great falls off

1801
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:14,300
here's the thing

1802
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:16,240
and i thought it every time

1803
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,220
here's the thing

1804
01:41:18,220 --> 01:41:21,000
if you do this it's a pretty good move

1805
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,940
to say oops sorry

1806
01:41:22,940 --> 01:41:25,220
and then run to the back

1807
01:41:25,220 --> 01:41:27,840
so i don't know if you're trying to do that

1808
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:32,020
or if anybody else is picking up a really strong feeling he was a baby i'm

1809
01:41:32,020 --> 01:41:37,780
just doing maybe i'm just doing some jackie chan drunken kung fu stuff

1810
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:40,980
i think that's your idea this year that that movie

1811
01:41:40,980 --> 01:41:42,240
yet he was

1812
01:41:42,240 --> 01:41:43,660
jackie chan is a good thing

1813
01:41:43,660 --> 01:41:47,340
and jackie chan with a grenade i'm shaking in my boots that's the scariest

1814
01:41:47,340 --> 01:41:51,220
thing i have a have you seen that video uh... where they're trying to prove that

1815
01:41:51,220 --> 01:41:55,780
jar jar binks is a sith lord and he's jackie chan's drunken kung fu moves and

1816
01:41:55,780 --> 01:41:58,340
that's not going to be a drunken master

1817
01:41:58,340 --> 01:41:59,840
uh... techniques

1818
01:41:59,840 --> 01:42:03,780
as an example it's uh... jar jar binks is i like that that's your reference for

1819
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:04,980
for

1820
01:42:04,980 --> 01:42:08,580
jackie chan's drug master is not the movie itself but when they showed it in

1821
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:09,820
a jar jar binks

1822
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:12,100
it's not a good

1823
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:15,460
and i think it humbles me more is when i realize that patrick and i have this

1824
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,140
star wars overlap

1825
01:42:17,140 --> 01:42:19,260
jacksepticeye

1826
01:42:19,260 --> 01:42:21,900
no i know i know pat just knows this shit

1827
01:42:21,900 --> 01:42:26,980
i'm like yeah i've seen that video ok so here's what's gonna happen

1828
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:29,180
if you guys want to take this opportunity

1829
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:33,380
you can all make uh... i hit a grenade off my bandolier and i say misa so

1830
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:48,180
so

1831
01:42:48,180 --> 01:42:54,940
the pin of this blinding grenade and it blinds you and Frosty's like "Oh God!" and the strippers

1832
01:42:54,940 --> 01:42:59,580
are like "Ahh!" and then like, like everybody in the fucking drug debt is like freaking out.

1833
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:05,380
And so you guys have this opportunity so you're, if you're gonna dash I'm gonna roll to see

1834
01:43:05,380 --> 01:43:07,700
if they notice you.

1835
01:43:07,700 --> 01:43:09,340
They have disadvantage so I'm gonna roll twice.

1836
01:43:09,340 --> 01:43:11,860
Let's see what they do, how they do.

1837
01:43:11,860 --> 01:43:12,860
Oh man.

1838
01:43:12,860 --> 01:43:13,860
Yeah, okay.

1839
01:43:13,860 --> 01:43:16,460
And do you guys dash for the door?

1840
01:43:16,460 --> 01:43:21,940
guys - for the door and you guys - for the door and Frosty's like wait where's

1841
01:43:21,940 --> 01:43:26,500
my new best friend where's I didn't even get your name and he's just sort of like

1842
01:43:26,500 --> 01:43:32,660
closing his eyes looking for our God and and you guys are running for the door

1843
01:43:32,660 --> 01:43:36,820
hurt Thomas put on his sunglasses.

1844
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:49,460
I'm gonna take a picture of that so we can post it with the episode later.

1845

01:56:15,820 --> 01:56:16,820
he just lies there

2101
01:56:16,820 --> 01:56:17,820
pool of blood around him

2102
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:20,820
and uh yeah you get another attack too if you want to

2103
01:56:20,820 --> 01:56:21,820

01:56:21,820 --> 01:56:24,820

And yeah now is your turn again Clark on

2109
01:56:46,220 --> 01:56:52,380
So you all right? He miser behind you one elf on the shelf left in front of you above on the shelf

2110
01:56:52,900 --> 01:57:08,900
All right, because I think everyone is just a character in the movie about my life, instead of helping everybody out by just like, you know, rolling for my scar or even my riot shield, I decide I got to keep reloading.

2111
01:57:08,900 --> 01:57:09,900
Right.

2112
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,900
Yeah, you spend your turn reloading.

2113
01:57:11,900 --> 01:57:12,900
Yeah, yeah.

2114
01:57:12,900 --> 01:57:13,900
Yeah.

2115
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:23,020
And I'd like to say to him, you're so fucking lucky that this gun takes so long to reload.

2116
01:57:23,020 --> 01:57:29,340
But it was actually given to me by my grandfather, Clargon Sr. III.

2117
01:57:29,340 --> 01:57:30,340
Tell me about that!

2118
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:36,220
Well, so the thing is, he fought on both sides of World War II.

2119
01:57:36,220 --> 01:57:39,780
He lived a very storied life.

2120
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:43,780
I mean, he actually started out on the allies, but, uh, right.

2121
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:44,580
Sure.

2122
01:57:44,580 --> 01:57:52,180
Yeah. He actually like, so what happened was that he was part of the secret mission where he had to

2123
01:57:52,180 --> 01:57:59,460
look like he was, uh, he was, uh, selling Volkswagen parts to Americans when there was an

2124
01:57:59,460 --> 01:58:04,020
embargo, but it was actually like, he was trying to catch other guys who did that, but then they

2125
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:09,380
just acted like, you know, he wasn't doing that. And so he had no choice. You're just switch sides.

2126
01:58:09,380 --> 01:58:11,940
You're just saying all this shit and just reloading your gun.

2127
01:58:11,940 --> 01:58:12,440
Yeah.

2128
01:58:12,440 --> 01:58:16,500
They really forced his hand and...

2129
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:21,220
See the heatvisor has sat down, he's crossed his legs, he's just sort of listening.

2130
01:58:21,220 --> 01:58:26,260
Yeah, he actually like, you know, he had PTSD his entire life after that from when he did

2131
01:58:26,260 --> 01:58:27,380
fall out of the guard tower.

2132
01:58:27,380 --> 01:58:30,420
Clarkon, you said PTSD right.

2133
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:38,980
I mean, QRT, QTBT from when he fell out of the guard tower.

2134
01:58:38,980 --> 01:58:52,980

and uh...

2139
01:59:02,740 --> 01:59:05,820
actually i think on this and i use my uh... afghani

2140
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:06,900

2141
01:59:06,900 --> 01:59:08,940

2142
01:59:08,940 --> 01:59:10,860

2147
01:59:15,180 --> 01:59:17,660
you know who were up against we both know

2148
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:19,660

2149
01:59:19,660 --> 01:59:21,820
The one that's closest to me

Well, yeah you missed him

2159
02:00:10,420 --> 02:00:15,860
You just sort of do some sweet kicks, but they just like go over the heat miser's head who's like he's like four and a half

2160
02:00:15,860 --> 02:00:17,700
feet tall

2161

Your sweet kicks are too sweet. We have another attack with the Afghan martial arts. Well, I'm gonna do it again

2162
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:30,260
The he might was like, haha. I am too hot to handle. That's my character and

2163
02:00:30,260 --> 02:00:35,540
Yeah. Oh, yeah, you just kick in the same exact spot just over his head

2164
02:00:38,100 --> 02:00:40,820
it first you don't succeed

2364
02:09:51,380 --> 02:09:54,580
This is basically wait what I'll do for the boys.

2365
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:55,280
No,

2366
02:09:55,880 --> 02:09:57,880
I'm wiping my tongue.

2367
02:09:57,880 --> 02:10:01,880
It's like the end of Ace Ventura.

2368
02:10:01,880 --> 02:10:07,880
And it's also not like that.

2369
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,880
No, but it's the same exact.

2370
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:11,880
Yeah, nevermind.

2371
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:13,880
Patches, who's that behind you?

2372
02:10:13,880 --> 02:10:15,880
That's a ghost.

2373
02:10:15,880 --> 02:10:17,880
Is there someone behind me?

2374
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,880
There was someone waving at you.

2375
02:10:19,880 --> 02:10:21,880
It's him. It's him.

2376
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:23,880
The Grinch is here.

2377
02:10:23,880 --> 02:10:28,880
Oh my god, oh my god, she's like Psycho Mantis, he broke the fourth wall!

2378
02:10:28,880 --> 02:10:30,880
Holy shit!

2379
02:10:30,880 --> 02:10:32,880
That's incredible.

2380
02:10:32,880 --> 02:10:36,880
Oh my god, Patches, you really fucking immersed us in this game!

2381
02:10:36,880 --> 02:10:43,880
Okay, now he's telling me that he's gonna save a file of twisted metal, alright, so I'm gonna give it away.

2382
02:10:43,880 --> 02:10:49,880
I don't want to wish it into existence, but this would be the funniest time for Patches to get murdered.

2383
02:10:49,880 --> 02:10:51,880
the

2384
02:10:51,880 --> 02:10:56,880
the

2385
02:10:56,880 --> 02:11:01,880
the

2386
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:06,880
the

2387
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:11,880
the

2388
02:11:11,880 --> 02:11:16,880
the

2389
02:11:16,880 --> 02:11:19,480

02:11:44,440 --> 02:11:47,400
Double crit flashbang in the room.

2402
02:11:47,400 --> 02:11:50,040
I've never seen that before.

2403
02:11:50,040 --> 02:11:51,040
What the fuck?

2404
02:11:51,040 --> 02:11:54,040
You keep throwing grenades, you're gonna hit a double crit eventually.

2405
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:55,040
Exactly.

2406
02:11:55,040 --> 02:11:56,600
Take a screenshot of it so I have this.

2407
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:59,120
You know that was my plan this whole time.

2408
02:11:59,120 --> 02:12:01,080
That was amazing.

2409
02:12:01,080 --> 02:12:02,640
Jesus fucking Christ.

2410
02:12:02,640 --> 02:12:07,720
I accidentally drop a grenade on the ground again.

2411
02:12:07,720 --> 02:12:12,160
I'm swinging my arms like Kermit when he's excited, you know, he's like "Yay!"

2412
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:18,560
I was doing that because I see the Grinch, but I'm scared so I'm doing that and one of them just falls off the bandolier for a double crit.

2413
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:20,060
You are all blind.

2414
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:22,060
[laughter]

2415
02:12:22,060 --> 02:12:23,660
Everybody in the room though?

2416
02:12:23,660 --> 02:12:26,560
Everybody is blind. The Grinch is blind right now.

2417
02:12:26,560 --> 02:12:28,560
The Santas are blind.

2418
02:12:28,560 --> 02:12:30,060
Uh, everybody's blind right now.

2419
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:30,560
For how long?

2420
02:12:30,560 --> 02:12:32,060
I fart really loud.

2421
02:12:32,060 --> 02:12:34,060
[laughter]

2422
02:12:34,060 --> 02:12:36,060
I- I take credit for it.

2423
02:12:36,060 --> 02:12:38,060
That was me.

2424
02:12:38,060 --> 02:12:39,560
Fuck, I can't see.

And you see the timer is going down for the stream is gonna start

2426
02:12:43,160 --> 02:12:47,880
No, I can't fuck the presence if I can't see them and you see the tires going down

2427
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:50,320
It's about to be Christmas Day when he's gonna fuck the presents

2428

*laughter*

2432
02:13:10,040 --> 02:13:16,700
This doesn't feel like a present while while he's doing that. I'm just kind of like feeling around the room. Yeah

2433
02:13:16,700 --> 02:13:27,240

Meanwhile, the, uh, Kargon, Kargon, what are you, Kargon and Vlad, what are you guys doing in this, you're, you can't see, the Grinch is about to kiss Zohan.

02:14:45,780 --> 02:14:46,780
Oh, he's not gonna kiss him.

2452
02:14:46,780 --> 02:14:53,280
I'm gonna try to use mental visualization techniques to aim my bolt action at the Grinch.

2453
02:14:53,280 --> 02:14:57,780
Okay, uh, roll an attack roll with disadvantage. Let's see how you do.

2454
02:14:57,780 --> 02:15:03,320
Okay, and then we'll resolve that depending on the result. All right

2455
02:15:03,320 --> 02:15:11,560
You just hit it you'll just take the lower number, okay. All right, so Thomas

2456
02:15:11,560 --> 02:15:14,660
Afghanistan's Vladimir

2457
02:15:14,660 --> 02:15:20,140
What are you doing doing this time you just feeling around for shit what's going on? Yeah, I

2458
02:15:21,280 --> 02:15:27,600
I think I'm sitting in Santa's lap because I like sort of felt around and stuff,

2459
02:15:27,600 --> 02:15:31,040
but I've just been sitting in like a regular chair for like five minutes.

2460
02:15:31,040 --> 02:15:36,800
And I'm just like talking to just a chair. I think he just has like really toned thighs or something.

2461
02:15:36,800 --> 02:15:40,960
The chair is like, yeah, what else do you want for Christmas?

2462
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:43,600

dead grinch

2479
02:17:09,700 --> 02:17:11,440

2480
02:17:11,440 --> 02:17:13,700

uh... clark on visual doing a visual part on shooting is done and it just

2482
02:17:17,240 --> 02:17:23,040

2485
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:29,560
this is a this is the end of the mission you guys killed the grinch with some

2486
02:17:29,560 --> 02:17:31,200
shy uh...

2487
02:17:31,200 --> 02:17:35,200
i instantly speak up for a big mass

2488
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:36,040
the rich

2489
02:17:36,040 --> 02:17:37,720
was bad person

2490
02:17:37,720 --> 02:17:41,080
and he hurt this country and all the other countries in the world

2491
02:17:41,080 --> 02:17:42,140
but

2492
02:17:42,140 --> 02:17:44,920
we're no better than our adversaries

2493
02:17:44,920 --> 02:17:47,320
if we desecrate his corpse

2494
02:17:47,320 --> 02:17:50,040
I think we have to give the Grinch a Muslim sea burial

2495
02:17:50,040 --> 02:17:53,400
in accordance with his faith

2496
02:17:53,400 --> 02:17:55,240
or one of them

2497
02:17:55,240 --> 02:17:56,840
one of the faiths

2498
02:17:56,840 --> 02:17:59,320
I'm going to find the Grinch

2499
02:17:59,320 --> 02:18:01,160
I do

2500
02:18:01,160 --> 02:18:03,560
I will kill them

2501
02:18:03,560 --> 02:18:05,800
(laughter)

2502
02:18:05,800 --> 02:18:17,460
- I cut off the Grinch's like,

2503
02:18:17,460 --> 02:18:19,520
like mangled bloated ball sack

2504
02:18:19,520 --> 02:18:22,820
and I just wear it as a necklace to add to my trophies.

2505
02:18:22,820 --> 02:18:24,540
Cause I'm bad ass as hell.

2506
02:18:24,540 --> 02:18:31,280
- The gap in my tooth is stuck in between like that,

2507
02:18:31,280 --> 02:18:33,040
that thing in the belt buckle,

2508
02:18:33,040 --> 02:18:37,760
where it like connects to the it goes through the belt hole so i'm just kind of like me and

2509
02:18:37,760 --> 02:18:45,120
santa i'm like kind of waving my arms back like whoa i'm falling backwards and it's this cycle

2510
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:53,680
where santa and i keep like doing cartwheels and then connected to his and i i walk up to the

2511
02:18:53,680 --> 02:18:58,880
present the presence the pile of presents the president president i walked up to the president

2512
02:18:58,880 --> 02:19:00,520
He's standing in the pile of presents.

2513
02:19:00,520 --> 02:19:03,480
And get this boys, I unzip my fly.

2514
02:19:03,480 --> 02:19:04,480
Oh no!

2515
02:19:04,480 --> 02:19:15,560
And I say into the camera, being Israeli is about more than having fun with your friends.

2516
02:19:15,560 --> 02:19:20,320
It's about more than using Reddit for pornography.

2517
02:19:20,320 --> 02:19:25,480
More than sounding like a French guy with a concussion.

2518
02:19:25,480 --> 02:19:33,040
More than visiting the dentist because there's no fluoride in the water in Israel.

2519
02:19:33,040 --> 02:19:34,680
It's about ruining Christmas.

2520
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:46,320
Yeah, and you hear Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On" play and the screen fades to black

2521
02:19:46,320 --> 02:19:50,160
and the credits start rolling.

2522
02:19:50,160 --> 02:19:57,160
the

2523
02:19:57,160 --> 02:19:59,280

2526
02:20:07,840 --> 02:20:09,640
all of them and

2527
02:20:09,640 --> 02:20:10,800
there

2528
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:12,040

2549

but uh...

2550
02:21:08,520 --> 02:21:11,920
In accordance with his Muslim faith, we are fucking the corpse.

2551
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:15,820
*laughter*

2552
02:21:15,820 --> 02:21:19,920
Let us never say that we've stooped to the low of America's enemies.

2553
02:21:19,920 --> 02:21:20,920
*laughter*

2554
02:21:20,920 --> 02:21:22,420
Yeah.

2555
02:21:22,420 --> 02:21:23,020
Perfect.

02:21:23,020 --> 02:21:29,620
Yeah, and before- right before we fuck him, we say, "Hey, here's five pillars for you, you dead son of a bitch."

2557
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:35,020
I, uh, I would like to say the traditional Muslim prayer during the sea burial.

2558
02:21:35,020 --> 02:21:38,860
Brooke Atatinoi, Kampenu, Mele Shalom.

2559
02:21:38,860 --> 02:21:41,020
You see his-

2560
02:21:41,020 --> 02:21:42,060
Happy Hanukkah.

2561
02:21:42,060 --> 02:21:46,220
His body touches the water and it bursts into flames.

2562
02:21:46,220 --> 02:21:50,540
Well, guess I was wrong about that one. He clearly wasn't Muslim.

2563
02:21:50,540 --> 02:21:54,060
It would have just sunk if he was Muslim.

2564
02:21:54,060 --> 02:21:58,860
Well, I mean, there were like, there's a one in five shot of me getting his religion right.

2565
02:21:58,860 --> 02:22:00,860
Like he could have been Hindu, he could have been Buddhist.

2566
02:22:00,860 --> 02:22:03,740
At least we tried though.

02:22:21,980 --> 02:22:27,260

2571
02:22:27,260 --> 02:22:30,780
