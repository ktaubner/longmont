1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
think

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
that's

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
a

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
good

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
maybe

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,000
pat

8
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
once I

9
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
became the

10
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
clapper,

11
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
maybe his

12
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
first

13
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
good

14
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
clap.

15
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
What are you

16
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
talking about?

17
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Maybe his

18
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
for you actually did get the

19
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
award of the day because you

20
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
found a cable that we needed.

21
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
So isn't that using creative

22
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
thinking really?

23
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I mean honestly using like

24
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
everybody smarter than wanted to

25
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
throw out a bunch of you got it

26
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
in just and pardon the pun here.

27
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You got it in just under the

28
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,280
And you got it in just under the wire because I was opening the bin that that was in when

29
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,280
you said it.

30
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,360
So I was opening it and you said it right as I saw the thing and my brain hadn't even

31
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,840
caught up yet and then I was like oh my god.

32
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,840
It was genius.

33
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:46,080
That was an amazing amazing moment.

34
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,160
I can just coast today and don't have to contribute at all.

35
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,620
It felt like you were narrating my life.

36
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,200
You have a Steve Jobs outfit on.

37
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,200
I do.

38
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,200
Yeah, I'm wearing that.

39
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,200
All black with pink socks.

40
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,200
It's summer buddy, look at me.

41
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,200
Show those shorts.

42
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Show those socks.

43
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,200
Show those socks, bro.

44
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,200
Show those socks, bro.

45
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,200
The air forces are so fucking crazy.

46
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,200
These are so funny for you to own.

47
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,200
You're jealous.

48
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
I do like them, but it's so funny that these are the

49
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
New York City Air Force Ones.

50
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
Look at the bottoms.

51
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,200
got the five and the four train logos and then what's on that side. It's like the

52
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,240
six and the what

53
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,500
I don't know.

54
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:32,900
The six and nothing. The six and then the I think he knows everything about

55
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,320
what it really showed. Show me the bottom again. It doesn't say it just says

56
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,960
six and nothing. Okay, so it's just the four, five and six train. Yeah, we all

57
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,200
know them trains. Don't worry. I've never been on one of them. The single

58
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,600
time. Those are the six goes all the way to the Bronx. Those are I drive trains

59
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,180
to go to the IMAX. Yeah, I really do. I can't remember the six. You take a I just

60
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,980
follow the Google. The six takes you the Bronx Zoo going up and then going down.

61
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:03,180
It takes you to this one curb that I like. That's all black with pink socks.

62
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:09,580
You got the my Crocs. This is a funny ass. This is some bullshit dress for the

63
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:14,380
what this is honestly getting dressed for the Brockhampton show.

64
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:19,380
This is not getting dressed for the Brockhampton show type outfit. What are

65
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,860
All black with the pink socks and the camo crotch.

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,820
I didn't want to put on my shoes when I left the house today.

67
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,820
Yeah, right.

68
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,740
Did I tell you about the time I saw Brockhampton?

69
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,740
All of them?

70
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
Or do you think that's one guy?

71
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,740
No, I...

72
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,740
You saw a blue guy?

73
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:47,060
I spent my student loan refund from community college, the whole $300 that I got, I spent

74
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:55,060
on Boston Calling tickets and coincidentally that Boston Calling show was the week after

75
00:02:55,060 --> 00:03:01,060
the Amir Van allegations dropped. So he was kicked out of the band and then...

76
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,540
So you saw that they did their weird stuff?

77
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,380
I saw them because I was like what is this show gonna be like?

78
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,660
Yeah, that was the reason you bought the ticket.

79
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,980
No, I went there, you know, it's more embarrassing because I went there to see Mac DeMarco.

80
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,660
Yeah, that's a little. I would say maybe that's a little less embarrassing than

81
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,580
going to see Brockhampton. Yeah, yeah, Mac DeMarco and Danny Brown were on that

82
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,660
year and then so like

83
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:29,900
their whole show, they cut their set halfway through because they all stood

84
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,360
up on stage and we're crying and hugging each other

85
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,900
because that we should do. We should pretend that we had a fourth guy that we

86
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,540
kicked out because he was a raper. Yeah, and we should do an episode. That could

87
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:48,700
we stand up, we all stand up. It feels like I like when I that I see on

88
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,780
Instagram people I knew in Boston who still live in Boston from like from high

89
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:56,180
school and stuff as they all go to Boston calling still every year and it's

90
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,960
crazy to me. It feels like an alternate universe that people are going to Boston

91
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,300
calling. It used to be cool. The crate that there used to be five. I don't

92
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,420
believe that I was in it was at government center. It was in the middle

93
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,600
know the city. Oh, that's oh really yeah. It was really cool. I moved into the

94
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,340
Harvard athletic Harvard athletic complex. You weren't allowed to smoke

95
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:22,300
cigarettes. Yeah, and it's all grass and mud and they have so bad bands now. But

96
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,760
back in the day, they were booking run the jewels.

97
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,000
I went the year that run the jewels played.

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,100
I went that year. That's fire. Yeah, that was the same.

99
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,500
White high schoolers dream that festival. White high schoolers dream got to see Hannibal

100
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:51,420
Burris perform gibberish rap live. No. No, dude. Holy shit. That was huge. You know he's

101
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:55,420
a full time rapper now. I think the funniest though, I think it was either someone I know

102
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,460
tried to book him on a show and he was like, I'll only do it if I can rap. Really? Yeah.

103
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:03,340
That's so funny. The funniest, I think it was either the year that Boston Calling switched

104
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,020
to the big field or the year after that that year was twenty seventeen

105
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,160
because that was the year I went. Okay, well, whatever year it was, it

106
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
was the one where

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:15,000
like I think the headliners were like Weezer and Major Lazer, I think,

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,160
but then the other, but then the other headliner was tool. That was the

109
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,720
one I like to. So the crowd was like half like, like sixteen year olds

110
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,960
going to their first concert ever and then half like forty five year old

111
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,740
guys who smelled so bad. I think it was the craziest crowd I've ever

112
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,980
I think the headliners were run the jewels and then no, it was chance the

113
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:37,980
rapper tool and then that's what it is. One of them one year was Weezer and

114
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:42,480
major laser dude that fucking I just remembered that. Okay. So is the chance

115
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:47,680
the rapper girl? Yeah, the chance the rapper show that all happened like the

116
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,680
week after the the Ariana Grande Manchester bombing. You remember that? I

117
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,680
forgot about that. So that happened like the week after I barely remember and I

118
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,880
I don't even remember what it is just besides it happening. Somebody

119
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,120
rapper said chance to rapper said in in like I don't know what, but he said

120
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,500
like do y'all want to see heaven tonight and then we heard like

121
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,440
and I was like oh my fucking God, he killed everyone in the

122
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,560
he's a young

123
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,840
tonight. I thought that chance the rapper was a terrorist. I thought that

124
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,440
I heard like to like what sounded like gunshots and I was like oh my God,

125
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:31,440
perfectly and then I was like oh no it's fine. I was just really drunk and I

126
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,520
thought that no no you thought chance the rapper was doing a ritual sacrifice.

127
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,840
He was no he was he was trying to get as many people to see heaven as possible.

128
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:46,360
No no no no other pieces unplugged. I'll plug that in okay. What are you guys

129
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,000
looking at you guys while I was talking about that you guys were all looking at

130
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,280
them and don't worry about something and I still don't know what it is they're

131
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:55,760
unloading it into a shop. I took my Adderall today. I've been extremely

132
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:00,760
I've been so focused on these stories I've been telling that I haven't let you guys get a word in edgewise.

133
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:05,760
What do you mean? We were talking about all the bus to Cologne. I've been talking up a damn storm all day. Shut up.

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,760
What'd you do this week? What'd I do this week? Did you do anything so fucking funny?

135
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:15,760
No, not really. Something so funny? Oh, me and Pat came up with something funny this week.

136
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,760
About surround sound. But we did something funny. We came up with something funny when we were walking.

137
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,300
owner. Why wait let me let me intro it basically it's a bit that we came up

138
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,300
with you fucking right. I think I'm sorry you know how excited I am. I think

139
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,500
you're actually going to I think you're actually going to like it, though. I

140
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,400
think it's actually funny all right, and it's the bit is Theo Vaughn, but he

141
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,980
grew up in a completely normal town. Yeah, okay, so I used to have this guy

142
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:46,260
coming into town. If your house is on fire, you give him one dollar. He put

143
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,840
that thing out. There used to be a place down in my town called the police

144
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,880
station all the cops hung out. I'll be cops there all the time man. We would go

145
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,680
down to the bus criminals. We would go down to this place man. It was me and a

146
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,000
couple of my friends. We'd go down to this place called the library and they

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,480
had every single book there. He was a borrow. He was a busy town. How about

148
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,680
that? Yeah, he's had his worm down there driving an apple and we had this worm.

149
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,280
He would drive an apple and all the caps all the cops were cats. See that's good

150
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:19,980
did okay. You guys did have a funny week. We were saying that to Jubio and he did not

151
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:27,180
get it. He listens to Theo Vaughn and he says yeah he lives in Mexico. Look at Caleb literally

152
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:37,500
trying to drift. I'll see you guys later. And then still got somehow out of the shot.

153
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:42,740
It's okay. Nobody cares. Nobody actually wants to see me. What? Don't say that. We did that

154
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:47,040
Hey, nobody even want we did that for the whole walk back to your apartment.

155
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
Good. It was funny. It was really making me laugh. It's been too hot.

156
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,220
I think it's cooking my brain. Yeah, cooking me toe all the way. I'm finally

157
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,860
dying y'all damn. It's really happening. It's confirmed. It's completely

158
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,940
confirmed. What way are you dying now?

159
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,980
I lost my vision again. You went blind. Yeah. How did you lose your

160
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:11,700
reiki beats me? It happened yesterday and I'm still scared of what you hear

161
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,760
they say it's happening again. That's what's happened. When were you and I was

162
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,880
sitting at the table, what do you get like a chronic migraine and then it just

163
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,900
well. So the usually I get a migraine. So also if any doctors are listening, I'd

164
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,900
really like you to tell me what this is. Do you wear glasses? No, maybe you have

165
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:30,620
macular immaculate, immaculate, immaculate, pregnant, but I do actually

166
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,660
want to know what this is. If you guys know you should tell me if I should go

167
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,100
to the doctor or not, but I usually get a mic. You know you get the don't ask a

168
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,380
the doctor they're going to say yes yeah. Do we have any anyone just a bunch of

169
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:47,080
everybody who listens to this message me and say yes or no, but no doctor, no

170
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,900
doctor, because you have a vested interest and you're trying to get you

171
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,320
have a doc. If what happened was you know usually you get a have you ever got a

172
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,700
migraine before you know how it's like a gradual kind of like visual halo that

173
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,260
like comes in, but this was like instant and it was like half, but the entire

174
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:05,280
upper half of my vision, just like it just was like it was just there and I

175
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,000
did you hit your head? Nothing app. I was literally sitting nothing, no, no

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,860
stimulus at all, something unplugged, something got unplugged in my brain. I

177
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,880
lost the upper half of my vision on one side. I stood up. I was walking around

178
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,120
saying I can't see I can't see what's happening. My girlfriend was very scared,

179
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,880
yeah, but I didn't feel I didn't my head didn't hurt. I didn't feel anything in

180
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,840
my body, my vision, and then it just faded away. I just some five minutes.

181
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:30,660
You only drink Gatorade. I don't this is the this is the first time I drink

182
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,800
Gatorade and probably over a month. Oh, then you probably not true. It's a

183
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,200
hundred percent sure I've been using the Gatorade water. It's completely true.

184
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,920
Do you know I went and you asked me to get you a Gatorade the other day and I

185
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,240
also was that Gatorade. When was that guys last week? That was not last. It

186
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,600
was. Let's be real. That was a hundred percent. It was not. I keep track of it.

187
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,920
Okay, I said you haven't had Gatorade this month is what you said. No, I'm in

188
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:58,720
at least a month in a thirty days. Okay, maybe I'll go to I'll go twenty days

189
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,880
then. Okay, I might give you, but it's been a while. It's been a minute. Okay,

190
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,020
I continue, though sorry I have nothing else to say. Do you think I mean it

191
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,100
probably nothing is probably just like a man, so it was the most scared I've

192
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:12,000
been. It's probably just a stroke yeah, that's what I was thinking. I thought I

193
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,700
was actively having a stroke. When it happened, it might have been a mini

194
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,960
stroke. Yeah, people have those all the time. There is a mean if you have a

195
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,940
mini stroke. It doesn't really mean I mean nothing really means anything.

196
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,600
It's not like

197
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:34,080
it's like I think it's like just your blood gets cut off to some part of your

198
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,340
brain for some very small amount of time. Oh, that makes sense. Got cut off to his

199
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,820
eyes. Maybe you have- I think it was my ocular nerve or whatever just got fucked

200
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,960
up in my brain. I honestly think just some little gremlin, some little mucinex

201
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,760
guy unplugged a part of your eye. Well, you know what else is? I think, as I did

202
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,480
have a headache in that morning. I didn't have one later in the day, but I feel

203
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,320
like maybe it was an aftershock. I think every headache I have is a- Did you hit

204
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,600
your head? I still didn't hit my head. You didn't hit your head? No. Did you hit

205
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,720
hit your head. I did hit my head. I did hit my head. You did hit your head. I

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,860
fell down. I hit my head on a door knob the other day, getting up from the

207
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,440
toilet.

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:09,680
I hit it so hard I had to lay down. You were sitting on the toilet and then you

209
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,120
got on hands and knees on the bath mat and then you stood up. No, I realize I

210
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,400
have a really bad habit of I get up really, really fast. I always go maximum

211
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,320
speed. That's when I hit my head on that. Yeah, so I keep hitting my head on

212
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,720
stuff because I get under something and I just try. I get so excited to get up

213
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,160
that I jump up and so I leaned over picking something off wall all while I

214
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600
was taking a shit or something off wall. What are you saying?

215
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,280
You're picking up holy

216
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:40,120
you don't remember

217
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,080
what could you possibly

218
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:48,720
you know what you know what my you know the set up of my bathroom. I have the

219
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,320
toilet there, the doors in front of it, and if you open the door, which I shit

220
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,560
the door open when there's no one home for sure because I have the dog out.

221
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,480
I don't want the dog to get into mischief while I'm doing it.

222
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,800
So I'm shitting with the door.

223
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,400
Does he put his paw under the door?

224
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:07,120
No, the doors open like so if I bend over and then I get up, I might hit my

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,520
head on the doorknob and I bent over to like pick up my phone or something

226
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:14,680
while after I'd wiped my ass and I was lifting back up.

227
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,040
It's making a little more and I hit my head so hard.

228
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,120
I still have a red dot.

229
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,600
I see it.

230
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,720
I think it's like over here.

231
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,140
Oh, no, it's a little above that. Yeah, it's right there. I see it and that was

232
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:29,120
like ten days ago. Damn wow yeah, and I hit it really, really hard now and then

233
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:29,740
today

234
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,860
I was making meatballs in my air fryer and I spilled them onto the ground.

235
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:40,020
I opened up the air fryer and it, and the air fryer was tipping over the

236
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,240
counter. Something has been going on with us. You know what else? I had a

237
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,720
dream that a bee crawled in my ear. I had a dream that I just pissed blood and

238
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,240
that was it. I had a dream that I found. I had a dream that I pissed just straight

239
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,840
blood and I was like, Oh, my God, I was like, Oh, yeah, like like I in the dream,

240
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,680
I told myself like, Oh, yeah, this this is like a big problem, but let's just

241
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,940
wait it out. Oh, yeah, I mean, that's so fucking weird. That's what my sleep

242
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,080
apnea has been really bad recently, too. Yeah, and last night I had a dream that

243
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,700
I found an AR fifteen and I brought it to the police

244
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:16,060
because I was like, I don't want to get in trouble for having this. You guys can

245
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,920
kind of it and this morning I farted and the one sitting on the couch. Oh,

246
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,760
that's not that

247
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,480
girlfriend farting in her sleep last night and it smelled so bad that I left

248
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
the room for a little bit. I'm done. Oh, you can't say that. I think that men

249
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,120
need to take a stand, okay, because all three of us have lived in, we have

250
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,440
lived in, you're going to be in trouble. You're in trouble. She doesn't listen.

251
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,960
You're in huge trouble. She doesn't listen. All the girls listen to everyone

252
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:41,720
to see if we talk about them. They do. They do and they get together and they

253
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,000
listen while they do whatever. That's what they do.

254
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,380
that's what they do. I don't know. I'm thinking they do that. They do that

255
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:51,980
they do that because they hang out and I don't know she comes back and she's

256
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,900
laughing at me. She's laughing at you.

257
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:59,660
She comes back and she they show each other's pictures of our little sees me

258
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,540
as soon as she sees me. She does this and just so they can laugh and I go.

259
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,620
What are you laughing at and here nothing we need to take a stand here.

260
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:12,120
We are kicking every one of us. The girls from now on are sleeping on the

261
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,100
couches. Yeah, because I do not get a good night's sleep when I sleep with my

262
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,580
wife. I do not want to see her past eight o'clock. I want her to be gone.

263
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:25,340
You are a lunchtime only person in my life, lunch and breakfast. She's on my

264
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:29,900
bed. She is going diagonal while I'm trying to sleep. These women, they sleep

265
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,860
like I have a full bed. I have a full side. Can I tell you something else

266
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,620
going on in my life that this just reminded me? What there is a new baby

267
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,140
where in my building,

268
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,840
but it's only there some of the time, either that or it's really a polite

269
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:47,280
baby. That's good to be if you're a baby and you're polite yeah. My baby who

270
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,680
only screams and cries a little bit, but I was thinking that and also the

271
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:55,320
people have been fighting who has who were the baby in the baby. They could

272
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,900
be very could very I have no idea fighting like you're hearing like

273
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,160
I don't

274
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:08,860
but I'm thinking once they kill each other and the baby is gone, I've done

275
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:13,200
I care I can take the apartment that they're in and expand. It seems like

276
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,500
there's a lot of tension right now expansion expand and I was thinking this

277
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,260
is something I was I was thinking about okay. So if you get the apartment above

278
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,180
you, okay, tell me you're put in your inside your apartment, not in the lobby

279
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,860
or whatever. Are you going to put in a normal staircase, a ladder, a spiral

280
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:36,300
staircase or a jumping pad? What about the pole fire pole fire pole doesn't

281
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,840
goes down well unless you're very yeah, but I'm not that strong. I would say

282
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,160
tighter on your legs and climb up. Are you can choose that? Are you going to

283
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:50,320
want to do the jumping pad every day? That's my question. Yes, I mean it could

284
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,200
be fun. I was a jump. You mean trampoline? No, I mean like a jump or

285
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,160
like it shoots you up. No, we are. I already had this discussion with who

286
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,280
with me. Yeah, with you, I'm just saying it's not a trampoline. It's a jumping

287
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,220
red, like in a game like yeah, yeah, like a spring, a spring, that's what I'm

288
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,560
saying it's a spring. It's not a trampoline. No, I'm I'm just asking if it

289
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,280
was not

290
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,700
trampoline. That's ridiculous. Okay, well, then I think I choose ladder. I

291
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,620
think a jumping pad would really hurt my back. Yeah, I guess you're right. I

292
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,540
think I would go spiral staircase just because it saves space and you don't

293
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:28,080
decline. Ladders, the cheapest is the space cheapest and the best efficient of

294
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,780
space. Then old people can't go up. Yeah, exactly. No old people. No, I'm

295
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:37,160
I have my antelope spiral staircase looks cool. Yeah, if I think it amazing

296
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:41,080
a stick is a look good in your apartment yeah. My part would probably look good

297
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,740
with a jump pad. My apartment jump pad would fit in great in my apartment. No,

298
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:50,880
no, it would not yeah. Well, it actually no, I think if I'm from the eighteen

299
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,640
hundred that doesn't even make sense. Some some Nikola Tesla

300
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,860
well made out of it's made out of like sheep's intestines. That'd be cool.

301
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,560
one day you guys came in and I had that Nikola Tesla thing with electricity

302
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,560
just shooting it into my Xbox and shit. Yeah, but I one day I get all this

303
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,080
electricity. Why don't how come how come people who get completely obsessed with

304
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,080
interior design, all these girls who want to make all their spaces look a

305
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,720
certain way, look like a magazine, how come they always every time they say I

306
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,640
want to look like this is a one room school house in the old west, how come

307
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,000
none of them are like I want to make my house look like a science lab or like a

308
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:30,300
dinosaur jungle or have it look like I understand they wanted to look like a

309
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,180
little pretty inside of a car. My shit would look like a Sunday school, like

310
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:38,740
like it already does no, my no, no, like a new one where they have like like

311
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:43,240
yeah, half of a car coming out of a wall, yeah, and like a slide, a built in

312
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,500
slide to the wall where you walk in that's a wall. Yeah, no, that one of

313
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,000
these bikes,

314
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,000
these people who have such incredible attention to detail, they're buying

315
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,200
worn husks. No one is going buying wooden poles. No one is doing P.

316
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,760
Rods. Nobody's doing Peewee. Nobody's doing Death Star. Yes,

317
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,720
we need to take these these these colonial women to work yeah and make me

318
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,160
a house.

319
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:13,280
What set these colonial women to work? That's okay to say what's wrong with

320
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,320
that? Let's set them to work yeah and build me a nice house that looks like a

321
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,400
video game and also if you're going to do all this shit and make do all this

322
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,720
that you should also have to farm for me and make me different food and all that stuff.

323
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,040
You want a corn broom? Get those husks, dry out that shit yourself. And we should have

324
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,920
a goat. And we should have a goat. Or you should milk my dog or something. We already

325
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:43,040
have a goat. In my person we already have a goat. Yeah, that's it. Okay, that's enough

326
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:47,200
of it. That's too much. You're talking about that vision thing. I don't remember who it

327
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:50,920
was, but there's some skater that like hit their head falling off of a like a

328
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,440
big stair set so hard that their vision went

329
00:19:53,440 --> 00:20:00,180
fucking skater hit their head really hard falling from really high. They fell

330
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,960
from really high and their vision went like completely black and white. It's

331
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,960
either Chris Cole forever Thomas, but no for like an hour can happen for an hour.

332
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,480
They went full artist. I didn't see him. I pissed my dad off so much. That's

333
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,280
funny. One of my dad talked about it for years. I don't even know what it was up

334
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:23,280
up against. It was up against 2011. It was up against 2012. The artist was up against

335
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:29,960
2012 and then from what I remember, my dad reacted to it like a sports game. He's like

336
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:36,960
Jesus fucking Christ! The artist, the black and white movie, and then I remember him looking

337
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,960
at me and being like, "Caleb, we should have made Moneyball." Oh yeah. The Tree of Life!

338
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,400
so mad because it won over Moneyball. That's so funny. Yeah, that's so fucking

339
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,680
funny. That's great. I was thinking of movies that I saw in 2011. It's like Toy

340
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:56,000
Story 3, The Sitter with Joe Mangielo. I remember my dad, he looked at me, he was

341
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
like, "You know what, Caleb? You know what we should have done this year? Made

342
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,480
a fucking black and white movie because we would have won an Oscar." He's so mad.

343
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,280
It's one of the maddest I've ever seen him.

344
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,840
Just a bit because Moneyball lost. The ultimate dad movie lost. It was, it was,

345
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,340
the ads have been waiting for the industry nod for decade. Dude, I went to

346
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,740
Kellogg Diner one time at like three in the morning. I was like hammered and I

347
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,680
sat down at the diner and next to me was just a dude like eating the biggest

348
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,880
breakfast plate I've ever seen just watching Moneyball

349
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,520
watching Moneyball on his phone.

350
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:39,420
What's up? A little breakfast right there just on that big Moneyball that

351
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,080
you have a plate you saved the most boring story ever by saying, but all

352
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:43,720
breakfast

353
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,680
as a guy watching money, you saw a guy watching a movie, a guy watch a movie on

354
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,800
his phone. That's your story. That was I've never thought to watch a whole

355
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,960
movie on. What are you crazy on my phone? No, why not everybody? You see that on

356
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,960
the train all the time. You're somebody if you're eating, what were you doing at

357
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,140
the diner? You on your phone watching a full he's probably stopped. He stopped

358
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,680
the movie and got up and left when he was done. So he didn't watch the whole

359
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,560
movie. He watched he was watching a good chunk of the movie.

360
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:11,720
I

361
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,320
like all the time on my phone. I saw a movie clip on YouTube.

362
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,020
The whole movie. And it did that like

363
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,240
it was the whole movie on his iTunes.

364
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,020
We have that movie clips part two of Eleven Moneyball. Yeah, that's what he

365
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:26,660
was watching. No, he's watching the whole movie. I don't believe it. It was

366
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,920
on his iTunes. Even if he was, it's not even interesting. It's not that

367
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,420
interesting. I can't believe you're fighting against it.

368
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,320
Is it now? It's not that interesting.

369
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,520
Don't get all inquisitive. Is it?

370
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,980
Yeah, wait, let's look a little deeper. Don't talk like that.

371
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,280
Talk like what?

372
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,120
It's part of a mystery.

373
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,620
Oh yeah, if that was the beginning of like a Knives Out style thing,

374
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:52,580
then I might as well... He was watching Moneyball, but then I saw him... Oh

375
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,440
my God, Pat, you would be maybe the best writer of all time to write the

376
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,880
beginning part of a mystery, where they, right before they cut to the detective,

377
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,400
like the beginning of like a Columbo episode or something. What would your

378
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,920
story be? Where like nothing's happening? Yeah, you would write like the first

379
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,860
four pages and then bring someone else in to write the page or something gets

380
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,220
killed.

381
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,160
All right, what do you do? What's this set up for your mystery? All right, all

382
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:13,800
right, so the

383
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,680
it's a

384
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:22,940
no, it's a library. I was going to say laundromat. It's a library that's next

385
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,420
to a laundromat. Whoa, that's already good and I already like this.

386
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:34,160
The lady who works at the laundromat closes up the closes up shop, puts a

387
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,780
shirt on a hanger and then walks out, walks into the library. So then she

388
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:43,840
walks up to the... It's clear that she has a rapport with the librarian. She's

389
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:48,040
talking, she walks in... I love that. Is the librarian girl or boy? Hey, Janice.

390
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,380
Oh, hey, Bernice. Hey, what have you... You clean a lot of clothes today?

391
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,900
No, just one shirt today.

392
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,980
And I hung it up before I left.

393
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:03,980
no, all right.

394
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:09,820
Are you here to get a book? No, I'm here to return my book. Okay, what book is

395
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,140
your

396
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,880
memoirs of a geisha? Oh wow, okay, no, no, no, because I said laundromat,

397
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,540
because then that could be racist coded.

398
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,000
So she's actually returning

399
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,780
she's actually retarded.

400
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:34,540
Okay, so I do now do one more one and she's returning memoirs of a

401
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,380
geisha. Yeah,

402
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:39,660
no fifty shades of gray. Okay, okay, now she's returning now.

403
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:42,620
And then Bernice picks it up and goes,

404
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:48,060
and she goes, yep, and then suddenly a man in a trench coat and a hat runs

405
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:51,660
in and slits her throat and she falls on the floor and screams and grabs

406
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:56,180
her throat, which one is Bernice or Janice? Both. Her name is not Bernice.

407
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:02,300
Burnet okay, Bernays, not like a no yeah, it's the laundromat lady gets killed

408
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:06,700
and then cut okay and then theme song and then the rest of the episode yeah

409
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:13,840
what in the what in the what is going on in this library? I heard of this

410
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,760
happen. I've heard of a bookish demeanor, but I've never seen something

411
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,600
he's madara madara,

412
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:29,000
but when it comes to this criminal, there's no one demeanor. This is

413
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,200
demeanors criminal

414
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,400
not even using book

415
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:42,000
did a bookish and he did it in a bookish room. Well, let me take a

416
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,500
look at this and then he walks up and he like and it is the guy from glass

417
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:50,240
or from knives out yeah and he opens us on you. He opens up her throat slit

418
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
ceiling up

419
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:58,060
puts his fingers in a hall. Oh there is a piece of paper in here. Let's see what

420
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:03,000
it reads. I did it. I did it. Well, criminal, the paper cut killer, take

421
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,340
this to the forensic lab and see if it's signed anywhere and then and then and

422
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:11,160
then get this here's. I'm going to add a wrinkle. Okay, the librarian. Can you do

423
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:14,260
the library? Go in the shirt? They're a library and says and that was the

424
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,100
motive. I'll take it to the to the lab. That's what the movie's called a wrinkle

425
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:21,300
the case, a wrinkle in the shirt, a wrinkle in the book,

426
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,580
a wrinkle in the book and also the shirt that was at the laundromat next door.

427
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:30,280
Wait, so what was the setup? And then the librarian says, I'll take this to

428
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,060
the lab. Why would you take it to the lab for me? I'll just take it. I like

429
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,760
doing things for you. Well, thank you so much for being helpful, Mrs. Janice.

430
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,460
And then the librarian walks off screen and we don't know where Cici go. Okay,

431
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:43,960
but we assume she goes to the lab. But we don't know. But here comes the

432
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:46,300
detective. That's where that's, kind of put a pin in there. A cyst,

433
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:48,340
sidekick. Sidekick. Hey!

434
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:55,220
My God! Why can't we dissolve this crime today? Oh my God, my canine sidekick is

435
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,020
speaking English.

436
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:02,100
Holy, the devil's got me. Oh my God, I think I, well, here. I guess I'm okay

437
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,260
with it. Yeah, I mean, I guess it's kind of cool. We need to find a murder

438
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:09,940
weapon. And you have the perfect nose to find smells of murder. I pull out.

439
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,740
Okay, now you need to shut up. I will pull, no, you need to.

440
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,460
There's a bee in this library.

441
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,460
That's the problem.

442
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:25,460
That's a problem with a canine.

443
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Somebody get a book on bees and find out what they don't like

444
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,460
to get this bee out of here.

445
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,460
Okay, I'm going to swat the bee.

446
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,460
Oh, it's staying now because it was used to swat a bee.

447
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,460
Okay, wait, let me get the bee.

448
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,460
No, no, no, no, no.

449
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,700
so don't shoot at the be grab my

450
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:49,100
the jump pad. We have to get up to the second guys. I want to so I do want to

451
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:54,140
solve this mystery. Yeah, okay, okay, so it was the librarian's husband. Yeah,

452
00:27:54,140 --> 00:28:00,220
it is a set up with Janice and his name and because I will say I want to expand

453
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,560
the library. Oh, my God, the the laundromat lady was taking out all the

454
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,460
books that were highest demand and keeping them for too long as well, and

455
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:14,440
it's also mighty curious that the killer, it was all erotic, does a murder

456
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:18,940
directly in front of Janice and yeah exactly, but not and she can't identify

457
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,380
and kill Janice and Janice, they asked they asked what they asked Janice like

458
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:26,620
what did the guy look like you did and she's like my husband. She's like no,

459
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,560
she's like well. I think he was about three inches tall and he had great so

460
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:35,460
you should go find a guy. It looks like that I'll be right on well based on the

461
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,560
security footage. He doesn't look like that at all. There's no such thing as a

462
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,580
that is green. Wait, who's that and you see him? He's looking he's checking out

463
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,400
a book yeah. How to get taller, how to get taller and less green. She's

464
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,080
friend again,

465
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,960
and she's framing

466
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:55,180
how to get taller and turn into a blue guy instead of a green guy. It would be

467
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:59,440
would you rather be blue or green in this world in this world that were this

468
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,160
movie world, the current world that we live in. I was in this world, then

469
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,600
in the

470
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,640
green. I would die up world. Would you rather be a blue motherfucker or a

471
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:14,360
green bastard? I would rather be a blue motherfucker. I guess I'd rather be

472
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:19,040
green. You'd be green. Why? 'Cause I could be an alien or a lizard. I think

473
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,920
I'd rather be blue because I like blue more than green. Yeah. I think green,

474
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,960
just when it comes to a green guy,

475
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,480
there's something special about it. A blue guy is like a blue guy, but a green

476
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,880
guy is almost like... Green is almost alien. It's almost like unbelievably

477
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:39,680
I think green would make it to a higher level of public office. A green guy, the

478
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:44,360
exact same guy with green skin or blue skin. Blue skin, oh my God. See, this is

479
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:47,200
like another... See, I think it would be blue maybe because I think green...

480
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,160
Racially coded question. I think green, it does, you think mutant, you think

481
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,480
alien, you think blue, you think I'm blue. Yeah, I think blue is literally like,

482
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:59,480
"Oh, this guy is a party animal. This is a big fat liar." But green, this is guys

483
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,120
from another world. This is a whole other planet of people. Or he's a... But a

484
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,360
blue person that we have blue people. There are people turn blue people eat

485
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:12,480
colloidal silver to make themselves and then blue, but people eat broccoli.

486
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,980
They turn green if they don't eat green, green candy. According to what

487
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,160
happens, that's what happens.

488
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:22,280
That's what happens if you eat a bunch of carrots. The can you turn orange

489
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,280
makes you orange. I think I had an orange and it makes you president. I

490
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,200
honestly think I was orange for about one year when I was in high school

491
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,040
because how many carrots I ate. There's some I think I'm also I could be blue

492
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,380
pretty easily. I think I could come blue. I think that happened on like an old

493
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:40,060
seven. My hands and feet turn blue. One of the I've never been blue and I've

494
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:40,860
never been green.

495
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:45,660
I bet you've been blue. I've been green and blue. I think we all three of us

496
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,700
have been blue for a video, but I've never been naturally blue. I think I've

497
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,300
been naturally both blue and green on parts of my body. I've seen you be green

498
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,220
yeah and I think I've seen you be blue and it's not my hands and feet turn

499
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,980
blue. Yeah, yeah, I've seen your blue feet. Yeah, but I would I think that you

500
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,220
have to go blue because you got to go blue is like you turn. You can be a DJ

501
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:10,780
green. People are going to mistake you for a plant. I think green and I've

502
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:14,180
it's happened to me. I think you go under the wrong lighting. Some people are

503
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,620
going to get very mad at you. Also people don't like Shrek. Yeah, people don't

504
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,460
like the Grinch. Well, they didn't like Shrek at first. Blue Grinch is worse

505
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,980
than the Green Grinch. Yeah, that's true, but yeah, but Blue Grinch also is not

506
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:28,700
widely known. It's true. It's completely true, but I think I like that. I think I

507
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:34,180
like the idea of being green precisely because it's so scary. You want to start

508
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,900
from the bottom. Yeah. I want to walk around and be like, 'That's right,

509
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,300
motherfucker, I'm green.' And then, 'What are you gonna do about it?' This guy

510
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:43,100
looks like a green apple. If I was blue or green, I think I would need to also

511
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:47,300
be in, like, the NBA or something. Yeah. What about hot pink? Hot pink? That

512
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,820
would, that would easily be the worst. Hot pink is the worst, 'cause then

513
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,540
everyone thinks that you just have high blood pressure from eating. Yeah, no,

514
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,220
I've seen, no, hot pink, not like, not like... Everyone thinks that you eat a

515
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:00,220
close enough to a shade of human person. Yeah, they're going to think that you

516
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:05,700
just this guy's fucking a part pig. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and look, see right

517
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:09,040
there, like that shade of pink. That's not that's

518
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,740
yeah, I don't think that people are. I think that's going to have a similar

519
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:17,420
reaction to green or blue when it's that like look, look at this guy with the

520
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,660
with the with the ears here. Yeah, that's Mr. Pink. I don't know who that

521
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,780
is and there's all if you're telling me if you saw a guy who was this color,

522
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,360
would be like oh yeah. I guess that you could just have high boy. Can you click

523
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,920
that link, go to pink, go back,

524
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:36,080
click on that? Mr. Pink? Mr. Pink on mushroommagazine.com. Well yeah. And

525
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,920
here's all the info about him.

526
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,800
Mr. Pink? Who the fuck is this? Yes, I accept the cookies. This is art fashion.

527
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:47,560
Everybody at the big festivals knows Mr. Pink. He is half naked and painted in

528
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:51,160
pink and jumps out the crowd as if he emerged from another dimension. Okay.

529
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,600
tens of thousands of festival people have seen him. This is what you guys were

530
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,840
saying about the fucking like being a green person.

531
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,720
Your real name is Jovis and you are from the United States. Wait, his name is

532
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:09,440
Joe Visible? No, Jovis. Jovis. Wait, hold on. What was the funniest? Oh God,

533
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,160
he looks amazing. Wow. I wanna read this question. He says, "What is the

534
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,480
funniest experience you had when performing as Mr. Pink?" My God, there

535
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,320
have been literally hundreds. They are all so unique and precious. It would be

536
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:22,160
really hard for me. I thought he was going to tell a funny. No, that's

537
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,460
really that means that the experience was too funny and he doesn't want to

538
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:30,040
repeat it. I think he's done bad things. He asked then because it's twenty

539
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,700
sixteen. We haven't heard from him. Yeah, but anyway, that's my point right. A

540
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,060
guy who's this color of pink. He pops up at a festival. Hundreds of thousands of

541
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:41,640
people are paying attention to him or writing articles. It's not normal enough.

542
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:48,840
It's still a blue tear experience. Yeah, Patrick swatting him away. Yeah, I don't

543
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,640
I'm here. I think if he comes back, I'm going to slap the shit out of him again.

544
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,080
OK, what?

545
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,040
Color would you least want to be?

546
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,480
I think you've already been over this.

547
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,200
White. Yeah. Yeah.

548
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I would rather be green or blue than the honky I am.

549
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,640
Yeah, honestly, because then at least like, you know, it's like telling people

550
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,160
like, you know, I just say half Italian.

551
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:15,920
I literally I'm actually fucking blue.

552
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,560
blue. Yeah, I'm blue, but I'm actually like some and I would get you know it

553
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:25,540
would be like it would be fun to be blue and then to get really mad at people

554
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:29,180
who play the song and be like yeah, very funny man. Yeah, what a great

555
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:33,180
while so original, huh? That's what I would say there is and it's by Ruka

556
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,220
Ruka Ali. Oh yeah,

557
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:42,020
yeah, yeah, and you can't play that. No, you'd be able to be the ultimate. Okay,

558
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:47,200
let's let's dig deeper. What's the worst two colors to be your half half and

559
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,940
we're upper body is completely one color lower body completely. I would say okay,

560
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:54,500
the best one yeah is perfectly black and white like a piano.

561
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,740
Whoa, what are you doing? He's playing with effects. Don't don't don't worry

562
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,860
about you be a perfectly black and white like a piano, especially if you can get

563
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:06,160
the cross section right down the hat like the I'm saying I'm saying top and

564
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:09,160
bottom and bottom. I was thinking strike because then you have to make a

565
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,600
conscious decision like left and right. It's like left and right,

566
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:14,600
whatever you could switch those, but top and bottom. That's you want to

567
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,300
see what color your ass is and what color your face is. I was thinking

568
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:22,800
just full stripes all over the body, like pink stripes with you'd be

569
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,100
Superman ice cream color. Yeah, yes, you would be red and I would be

570
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:33,600
like a bomb pop. Yeah, I think I think red and white is pretty good.

571
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,700
I guess I guess now that I'm thinking about it, we'd have to think about

572
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,300
what countries flags are two colors and maybe what? Oh yeah, because that's

573
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:44,940
gonna, 'cause red and white is what Poland? I would. Oh God no. That's Poland.

574
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,920
I would not wanna be red and white. So yeah.

575
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,540
The Philippines flag is

576
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:56,420
red and blue. Who's Philippines? I don't know. You said that like it was a

577
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,060
guy named Philippines. I know Philippines. I would... He's my barber.

578
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,580
I think green and... Okay guys, let's dig deeper. What would the worst 1000

579
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:11,260
colors to be probably the whole rainbow. Yeah, the rainbow is barely even it's

580
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:15,520
out of the color because if I tan, then it's going to get darker and darker

581
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,340
until it's like a

582
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:23,260
like a negative of a rainbow. Yeah, an opposite bow, but then in the winter, I

583
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:31,780
become pastel sunbow sunbow. Yeah, that's scary. Damn pastel pasty, pasty

584
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,820
white like I am right now.

585
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:38,820
Speaking of the rainbow, we finally got into...

586
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,820
That's barely white.

587
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,820
I think you're calling me Barry White.

588
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,820
We finally got into Pride Month.

589
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,820
Talk a little bit about that.

590
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:47,820
Me?

591
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,820
Yeah.

592
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,820
What does it mean to you, Pride Month?

593
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:54,820
It means that there's going to be some sales for...

594
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:58,820
You're going to start wearing that dog mask and walking around with the whip?

595
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:09,060
I don't know because my domino is not participating this year because of woke reasons.

596
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,220
Is piss going to enter the picture for you?

597
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:19,340
That's really, really funny to be like an anti-woke person who's also into all that

598
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,340
stuff.

599
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:21,340
Gayness?

600
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,340
Being gay?

601
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,340
Yeah, being a gay.

602
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,580
You think anti-woke people who are gay?

603
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:27,580
Or like being right wing?

604
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:31,580
right wing... So you don't like David Rubin? No.

605
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:35,260
Because now, it's like all the

606
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,780
right wing people now are just calling gay people pedophiles

607
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:42,140
and it's just like, alright, what are you...

608
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:44,700
It's your reflection in the headphones.

609
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,500
Can you, Jubio, can you really quickly make it look like

610
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,780
Patrick has put a Twitch chat up like he's doing a Hassan stream while he's talking about this?

611
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,740
God damn it.

612
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,740
just a bunch of people. I'm not going to talk about growing twitch chat. I'm not

613
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:01,380
going to talk about this. I love these right wing people are they gays or

614
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:06,900
got you. Yeah, pride month. Honestly, I think it's gone corporate. It is gone

615
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:11,500
corporate. I preferred it back when we were kids. Yeah, I like for I was a

616
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:15,900
little before I was walking around there before the chase bank got in dude.

617
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:20,020
Seriously, that chase bank is all over pride. My yeah, you know who else is

618
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:23,820
there. Black guys do nobody's complaining about.

619
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:33,020
Not kidding. Yeah, we should get a pride float that we could be that hard. I

620
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:37,820
almost I almost was a part of one last year, but then I decided not to do it.

621
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:43,020
I was like, wait, why'd you decide not to do it? Because it was gay. Wow. No,

622
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,020
you know what? I did instead was my friends. Wow. I did my friends fashion

623
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:52,360
show and I met that pit bull impersonator and then you were like I'm going to be on

624
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:58,860
a pride float. I was almost it was a it was Ben Ben Mora. You thought that you

625
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,000
were going to be on a pride float. They were not letting us anywhere near there

626
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:02,780
on the Snoopy.

627
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:08,740
The string

628
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:14,120
smiling

629
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:26,440
I think they got a Polaris slingshot for that, though I was kind of a Snoopy no

630
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:30,600
no for remember. We saw that like Polaris slingshot like meet up dude.

631
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:34,040
That was sick. There's a rental place about two blocks away from my apartment.

632
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah, it has like four of them out. I saw an old lady driving one the other day.

633
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,040
They're good car. I want to we need to get a three seat a

634
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,800
Polaris Slingshot. I think they're only two seater.

635
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,560
Well, they can make a special one for us. They should. We should get a double

636
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,480
decker. We get the pride float. Whoa, right? Three seater, double decker,

637
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,840
Polaris Slingshot that we have as our pride float. We go in to the pride

638
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,000
parade and we're like,

639
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,480
"How the hell did we get here?" What if... Yes, we dress up like The Hangover.

640
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,080
what the hell?

641
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:13,120
What? We're just trying to drive our three seated

642
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:13,880
Polaris.

643
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:18,760
What if- Where the hell are we right now? What if aliens finally detect the

644
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,900
Earth and they're coming down in their UFOs and they're coming down to make

645
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,740
contact and they're like, "We're gonna come down. We need to make contact with

646
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:27,400
these humans. We gotta come down to a place with high concentration of human

647
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:29,660
activity." And they come down in the middle of the pride parade and they land

648
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,860
their UFO and they come out and everyone's like taking pictures like, "Oh

649
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,200
my God, it's aliens!" And they take their pictures and they're all next to all

650
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:37,440
the guys sucking each other and with the pride flag and our first

651
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,140
our first pictures of ever of aliens. They're all people pissing on each

652
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,400
other and then forever

653
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,280
then the aliens are forever. No, the aliens. Can you imagine that situation

654
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,200
and people will be like I did not have this on my bingo card? Yes, yes, and the

655
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,080
aliens also would be so probably when they figured out what was actually

656
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,400
like. Oh, my God, we're getting out of here. Homophobic alien showing up

657
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,800
because they definitely aliens definitely are. That is I guess I never

658
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,940
the the first picture somebody ever takes of an alien is not going to be just an

659
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,660
alien against a white background. No, they're going to land somewhere.

660
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,900
They're going to be in front of like

661
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,520
or something. They're going to be in front of a guy. There's going to be a

662
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,580
crazy guy. They're literally going to show up at Burning Man. Yeah, they will

663
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,140
be in the middle of Burning Man. Yeah, women with giant hippie tits flying out

664
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,320
of their pants. What is Burning Man? Burning Man is a festival. It's

665
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,720
basically a, yeah, it's like a sex and

666
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:36,840
It's not really, I mean there is music there, but it's mostly like a, you go there, you do

667
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:39,520
drugs and you fuck people and you burn a big worker man.

668
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,240
That's why all the tech people go there?

669
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
Yeah.

670
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
Oh.

671
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,240
I thought it was a music festival.

672
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,440
No, it's like art and dance.

673
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,080
It's an experience.

674
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,120
The fire that burns the man should, somebody should lead a big trail of gasoline and burn

675
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:55,120
everyone else that's there.

676
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,760
You want to kill these, it's like a hundred thousand people, you want to kill all these

677
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
people?

678
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
They're going to burning man, yeah.

679
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Yeah, they should all get it.

680
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
You didn't even know what it was.

681
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,120
You just learned, I just said that they have dancing and art.

682
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,120
You just have to kill them all, burn them to death.

683
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:13,000
Burn them all to death in the middle of the desert?

684
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,960
Burn all those motherfuckers that bring my big magnifying glass, put it over them.

685
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,360
Burning Man, I would go to Burning Man.

686
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
I would not.

687
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
That sounds fucking cringe.

688
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:21,360
I would go anywhere for the most part.

689
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
But I would go to Coachella though.

690
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,360
I'd go to Coachella.

691
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,360
I really want to go to the gathering of the juggalos and perform there.

692
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:34,840
I was performing that song. That's you performing. Yeah. You're doing your DJ

693
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:39,800
set at Coachella. I bring this over there. Only hitting that. Yeah. But I would go to

694
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,720
any, I'm trying to think if I've ever been to a music festival. Oh my god, we came

695
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,560
full circle. Guess what? All the way back to music festivals. I don't think I've ever been to one.

696
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:53,880
I've been to Boston Calling. Oh, me and Pat went to a... Oh, we went to FYA Fest. I lied.

697
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,760
I've been to Azalea Festival in Wilmington, North Carolina. Azalea Banks?

698
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,260
I've no no no I've been there twice. One time I saw Leonard

699
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,260
Skannard and one time I saw Snoop Dogg.

700
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,760
Nice, but those are the only people there.

701
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,260
Yeah, nice, but it's not really a music festival.

702
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:14,860
We went to the FYA in 2022, I think 2022, but I think that's

703
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:15,360
it. Yeah.

704
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,160
Yeah, I wanted to go to that one the stick new world or whatever.

705
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:26,560
No, the one that had him gay and had him in like gay Mr.

706
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Bungle, your favorite band?

707
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,560
There were a bunch of bands I liked on that show, but I would not go to that festival.

708
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,560
But there was another, I wanted to go to Psycho Las Vegas, which is called Psycho Las Vegas,

709
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:37,560
and it was in Mandalay Bay.

710
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:38,560
Oh wow.

711
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,560
What was that?

712
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,560
It was like I Hate God and Emperor and a bunch of metal bands.

713
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,560
Psycho Las Vegas.

714
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,560
Psycho Las Vegas.

715
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:46,560
The poster said Psycho Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay.

716
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,560
Damn, that's tight.

717
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,560
I was like, God damn.

718
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:53,560
We went, what do, oh that was the first time you ever went to Applebee's.

719
00:43:53,560 --> 00:44:00,240
The first of the first of three or four. Yeah, that's true. I there's the funniest Applebee's

720
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,060
ad that keeps coming on my to be all what happens in it. It is just a video of the food just

721
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,480
bouncing around it like you know how they do in a commercial where the food bounces

722
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,280
down on the plate and there's no talking in it at all and it just shows the food and shows

723
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,160
the name of the food and the prices and it's just I want to dance with somebody. Okay,

724
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,400
I want to feel the heat was it just plays that song and it doesn't make you want to

725
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,720
to go to Applebee's. It makes me laugh every time.

726
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:24,720
Hey, real quick.

727
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,000
Because it's just food on the screen and they're just playing that song.

728
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,200
As a comedian, I have something to say to you commercial writers.

729
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,200
Back the fuck off!

730
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,200
That's right.

731
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,200
Okay? Leave the funny shit to me!

732
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:36,200
Uh-huh.

733
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:39,200
I'm sick of you fucking making these little...

734
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,200
Leave Eric Wareheim out of it. I don't give a fuck.

735
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,200
You're basically doing an entire season of network comedy...

736
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,200
Tim and Eric.

737
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,200
In one... 30 seconds. Fuck that!

738
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:55,600
fact, Tim and Eric, get your ass back to adult swim. A T and T get your ass off

739
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:59,520
purple mattresses. I don't want to see no more little Caesars commercials. I

740
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,760
want commercials that are unintentionally funny, like from the old

741
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:07,040
days with puppets. I am. I am coordinating DDoS attacks and

742
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:11,000
electromagnetic pulses to take down the entire AT&T network. All the

743
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,880
McDonald's commercials. Stop taking my ideas. Yeah, I have a bunch of ideas

744
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,560
about commercials where people get McDonald's food and eat it and smile and

745
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,980
I've been using every single one. Most of my stand up is about people eating

746
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:24,320
different foods and going, "Mmm, that's good. How much does this cost?"

747
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,740
So please shut the fuck up. And Burger King, you stole my idea to make a

748
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:30,660
commercial for your burgers. Stop stealing my song, Burger King. When I saw

749
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:34,600
your menu, I thought, "I'm gonna make a commercial about these items." You did

750
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,980
it, but I had the idea first. I swear to God, I was walking around Burger King

751
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:43,940
headquarters in downtown New York City, Manhattan, and I was walking around just

752
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:49,160
going whopper, whopper, whopper, whopper, junior, junior, junior, junior.

753
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,160
(Laughter)

754
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
Yep.

755
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,160
Like I do every single day.

756
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,160
And they stole it and changed the fucking lyrics.

757
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:59,200
I know that they had one of those little guns that you can, with headphones on, that they

758
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
use in a spy movie.

759
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,200
The spy gun.

760
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,200
FBI.

761
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,200
And they stole that from me.

762
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,200
I know for a fact.

763
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,960
And do you guys remember what I used in my bit when I used to do in Boston about like

764
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,360
Arby's, what's their fucking thing, saying like, oh what, we have meat?

765
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:12,360
Yeah.

766
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,680
Boy, guess what their slogan is now.

767
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,880
no fucking way. We have the money. They stole that from you. They stole that.

768
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,320
They ripped that shit off of me. That is so fucked up that they do that to

769
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,160
Boston Open. My comics is stealer shit. Let me say something though. Most

770
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,720
vacation and travel ads, you keep doing what you're doing, 'cause I like seeing

771
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:32,160
the beaches and the TV. Yeah. Melissa McCarthy, you stay in that Travelocity

772
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,920
commercial or whatever. Melissa McCarthy, y'all, y'all pussies stay.

773
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:40,720
No, this is what you should be doing. You should not be doing funny commercials,

774
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,560
you guys, you should be doing dramatic commercials, scary commercials,

775
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:48,100
tears, a musical with food. I want to see every more of that surprisingly

776
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:50,740
human commercials. Here's an idea for a commercial Arby's.

777
00:46:50,740 --> 00:46:56,120
Somebody's at an Arby's. They say, let me get a half pound roast beef. The

778
00:46:56,120 --> 00:46:58,040
guy goes, yeah, of course he grabs like a

779
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:02,020
half pound roast beef sandwich. Okay, no pound of roast beef. Yeah, I thought

780
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:02,540
you were saying

781
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:06,800
he gets the you should be able to do that. It should be able. He gets the

782
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,520
sandwich right and he puts it in his pocket, his chest pocket for good luck,

783
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,500
like or just to put it there, that's the only pocket he has he's wearing a

784
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,520
uniclo pants with small pockets anyway.

785
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,760
So he's about to walk out okay, bam open the door, five foot, five white guy with

786
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:25,860
a bullet proof vest and an ar fifteen, who says I've been playing video games

787
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,960
my whole life and I'm ready to kill. Can I add a

788
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,940
mass shooting, killing every single person in the Arby's brain flying

789
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:32,320
everywhere?

790
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,560
He's double tapping the babies, he's killing everybody yeah, but and then

791
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:42,600
this guy he he's fully in shock, realize he's been shot and then he's down on

792
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:46,340
the floor. The guy finally does he kills himself or gets shot by the cops or

793
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,140
whatever, but then the guy goes oh my God wait pulls out the thing like a

794
00:47:50,140 --> 00:47:54,240
Bible. There's so many layers of meat in a be sandwiched, completely block the

795
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,500
bullet from entering his heart eats it and then takes a bite and he says

796
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,860
doesn't taste like bullet at all. It doesn't actually

797
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:06,200
I was going to say I have a Patrick. I've had my hand raised okay, okay, and

798
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:09,420
We do not see that. We don't do this. We don't do that. We don't do that.

799
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:13,620
We don't do that here. I know that basically legacy and movie tie-ins is huge right now.

800
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:18,120
So as a marketing type of guy, let me tell you that this could be a tie-in for the new

801
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:20,620
legacy sequel. They're probably going to make for Falling Down.

802
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:23,820
Yep. The scene when he's in goes into the burger place and he shoots everything.

803
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,020
You could get him to come do that. Does he shoot in it?

804
00:48:26,020 --> 00:48:31,520
Yeah. He shoots up a burger place. I was going to say he after he has the bullet in the

805
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,360
sandwich pulls out the sandwich right in the guy's face. I can't there's so much.

806
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:41,360
It's probably better if he's saying which is so juicy. Oh my God. There's so

807
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:41,640
much.

808
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:48,720
Or he just goes over to the guy. So that guy takes the AR 15. Yeah,

809
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:52,280
accidentally kills himself but shoots through his own head into the guy's head

810
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:55,720
and double suicide. No, I'm saying that the shooter kills himself. That's

811
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:59,240
because he can't handle that was cool though. And then at the end it's like

812
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:03,400
it's like Arby's. It's like a fuck, what the fuck just happened and every with

813
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,540
every sandwich get a chance to win a ticket to falling down to

814
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:11,080
the revenge, the revenge, Arby's, who the hell made this commercial? I just

815
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:15,200
had the best was a good idea. I said the best idea for a sequel to falling down

816
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,540
yeah, following up, falling down to society strikes back and it's all the

817
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:23,160
people he fucked with and they're kind of kill. Yeah, that's a good idea.

818
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,880
They're doing pitchforks in the street

819
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,520
that it's about cancel culture. You know that's a good idea. You got cancelled

820
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,560
because you went crazy and killed all these people

821
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:38,560
out a big as RPG on the highway and shot all basically all three of us just

822
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,200
learned about every single character and extra from the original. They're old

823
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,200
now yeah, I like they all have gone. They all have the same guns that Michael

824
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,680
Douglas has. I've never seen that movie, but I've seen every clip from that

825
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,520
movie. Yeah, it's a good movie. I've seen

826
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:57,040
that character parodied in Tony Hawk's American, I never really understand why

827
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:57,800
he does all that the

828
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:04,000
it's kind of a satire. He basically just fed up with modern and it's made by

829
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Joel Schumacher, who made Batman. Oh really yeah, it's a good ass movie. You

830
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,080
should watch it. I bet you'd like it, because I bet you identify with the

831
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,000
character. I'm nothing, okay, I'm the furthest thing from violence. Why in my

832
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,560
head I just is to until

833
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:22,120
I do get pretty worried that one day I'll snap yeah, but I think that that's

834
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,160
probably eight or nine years away. I've driven you to the brink a few times. You've never

835
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:31,080
driven me to violence. I've driven you to violence many a time. You have instigated

836
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,200
violence and you have struck first. I will never ever strike first. There is not, no,

837
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,240
I have seen you, you have slapped me. When you wanted it. You have slapped me a lot on

838
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,080
this show. Shut up right now. There is now visual evidence of your slapping miss. Shut

839
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,760
up. You tried to put me in handcuffs one time. That was funny. You tried to handcuff me to

840
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,360
to you while we were recording. Why would you not want to be handcuffed to me for a day?

841
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:59,920
That is a perfect cartoon style. I think that you would be good in that. You know what I

842
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:05,880
had to do that day? Go to prison. No. What? Jerk it. I don't remember. I think it was

843
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,320
jerk it with the left. Jerk it with the left. Jerk it with my left hand. Jerk it with the

844
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:16,920
both. Jerk it with the both hand. I gave you, by the way, when I tried to handcuff you to

845
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:22,720
me. I gave you my right hand, which meant on your left, which meant that I was

846
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,140
giving you the, I'm, we're both right handed. Then I broke the handcuffs with

847
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:32,140
my strength and you threw, they were cheapo handcuffs, you threw that at my

848
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:38,100
knee and it did hurt. Really? Yeah, because it was a piece of metal at my

849
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:43,900
knee. Honestly man, so I've driven you to the brink of insanity and violence. I

850
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:47,900
I didn't even know that until right now. And that's another problem. Why can't we

851
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:50,940
communicate more? Yeah. Cause that's when we were not communicators. That's probably

852
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,900
two years ago. That is two years ago. And you couldn't just tell me. What a wild

853
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,200
ride it's been. You couldn't just tell me in the moment, "Hey, when you threw that

854
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,300
at my knee." It hurt my knee from the metal. I probably did tell you in the moment.

855
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,340
Metal on my knee hurts. Immediately, probably. I don't think you did. I think I

856
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,900
would have remembered that. Yeah. Because every single time that you tell me

857
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:13,580
anything really hurts you, I scratch it into my heart. I inscribe it on my heart

858
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:18,620
that fucking razor blade. Yeah, I did throw a can at your head one time.

859
00:52:18,620 --> 00:52:24,300
That was wrong. That was wrong. And you I remember you throwing a shoe to you.

860
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,340
I remember that you're the hurt or you're the abusive one. You probably

861
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:31,260
you always throw stuff at you. You know, honestly, you always throw stuff at him

862
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:34,100
and then you probably do. Don't say that. Probably. Probably does just

863
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,540
based on the evidence. Yeah, based on how much stuff he throws at me, it's

864
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,460
always he throws stuff at you and then you fight back and then it's I get

865
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:45,160
I get scared exactly yeah and I remember every single incident and I fight back

866
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:50,200
well. I'm self to the only the only instigation from you that I can think of

867
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,760
right now

868
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,340
is when we were in Manchester and you tried to kill him. You tried to fight

869
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:58,340
you said let's have a fight club and then you cornered him.

870
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:05,960
I'm trying to find you would not let me in, but that was funny. That was let me

871
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:12,320
something in my defense. He had an alley that his apartment building led into

872
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:16,020
that was basically what I thought was a perfect either fighting or break

873
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:19,940
dancing club. I figured you'd be more into fighting than break dancing. So I

874
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:23,780
said, let's have a fight club and you were being such a sissy about it. Just

875
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,380
fight. I did not want to have a fight club with you because you work out and

876
00:53:27,380 --> 00:53:32,780
stuff and also I was very, very, very fat at the time. I was probably in

877
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:36,580
in terrible shape that I was extremely big at the time. So you probably had

878
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:39,860
pounds on me. You could have destroyed me. Yeah, but I don't have arm strength.

879
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,460
What kind of strength do you have? I don't. I sumo him. I could assume you

880
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:47,460
could have plastered him the wall. You could have got a crazy. That was a crazy

881
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:52,620
look at the time, because I had all of this fat in my gut and waist, but then

882
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:56,980
these tiny arms. I remember that. I remember the first time I saw your tiny

883
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:01,140
arms. It really shocked me. Yeah, because I think I met you in the winter time.

884
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:03,700
Yeah, when you had burned all your fat reserves?

885
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:04,700
No, I was just wearing hoodies.

886
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,700
I was wearing those hoodies.

887
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:10,700
But the first time I saw him with a short sleeve shirt, I was like, "Holy, this guy's

888
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:13,700
got some mini skinny arms and a big ass body."

889
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,660
Big ass butt in the back.

890
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:17,660
But you...

891
00:54:17,660 --> 00:54:18,660
I'd eat McDonald's every day.

892
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:23,700
But okay, so I admit that Fight Club is the only time I instigated.

893
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:24,700
I don't...

894
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,780
Do you remember Atlantic City?

895
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,780
What did we do there?

896
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:30,380
When you hit me in the elevator like Solange?

897
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,980
Yes, and then ran away. Yeah, and then he ran away. He fully Solange and me fully

898
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,480
Jay-Z. Don't give a fuck. I'm a billionaire. I'm not going to touch this

899
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,280
thing. No, you were you, but then I chased him. We had a chase. No, you did

900
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,780
the thing of like you calmly kind of walked out and then once you do the next

901
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:48,880
time that you guys were in the same space, you got him. I have to. I think I

902
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,680
only remember the times when both of you were fighting against each other

903
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:57,380
because I'm cowering. Yeah, one time I drank. I was like, damn, these truly's

904
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:01,280
these are eight ABV, that's crazy. And I had a six pack of them and I drank the

905
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,480
whole thing and then I slapped you.

906
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,980
Abusive dad.

907
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:05,680
I remember that.

908
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,480
Abusive dad.

909
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:06,880
Yeah.

910
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:07,280
Yeah.

911
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:07,680
Wait, when...

912
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,380
They say that when you're drunk, you're who you truly are when you're sober.

913
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:12,380
Yeah, you're a violent abuser.

914
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,580
I'm a completely violent person, yeah.

915
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:17,580
They say that getting more drunk actually makes you more sober when it

916
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:18,380
comes to your behavior.

917
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,180
When people say... That really terrifies me. If I'm actually who I am when I'm

918
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,080
drunk, that is the worst news ever.

919
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,180
Yeah, it's so funny.

920
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:29,480
Mostly when I drink, I have a good time.

921
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,680
You just blink a lot.

922
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,180
Yeah.

923
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:31,680
Yeah.

924
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,680
I blink a lot and I go, "Hmmm."

925
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,180
Yeah.

926
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,180
You go, "Hmmm."

927
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:39,680
And I like think it's funny to put like a new hat on.

928
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:43,180
Or if I find a jacket on the street, I'm going to put that on.

929
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,180
You drunk on the street is a scary sight.

930
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:47,180
Why?

931
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,680
Because you're going to pick something up.

932
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:49,180
Yeah.

933
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:50,680
Pick some trash up and keep it.

934
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,180
I'm going to pick something up. I'm going to keep it.

935
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,180
Yeah. I don't like that.

936
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:54,680
sometimes I sometimes I find money.

937
00:55:54,680 --> 00:56:00,480
Oh, I found it. I found a dollar on the street the other day. I found a sheet of

938
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:08,320
dog stickers. Whoa! I was made to throw them away. By who? You can guess. Wow!

939
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,160
I hate her!

940
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:18,220
So wow! I've been having kind of a rough time at home. Yeah, I can imagine. Yeah,

941
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,560
you need him to come in.

942
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:22,260
Start throwing shit at her.

943
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:28,740
Oh, brother. Yeah, but you haven't you have not violently hurt me in some time.

944
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:32,940
Yeah. So I mean, I've got to stop doing it. There was a recent you threw a can

945
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,700
at him recently. I threw a can at you and no retaliation from me. And you said

946
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:40,460
and I was having a bad day. You looked at me and said you have bad instincts.

947
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:46,060
You do. You have no social. Yeah, completely true. That honestly that did

948
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:50,660
shake me to my core. It's saying you saying you have bad instincts. I was

949
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:54,140
I was clearly in a grumpy mood and you threw a can at my head.

950
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:55,140
Yeah.

951
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,700
And then we had to record a podcast.

952
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,340
Yeah, but then I gave you an apology poem.

953
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,940
I don't remember that.

954
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:02,940
So let's talk AI.

955
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,340
I said I remember exactly what it was.

956
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:05,340
Oh, it was AI.

957
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,340
It was not AI.

958
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,340
It was AI.

959
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:08,340
I came up with it on the spot.

960
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:13,660
Because I said throwing a can even in jest is not the best.

961
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,660
First run.

962
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:15,660
Patrick's first run.

963
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:16,660
Patrick's first run.

964
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,700
After his worst crime.

965
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,200
I'm throw

966
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:25,100
do you guys? I don't know why I start first time you because you grew up with

967
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,800
with brothers. That's true. I was the little sibling, so you were the herder.

968
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,000
I was the instigator and then I would run away.

969
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,240
I you I treat you exact. I realize that day. I treat you exactly like I do. I

970
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:40,280
did my little brother because he would always like punch me or something yeah,

971
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:40,800
and I'll go

972
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:44,400
you don't realize if I fought back, I'd kill you.

973
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,900
If I fought back, if I let myself fight back, you would be fucking dead.

974
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,900
You'd be in the hospital, your neck would be broken.

975
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,260
That's what I used to tell him.

976
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,060
I was the instigator, then when I got older I stopped, but then my two older, my older

977
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:06,580
and my younger brother would fight and then I would use that as an excuse to shut off

978
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,580
their video game and then I would start playing.

979
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,340
I miss fighting my brothers, man.

980
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,340
That was fun shit.

981
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:12,540
Dude, you can't fight anybody anymore.

982
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:14,340
You can't fight your brothers anymore.

983
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:15,340
It's bullshit.

984
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,340
You can fight your brothers.

985
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,340
You can't fight your brothers.

986
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:18,800
I fight my brothers every time.

987
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,800
Then it gets sad.

988
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,880
And like sounds like that happened.

989
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:23,880
There's a hyena outside.

990
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:24,880
Yeah.

991
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,880
But yeah, you can fight your brother.

992
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:28,880
Anytime that we go back for Christmas, we get, we fight.

993
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,880
You fight your brother?

994
00:58:29,880 --> 00:58:31,380
We wrestle over something.

995
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,380
I think my brothers, my older and younger brother have wrestled.

996
00:58:34,380 --> 00:58:35,380
We smoke too much weed and we start wrestling.

997
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,380
At some point.

998
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,380
Watching TV.

999
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:39,380
But yeah, no, now I'm thinking about it.

1000
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:42,380
I have like thrown shit at my brother and then run away.

1001
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:44,380
At Christmas, yeah.

1002
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,880
You're a coward archer.

1003
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:46,880
Uh huh.

1004
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:51,840
Yeah, I got a good aim. You should be on the back lines. Yeah. You're a sniper. I am. Bastard.

1005
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:55,560
I'm real good at sniping. You're not willing to put your body in. Me, I'm the first person

1006
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:59,400
to fucking die. I'd be like the John Daly. I'm like a spy. I'd be the John Daly of snipers.

1007
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:06,760
I'd come in and disguise. Spy, sniper. Pyro. Pyro. Heavy. Yeah. Yeah. I walk in and I just

1008
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:12,280
die as much as possible. There's a, every army is 5,000 me in the front. Do you think,

1009
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:16,960
That makes sense. Like snipers don't really have to be in good physical condition. I mean

1010
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:17,960
they have to run away.

1011
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:19,280
I think they have to carry a bunch of sniper stuff.

1012
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:20,280
Yeah, but John Daly...

1013
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,600
I think every soldier has to be in physical condition, right?

1014
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:25,760
John Daly would just... no, he had a caddy.

1015
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,760
Doesn't everybody have to do all this stuff?

1016
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:30,040
You're saying that snipers should have a caddy.

1017
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,040
Snipers should have a caddy.

1018
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,040
I agree.

1019
00:59:32,040 --> 00:59:35,920
And they can sit up there in their little nest and drink a bunch of high... oh, well

1020
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:36,920
then it affects their aim.

1021
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:37,920
They can't be drunk.

1022
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:38,920
They can smoke a bunch of cigarettes, though.

1023
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,400
I think you probably take some kind of crazy stimulant.

1024
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:44,400
Yeah, Medgar Diazepam.

1025
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,400
Yeah.

1026
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:46,400
Shit.

1027
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,720
I think that if you were the John Daly of snipers, that would be very cool.

1028
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:50,720
Your aim is so good.

1029
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:56,640
I guess it's more like a Dustin Dahlen, where your aim is so good, even though you're a million

1030
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,640
beers deep.

1031
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,600
Or you're like the drunken master.

1032
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,600
Yeah.

1033
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,960
You're only good at aiming when you're drunk.

1034
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,360
You're doing drunken kung fu style stuff.

1035
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:08,680
If you think about playing, you're better when you're playing a first person shooter game

1036
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:13,360
if you're a little drunk. Yeah, that's true. That's actually a myth. Completely

1037
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,200
true. Now that's a myth. It's completely true. That is true. That's an alcohol.

1038
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:21,000
That's completely true. I am stone cold sober when I play FPS shooters.

1039
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:26,320
That's because you play in a different style. Yeah, I do play tiger style. You

1040
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:30,000
play with your keyboard all fucking stupid. I put my keyboard completely

1041
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,520
sideways like this. Yeah, I don't really. I don't know why I just started doing

1042
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,400
it one day. I think I saw some counter strike guy do that. Yeah, I play every

1043
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:42,280
I saw you do that. I saw you do that. I started doing the weird controller grip. Oh, you do?

1044
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:47,160
Yeah. Not for first person shooters, but for Dark Souls. I've been playing it like that.

1045
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,200
I miss the custom controllers. My dad used to have one that was like all, every button

1046
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,960
was on the back. Have you seen, I don't know if we talked, tell me if we talked about this

1047
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,680
before, where the person who made the custom fight stick for the fighting game tournament

1048
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,120
where it's every, it's like, it's, it's like a, they made it in a big shoe box and then

1049
01:01:02,120 --> 01:01:05,800
it's like, it has like a hundred buttons where they're all on a line so that you can do combos

1050
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:09,260
goes by just like just pressing down the like it's like every button is just

1051
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,160
like a different direction thing. So they brought it's like technically legal in

1052
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:13,700
the turn of whatever and got pissed off. That's

1053
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:18,920
it looks like shit. It's like it doesn't actual shoe box. It is a million

1054
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:19,660
buttons and they just go

1055
01:01:19,660 --> 01:01:21,220
and just

1056
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:27,340
because it makes it easier. It's so sick. I would use that. I would win every

1057
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:30,460
single fighting and you can just build that nowadays. People is build their own

1058
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:34,980
ish. I hate builders. Yeah, it's weird. I like out of here builders because where

1059
01:01:35,020 --> 01:01:39,940
did our inventions go? Yeah, it's true. Wow, that's true. That's actually, I'll just be

1060
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:44,340
stuck in your head. Yeah. Yeah, if we had no builders, there would be no inventions.

1061
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:48,620
If we had no inventions, we would have no uniqueness. There would be inventions, but

1062
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:54,700
not prototypes. True. Prototypes are the mother of invention. No. They're the child of an

1063
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:58,700
invention. Mother necessity. Oh. Invention prototypes are the mother of a blueprint.

1064
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:00,700
Who was the mother of invention?

1065
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,700
Necessity.

1066
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,700
Zappa.

1067
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,080
Frank Zappa.

1068
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,140
He died from smoking too much.

1069
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,140
You know that?

1070
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,140
Really?

1071
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:10,140
Yeah.

1072
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:11,140
He's gotta be the only one.

1073
01:02:11,140 --> 01:02:13,860
He was also afraid of the human mouth.

1074
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,860
Or the nose.

1075
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,220
He had a bunch of nose surgery.

1076
01:02:16,220 --> 01:02:19,020
I do not give a fuck about Frank Zappa.

1077
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:23,700
I used to love him so much and then when I got older I was like, "Oh this guy sucks."

1078
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,500
I don't give a fuck about any old music that sounds weird and weird.

1079
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:30,500
I like old music like Da Beus.

1080
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:34,500
Were you kidding me? They got a song about a fucking yellow submarine.

1081
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:37,500
You think that's normal?

1082
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,500
I don't listen to the lyrics.

1083
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,500
Yeah, you just listen to the music.

1084
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,500
You're just there for the tunes.

1085
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,500
You go to the Beatles rock band and turn the vocals down.

1086
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:47,500
Mr. Beef, Captain Zappa.

1087
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,500
I like one Captain Zappa.

1088
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,500
There's a good couple of them.

1089
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:54,500
But it's too much time.

1090
01:02:54,500 --> 01:03:00,180
It's hard. The only weird guys, the only weird guys who have ever made a good rock song are

1091
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:05,860
Ween because they do Spongebob music. They are the inspiration for Spongebob. Most music

1092
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:11,660
is just crap. I can't care about it. Here's what I like. I used to try to care about it,

1093
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:15,900
I just can't care. It's too much of it. I just don't give a fuck. Too many movies. There's

1094
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:21,580
too much tunes to pay attention to. It's like growing up and being like, "Oh yeah, I don't

1095
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,380
I don't need to look at the new Pokemon game.

1096
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:25,380
Yeah.

1097
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:29,100
You need to choose, as you get older, you need to choose a hobby that is not one of the big

1098
01:03:29,100 --> 01:03:32,100
three of music, movies, and games.

1099
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,100
Dinosaurs.

1100
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,100
I picked dinosaurs.

1101
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:35,100
You need to choose dinosaurs.

1102
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:39,620
Something that's so, like, yeah, dinosaurs, crosswords, which is basically, it might as

1103
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:40,620
well be fortune cookies.

1104
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:41,620
Pendulums.

1105
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:42,620
Huh?

1106
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:43,620
Pendulums.

1107
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:44,620
Pendulums?

1108
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,620
You could get into pendulums.

1109
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:46,620
You said pendulum.

1110
01:03:46,620 --> 01:03:47,620
Pendulums.

1111
01:03:47,620 --> 01:03:48,620
Is that a hobby?

1112
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,620
It's a hobby you can have.

1113
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:54,420
Is that a hobby? It's a hobby you can have. You set up stuff and then you swing

1114
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:58,260
your pendulum to make sure that it's fun. Yeah, I mean, honestly, any anything,

1115
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:01,940
any literally imagine a hobby. I mean, if you're doing it in the garage,

1116
01:04:01,940 --> 01:04:06,820
truth, I think the true thing is that music, movies and video games, these are

1117
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:10,420
not hobbies. Grandfather clocks. They're not how you need to have. You need to

1118
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:13,780
have an actual hobby. People think they're not. They're not. No, they're and

1119
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:17,140
they're not even they're barely even interests. They're a thing that everyone

1120
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:20,780
and sees every day of their life. You know it's a nice water and yeah, it's

1121
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:22,100
literally it's food. Yeah,

1122
01:04:22,100 --> 01:04:26,940
ebay's an okay hobby. Yeah, reset. That's a hobby. Anything where you actually do

1123
01:04:26,940 --> 01:04:29,900
something and you're not looking at something, anything that if you're doing

1124
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:34,100
it in the garage or a separate room that's just for this and your wife walks

1125
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:38,780
in, she's upset that you're in there. Yeah, that is a good hobby, because that

1126
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:41,700
means that you don't give a fuck what anybody else thinks, including the person

1127
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:44,380
who's supposed to be closest to you. Yeah, you're still going to do this.

1128
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:48,560
exactly. You don't realize this is this is I do this so that I can spend time

1129
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:51,760
with you because if it wasn't for this, I never see your

1130
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:54,900
I'd be biting your ankles while you're making dinner.

1131
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,460
Okay,

1132
01:04:56,460 --> 01:05:00,180
and cooking's not a hobby either. Nope and anything girls like

1133
01:05:00,180 --> 01:05:05,960
cooking is definitely not a hobby. No cooking is a necessity. Yes, you have

1134
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:10,380
to do that's why people invent food. Yeah, that's why, like I have cooking

1135
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:15,040
Yeah, cooking is not a hobby. You have to cut like a parchment paper and then put a

1136
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,560
salmon in it and then twist it and stuff. This is what I say to my wife. I say,

1137
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,080
I'm like,

1138
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:23,280
"I see you're cooking," and I'm saying, "Just so you know, cooking's not a

1139
01:05:23,280 --> 01:05:26,200
hobby, so if you want to have a hobby, you better clean, too.

1140
01:05:26,200 --> 01:05:30,520
Wash the dishes after. That could be a hobby." Wash my food. Yeah. You better

1141
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:34,040
wash this chicken. You better get home and wash the food. I need to, yeah,

1142
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:38,240
put the plug in the sink drain, fill it up with Fabulo, so I want you to dunk

1143
01:05:38,280 --> 01:05:41,920
the chicken in yeah, and then I want you to dunk that I want you to put the

1144
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:45,760
fabulous on the air fryer so we can get a nice a nice smell. Turn it into like

1145
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,960
a fruit roll up yeah with the fabulous

1146
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:53,320
fabulous. So put a little bit fabulous in gelatin powder. That would honestly

1147
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,880
probably eat that and what are you doing? Don't throw away those chicken

1148
01:05:55,880 --> 01:06:03,360
bones. I'm making a diorama. I'm making a man of chicken bone man. I'm making

1149
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:08,740
chicken bone man in my office. You know what he fucking times have I told you

1150
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:12,840
not to throw away the bones, because I make mobiles and I make chicken man and

1151
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,020
I've been working on this for the past six months. You've seen what he looks

1152
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:19,620
like. I've got the face almost done. I just need fifteen

1153
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:28,600
with glue. You can't vacuum in here. You can't vacuum. You can't back and take

1154
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:32,620
one of the did you touch my bones? Did you move my bones? Because I didn't oh

1155
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,940
it's in this drawer. I didn't put it there, though. I know for a fact that I

1156
01:06:35,940 --> 01:06:38,500
did not put this bone in my sweatshirt drawer.

1157
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:43,120
I know that you did that. I did not forget this bone in my sweatshirt

1158
01:06:43,120 --> 01:06:46,680
pocket. I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't do stay the fuck out of my

1159
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:47,120
sweat.

1160
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:50,220
Those are my sweatshirts and you can't

1161
01:06:50,220 --> 01:06:57,260
top drawer, all bones, second drawer, all sweatshirts, bottom drawer is all

1162
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:01,640
my glue. Guess what I'm doing? I'm making a sweatshirt made out of bones,

1163
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:04,120
putting a padlock on all of your dresser.

1164
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:12,540
How are my shirts? They're too big on you. What the hell you're wearing that

1165
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:17,060
to bed. You're wearing that to bed. That's my crank. Yeah, put that back.

1166
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:20,540
Here's the here. That's my crank. Yeah, what if I'm going to sell that? What

1167
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:24,140
if somebody swatted us right now and called in and said that I was I was

1168
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,100
holding somebody hostage? You're wearing my shirt. They'd come in. They kill you

1169
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:31,360
I think you were me yeah. You fucking don't bitch a woman would not wear a

1170
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:35,540
shirt that has Dane Cook's face on it. There's no world. Okay, listen if you're

1171
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:38,820
gonna we'll compromise. You can wear that big shirt, but you gotta wear some

1172
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:42,780
big pants too. Yep, yep, and a way it looks like you're not wearing anything

1173
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,820
because the shirt's so long. You have to dress up like a mini baby. You need to

1174
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:52,100
dress exactly like me or else I don't get turned on by you. Oh come on. You

1175
01:07:52,100 --> 01:07:56,220
need to wear my big pants and you need to wear my big shirt and my big way.

1176
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:59,740
not the episode. I can't do this. Go pull up the website. Oh wait.

1177
01:07:59,740 --> 01:08:05,540
What website? The website. Pink Person? Yeah, pull this website up. Okay.

1178
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:11,420
Why Pink Person? Are we... So we have a new live show coming up. Oh shit.

1179
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,380
Coming up on July 14th. Go to swagproof.com/shows. July 14th, this is a

1180
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:22,020
show featuring Pierce Campion, who you know from previous episodes. You also

1181
01:08:22,020 --> 01:08:28,180
know Alex Forrest and Joe Gleason from the planet.

1182
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,180
Home planet.

1183
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,180
What's their thing called?

1184
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:35,180
This is world's biggest army port of call, Gowanus. We're doing a sketch show at Little

1185
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,180
Field.

1186
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:38,900
These are sketches that we are writing.

1187
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,900
It's going to be a sketch show.

1188
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:46,060
So imagine, think about this, think about all the crazy funny stuff we were saying about

1189
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:52,540
are making a bone sweatshirt for a girlfriend. Imagine if that was all fleshed out and we

1190
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:59,780
wrote stuff like that. And we wrote it and we performed it live on a stage. So go to swagpoop.com/shows

1191
01:08:59,780 --> 01:09:05,980
to buy tickets to it. It's in July. You better be there. I made a video for it and it flopped.

1192
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:10,340
Big flop. It flopped immediately. A flopping video. We're going to have to promote this

1193
01:09:10,340 --> 01:09:13,020
way more. We're going to have to do another video.

1194
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,020
Patrick had a giant flop.

1195
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,020
Maybe we just post the poster.

1196
01:09:15,020 --> 01:09:16,020
The little video that I made.

1197
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,900
Instead of making weird videos.

1198
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,900
I thought that it was a good video.

1199
01:09:19,900 --> 01:09:20,900
You flopped a fucking ton.

1200
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:21,900
And it fucking flopped.

1201
01:09:21,900 --> 01:09:22,900
Great.

1202
01:09:22,900 --> 01:09:23,900
Great.

1203
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:24,900
A flopping win.

1204
01:09:24,900 --> 01:09:28,660
I flopped on the promo side. I thought that I knew how to promote and do marketing.

1205
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,740
This is the other thing guys, we need to sell this show out because it's Patrick's first

1206
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:32,740
time organizing a show.

1207
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:33,740
Yep.

1208
01:09:33,740 --> 01:09:34,740
And he's doing a great job so far.

1209
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:35,740
He's done an incredible job.

1210
01:09:35,740 --> 01:09:36,740
Except for the flopped video.

1211
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,620
The flopped video was not even so bad.

1212
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:39,620
It wasn't that bad.

1213
01:09:39,620 --> 01:09:43,660
I wouldn't really even call it a fly. He works hard, organized the whole thing.

1214
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:47,200
He really myself. He actually did he completely did. He was on the email

1215
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,000
chains saying

1216
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:53,080
basically looking at these percentages and I was saying I was using a lot of

1217
01:09:53,080 --> 01:09:53,680
hello,

1218
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:56,520
exclamation point, using a lot of

1219
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:03,840
he was using a lot of hello. I was I was saying hello a lot, yeah, looking

1220
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,980
over so much joy, writing an email. No, no, no use the hello, put some hello,

1221
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:13,460
And you know what? You guys are going to think this is crazy of me. You guys are going to

1222
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:19,420
think, "Damn, maybe this is how he got it." I did color by numbers with Patch's email

1223
01:10:19,420 --> 01:10:27,260
for the Union Hall show we did that one time because I was nervous about writing the email.

1224
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:32,780
I didn't think we would get the show, so I used a previous email, switched all the nouns

1225
01:10:32,780 --> 01:10:33,780
around.

1226
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:34,780
You mad-libs-ed it.

1227
01:10:34,780 --> 01:10:35,780
I mad-libs-ed it.

1228
01:10:35,780 --> 01:10:36,780
That was smart of you.

1229
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:37,780
That was smart.

1230
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:52,780
*Screaming*
