[explosion]

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,300
Bam!

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:17,300
[guitar riff]

8
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,300
Yeaaah...

9
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,800
I feel like that's like the national anthem. I need to stand for that.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,300
[guitar riff]

11
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,300
I need to salute!

12
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,800
[guitar riff]

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,300
All the fallen Spartans, dude.

14
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,640
(sad music)

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,940
- Dude, already the best episode ever.

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,220
- So sick. - Pat's playing Halo.

17
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,180
He's dressed like a referee at a candy football game.

18
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:43,020
- I almost bought a referee outfit yesterday.

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,780
- Yeah, the problem with refereeing

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,540
is that if you walk around like that,

21
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,700
like if something, so like if you're dressed

22
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,620
as a referee, right?

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,180
It's like being dressed like a police officer

24
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,140
where if you see somebody getting mugged in front of you,

25
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,660
people are gonna look to you and be like, do something.

26
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,500
- Yeah. - You know?

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,380
'Cause like referees, it's like a place of power, right?

28
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,900
- Right. - You have some authority.

29
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,380
- If you're dressed up like a ref

30
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,860
and you accidentally walk into a pickup basketball game.

31
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,820
- Not even a pickup basketball game,

32
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,860
but if you're at a corner store and it's getting robbed,

33
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:16,900
you have to blow the whistle and call foul.

34
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:19,340
- Or like if somebody-- - True.

35
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,460
- You're like, you have like a,

36
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:23,780
that's gotta be in like the referee code, yeah.

37
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,820
(whistles)

38
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,220
Foul on the robber guy!

39
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,900
If you see one person walks into another person on the sidewalk, you have to figure out whose

40
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,260
fault it was, too.

41
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,620
Exactly, yeah, who's off sides in that situation.

42
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,340
You know what I mean?

43
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,020
You gotta walk around, I mean, you're kind of on patrol all the time.

44
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:41,020
You're like always on duty.

45
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,580
As long as you have the shirt on, you're on duty.

46
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,580
Stop playing guitar, Patrick.

47
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,100
I was shutting it off.

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,100
It's a button.

49
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,980
You didn't have to touch all the strings.

50
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,420
I have to turn down the knobs, and I have to unplug my pedal, and then I have to shut the

51
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:56,420
amp off.

52
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,860
I'm already giving you such an amazing premise of the referee off-duty, and you're just fucking

53
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,180
playing guitar in my face instead of talking about it.

54
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,540
I played the Halo theme for you!

55
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,020
I did appreciate that.

56
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
Yeah!

57
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,020
Yeah.

58
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,540
I think that if that was the National Anthem, I would be the guy who cries at baseball games.

59
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,460
It's like maybe the most beautiful song of all time.

60
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,460
It's true.

61
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,460
Yeah.

62
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,460
I would be the dad-- I mean, my hat would be coming off every single time.

63
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,460
Do you guys do that?

64
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:22,140
do you guys take your hat off for the national anthem? I don't hear the national anthem that

65
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:26,700
often to be honest. Really? You don't hang out? I don't really go places where they play it.

66
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:31,340
You don't listen to it? You don't go to the mission barbecue? No not. Do they do that at

67
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,740
mission barbecue? Mission barbecue get this. Oh wait yeah you've talked about this. Every yeah

68
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:41,100
every day at noon they stop every they stop the barbecue dude they fucking stuff can overcook

69
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,260
they don't give a fuck and they play the national anthem and sing along and tell you what my mom

70
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:52,060
loves going to Mission Barbecue at noon. Yeah. It's just, I mean, there's just something about it.

71
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:56,300
Yeah. So I don't even buy it. You don't even buy anything. Just listen to it and leave. It's a

72
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,060
free concert. Yeah. With all these people who are fucking pulling pork back there. They're beautiful

73
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,060
voices. You never would have thought. I wonder if that's part of the interview process there.

74
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,780
Oh yeah. You probably have to do like a... Sing us a couple of bars. Yeah. Of the national anthem.

75
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:14,940
I mean, which is worse to having to do that or the Cold Stone Creamery like

76
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,620
tip song that you have to sing? I feel like... Which would you rather have to do? I feel like we're probably five

77
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,380
years away from Cold Stone switching to freestyle rap because people are gonna

78
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:30,060
get sick of the Cold Stone. People are already sick of the Cold Stone. They have to update it. Yeah exactly cuz back in the day back in the 80s

79
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,940
when Cold Stone started that was like the most popular song in the world. That was a bumpin' track.

80
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,980
But now it's gone it's gone the way of the Super Bowl shuffle you know it's just kind of a

81
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,260
novelty. Exactly and people are gonna have to start people are gonna start

82
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:48,940
Requesting sit things such as sicko mode when you go into a cold stone creamery. Mm-hmm. Yeah, it's a cone

83
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:55,980
Snicker cone snicker cone. See that's pretty good. Yeah, I can have that one for free. That's not gonna me

84
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,740
Yeah, I have so many amazing cold stone songs. I've come up with

85
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,220
Do a couple right now

86
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:07,580
Cold stone where you go to get cold another day older getting so old going

87
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,780
It's like about aging. I'm fucking old at the Cold Stone. I feel so old at the Cold Stone

88
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,720
Yeah, when they start hiring like older people too, I mean

89
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:31,100
There that could like work really well, why do you not see old people with jobs all that often they're dead

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,380
It's their dinner retired. Yeah, they're dead or their bones will break

91
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,680
- Retiring should be illegal.

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,300
- No, if you see like an old person

93
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,140
working at like McDonald's or something.

94
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,340
- I think young people should get to retire

95
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:42,800
before they start working.

96
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,680
- 100%, okay, yeah, here's the thing.

97
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,640
- You get to retire until you're like 30

98
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,220
and then you work until you're 90.

99
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,140
- Why are we wasting, like people only have

100
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,300
a good time in life before 50 years old.

101
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,520
- Yeah, exactly, oh, I'd like to retire

102
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,260
so I can sit in my armchair and feel

103
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,980
each one of my organs fail one by one.

104
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,700
- Yeah, like fuck that dude, old people

105
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,500
should have to be slaves by law,

106
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,960
is what we're saying, basically.

107
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,800
- Absolutely.

108
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,100
- And they should have to work for the young people.

109
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,700
Young people don't have to work ever.

110
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,900
You get to retire from the age of 20 to 40.

111
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,980
No, 20 to 35.

112
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,020
Yeah.

113
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,660
20 under 16 years.

114
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,540
Under 20 you can retire at 23 if you make a podcast.

115
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,060
Yeah, well you have to, true.

116
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,140
Yeah.

117
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,180
Well we're hard workers, we're not retired.

118
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,060
I don't know what you're talking about.

119
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,740
We have to slave away at this.

120
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,720
I'm out here thinking of Cold Stone raps

121
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,220
on the fucking corner, dude.

122
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,340
God, I look so bloated.

123
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,620
You know what it is is I shaved.

124
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,300
I look insanely bloated right now.

125
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,740
- So back to the retirement thing,

126
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:39,860
I don't know what the bloating really has to do with that.

127
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,700
- Yeah.

128
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,520
- You know, anybody--

129
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,740
- I should be able to retire 'cause I'm bloated right now.

130
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,580
- Anybody under 20 years old has to work,

131
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,580
anybody over 35 has to work.

132
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:49,780
The jobs are worse the further away from retirement you are.

133
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,740
(laughing)

134
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:51,580
- Yeah, yeah.

135
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:55,540
- At 96, you're working as an Alaskan crab fisherman.

136
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,860
And you're just like,

137
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,140
just start getting knocked over on the boat all day.

138
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:02,340
- And at age one, you're running in the hamster wheel

139
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,240
that powers the crab boat.

140
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
- Yeah, exactly.

141
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah, no, I mean, I think this is like,

142
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,280
'cause seriously, like nobody likes being alive after 35.

143
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,120
You're right.

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,480
So you might as well just make them work to death.

145
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,960
- After 35, that's when your back stops working.

146
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,580
- Yeah, your back just gives out.

147
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,800
- Also, yeah, after 35 is when you start

148
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,440
trying to pretend you're young.

149
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,640
So I mean, if they were working harder,

150
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,320
that we might be able to nip that in the bud.

151
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:31,480
- Dude, you would never get confused by a person's age.

152
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,880
Like if you were trying to have sex with them,

153
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,920
you'd be like oh yeah I work it and you'd be like - you're 35 I know it you're at

154
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,240
least 35. Why is that a concern you have about that? Because I don't want to fuck

155
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,080
some old bitch. Okay. I want to fuck people who are exactly my age because I'm such a hero.

156
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,600
It's the bravest stance you can have on the subject. It'll also make people who

157
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:56,000
are you know getting old and they want to feel young it'll be like oh you can

158
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,960
feel young here you'll work again because they remember working. You can

159
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,560
- You can work at a lemonade stand.

160
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,400
- Yeah.

161
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,240
- Yeah.

162
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,240
- Or a balloon stand.

163
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,720
You can be young again.

164
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,560
What are young people, Josh?

165
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,560
- You could be the guy who pulls jams out of the lathe.

166
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,520
Here's some rubber gloves.

167
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,360
(laughing)

168
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,200
Go at it.

169
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:20,800
- I thought you meant like jams, like strawberry.

170
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,440
- Oh, you can do that, Patrick, if you want,

171
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,880
when you turn 35.

172
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,800
- Yeah, when I turn 35, I'm going into the metal shop

173
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,480
with a jar of Smuckers.

174
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,120
I mean Smucker's factory is an old woman job.

175
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,960
Yeah.

176
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,800
Yeah.

177
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,620
Oh, sure.

178
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,000
Well, no, if you see an old person working, it's sad.

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:38,840
That's what I mean.

180
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,800
Like, it shouldn't be sad.

181
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,360
It should be normal.

182
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,560
It should be like a ha ha, like you'd get your job done.

183
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Ha ha ha ha.

184
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,280
Like, oh, good, yeah, exactly.

185
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,180
It should be funny, you know?

186
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,520
Like some old lady fucking stacking shopping carts

187
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,360
at the grocery store.

188
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,200
Well, here's the funniest job for her.

189
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,360
That should be cool.

190
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,400
Yeah, she should not be stacking grocery carts, by the way.

191
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
She should be lifting boxes.

192
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,220
the funniest job for an old woman is clown

193
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,480
yet grandma clounded

194
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,640
yeah and grandma clown or like

195
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,040
stunt double

196
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,800
this is not a problem

197
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,120
pretty good

198
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,600
that's a good grandma job absolutely

199
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
yeah

200
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,800
like like top group not a top cruise does his own stunts what am i fucking

201
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,540
saying he's also old

202
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:27,340
yet certainly somebody somebody like i'd like a timothy chalamet has to do like a

203
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:34,340
stunt in a movie. They toss an old woman over like a car.

204
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:39,100
I mean I think that this Timothee Chalamet is gonna be Ernest. No they're

205
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,700
gonna bring, sorry I just got a Skype call or something. What?

206
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,180
Yeah just it was like the loudest thing I've ever heard in my headphones.

207
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:50,060
Anyway yeah they bring in an old man named Ernest and they push him off of a

208
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,980
bridge or make him kiss a guy or whatever. What I was thinking is they could also

209
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,320
- Also, I mean, you could kind of make,

210
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,040
for example, say there's a pothole,

211
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,640
you could kind of just have an old man sit in the pothole

212
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,380
with a plate, holding a plate over his head so it's flat.

213
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,560
- That's the other thing, is that it could be like

214
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,200
the movie, it could kind of be like the movie Gamer,

215
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,380
where we have control of them, and since they're old,

216
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,500
it doesn't matter if they die,

217
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,340
so you could do way cooler stunts.

218
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,640
- Or like a SpongeBob SquarePants movie,

219
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,680
like when they put the buckets on their head,

220
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,980
it could kind of be like that.

221
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,240
We could put buckets on their head.

222
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,080
- That's what I'm saying, is we could have

223
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,800
way cooler movie stunts where people actually die,

224
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,320
we show death on screen.

225
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
- Absolutely.

226
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,160
- People be like, oh my God, is Tom Cruise dead?

227
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,360
It's like, no dude, it was an old lady.

228
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,200
It's fine.

229
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,600
- So okay, I mean like, imagine this scenario, right?

230
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,000
You're an explorer.

231
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,520
You're going to a distant island to explore the island,

232
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,440
okay? - Nice.

233
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,980
- You get to, you get to--

234
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:44,040
- Sorry, something just, I think my apartment's haunted.

235
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,480
- Yeah?

236
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,320
Okay.

237
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,160
- We'll get to that.

238
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,840
- Yeah, you get to a rope bridge, but what's that?

239
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,480
The rope bridge, it's broken in the middle.

240
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,880
You can't cross it.

241
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,520
you go hey uh... a gertrude you know you keep you can have your your old lady

242
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:02,920
where she was she goes down to the bridge and she clings to one end in the other

243
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,560
like one with and with her hands on their feet

244
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,920
you can cross the bridge or you could also because you can be so many of them

245
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,920
you could use in like nanobots or the or the zombies from world war z and you

246
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,920
can't react to anything that you want the canyon and i have to go out there

247
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,360
and i i i would have a little bit but the fucking eight thousand or people in

248
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
Exactly, they're like nanobots.

249
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,640
Yeah, they're just filling in like potholes on the road.

250
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,480
Yeah, I mean you realize your liver is failing or something, you send a couple hundred old

251
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,200
peoples shrunk down in there, they can repair your tissues, you know, with like self-replicating

252
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
technology.

253
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
They stand daisy-chained.

254
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,400
Exactly, and they replicate the molecular structure like your kidney or whatever.

255
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,680
- If you have like an issue,

256
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,720
if you have like some sort of like Parkinson's or something,

257
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,640
some genetic disease,

258
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,160
they can actually replace your DNA with them.

259
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,000
- Yeah. - Like kind of doing

260
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,320
a YMCA thing. - Exactly.

261
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,800
- Chained together like monkeys in a barrel.

262
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,480
- And you probably get their like memories too.

263
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,200
So like you, maybe one of them knows

264
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,880
how to play like piano really well.

265
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,720
- Okay, maybe one of them went to Vietnam

266
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,720
and you get to have a cool reaction of fireworks.

267
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,560
- Picture this, right?

268
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
You're walking down the city street on a dark night.

269
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,200
- Beautiful song about Vietnam.

270
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,320
- It's terrifying.

271
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,160
Somebody comes up to you.

272
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,960
he tries to mug you, he says, "Give me your wallet."

273
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,660
And you say, "I'm not gonna give you my wallet,

274
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:23,400
"but I will give you 100 old people's wallets

275
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:27,000
"that I have with me that I control like plankton."

276
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
- Yeah. - That's a good idea.

277
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,320
- The robber's leaving happy.

278
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,800
- And each of those wallets,

279
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,240
each of those wallets and purses,

280
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
you know what they have in them?

281
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,480
Worthers original, that's worth more than money.

282
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:38,320
- That's right, the robber will choke on it.

283
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,400
- You kinda, at some point, if you have enough old people,

284
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,760
you kinda just become Venom, you know?

285
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,600
- Exactly. - You're just like

286
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,120
creating matter and shit. - You can make it a suit.

287
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,880
You're just doing cool shit with your hands, making a hammer out of your right hand and

288
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,880
shit.

289
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,880
Exactly.

290
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,960
You have like a symbiote, like a bio suit type thing, but instead of looking like black slime,

291
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,360
it just looks like wrinkled flesh.

292
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
Yeah.

293
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,960
With maybe like a few hairs poking out at different places.

294
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Probably scarier.

295
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,960
Probably way scarier.

296
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,800
Who's the oldest person you guys have ever seen?

297
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,640
- Uh, you.

298
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:10,680
- Ooh, damn.

299
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,520
- Are you serious?

300
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,360
- You're older than me by a couple months.

301
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,200
- I saw Mike, I mean my great grandpa was 96 when he died

302
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,600
and I knew him, I saw him several times.

303
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,680
I don't know, I mean I've seen some old people,

304
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,280
I don't ask most of them their ages.

305
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,600
- I think a Holocaust survivor came to my middle school

306
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,480
and talked, I think that might be the oldest person

307
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,520
I've ever seen.

308
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,240
- That's true, actually yeah, a Holocaust survivor

309
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,160
come to my elementary school too so maybe that yeah. My aunt Ruth I think was like

310
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,800
a hundred and one when she died and I saw her when she was a hundred and she was so

311
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,720
insane at that time that she started like walked in with my grandma to her

312
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,780
like hospital room and she just started getting completely naked so that she

313
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:57,400
could go take a shit and I was like old people suck dude. Yeah. And then I told my

314
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:01,640
grandma that I thought she was an actual dinosaur because she had a hunchback.

315
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:09,180
like spot like a spine yeah yeah I I didn't I mean you know I had like my

316
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,600
grampy but like I didn't really have like grampy I didn't realize you were a

317
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:18,640
gay child yeah I had like a grampy and then like my grandpa John was never

318
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,840
really around I didn't really have like an old person in my life yeah I was

319
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,240
growing up you gotta have that's why you grew up this way yeah you're not old

320
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:31,000
people in your in your life I know but that's why I'm older than you. I don't like old people I

321
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I really does.

322
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,500
I don't think anybody does.

323
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:37,700
People fucking of course Neil does everybody get we don't have to talk about that.

324
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,500
But like everybody gets uncomfortable.

325
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,660
There's all there's a level of old where everybody starts getting insanely uncomfortable being

326
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,500
around that person who's not old and that's why you put them in the in prison.

327
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Yeah, when they're old or whatever.

328
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,900
Like why would you want to be reminded about you're gonna die?

329
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,000
Like why would you want to be reminded that you're gonna die?

330
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,700
Also like why would you want to be reminded about a TV show that aired 60 years ago?

331
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,700
Right? Like I don't need to know about the antidote from the soap opera that you were watching.

332
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:07,700
Yeah, that's the thing. If old people could maybe like get into cool, like young person shit,

333
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,700
then I'd be down to hang. But until then, just fuck off.

334
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Fucking old people. Well, the old people that we're gonna have in a couple years are like,

335
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:22,700
the old guys who are like, "Yeah, I saw Sonic Youth," or "I saw Suicide Play at the CBGB,"

336
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,700
or whatever, and it's like, yeah, that's cool, but it's like, I'm not gonna be comfortable around,

337
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:31,900

00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:52,060
video my mom my mom's I can see your skull through your face I don't want yeah

342
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:55,420
She's drooping a little bit. It looks like when you...

343
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,580
It looks like seeing somebody in a sheer shirt. You can just see all their bones and shit.

344
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,900
You look like you're wearing a Halloween mask. I don't want you around me.

345
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,020
My mom sent me this video of Dick Van Dyke working out.

346
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,940
Just out of the blue. She was like...

347
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,740
She didn't even... No context.

348
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:13,580
It didn't say like, "Oh, look at this."

349
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,340
"I know you think Dick Van Dyke's name is funny." Or something like that.

350
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,260
She just sent me Dick Van Dyke

351
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,700
working out and I like I looked at it and I was just like

352
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,220
disgusted. Just let me think that Letterman is dead.

353
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,380
Yeah. He's like he's at that age where it's like I in my brain David Letterman

354
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,820
has died. He died in a car accident. He's done. He died he died dropping a

355
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:40,540
watermelon off of a building and it came back up and hit his head.

356
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,540
Yeah dude I I I hope I never make it to old age.

357
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,060
Yeah fuck that. I know I'm not I'm probably gonna die when I'm like 60

358
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:53,180
something 68 69 something like that I'm gonna just try my goal is to go Sonny

359
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,820
Bono style and fucking hit a tree real fast mm-hmm yeah cuz I think that'd be

360
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:02,580
funny you know look like a far side comic just like your legs and arms still

361
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,020
just like poking past the tree yeah you're just like stuck to it I think

362
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:12,980
that's a perfect way to die that would be pretty nice yeah just not old never

363
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:17,580
absolutely not yeah I've been watching a lot of Better Call Saul and there's so

364
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:21,860
many old people in that show and I just think every single time just like like

365
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:25,180
do they like they'll get old people that it's like clear that they're just weird

366
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,260
old people who don't know they're acting yeah and they'll just like sit there and

367
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:35,940
smile or like say something when they smile yeah imagine it's just like just

368
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,980
shut up and like it's just hope to God that they're getting ripped off just

369
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:47,380
anything. Just like, please don't pay these people. Also, don't let them into the actors

370
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,820
guild. I don't want to be anywhere near these people in my entire life.

371
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,740
They better not be at the craft services either.

372
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:59,220
Yeah, like you're going to slobber all over the deviled eggs. Shut the fuck up.

373
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,500
I hate old people food like that too.

374
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,020
There's so many old actors now. Can you imagine going into an audition for a role and you

375
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:11,020
really studied hard and on the lines and you walk in and everybody but you is like 90 years

376
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,280
old yeah that's got to be happening to be some perfect young people that have to

377
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,180
be around those things imagine what that room smells like to probably like really

378
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,020
old people probably yeah probably smells like fucking old people I've never I've

379
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:27,400
never met an old person that smells good yeah they all smell like flesh they

380
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,780
smell like like if you ripped open Hanes t-shirts and he smelled bad smell that's

381
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:37,180
what all them smell like if you lift like a thigh bone out in the Sun for

382
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,320
like a year yeah it's like it's it's fucked up man it's not like they smell

383
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:46,420
like a something that like a liquid you put in a car to keep it going so there

384
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:56,420
hey yeah also at least like I know that you're rich if you're old you have to be

385
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,220
rich you're either rich or you're the poorest person yeah so and the poor

386
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,260
people I don't care if you die but the rich people at least have the common

387
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,580
decency to get some plastic surgery.

388
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,420
- For real, yeah.

389
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,860
- Like, do I really have to fucking look at you

390
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,540
every single time I go to Walmart?

391
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,460
You have to, I have to look at you

392
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,820
'cause you're the greeter?

393
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,780
Get the fuck out of here,

394
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,180
go sit in the security office, you old bitch.

395
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,860
I don't wanna fucking look at you.

396
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,260
Yeah, like, I mean, if you're gonna work at Subway,

397
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,960
at least put 'em in the back baking the bread.

398
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,100
That's all I'm gonna say.

399
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,380
I don't want them touching my food, even through gloves.

400
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,300
I feel like the smell could permeate the gloves.

401
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,580
- Yeah.

402
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,580
No, I want them in 7-Eleven,

403
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:36,500
curled up under the counter turning the crank that does the roller dogs.

404
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,500
Exactly.

405
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:38,500
That's where they belong.

406
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Yeah, yeah.

407
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,840
Sweating, sweating from the heat lamps.

408
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
That's what I'm saying, dude.

409
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,840
Just make old people do forced labor.

410
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,420
Whenever somebody takes a pack of gum from the bottom of the counter, they have to push

411
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,700
forward another pack.

412
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,420
They should be doing like, you know, like you see a one-man band out on the street?

413
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,700
They should be doing that, but for convenience stores.

414
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:01,860
Like I need them to have a string tied around each finger and every finger, like they have

415
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,940
to do something different every second.

416
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,880
I don't want them to have a moment of downtime.

417
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,720
- The other thing is,

418
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,260
why is the CIA not experimenting on these useless people?

419
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,780
Like, you can, you have, like,

420
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,380
stop kidnapping kids and shit.

421
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,480
Get old people and make them try to do ESP.

422
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,580
Stop fucking, like, I don't get why the fuck

423
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:23,740
they're not doing this.

424
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,580
Nobody's gonna care.

425
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,400
- You're gonna, you're gonna--

426
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,240
- I don't care.

427
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,260
- If you have to, exactly, if you have to,

428
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,020
if you have to fucking push somebody

429
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,760
into committing some kind of massive act of horrible cruelty.

430
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,940
I mean, why not do it with someone

431
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,020
who already lived their whole life?

432
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:36,860
Doesn't matter, you know?

433
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,780
- Yeah, exactly, they don't matter at all.

434
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,020
- And you know what, listen.

435
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,140
(laughing)

436
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:41,980
- God damn, this is getting very dark.

437
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,900
- They're not gonna be able to lift whatever--

438
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,340
- This is getting so fucking dark.

439
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,060
- Whatever weapon you wanna give them,

440
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,460
they're not gonna be able to do it, you know?

441
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:51,180
And then you'll still be able to impose the regulations

442
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,020
or whatever that you want to.

443
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,140
Just be like, oh yeah, another 98-year-old guy tried to--

444
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,980
- Also, everybody's all worried.

445
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,180
Oh no, the baby boomers are about to fucking start hitting social security.

446
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,780
It's gonna bankrupt America.

447
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,420
Hey, here's a thought.

448
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,420
Make them slaves.

449
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,420
What are you, stupid?

450
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:08,420
No.

451
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,100
Make the old people slaves.

452
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:13,500
Every one of us could live like Caesar.

453
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,300
Yeah, just fucking do it, dude.

454
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,300
Why are we pussying around?

455
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,860
Obama should have done this shit.

456
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,900
I would have, he would have had a third term.

457
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,900
Hey, Elon Musk, you need, you need guinea pigs for your Mars colony, right?

458
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,620
Yeah, start just- all these tests that keep blowing up.

459
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,900
Fucking fill it with old people!

460
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,900
We got plenty!

461
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,400
What are we doing here, man?

462
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,100
Maybe the- maybe the- maybe the shuttles are blowing up because they're empty, you know?

463
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,180
Maybe they're not, but you know, if that's not the case, that's fine too.

464
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,260
Yeah, start testing makeup on old people.

465
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,780
Why are we doing this horrible thing to these cows?

466
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:45,780
Yeah, these chinchillas.

467
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,780
Yeah!

468
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,780
A chinchilla's cute, I like to look at it.

469
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
It's got hair.

470
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,780
Also, lab rats.

471
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,940
Uh, hello.

472
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,580
I got something- oh, they have a DNA like a human.

473
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,360
Let me tell you what else has DNA like a human.

474
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,420
An old person.

475
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,620
Not quite the same, but pretty close.

476
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,340
Pretty much anything that you could do to a rat, you could do to a fucking...

477
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,340
They have the same hair!

478
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
You know what else I want to say about...

479
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:07,060
Rats and old people have the same hair!

480
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,540
That's true, they got the same tails too.

481
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:12,540
And they look the same when they stand up.

482
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,780
The zoos, you know, people aren't going to zoos anymore.

483
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:18,260
They don't want to see the same old animals every time.

484
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Here's two words.

485
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,940
I'm about to blow your mind, Zeus.

486
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:22,940
Human monkey.

487
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:28,700
You get a whole bunch of old people and you fucking, you know, paint their ass red like

488
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,700
a baboon.

489
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,700
I mean, I'm gonna go to the zoo.

490
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,900
Don't worry, aquariums, you can get in on this too.

491
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,140
I mean, you can pay for the scoop apparatus, you don't have to either.

492
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,340
Don't have to, hey, how long can you hold your breath?

493
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
Two minutes?

494
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Alright, well, alright.

495
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,340
That's fine, we'll switch you out after two minutes.

496
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,340
Yeah, whatever.

497
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
That's fine.

498
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:47,220
We got a guy with one of those big things who scooped the fish out of the aquarium with

499
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,340
and he's a diver, he's gonna come scoop you out in three minutes.

500
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:55,340
Yeah, here Dottie, put this anchor on your leg, you're about to be the hit of the aquarium.

501
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
Do you guys ever work in restaurants?

502
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,340
Yeah, I worked at a Jersey Mike's.

503
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,340
Oh yeah, you worked at Jersey Mike's and you made dough out of your hands.

504
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:08,340
I got sweaty hands, what's wrong with that? See if there's an old person there, they're dry as fuck.

505
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,340
Yeah, exactly. You could make, no, I'm just saying, have you ever had to wait on an old person?

506
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,340
Yeah, in that four days, yeah.

507
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,380
Dude, I've had to sell, dude, working at the liquor store,

508
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,620
old people come in, you know what they go for

509
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,820
every fucking time?

510
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,500
- That's 'cause they're degenerates.

511
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,420
- You know what they go for?

512
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,420
They go for the fucking like three liter giant glass jugs

513
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,860
of Italian wine that they literally can't even carry

514
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:33,020
to the register by themselves.

515
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,020
Like what, come on, what kind of freak does that?

516
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,780
- They're fucking so stupid.

517
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,460
- Buy a hundred nips, I don't care, okay?

518
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,980
That's fine, that's easy.

519
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,900
- There was this one time, there was this old woman

520
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,500
that came in, I was working at this restaurant,

521
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,060
I was working, it was one of those places

522
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,140
where they just have an iPad at the front

523
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,860
and you hit the, for substitutions and shit,

524
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,060
you have to go into something new

525
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,740
and press all these buttons.

526
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,140
And there's this woman who came in

527
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,140
and she had so many dietary restrictions,

528
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,160
she was so old, she had so many dietary restrictions,

529
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,980
and it was just impossible for us to get anything right.

530
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,900
- Exactly, they shouldn't be allowed

531
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,500
to go to restaurants or eat.

532
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,980
She's like, "Okay, I can't have this. I can't have eggs in this. I can't have that."

533
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,900
And it's like, "Well, I don't know everything that the food is made out of."

534
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,060
And also...

535
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,580
I don't know what the broth... She complained about the heat of the soup.

536
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,020
It was like one of those things where it's like...

537
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,060
A serious McDonald's situation.

538
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:35,300
The broth sits in a... One of those things where it sits at a temperature-controlled thing.

539
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:39,940
And she was complaining about how it wasn't... And the guy... I remember seeing my manager

540
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:46,740
take a thermometer into the broth and like showing her like look it's at like 165 like i fucking like

541
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,020
yeah we're good yeah what's she saying it wasn't hot enough or too hot she's like can you just

542
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,020
like put it in a microwave or something it's like we don't have a fucking microwave that reminds me

543
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:02,580
old people do a lot of fucked up shit like that you remember that old bitch she sued mcdonald's

544
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:07,140
she robbed mcdonald's of three million dollars drinking coffee because she dropped first of all

545
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:14,180
Coffee's supposed to be hot. Sorry that you fucking dropped it on your crotch and it sewed your vagina shut, but it's not my problem, dude

546
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,860
Seriously, it looked like dried magma. I'm not kidding

547
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:25,660
You've looked it up I watched a documentary about it. They showed it in the documentary. Yeah, dude. She's old. She didn't even know

548
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:31,400
She probably probably don't say that she didn't care I mean

549
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,980
She knew dude, she definitely knew she was in the documentary.

550
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:42,500
Now she's living it up in Beverly Hills, you know, starring in every fucking episode of

551
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Better Call Saul.

552
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,100
Yeah dude, and she's killing it in the circus where she's doing the freak show.

553
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:51,100
She's got three million dollars dude, she can do whatever she wants.

554
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,100
Exactly, I mean, yeah.

555
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,180
Also, are you serious?

556
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,180
I mean think about what McDonald's would be-

557
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,180
You wanna go up against McDonald's?

558
00:24:56,180 --> 00:25:00,380
Yeah, think about what McDonald's would be today if it had that extra three million dollars.

559
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,380
I'm serious.

560
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,640
(laughing)

561
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,480
- I'm serious.

562
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,300
- They could have opened one of--

563
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,740
- Dude, they would have to do all this BTS meal bullshit.

564
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,820
- Yeah, they would have to join up with all these--

565
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,660
- Yeah.

566
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,480
- They would have to collab with these celebrities.

567
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,740
- Do the Hiare-Bolsonero meal.

568
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,060
- They could have opened up a restaurant

569
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,220
in my apartment building's basement, dude.

570
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,580
- The Bolsonero meal at McDonald's.

571
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,140
- The Bolsonero meal goes crazy, dude.

572
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,820
Two Diet Cokes, that's it.

573
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,020
- Boom soda.

574
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,020
- Boom soda.

575
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,260
(laughing)

576
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,220
Okay, but you know, you just made me think of something, which is old people, politicians,

577
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
that's fine.

578
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
Let 'em be.

579
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
That's funny as fuck, dude.

580
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,220
They're doing a good job.

581
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,220
They're hilarious.

582
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:44,580
Dianne Feinstein, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, we all, you're the best.

583
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,820
Politics is supposed to be funny.

584
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,900
And it's supposed to be entertainment.

585
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:48,900
Exactly.

586
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,180
So you want to have a better life?

587
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,860
What are you, a fucking pussy?

588
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:58,220
When I see Joe Biden go on stage and he says something accidentally racist about Mexican

589
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,260
people, that's like the funniest shit ever.

590
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,740
I'm not gonna like try and get a young per- I'm not gonna- I don't- I much rather have him than like Beidou.

591
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,920
You know, fuck that guy.

592
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,420
Exactly.

593
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:11,360
Stop- stop- just stop trying man. You're never gonna be old.

594
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,300
He's gonna- you know why? Cuz he's gonna probably overdose cuz he's a junkie skateboarder.

595
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,440
That's probably why he's gonna never be old.

596
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:18,980
Yeah.

597
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,360
He can't- dude, Beidou can't fucking skate.

598
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,940
Nobody can skate if I'm in charge.

599
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:27,480
Beidou, I- I'm fucking- I'm challenging you again.

600
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,460

601
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,720

00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:13,140
I'm just trying to make a statement. I just don't like these fucking drug addict

612
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,860
fucking pothead skateboarders. Hey, what if we invented something that was

613
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:22,340
as lame as parkour but required less skill? Yeah, and a hundred bucks so that you could

614

00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:26,720
Oh, dude, I need I need more. I need more nationalities in my video games. Yeah, that's actually good to have representation

663
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,340
Sorry that I'm what the hell Cameron likes to play as the different nationalities and do the voices though

664
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:36,500
It's like terrorists versus counter-terrorists and the terrorists are almost always

665
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,180
Middle Eastern and that's where the person who plays counter-strike

666
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:43,460
I hate that game because I find it offensive

667
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,740
You are defensive. What are you fucking talking about?

668
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,900
You play so much you've played counter-strike for like every day for the past like 16 years of your life. Just lying

669
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,300
I have played go that's the thing is I made it in the past 16 years

670
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:01,620
He got into it like like seven months ago counter-strike. I really counter-strike slam. I play Valorant. I never

671
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,380
You play counter-strike

672
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,900
No, I really haven't you guys don't know where you're talking about dude. You played Counter-Strike.

673
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:12,540
I will pull up the streams. I will text Noah right now.

674
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:14,860
I'm taking my hoodie off. I'm getting hot.

675
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,220
Is that your 100 Thieves hoodie? That's his 100 Thieves hoodie. Why does my hoodie?

676
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,060
What's Caleb's uh, uh steam? I'm not kidding. My underarms smell like pussy today.

677
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:29,420
Yeah? Isn't that gross? Well, it's because you-

678
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:35,280
You are what you smell like dude. Patrick is frozen. My PC froze. Hey, hey

679
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:41,120
Caleb you have a hundred and eighty two hours of Counter-Strike. I just said I have a hundred hours. That's like nothing dude. That's a hundred and eighty two.

680
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,780
That's still a hundred and eighty two. What's that like five days? That's nothing dude. Now don't pull up my skater XL.

681
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,480
Oh

682
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:54,320
Yeah, this guy's such a fucking skating addict that he has to be normally play skate video games

683
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,000
I can only fucking play him right now. I've been out for a month

684
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:03,120
Yeah, do you think that do you think all that be so rusty when I get back into it?

685
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,620
I was doing my fucking do my calves were stronger than they've ever been in my entire life. Yeah

686
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:12,120
Yes, how about she hit the gym?

687
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,380
That'll get you nice and strong. You know, that's a workout

688
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,720
Yeah, I probably should hit the gym, but I don't want not supposed to agree with me. We're fighting. This is like crossfire

689
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,640
All right, only have 85 hours in skater. Excel. That's not very many. That's nothing. That's a pathetic amount

690
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:33,240
If you could see how many hours I played in Skate 3.

691
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
That's pathetic.

692
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,320
I'll tell you what I had a lot of hours in, Guitar Hero.

693
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,600
Oh dude, I almost bought a full bundle today.

694
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,800
Dude, I really want to play Guitar Hero.

695
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:45,120
No, no, we should totally go halfsies on this bundle.

696
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,240
It's in Trenton, New Jersey.

697
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,680
We could get it shipped to one of our apartments and then we could switch off who owns it.

698
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,000
I said that I was going to buy the drum kit and two guitars.

699
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,500
I asked Neil if I should do that and he said no, we don't have any room at the apartment.

700
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,900
So I think we could keep the drums at your place.

701
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:08,460
You think that Jana will let me keep a Guitar Hero drum kit at my apartment?

702
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Yes.

703
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,020
I think you might be right.

704
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
Yeah, let's do it.

705
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
Yeah.

706
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
Yeah, dude, let's do it.

707
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,020
I think I want to.

708
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,680
That would be a great idea.

709
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,560
I never finished World Tour.

710
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:20,560
I never finished guitar.

711
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,560
I had it for the Wii.

712
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,920
I had Guitar Hero World Tour.

713
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,920
the uh i didn't like tool when i was a kid and there's like the three tool songs you have to

714
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:32,960
beat and they're so hard i'm not gonna cry when they came on no i just like i just was like i can

715
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,200
[ __ ] skip this like my brother will beat it for me and then i just stopped playing it because you

716
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,640
were too scared of the songs i wasn't scared i wasn't scared of the songs you were scared of the

717
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,200
knowledge dude i wasn't scared of the visuals that they gave to the tool songs you're so cool

718
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,800
you're scared of knowledge forbidden knowledge that might show up in tool albums i well no i

719
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,800
I like it now.

720
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,800
No.

721
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,720
Did you guys see my space yesterday?

722
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,800
I did spaces on Twitter for the first time.

723
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,920
I'd love to get in your space.

724
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:10,720
I played the intro riff to Schism.

725
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,720
That's all I did.

726
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,040
I mean I've heard you do that 100 times while we were trying to talk about something so

727
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,580
it's not that interesting to me.

728
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,580
We should start writing to ourselves.

729
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
You play the whole song.

730
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,580
It's pretty easy right?

731
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Yeah.

732
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,420
- It's easy.

733
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:27,420
♪ The forbidden secret of the stone ♪

734
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,740
♪ I saw my uncle's kiss ♪

735
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,580
- No.

736
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,620
- They don't talk about uncles,

737
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,380
they talk about secret and Illuminati cool shit.

738
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,380
- They talk about like, yeah,

739
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,580
like, you know, breathing and aliens and--

740
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,500

- Something like that.

745
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,340
- Yeah, but it has to be a mathematical, like--

746
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:54,380
my brain is made of math

747
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:58,580
yeah he could be like the equation of the aliens there could be a song called that

748
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:02,880
the equation of the aliens would be a perfect tool song and the whole song has to be a

749
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:07,040
palindrome too it has to have something like that in it and it has to be fascinating

750
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,020
yeah so what's a fascinating fact that i know

751
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:14,980
uh... you know most aliens are robots race car

752
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:17,260
race car race car

753
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:25,980
That would be a perfect fucking Tool Song, is a race car song.

754
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,700
All palindromes, all the way through.

755
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:37,100
Or he could do like, 1 x 2 = 2, 2 x 3 = 6, 6 x 4 = 20, like and just say a bunch of times

756
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
numbers.

757
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,260
2 x 2 = 6!

758
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:42,940
It could be called multiplication fables.

759
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
Oh my god.

760
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,220
There needs to be something fable-ish about it.

761
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,220
Yeah.

762
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,220
Yeah.

763
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,220
Yeah.

764
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Man, we should start a band.

765
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,500
What about like multi-defecation?

766
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,500
Because they like poop too.

767
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,500
They sometimes talk about poop.

768
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,500
Yeah, they love shit.

769
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,020
They kind of have like a wicked sense of humor at times.

770
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,020
I forgot they love shit.

771
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
In their song titles.

772
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,020
Yeah.

773
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,660
What's that one, Hooker with a Penis?

774
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,660
Is that the Tool song?

775
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,660
Yeah, that's a Tool song.

776
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:06,660
Yeah.

777
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,300
They also have Anima, but it's like, is it Anima or Enema?

778
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,300
I can't tell.

779
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,300
You know, kind of.

780
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,180
They kind of have like a biting sense of humor at times.

781
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:17,900
kind of wicked. I think I do like Tool. They might be the most hot topic band that there is.

782
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:23,340
No, what are you talking about? My Chemical Romance is the most hot topic. No, that used to be. I feel

783
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:32,380
like Tool has persisted. No, MCR is still hot topic. Yeah, whatever guys. Trust me. All right,

784
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:39,660
I'll trust you. Whatever. I have a younger sibling so I know about this stuff. Is MCR still around?

785
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,220
Yeah, I mean I don't know about still around. I don't really follow them

786
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:47,480
But I know that there's still people who are in high school right now who are obsessed with them. Yeah, it's so weird

787
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,300
it's so weird that like

788
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:56,420
Like the emo shit it like I guess it's just like respecting the classics, but it's like it doesn't that shit date a little bit

789
00:37:56,420 --> 00:38:00,340
Yeah, respecting the classics of all-time low. Yeah

790
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:07,520
That's like you know Laurie, yeah, I mean they paved the way for like the shitty fucking well

791
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,920
I think now it's just all like the bedroom pop like band camp shit. You know what I mean like

792
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,560
Like what's that song?

793
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,880
freak

794
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:19,480
Splish splash I was taking a bath. Is that the song you're thinking? Yeah

795
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:27,720
Under the sea it's freak by my patchy the pirate on a leash. I think that's the one like the one that's in all the tick-tocks

796
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,720
I mean, I don't I don't

797
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:35,160
Man, who isn't it? I just watch the ones that get reposted to Twitter. Yeah, I'm sure yeah

798
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,180
Don't leave just got me nervous. So he called him out. He dropped his vape on the ground

799
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:46,180
That is not what happened. Oh, no, I don't look at tick-tock all day. Oh fuck. That's not I don't you look at tick-tock

800
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,440
I see a baby twerking and you press fave

801
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,320
fucking freak

802
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:56,620
You're a freak. Is that yeah, I mean, I don't know anything about the you know, like new music that's coming out

803
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,240
I just listen to like either

804
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,340
Mute the only type of music I listen to is either music that makes me want to kill myself or that like turns turns my eyes

805
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:08,140
into spirals those are like the two genres. Cameron I was sending Cameron songs I was sending him like

806
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:15,020
Scott Walker songs cuz Sun was it Sun O how do you say there's you know is silent. It's Sunu.

807
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:20,380
Suni. I hate that dude the O being silent is the worst thing in the world because then if you want

808
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:23,580
to like talk about that band and you like call them Sun people are like what are you talking

809
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:29,660
about and you're like you know Sun O with the silent O. I fucking hate like stupid names for

810
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,580
for artists. Also you know what the thing about that name is? That's just the name of an amp.

811
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:38,760
Like they just stole that. It's a brand name. That's so funny. Yeah. That's yeah but I was

812
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:44,400
sending Cam because Sun did like an album with Scott Walker. So I figured like Cam would

813
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,860
probably like Scott Walker stuff and then Cam sent me a Sun song and I listened to it and

814
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,860
it's just just feedback. It's not just feedback. It's one chord and they play the feedback

815
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,740
beautifully and it's one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded because it sounds like

816
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:03,100
I didn't say I didn't say I did you listen to the whole thing. I didn't you hear the part around like eight minutes

817
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,100
Or yeah, I thought it was I thought it was great

818
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,660
I thought it was great. I liked it. I just like it's so funny that like I

819
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:15,340
Knew that's exactly what you listen to I told you that's what I listen to I knew it was

820
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:21,140
It's well, I didn't know it was like like I thought like oh, that's like probably a parody of like what Cameron listens to

821
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,880
But no, that's exactly what it was so good, dude

822
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,380
And then I said you like this song that like sounds like fucking show tunes

823
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:31,360
Jackie by Scott Walker

824
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:39,440
We're in a country western music you would probably you'd probably like Scott Walker a lot Caleb

825
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,920
I like I'm on a huge Scott kick right now. I think he's so cool

826
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,880
My favorite guy is this dude Coulter wall right now

827
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,440
He just like sings about like doing heroin and being a cowboy and shit

828
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,760
but then it's always so fucked up with country music nowadays because you like you every good country

829
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,640
artist you'll look up like their wikipedia to like figure out where they're from and shit

830
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,440
and they're all from [ __ ] canada they're all from like toronto and they're just and then the

831
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:12,000
guy looks like a i thought i thought he was 60 years old he's like 19 yeah american country now

832
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,800
it's like it got too like uh like nationalist or whatever guys like too patriotic all right i don't

833
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:25,680
want to talk about this is already going to the boring direction like I'm enjoying

834
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,520
a beer on the 4th of July that's sick you like say you like country music

835
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,760
right you like you sad I like country listen it's not cut you should listen to

836
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,200
Pedro the lion that's the only band that I can listen to right now he's yeah

837
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:42,000
they're the best dude they're like I think at least three of their albums are

838
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,160
concept albums about a husband killing a wife or a wife killing a husband Wow so

839
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:52,960
first of all I would be investigating that if I was a police. If you make one album about that, that's fine.

840
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,560
If that's like the only thing you can make music about, that's not gonna be...

841
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,960
He also talks about being a born-again Christian.

842
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,880
All right, well then, hey buddy, police can't do anything there. That's God's jurisdiction.

843
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,380
Right.

844
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,640
Dude, Christians make the best music.

845
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,280
Absolutely.

846
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,480
That's just the truth. They all do.

847
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,120
Completely true. Best art just in general.

848
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:13,680
Yeah, dude. Like in all of history, Christians have been crushing it.

849
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:18,280
Catholics make the best movies although every Catholic director is like

850
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,720
insanely good. Yeah and the best like plays and shit they just fucking have

851
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,080
always been crushing it. William Shakespeare made the best plays. Yeah I don't care much for

852
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:30,520
Shakespeare. Yeah actually I remember in high school I said I don't like all that

853
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,760
rap crap yeah I said like just like as a as a joke I was like Shakespeare's just

854
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,240

Just broken job, broken person.

866
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,400
People who are in their 20s and read Shakespeare for fun.

867
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:18,400
And like have like some shitty, some shitty 14 year old kid with like weird pants.

868
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,400
Exactly.

869
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:20,400
I don't read it for fun.

870
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,400
Shakespeare's overrated.

871
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,400
I listen for, I read it for enrichment and enlightenment.

872
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
Yeah.

873
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,400
No.

874
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
It's not funny.

875
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
No.

876
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,400
If someone's in their 20s, they might as well be reading the fucking dictionary on their

877
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,400
free time.

878
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:30,400
Shut the fuck up.

879
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,400
I just remember I said that and then the guy went, "It's just like what?

880
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,400
I'm like 14, dude.

881
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,400
Of course I'm gonna say something fucking stupid."

882
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,400
I can't believe that happened.

883
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,000
stupid honestly I can't believe that happened in New Hampshire yeah really

884
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,800
yeah you were like you got owned for not liking Shakespeare in fucking New

885
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,680

886
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,400
like dude yeah fuck yeah fuck that fucking elitist pussy pick me up in my

887
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,160

888
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:00,440
you don't understand I mean you wouldn't you're not from New England so you know

889
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:05,600
I know just one of the biggest regrets my command a certain respect that's why

890
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,680
That's why all the guys in star all the villains in Star Wars

891
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:21,080
Nice dude, I've not talked about Star Wars for like three episodes. I think I think most people

892
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:27,440
Okay, I mean just a people in the north as redcoats now that I know that I I mean

893
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,560
Now that you brought it back to Star Wars

894
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:32,440
I want to you know bring it back to we're talking about the beginning - you know how they you know

895
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,240
they like reconstructed like like Peter Cushing and and whatever yeah I mean

896
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,720
they should just do that to every old person they should get rid of them and

897
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:48,000
then just yeah be serious they had those facial projectors for the what was it

898
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:51,000
was it the Hong Kong protests where they had like the facial projectors or it

899
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,400
would put like a face over your face yeah what if we utilize those put it on old

900
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,960
people's face put a much younger face exactly also or put it on I mean on a

901
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:04,480
young person because there'll be a better old person and then send your grandma to Siberia.

902
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:08,880
Even better, even better like take like an old person and put them through like some kind of

903
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,200
processing plant where it shears off their face with a laser and uses it for like a hot dog casing

904
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:19,760
and then you can like use the body for whatever. Yeah and also like stem cells you know like how

905
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:23,760
much... Exactly. We could stay young forever if we kill all the old people. I mean you're not gonna

906
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,600
you don't miss your grandma you miss chocolate milk let's be completely honest. You don't give

907
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:32,400
- Don't give a fuck about your grandma.

908
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:36,560
- But you know the amount of stem cells in a fetus,

909
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,840
- Yeah, so by the time they get to an old person,

910
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,800
it's probably humongous amounts.

911
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,680
- The amount of stem cells in a 90 year old

912
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,280
compared to an eight month old baby.

913
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:50,480
- I mean, and we've been just chopping down so many trees

914
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,500
in the Amazon rainforest to make canes and walkers

915
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,340
for these fuckers.

916
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,120
I mean, let 'em crawl is what I say.

917
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,360
- Patrick, that's a really good point about stem cells.

918
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,660
is that we no longer have to do abortions

919
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,960
once we make all these old people slaves.

920
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,280
We can stop all abortions across the world.

921
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,720
- We can get rid of all the old people

922
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:09,240
and make Christ happy.

923
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,520
- We can use old people body tissue

924
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,880
in the Pepsi for the flavor or whatever.

925
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,120
We don't have to use babies anymore.

926
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:16,600
- You're right, that's such a good point.

927
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,880
Also glue, we can stop fucking up these horses.

928
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:20,800
Glue and gelatin.

929
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,600
Fucking old people have to have some glue in them.

930
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:23,440
- Exactly.

931
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:24,260
- Right?

932
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,600
- Well, Cam, they already tried that with Pepsi 1893.

933
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:27,920
(laughing)

934
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,400
- They used the stem cells from a person born in 1893.

935
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,360
- That could not have been very good.

936
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,680
- Pepsi 1893.

937
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,560
- Was it good?

938
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:37,400
- I liked it.

939
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:44,080
- There was some cocaine in Coke at some point, right?

940
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:44,920
- Yeah.

941
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:46,680
- That's just so goofy, dude.

942
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,720
- Pepsi 1893 was just like--

943
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,520
- That's just some goofy-ass foo-foo shit, for real.

944
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:53,840
- They had two, they had Pepsi,

945
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:57,240
they had like a ginger cola, and then like the Pepsi one.

946
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,760
- What is the 1893?

947
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,800
I don't know what that is.

948
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,000
- It was like original formula or something like that.

949
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:05,240
- I wanna try Pepsi 10,000 BC.

950
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:06,080
- Yeah.

951
00:47:06,080 --> 00:47:06,900
(laughing)

952
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:07,740
- I wanna know what was going on back then with soda.

953
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:11,160
- Yeah, caveman Pepsi, that'd be fucking good, dude.

954
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,840
Dude, caveman, I talked to somebody recently.

955
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,160
- You talked to a caveman recently?

956
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:16,640
- I talked to a caveman recently.

957
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,160
No, I was talking to somebody recently

958
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,160
about like primitivism and they were like,

959
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,400
yeah, cavemen were probably way happier.

960
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,240
And I was like--

961
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,120
- What are you fucking talking about?

962
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,040
- I just don't fuck with rocks like that, though.

963
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:30,400
- Oh yeah, oh, the cavemen were way happier, yeah.

964
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,520
Getting chased by like a fucking boar?

965
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:33,800
Are you kidding me?

966
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:34,640
- Exactly.

967
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,160
- Oh yeah.

968
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,640
- I can look at a video of a caveman

969
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,080
getting chased by a boar on my big screen.

970
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,240
- I can find one of those videos of sad.

971
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,480
That's the thing.

972
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,440
- That's exactly, dude.

973
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,840
- Cavemen were definitely happier.

974
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,600
I'm sorry, I have to take a stance on that.

975
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:52,320
Yeah, dude, they got to draw on the wall.

976
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,160
Their mom didn't yell at them if they drew on the wall.

977
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,000
- You can just do graffiti!

978
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:55,840
You have so much more tools.

979
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,160
You got to take him to jail and your legs broken.

980
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:00,240
- There's so many more tools to do

981
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,080
to drawing on the wall now. - You probably got

982
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,240
taken to jail. - You think tools

983
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,640
are what make you happy?

984
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,680
- Yes. - Tools make you happy.

985
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,660
- The happiest animal in the world is the noble worm.

986
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:13,640
And back in the time-- - The noble, ah.

987
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:15,120
The noble worm.

988
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,320
- Back in the time of the cavemen,

989
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,240
we were more like worms than we are today.

990
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,120
- They should do a full David Attenborough

991
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,000
planet Earth mini series just about one worm.

992
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:27,320
Yeah, just follow one worm around.

993
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,320
Well, you'd have like an hour of footage.

994
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,240
Like what is a worm's lifespan?

995
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,080
Like a day?

996
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,160
I was, this just reminded me of,

997
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,840
I was talking, I know we kind of talked about this

998
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,680
a little at the last show.

999
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,000
I was talking to Pierce about this.

1000
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,360
You know those shows that were like,

1001
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:43,360
they were like the top 10, like deadliest animals.

1002
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,280
Oh yeah.

1003
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,280
Like, did you guys ever watch that?

1004
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,880
Like, I remember I used to watch that

1005
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,240
and get like really pissed off.

1006
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,480
Cause like number one would always be mosquito.

1007
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,480
And it's like, that's like the biggest cop out.

1008
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,720
like number one should be like some kind of animal that like exists but somehow I

1009
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:01,280
never heard about it until now and it's also the most evil like it should be

1010
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,360
like something that lives in the way by exactly they should be like oh like

1011
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:09,200
here's this no it should be like there's a there's a 17 foot long wolf and here's

1012
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,920
a here's footage that we just uncovered of a killing 10 people that looks like

1013
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:17,760
it was directed by John who what if what if it was like like top 10 deadliest

1014
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,440
animals or whatever is like one of those shows and it's like number one the pit

1015
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,720
How about the laser sharks from Austin Powers?

1016
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,520
That's what it should be something that I didn't know existed before I watched the show.

1017
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,520
I mean mosquitoes is like maybe the worst possible.

1018
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,040
We talked about how like last episode about like how so little of the ocean is discovered.

1019
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,680
There's got to be a fucked up beast in there.

1020
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:45,000
Like there has to be a humongous octopus that is like cracking level crazy big.

1021
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,480
Yeah that we just haven't seen.

1022
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:49,320
And it probably has probably breathes fire or something too.

1023
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,320
And it probably smokes weed.

1024
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:52,320
Fucking cool.

1025
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,320
Woah.

1026
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
What?

1027
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,320
No way.

1028
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:56,320
Oh fuck.

1029
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:01,320
Or it could be like, you know, number one most deadliest animal is like the alien.

1030
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Yeah.

1031
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:03,320
An alien could be pretty deadliest.

1032
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,320
Oh shit.

1033
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:05,320
And they should have alien footage.

1034
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,320
They're dropping the alien knowledge this month.

1035
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:08,320
Yeah.

1036
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
Oh, speak, hold on.

1037
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,320
A worm lives four to eight years.

1038
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:14,320
So I guess you could do a thing about one worm.

1039
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,320
Yeah, dude.

1040
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
One worm, wait, really?

1041
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,320
Four years?

1042
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:18,160
- Four years, that's fucking--

1043
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,000
- What a GoPro eyes.

1044
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,560
- Four to eight years is the average lifespan of a worm.

1045
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,320
- What type of worm?

1046
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,280
- An earthworm. - An earthworm.

1047
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:26,800
- An earthworm lives four to eight years?

1048
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:27,720
- Yes.

1049
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:29,080
- So when you see an earthworm,

1050
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:33,400
it's gotta be full-size, probably four years old.

1051
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:38,000
- That's crazy, dude, 'cause flies live one day or something,

1052
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,600
or like a week.

1053
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,040
- A worm is in the ground, though, and a fly--

1054
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,920
- A worm must have done something horrible

1055
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:49,600
in a past life to be you know you have to you have to eat and poop the same thing

1056
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,600
yeah rest of your life and you're living eight years every year size lives like

1057
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,680
we've no eyes yeah but you yeah that's got to be fucked up man and you are

1058
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:05,600
gonna be eaten by the most beautiful creature of all time yeah my me yeah I

1059
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:10,600
mean either either a gorgeous rainbow trout or a you know a Robin with

1060
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,600
glistening plumage and more you know you're just or a Patrick with a big

1061
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:21,640
gaping mouth. I read how to eat fried worms in the third grade. I saw the movie. I read it so I could see the movie.

1062
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:26,720
I did that too. What do you guys hope that you were reincarnated as? Me again?

1063
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:35,960
That would be sick dude. That would be so fucking sick. Yeah, just get to go again. Yeah, retry. Second life dude. Level up.

1064
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:41,880
If you put a quarter into your slot right before you die, you can do that. You can restart. Yeah,

1065
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:48,200
You have 15 seconds. There's a countdown. Yeah, if you don't do it, you got to be able to put like gold coins on on corpse's eyes

1066
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:52,400
True, so they'd have tokens. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah that I mean

1067
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,440
What that's what the boondocks Saints would do. I feel like you can't be like a dolphin or a sea turtle

1068
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:04,120
What come back as yeah, cuz sea turtle you could be fucking like you do your thing forever, dude

1069
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:08,360
You see so much shit. There's turtles who were like fucking with Genghis Khan

1070
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:14,680
I mean, I think probably sharks and shit most likely but also I mean they could die just from like, you know

1071
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:17,920
You could swim into a coke bottle and yeah, they can't really die. Well, but I

1072
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:23,240
Straw but also that's because they are sea turtles are so old. They don't know what a coke bottle

1073
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:27,160
I was I was gonna say like a grizzly bear, but then people would try to shoot you I think

1074
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:30,080
Yeah, plus you end up in all these fucking backyard

1075
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:36,800
Jump in a pool, whatever. Yeah, whatever animal I want. I just want to be reincarnated as an animal that can get a lot of kills

1076
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,060
(laughing)

1077
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:42,500
- I looked up what eats a sea turtle,

1078
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,400
and it said that the first,

1079
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,540
all right, this is the list of animals

1080
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,040
that eats a sea turtle,

1081
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,240
or that are natural predators for a sea turtle.

1082
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,880
Crabs, raccoons, boars, birds, coyotes, and sharks.

1083
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,640
- Oh, yeah, 'cause when they're born,

1084
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,960
they're super, yeah, they just gotta get to the,

1085
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,800
it's funny that the sea turtle has like,

1086
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,080
like they either live one second or 600 years.

1087
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,580
Why don't they just lay their eggs in the water instead of on the beach?

1088
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,080
They're the dumbest animal in the world.

1089
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:14,580
In North Carolina, all the people who live on the beach,

1090
00:53:14,580 --> 00:53:20,580
they have to turn off their lights in their house for a certain time of night for parts of the year

1091
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:23,580
because sea turtles are so stupid they think it's the moon.

1092
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,080
Because they just go towards the moon.

1093
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:26,580
That's the same thing with bugs, too.

1094
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,080
Like insects.

1095
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,080
Yeah.

1096
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:32,080
I would, you know, like bugs or insects.

1097
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:34,080
Yeah, bugs or insects. Either one.

1098
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:36,320
I meant to say like moths.

1099
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,760
Well sea turtle might be a good choice then, again because it's like either you're like

1100
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,560
straight to the next life or you get to see like everything happen.

1101
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,280
What about one of those like Greenland sharks, you know the sharks that live like 300 years,

1102
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:50,800
like there's one that's been alive since like the 1800s.

1103
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,420
Like I think they live pretty deep in the ocean but you could like you know swim, maybe

1104
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,320
you could figure out a way where you could like swim in a river and just see what's up

1105
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,080
and then like go back and like hang out for like 50 years.

1106
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:04,520
I think, well, ocean is the move also because like in 50 years you get New York City.

1107
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,520
True.

1108
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,520
You know what I mean?

1109
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:10,400
Like you have, like you're only getting better as far as like where you can go.

1110
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,840
Yeah, you get to live in like the most beautiful house ever in Florida underwater.

1111
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,680
Sea creature has to be the move.

1112
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:17,680
Yeah.

1113
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,680
Yeah.

1114
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:19,680
Sea creature or like a...

1115
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,680
Either, yeah, a sea creature or like a...

1116
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:21,680
Tree.

1117
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,680
Alright, fine, mermaid.

1118
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,680
I choose mermaid.

1119
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,920
Yeah, like some kind of like all powerful spirit that can like infest...

1120
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,880
What about like a holy tree?

1121
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:28,880
What about God?

1122
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,880
Yeah.

1123
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,320
would be good or a holy tree might be good too or maybe like a like a herald from

1124
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:39,000
Fallout 3 situation. Maybe a roly-poly. I might want to yeah I might want to be

1125
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:45,240
like a warlock you know yeah or like maybe a werewolf. I might try to be a girl

1126
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:49,200
next time. Yeah? Yeah just see what it's like you know maybe give me some

1127
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,960
perspective. I can definitely tell I've never been a girl in a past life. Yeah. I

1128
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,320
can just feel it. I think I could have been. I don't know. I think there's a strong

1129
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,120
possibility you maybe even two lives ago where a girl yeah you had one buffer but

1130
00:55:02,120 --> 00:55:08,200
the two lives ago you were definitely a girl in Central Asia yeah yeah yeah I can

1131
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,400
see your aura yeah I could tell dude I'm looking at you dude also there's

1132
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:16,780
anything wrong with that yeah no it was it was great dude you had like 50

1133
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:20,080
husbands and you loved all of them yeah and you seriously loved what you did

1134
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:30,200
with them that's right that's right yeah you okay love something is something

1135
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:33,840
about me tells me that in a past life you might have been like an apple or like

1136
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:40,920
maybe you might have been like a you might have been like a naked bull rat

1137
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,680
maybe or something I don't know I don't know what I'm getting about your aura

1138
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:48,360
that makes me think you might have been like a round rock in the ground Cameron

1139
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:56,960
was a snake and Patrick was a Snorlax in previous lives. A Snorlax? Yeah. The one Snorlax that

1140
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,960
ever lived on earth. Yeah the guy, well the guy had the idea for Pokemon. Yeah. He saw

1141
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:07,280
him and he's like "Oh shit I'm gonna make a bunch of you." Yeah. Yeah he said nobody

1142
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,400
can know about this thing if they, they're not gonna want to play the game if they find

1143
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:15,120
out it's a real animal. So God doesn't exist in the Pokemon franchise right? He does, there's

1144
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,120
There's a Pokemon God.

1145
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,600
There's a Pokemon that is God.

1146
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:24,560
There's no earthly way that Christ exists in Pokemon, right?

1147
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,560
Arceus.

1148
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,560
But he's not Christ.

1149
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,560
Arceus is God.

1150
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,560
No, he is God, though.

1151
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,920
He is the God of the Pokemon world.

1152
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,360
But there's no, like, you know, the real God.

1153
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
Like, there's no...

1154
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,360
He is, dude.

1155
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,360
What are you talking about?

1156
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,360
You sound like a fucking idiot right now.

1157
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,360
Yeah, I'm sorry.

1158
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,360
My bad.

1159
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,800
Yeah, I just don't...

1160
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,000
Pokemon never made much sense to me.

1161
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,200
I don't know why they...

1162
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,600
I started playing Pokemon like two years ago.

1163
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,200
Like, the handheld ones.

1164
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,760
But I played like, I played like Pokemon Colosseum and like Stadium and Snap as a kid.

1165
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,320
I played all the console games, whatever the handheld was.

1166
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:57,400
If you played Pokemon Snap as a kid, you's a pervert now, I'll tell you that much.

1167
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:58,400
What?

1168
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,400
You's a damn perverted freak.

1169
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,400
Not true.

1170
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:01,400
You're walking around.

1171
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,600
I'm gonna capture a fucking tight angle on this one.

1172
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,520
I mean the thing is, I- No, it just makes you appreciate nature.

1173
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:10,920
I mean, I wasn't even, I wasn't allowed to play like Call of Duty or anything as a kid

1174
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,240
and even I knew Pokemon Snap was lame.

1175
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,080
- Yeah.

1176
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,240
- I mean, I have to say, and I know that people,

1177
00:57:15,240 --> 00:57:16,080
people love that game.

1178
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,600
They're gonna crawl out of the woodwork,

1179
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,720
and it's like, I mean, you can just hang out in the bathroom

1180
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,080
if that's really what you wanna do.

1181
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,920
- Exactly.

1182
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:24,040
- You don't need a GameCube for that.

1183
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:27,200
- Hey baby, just got 100 points off you, so pretty cool.

1184
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,840
- That's not what Pokemon Snap was about.

1185
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:32,280
- Pokemon Snap was about looking under Pikachu's dress

1186
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:33,120
to see if it's a boy or girl.

1187
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:34,880
- No, no, you give him an apple,

1188
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:35,720
and he stands on a surfboard,

1189
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:38,000
and you take a picture of surfing Pikachu.

1190
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,280
That's not what happens.

1191
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,880
- You could be playing like a Kirby game,

1192
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,600
and get different abilities but you'd rather just like take pictures of creatures and animals.

1193
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:52,200
You hit Charmeleon into a thing of lava and he turns into Charizard and you can take a

1194
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,200
picture of it.

1195
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:54,360
That's what you do to girls.

1196
00:57:54,360 --> 00:57:55,360
You don't do that to girls!

1197
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:56,680
I'm not saying that!

1198
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:58,680
Yeah you do.

1199
00:57:58,680 --> 00:57:59,680
No!

1200
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,680
You do.

1201
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:08,680
And you give Slowpoke an apple and then he turns around and then Cloyster bites his ass

1202
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:10,240
and he turns into Slowbro.

1203
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:14,120
You guys know when you complete the Pokédex in Pokémon Snap and you unlock the mirror

1204
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:15,120
on your shoe?

1205
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,120
That's not true!

1206
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,120
So you can take pictures of the...

1207
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,120
Yeah, you get real close to Mr. Mime on the subway.

1208
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,160
Damn, what's up Mr. Mime?

1209
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:31,520
Any Pokémon that looked like a human would freak me out.

1210
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:34,840
I will not stand for this Pokémon Snap bullshit.

1211
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,800
Okay, pervert, that's fine.

1212
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,800
You perverted freak.

1213
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,280
I'm not a perverted freak for this.

1214
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,120
You're a pervy--

1215
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:40,920
Oh, stop.

1216
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,040
What did you do?

1217
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:46,160
He just accidentally went low in his office chair.

1218
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,560
Went really low.

1219
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,440
I don't like this, dude.

1220
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:52,000
Look like you're on a hog, Orange County Chopper style.

1221
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,960
I'm pissed off.

1222
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,960
What, do you shrink when you're mad?

1223
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:57,200
I'm down here, so don't smack me in the screen.

1224
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,440
I mean, if you're going to play like a pervert photography

1225
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,080
game, you could at least play like Fatal Frame or something.

1226
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:03,880
That's cool.

1227
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,200
It's not a pervert game.

1228
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,200
Play like a dating sim if you're going to play Pokemon Snap.

1229
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,200
It's not nature.

1230
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,240
they're not real dude it's a I wish they were real I wish I could see a Pikachu I

01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,780
That's... that's just all I wanna say.

1245
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,000
*laughter*

1246
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,000
I was doing that for Caleb!

1247
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,320
I don't want that.

1248
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,320
You said you liked the Halo theme.

1249
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,320
Yeah, I like listening to it when I'm on a run...

1250
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,820
'cause it pumps me up.

1251
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:22,820
Feel like I'm defeating the fucking Covenant!

1252
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:23,820
Okay?

1253
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:24,520
Yeah, dude!

1254

Sometimes I gotta listen to Halo, feel like I'm fucking 343!

1255
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,520
I'm like, "Oh shit, dude, I'm 7 feet tall, I got kidnapped as a kid."

1256
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,720
And when you're... when you're...

1257
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:34,520
You're running from your mousehole to... to pick up a crumb...

1258
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,120
Okay, episode's over. I'm stopping recording right now. Fuck you.

1259
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,520
[laughs]

1260
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,520
Caleb's small and Patrick's a pervert.
