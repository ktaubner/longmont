1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
I

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:12,700
get a lesson today and getting a laid back juveo yeah. You need to chill man

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,580
relax,

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,140
take a load off

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:24,160
just lie down on your

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,800
that's how you chill out. Surfers are so they got to be some of the

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,600
they are. Okay, we've talked about my

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:40,000
my hatred for skaters. I have the opposite feeling for surfboarders because

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,900
you are servers as I call them. I surfed like four times and I was like

10
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,900
surfers actually

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,000
listen. He's talking about surfing. Let me talk about surfing like he used to

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,200
do it all the time. Let me let me explain. Let me explain where let me

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,700
go a little psychological and I just explain the

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,840
the reasons for your feelings because it's because skateboarders they

15
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,640
pretend to take their lives in their hands every day. They go dude. Oh my

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,200
God, I'm skating. I'm going on to a box that is six inches tall. I could die.

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,520
I what if I guess right? I'm not wearing a motherfucking helmet bitch.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,160
Whereas a surfer every single time he goes out there runs the risk of being

19
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:17,880
drawn and quartered by a shark. Yes, a shark sharks like to sharks a hundred

20
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,680
percent. There's sharks in the street there. No, shut the fuck up. That's a

21
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,240
cartoon and they're in the sewer. It's not true at all. Street sharks. They

22
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:29,800
don't live on the street. I saw one. You're literally, you're thinking of a

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,140
toy. I saw a shark the other day. No, I saw one. I saw one on the street. You're

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,940
a toy. You are a toy. I'm not a toy. You're a hella toy. I'm not a toy. I

25
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:42,160
don't write, so. Skateboarding is fried. Skate-- Whoa, chill. Chill. Chill on that.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,160
Chill on that. Chill on that. Real quick. Dude, that's crazy. You're about to get

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,160
your jaw slicked. You can't say that. You cannot say that. You're about to get

28
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,020
your jaw slicked, bro. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's my boy, and I'm sorry. My

29
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,920
balloons are going to slide your jaw. I'll get him now. That's not even escape

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,960
talking. You're talking about balloons. I got balloons tower defense, bro. You

31
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,080
have balloons. I do have double. I would say there's almost no first find a

32
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,600
balloons when they surf. Skateboarders are lucky to find a penny with the

33
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,200
tail side up. That's our servers are weed addicted. Heroin

34
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:17,360
surfers are addicted to the beautiful vitamin D from the sun.

35
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,320
I'm addicted to one vitamin D and sunscreen.

36
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,320
You think surfers are gay?

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,320
Or girls I guess?

38
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,320
Surfers are gay girls.

39
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Well okay, I will say that the most famous surfer

40
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
is named Kelly and he's a boy.

41
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,320
Yeah, which is a little strange.

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,320
He actually has some fucked up political opinions that I would not like to get into right now.

43
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
Does he really?

44
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,320
I don't know. I think I saw him commenting on some

45
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
one of those like public

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,320
rage bait videos that they post on like

47
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,320
what is it called?

48
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
Hood Clips or something.

49
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:50,920
something. You saw Kelly Slater on Hood Clips and he was saying, he was saying,

50
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,320
"I'm gonna kill every single one of my..." He's probably pro, you know what it is?

51
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,800
He's probably pro global warming because it's more... He wants more sea level,

52
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,760
yeah, exactly. Peach, higher waves. Higher waves, man. Higher waves, bro! He

53
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,240
wants the polar ice caps to melt so he can get one of those big Fiji waves.

54
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,440
'Cause what's he gonna do with the polar ice caps? You know what he wants?

55
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,200
He wants all of the... Nothing, nothing. He can't surf those. He wants all of

56
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,840
the planet to be covered in water so he can surf and Bradley Knowles corpse will go up

57
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,160
so he can use that, put it in his surfboard.

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Who's that?

59
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,160
The guy from Sublime.

60
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,720
Why are you talking about Bradley Knowles corpse?

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,880
Why do you gotta get so far?

62
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,160
I mean his kids could listen to this show.

63
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,480
His kids do listen to this.

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
He didn't have kids.

65
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,480
He definitely had some kids.

66
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,480
He had Dalmatian.

67
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,480
I think the Dalmatian listened.

68
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,440
I think the Dalmatian would be passed away by now.

69
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,440
Yeah, probably.

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
They don't live very long.

71
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:47,960
surfing is a surfing is a moral is a moral dilemma. No, it's not a thing is

72
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,280
that surfing is about being at one with nature and the wild world. It is so

73
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,680
amazing, whereas skateboarding is about the concrete jungle, which is an

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,900
artificial about the light on the story of the planet, during the concrete

75
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:03,440
jungle. No, it's not. No, you guys build concrete ramps. You don't understand

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:09,960
so surfing is so serene like being out in the ocean. I served four times and

77
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,900
said that he's done it. Yeah, surfing is being out in the open ocean, 300 feet

78
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:20,060
from land. It's a mile out of the ocean surfing. I love I love the I want to I

79
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,140
want to try to serve. Actually, I have been I have been thinking about it.

80
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:28,500
Maybe I do that. I think you'd be fail at it, but I actually if it gets you off

81
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,580
of skating, I'm like a mom who's like kid wants to start like smoking weed

82
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,620
instead of doing pills like I find you should be. I should encourage maybe I

83
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,200
I don't know because I mean I can't flip tricks. I can't do flip tricks. People

84
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,860
don't flip all that much when they're surfing. Yeah, it's mostly just going

85
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,140
straight. Yeah, you go straight. Sometimes you go sideways and you will

86
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,740
do a handstand or they hang ten. You could get in a rip curl.

87
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:55,300
The biggest trick in surfing is hanging ten.

88
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,440
Has anyone actually ever hung ten? Yeah. The Tummy Hawk of surfing hung twenty

89
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:05,560
one time. Hanging ten, hanging ten's like a big deal. Hanging ten is not a

90
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,580
It's one of the only like five people in the world who have ever hung ten before.

91
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,580
No, dude. I've hung ten. Bro. No. You want to check me?

92
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:17,580
Speaking of hanging ten, there's a really, really crazy clip. You literally put your feet on either end

93
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,580
and you hang ten off, hang five on each side. That's my strat.

94
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,580
That's not, that's a monkey grab. That's hanging five and five. So you claim to be a

95
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,580
skateboarder and yet you know about monkey kind of language for surfing.

96
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,580
There's a lot of, a lot of the tricks are analogous to each other. They're the same

97
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:39,460
pretty much goofy came from all the word goofy. The goofy footed comes from the

98
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:46,900
animators in a Disney short about surfing, drawing goofy doing his foot like right

99
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,900
foot forward and then regular is like so it's actually about Disney goofy. It is

100
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,100
actually about Disney goofy. Yeah, that's awful. That just blew my mind. Meme style.

101
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,940
Do you ride goofy? Yeah, I'm riding a regular way. I bet he rides grimace style.

102
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,100
Oh, but hang ten.

103
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,100
You ride Ben 10.

104
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:13,100
There's a clip of fucking Tim Pool doing a hang ten inward heel.

105
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
That's cool.

106
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,100
It's crazy that he's hanging ten and then he does a flip with his two feet.

107
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,100
So he's kind of nice.

108
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,100
He's still wearing the fucking beanie bro.

109
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,100
He's kind of nice though.

110
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
He can skate.

111
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,740
He's yeah, he's better than me. Whoa. So you just admitted that yeah, Tim pool is better than me at skating, but they like

112
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,740
He's he cuz you're kind of the temple. You're like the leftist

113
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:48,180
Yeah, you won't take a hat off you I'll take it off right now damn it got stuck

114
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:54,940
Take us stuck

115
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,260
I'm down to go surfing this summer. The summer is upon us.

116
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:03,260
The summer is over. I'd be down to surf. Summer is over. Summer is barely getting started.

117
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:07,260
It's only 80 degrees. I'm so not excited for these 100 degree, 110, 120, 130 degrees days.

118
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Apparently it's going to be jungle climate across the entire US.

119
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Being born in July is a curse. Why? It's a cancer if

120
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,260
it's before the 23rd. Why? Because of the heat.

121
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,260
Right. Why the 23rd? It's the cusp of Leo.

122
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:30,160
on my birthday, the cusp of Leo, the cusp of shut up. Okay. Oh, you did get into

123
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,140
astrology for a little bit when you moved to New York because I was dating.

124
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,660
I had to know this shit. Oh, God, this is what you say. A girl asked you for your

125
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:46,560
astrological information. You say this fuck off. You could pretend like you're

126
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,700
you say you say really quietly manute bowl and you didn't you know they don't

127
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,840
- You know who Manic Bowler is?

128
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,680
- Bowl Ball?

129
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,520
- No, no, Bowl Ball is his son.

130
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,280
- I think his son went to...

131
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,120
- No, he didn't.

132
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,640
- His son went to school in New Hampshire, I think.

133
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,480
- Maybe.

134
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,520
Do you know who Manic Bowler is, though?

135
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
- Yeah.

136
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,180
- You know who they are?

137
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,240
- I know he has a son named Bowl Ball.

138
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,440
- He's like a seven foot seven guy from Africa.

139
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
And they just, he came to the US

140
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,060
and they made up a birthday for him

141
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,800
'cause they didn't know, he didn't know his birthday,

142
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,440
he didn't know how old he was.

143
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,960
But he apparently used to,

144
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
anytime that it would like,

145
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,640
the summer would come back around,

146
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,640
he would cut his head to mark like...

147
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:24,880
and he plays one of his teammates said that oh he is a sportsman yeah he was a

148
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,460
basketball player so one of his teammates said he could I think his

149
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,160
listed birthday was at the time he was like 28 years old and one of his

150
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,680
teammates asked him about the scars he was like yeah this is like how many

151
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,840
years old I am and he said that he had like over 50 scars and he was like 50

152
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:48,480
years old that's sick and then he died like five years after that so it makes

153
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,480
He died?

154
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Yeah.

155
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
I thought he was alive.

156
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
No, no, he died.

157
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,160
They claimed he died at like 40, but he was probably in his 60s.

158
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Oh.

159
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,160
Wow.

160
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,720
I would love to lie about my age.

161
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,640
I'm getting to the age where I'm feeling like I should be lying about it.

162
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,640
Yeah.

163
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,640
When people say...

164
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
I'm 15.

165
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,640
Yeah, you're young.

166
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,320
Dude, I look kind of indeterminate age, I think.

167
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,880
I don't think I look like a 25-year-old.

168
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,720
You look like one of those photos where they're like, "This is what a 25-year-old used to

169
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
look like."

170
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,200
I was like a twenty five year old in like nineteen seventy. Yeah, yeah, that's what high school

171
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,600
kids used to look like in two thousand and three. What the fuck? Yeah, I don't think

172
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,880
that's fair. Jesus Christ. Yeah, that guy's fifty. Yeah, I think I'm kind of blessed in

173
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,000
that way though, because I already look, I already look old. My parents look very young,

174
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,440
but maybe I, actually maybe I'm fucked. Why? Maybe I'm completely fucked. Do you think

175
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:43,220
you look older than your parents already? Probably. That's a fact. I look older than

176
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:50,220
my parents did in like photos. I'd rather look old than young. Yeah. I'm going to look like

177
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:55,660
a fucking raisin by the time I'm like 40. No, you have decent skin. I don't think you're

178
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,560
going to look like a raisin. I didn't get zits until my girlfriend started giving me

179
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,560
skin care stuff and then I was like, I can't do this anymore. I think that this whole skin

180
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:13,060
care thing that women are into. I think that that stuff gives you worse skin. Yeah, so

181
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,740
that you have to keep using it. Yeah, that's why. That's why they use it. Me wrong, L'Oreal.

182
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:26,420
I think it's probably true because they didn't have that back. They didn't have skin care

183
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:33,180
back in the caveman. No, no, no, no. Yeah, wait, have you ever seen a picture or a cave

184
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,420
great painting of a caveman with acne yeah never want no of course not no. I

185
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:41,580
mean they do it to the little blood dots yeah Simba. It's the easiest thing to

186
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:45,780
draw in the world yeah dots a dot. It's easier than a line and they didn't do

187
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,620
it dozens of lines. Imagine what caveman acne looked like the probably like

188
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:56,060
imagine how big imagine how big sure everything was bigger back then. No,

189
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:59,220
just like the just because all the oils and shit like they've never washed so

190
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,740
like imagine just like the doctor pimple pop of videos for caveman.

191
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:10,840
well, you know it would be do me like he does back then were sucking people dry

192
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,360
yeah and all the blood out land of the law land of the last. I never saw it

193
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,040
because it was too adult for me when it was released. It's too little for me

194
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,360
now man. There's some fucking inappropriate shiz in the show the movie

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,800
shut up.

196
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,480
What show the show that the movies based on you're trying to be old. You are to

197
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,940
Okay, you look old because you're spiritually a hundred. You love old

198
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:37,300
shit. Yeah. And you always know about old crap. Well, that show looks cool.

199
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,960
The reason is because you like your parents too much and you listen to what

200
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,400
they say. Well, they would... Me and him. That's right. Our parents blabbered

201
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,780
on all day about... That's right, I'm like, "Fuck you, Dad, I like Pokemon."

202
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,060
My parents wouldn't let me watch shit like that.

203
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,960
Like what? Like Pokemon because

204
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,920
there was... Well, there was like four kids in the house and they were like,

205
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,340
"No, we're gonna watch this instead." So they would put on their kids programs

206
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,600
from like when they were younger, he calls them programs. I do God damn you

207
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,220
man. Jesus. Okay, so here's how am I? How am I like this old and this young at

208
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,040
the same time? Me too son is a good thing. They're the same fucking thing.

209
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,180
Yeah, I think it's the electric company you want to watch. Yeah, you so to me

210
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,240
and Cameron Jeepers Creepers is a scary movie to you and to my mom. It's the

211
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,460
the song. It's the best song ever.

212
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,400
It's your ringtone man

213
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:37,440
that's your kind of thing. Yeah, scary movies you, you know, we need to put us

214
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,880
as a horror character. Yeah, who is attacking Christopher Robin and the

215
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:45,240
hundred acre wood because they abandoned him yeah right to you. He's some

216
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,680
cartoony. You probably only read the book and the poetry

217
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:54,600
I really I had a movie out of winning the that's new for me. I saw I still on the

218
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,080
Charles. I watched the trailer for that movie. That is got to be the biggest

219
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:05,880
whiff of a fine idea where you could have done something kind of fun ever. I

220
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,360
think well, it's all just it's money laundering. Yeah, I think so, do every

221
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,200
every every movie like every horror movie like that is is like that, but why

222
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,280
didn't they do it? They could have made him a big puppet. I think there was a

223
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:20,800
movie a couple years ago that was like also a similar thing. Banana splits.

224
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,160
Yeah, yeah. But that was kind of fun. They made a banana splits horror movie

225
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,080
where they like torture people. That's a show from the 70s. Yeah, yeah. So it

226
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,760
became public domain and they turned it into like they were torturing... They

227
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,220
were... How did it just become public domain? It was fun. How did that become

228
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:37,380
public domain? That was like made in the... Oh, okay. They probably... Yeah,

229
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:40,120
that makes sense. Yeah. But they also did that one with

230
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,400
Nicholas Cage, Willie's Wonderland. I didn't see that. They're all bad.

231
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,760
there was Willie's Wonderland. It's the same thing. It's another five. Is that

232
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,160
like a now they're making five nights at Freddy's movie, which I'm excited for.

233
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:55,480
I got a mother. I'm gonna wait. See, that's why that was my kid shows. Yeah,

234
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,200
five nights at Freddy's. Markiplier show. I think five nights at Freddy's is

235
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,360
literally the cut off point. One was the thing that was the first thing that I

236
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:06,280
didn't get. One of the actual shows that I love to watch when I was like a

237
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:12,040
five year old boy was this show called Lidsville, where a guy falls into a

238
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,600
magician's hat and he goes into a world of hats.

239
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:23,600
And the whole show is him interacting with hat people.

240
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,720
A world of hats? Shut the fuck up!

241
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,600
It's a real Lidsville. It's a Lidsville.

242
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,360
Search Lidsville right now.

243
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,760
This is a stop click.

244
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,720
Search Lidsville.

245
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,960
It's a Sid and Marty Kroft show.

246
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,160
I don't care about Lids.

247
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,640
Yep, Lidsville.

248
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,480
Oh, oh God, bro.

249
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
This is what you watch as a kid?

250
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,980
I watch I was a I was obsessed with say to Marty cross stuff as a kid. You are

251
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:50,520
an idiot. I'm not an idiot. It's just the shit that my mom would let me like

252
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,440
watch. I did this.

253
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,520
This is the VHS tapes I would have. I didn't fucking buy it. My mom did. I

254
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,080
had no money. I was a boy. This is something that you would you would in

255
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,920
2012 you would open an imager album that was called oddly terrifying shows

256
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,760
from the olden days and it would be this. Well, yeah, I didn't know that

257
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,800
that shit was scary until I started seeing. Why is she why is she she

258
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,360
they're blasting her ass? Why is he using electricity on her? And the

259
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,580
green guy, they portrayed the hats with costumes. Yeah,

260
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:25,560
the green guy, I forget his name. But then there's also the bug loose jam

261
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,080
and cartoon, but there's also the bug loose in the head, but need a bizarre

262
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,880
you thinking of the tootsies in the yeah, the hooters and tootsies

263
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,880
What was that? What that character's name? I think that's the boy. I don't

264
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,880
know. The person on the right. Oh, that's I don't remember. That's his

265
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:46,580
mom. This is literally you and your mom. Mrs. Hat, yeah.

266
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:51,080
That's what... The idea that I would be looking at this picture and asking,

267
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,180
"Who is that character?" I mean, the kid on the left. I don't remember that

268
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,280
much about Lidsville, but I do remember a good... You remember everything about

269
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,520
it. You said you loved it. I remember, I think I could tell you like maybe

270
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:05,580
storyline from HR Puff and Stuff. Here's why me and Cameron get along so well, better than

271
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:12,580
you do with us, is because we watched Cyberchase. Oh yes. I thought that shit sucked. Shut the

272
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:16,260
fuck up. I thought that shit sucked so bad. I didn't have a viewable, I just had an antenna.

273
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,420
When I was a kid I thought that shit sucked. Cyberchase was the best show of all time. I

274
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,380
thought that sucked and I thought HR Puff and Stuff was sick and I thought The Muppet Show

275
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:30,880
was sick. No man, you're just gay. The Muppets are so gay. The kid who liked The Muppets

276
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,600
still in middle school. Yeah, still like them a bitch in middle school. Yeah,

277
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,880
that was me. That's right. I'll go Mrs Piggy on it. Yep, yep. Slap the shit out

278
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:39,200
of them.

279
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,880
Why was she always hating on Kermit trying to get a little fat? She, she...

280
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:59,240
For real, though. Kermit would say... She did stay. I mean, okay, here's the

281
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,580
She did not let him.

282
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:05,460
They would have somebody on Elvira or something.

283
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,080
And she's rubbing her tits in Kermit's face.

284
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:08,580
Yeah.

285
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,080
And it's like, what is Kermit supposed to do?

286
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,880
He's the boss of the show.

287
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,480
He's supposed to scorn this beautiful woman.

288
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,480
It's also TV.

289
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
It's not real life.

290
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,080
So don't get mad.

291
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,480
She was always mad about that shit.

292
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,580
But you have somebody like Ricardo Maltaban on or something.

293
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:25,080
Yeah.

294
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,580
He's digging Miss Piggy out in the fucking dressing room.

295
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:31,880
that stage he's going all the way up in me yeah. I don't need to fuck my

296
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:35,640
pig. He's touching the part. They make the hot dogs out of he's up in there.

297
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,620
He's up in there. They got like he's like mum and shunts on there and she's

298
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,980
trying to get a train run on her by moment. Yeah, wait, deep way. He's

299
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:49,620
fucking with her patay. That's a really good point. Is there like pigs, pussy,

300
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,540
balls and dicks

301
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,400
it's funny to him. I that would be like we're going to make the hot dogs out of

302
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,820
the intestine and yeah we're going to use the butthole, but we're not touching

303
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,560
the post. Yeah, they definitely put the

304
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:06,120
we're sorting it all out, save the put

305
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,760
I'm going to take it home. Yeah, some guy, I'm going to save it. I'm going to

306
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,580
save it for later. There's one that is so nasty man.

307
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:16,740
You know hot dog and we talked about how hot dogs are technically as bad for you

308
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:19,680
as I always talk about. It's really recently. All right, dude yeah, if hot

309
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,300
dogs, that's probably why it looks so fucking old because of I got to change

310
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:26,940
my whole life. How often do you eat a hot dog? It used to be when we were in

311
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,760
college together, it used to be probably like

312
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,200
two every day.

313
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,020
No, I hear. No, that's a gross

314
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,020
estimation. It's gross, alright.

315
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,500
I think it was maybe, I think I would get like a 7-Eleven Big Bite probably

316
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:50,100
four times a week. That's a lot for a hot dog. But there's only like a $2

317
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,320
hot dog. That's not you know, I mean the price of it is not that it's not that

318
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,420
it's economical. Yeah, I'm just saying that. Yeah, I mean if obviously a hot

319
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:01,220
dog is the cheapest thing you can eat at any given time. No, that's not obvious.

320
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:06,120
You can get this. No a meal. Yeah, I would say people get a lot of peanuts

321
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,920
for the grind. I mean all I'm saying is that the price has nothing to do with

322
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,520
you get a problem with eating. That's a that's cheap. PB and J is more expensive

323
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,220
because you have to buy all the ingredients at once. True. Yeah. Well,

324
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:23,780
That's true. There was a I used to work at a restaurant that sold a $4 PB&J.

325
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:26,580
Still probably more expensive than a hot dog. You just said it was $2.

326
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,500
What restaurant are you working that sold a PB&J?

327
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:28,980
Clover.

328
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,100
They sold a PB&J? On that pita bread?

329
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:32,660
Yep.

330
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,300
Ugh.

331
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,100
And it was the tiniest little dollops of peanut butter and jelly.

332
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,660
Oh no.

333
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,220
And the tiniest peanut butter. We were ripping, dude, I was ripping people off. It was, it felt

334
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:43,460
like.

335
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,940
And you were getting all that cash.

336
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,100
I was like, I'm just following orders. I just got to keep doing this.

337
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:50,900
You're comparing...

338
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,500
Uh-huh. My time.

339
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,060
Your time working for a kind of expensive restaurant to be...

340
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,740
Yeah, a restaurant.

341
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,460
To working for the Wolfenstaffel.

342
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,100
Wolfen... Wolfensteppen. What was it?

343
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:06,820
Steppenwolf.

344
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,380
Steppenwolf.

345
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:11,060
I like Disney! Fucking magic copyright!

346
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,580
That's got to be the worst song ever.

347
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:12,900
Yeah.

348
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,100
That's one of the songs where I'm...

349
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,860
There's a couple songs like that where I'm so surprised that they were not made.

350
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,540
They were not novelty songs.

351
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:24,900
Yeah, I always thought Steppenwolf was like a 90s band because the guy's voice is so stupid.

352
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:30,660
That's because you don't have the kind of knowledge that I have about 70s bands and stuff.

353
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:32,900
But your parents weren't even into like cool bands.

354
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:37,460
No, my parents, I got into Nirvana in middle school and my mom was like,

355
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,940
"That is the worst shit I've ever heard."

356
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,820
She doesn't like Nirvana?

357
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:41,940
She didn't like Nirvana.

358
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,980
Nirvana's fire.

359
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,780
Yeah, they were so good. My mom was like, "You didn't..."

360
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,780
You made fun of me for listening to Pink Floyd last week.

361
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,580
Pink Floyd sucks.

362
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,480
You are gay.

363
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,380
That's not gay.

364
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,680
Pink Floyd is awesome.

365
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,380
Pink Floyd sucks so bad.

366
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,380
There's some cool songs.

367
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,780
Pink Floyd is sick, dude.

368
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,880
They suck.

369
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,280
You don't like money.

370
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,980
You listen to songs that are like...

371
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,980
I like that song, actually.

372
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,580
It's a good song.

373
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,180
I really like that song.

374
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,080
It's in the Italian job.

375
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:02,780
Yeah.

376
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,280
Maybe I have to give them another chance.

377
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,680
You need to give Pink Floyd another chance.

378
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,380
Yeah, because I just got annoyed by them.

379
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:09,980
I don't know why.

380
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,480
When I was 15...

381
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,180
We walk into the office and you're listening to a song

382
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,060
and it sounds like it could be from a video game

383
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,220
that has a frog level.

384
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,060
- Absolutely.

385
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,020
You're listening to a Lily Pad song.

386
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,860
(imitating frog sounds)

387
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,420
- I was listening, okay, okay.

388
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,260
- That's the music you listen to.

389
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,460
- You guys come in, you guys came in,

390
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,620
I was listening to Sade the other day.

391
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,620
- That wasn't what we're talking about.

392
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:29,460
- No, it wasn't that.

393
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,540
- Not what we're talking about at all.

394
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,080
- No, I know the exact song that I was listening to

395
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,940
and it's gonna make me--

396
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:36,780
- Mario 64 underwater music.

397
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:37,980
- It looks even older,

398
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:39,380
it's gonna make me look like an old man,

399
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:41,580
but it's a song called the Elusive Butterfly.

400
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,540
Why how does it go

401
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:56,460
it's a good song? I bet you listen to the tent, the elusive butterfly of love

402
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,100
by Bob

403
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,340
I

404
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:01,540
listen to

405
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:05,540
I bet you used to listen to eight bit music. Yeah,

406
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:10,700
I talked about that. I talked about that before, but I was in middle school.

407
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,440
I really in the music because I made I made YouTube. You listen to the

408
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,360
eight bit stuff. Wow, I got I was listening to moon theme. Yeah,

409
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:27,720
you know what I you know what I had on my computer and I was in middle school

410
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:27,940
was

411
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:34,500
I had something called it was called it tracker like it tracker and so I could

412
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,900
listen to the files and higher sound quality.

413
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:57,700
It was like our mod plug track. It was a mod, like a midi player. No, it would play dot XM files or dot like it files and I don't even know what those files are. There are files on the old man files. I know. I think you listen to this is why I don't get along with anybody. My music dot O. G. G.

414
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:04,500
because you're so old. I think so. Due to your age. I like I'd like get along with you guys

415
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:10,900
enough. Yeah, we get along proper. Yeah, we get along well. It's just like I guess it's

416
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,860
kind of like you guys hanging out with me is kind of like when you got to hang out with

417
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,700
your uncle. It's like an uncle that I'm wiser than. Yeah, it's like having to take care

418
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,620
of an uncle. Yeah, it's like an uncle with an injury. With a hip problem. Yeah, not a

419
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:27,820
my hip problem. I'm that much of a burden on you guys. I'm going to take

420
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,340
care of an uncle. Yeah, I would say you're definitely taking care of your

421
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,700
kid. Yeah. Did you guys ever have an uncle live in an extra room in your

422
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,620
house or something? No. I've talked about, I've had every single one of my

423
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,260
uncles live in my house. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I forgot about that. Yeah. It's

424
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,380
fun. Yeah, well, it's kind of until, you know, you have

425
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:48,500
two other siblings and you want your own room. Yeah, but kids don't need to

426
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,820
have their own room. Two other siblings that still live there. Unless you're at

427
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,620
age where you also shouldn't have their own room. I agree. I should have shared a room.

428
00:23:54,620 --> 00:24:00,980
Unless it's your sister and there's three other boys. I lived in a... I had a... I shared

429
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:05,060
a room for a long time and then I had my own room and it was a closet. I lived in a closet

430
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,180
under the stairs and my cousin Dudley. Every story Caleb has about me. It was so rude to

431
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:14,820
where he lived. Really? Yeah. I lived in a outhouse. I didn't live in an outhouse. I

432
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:19,540
lived in an outhouse for six months. I never lived in an outhouse. I did live in twenty

433
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:25,060
many houses growing up yeah. I lived in one rich cool, not at the same day

434
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:31,360
okay, great man money bags over here. What can I say? We just we move into a

435
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,240
house to get bored. We move buying an entire neighbor. Yep, but we did one

436
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,360
time we moved. We moved we lived in one house and then we moved four houses down

437
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,060
and then we moved next door to that house. Yeah, well yeah in like a year

438
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,080
I lived in the same place until I was in college.

439
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:53,080
But like I, for like, I don't remember how long.

440
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
I lived in the same place till after college.

441
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
What was it?

442
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
That's so fire, man.

443
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:04,080
My uncle, I don't know why, he had his own place,

444
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,080
but he got veneers. He got veneers done.

445
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
That's sick.

446
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,080
And then for some reason, my mom put a bed in the living room

447
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,680
that he could recover from the veneers.

448
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,520
- From veneers?

449
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,240
- He laid on the, maybe he got back surgery.

450
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,600
That makes a lot more sense.

451
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,880
- He just had veneers and you thought

452
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,040
that he was recovering from the white teeth?

453
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:26,720
- Yeah, I think that he got veneers at the same time

454
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,180
that he got a back, like a major back surgery.

455
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:32,640
So I, in my little kid brain, I was like,

456
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,400
oh, they must, that must fuck you up.

457
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,440
- That's honestly, I think the scariest part of getting older.

458
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,640
- I wouldn't be surprised if getting veneers fucked you up.

459
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,520
- Oh, it does, it fucks up your whole mouth.

460
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,320
No, it doesn't. Yeah, it does. They put little chicklets in there, Dennis the

461
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,920
Mastiff. Yeah, don't they do? They do Bobby Peru. Yeah, but then you have the

462
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,800
teeth, like it's not gonna... Yeah, but those teeth can rot on the inside of

463
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,640
the veneer. I bet it hurts like shit. Yeah. I don't think it hurts. After you

464
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,500
get them put in. I don't think so. You get a lot of good painkillers. My uncle

465
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,520
was asleep all the time.

466
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:04,820
I would get veneers. I would. I would, but I would not look good with them. My

467
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:08,920
teeth are pretty fucked up, too. Mine are, too. I've fucking cracked my... This

468
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:11,760
tooth is broken right now. Well, you have like five teeth that are rotting out

469
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,320
I have five cavities. How did you know? Because you told me. Yeah, I did tell you. Because

470
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:22,360
you're such a candy man. That's your tie to you. I got candy the other day. I'm so jealous.

471
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,720
I literally can't eat candy, bro. For the first time in probably over a year, I was

472
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,880
craving candy. Something's going on. I bought candy. I bought candy, too. What kind did

473
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,280
you buy? You're buying candy because I told you guys I have cavities and you want to rub

474
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,640
it in my face. I bought Nutella Bueno bars. That's terrible. I don't even know what that

475
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,760
That is a terrible choice. I got myself some Skittles.

476
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
I wanted some Skittles. What kind?

477
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
Skittles. Plain Skittles? Skittles.

478
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,540
Red bag. Red bag Skittles. I eat old lady candy. My favorite candy in the

479
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,460
world

480
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,720
Why don't you give me a side for that? A chocolate covered pomegranate bite.

481
00:26:55,720 --> 00:27:00,440
Shut up. I love those. You know what's really good is those milk candies.

482
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,440
You've said this before and I don't know what you mean. Dove chocolate,

483
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,760
Magnum bars. Oh, Magnum bars are good. Yeah.

484
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,840
that dark chocolate that's real velvety and silky.

485
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,600
- Yeah, I like dark chocolate.

486
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,040
- That like all the ads are like,

487
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,120
it's like a woman in her like early 40s

488
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,680
and she like bites into the peppermint patty and nuts.

489
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,120
- You know these scumbag Europeans

490
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,720
think that Hershey's chocolate bars taste like vomit?

491
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,560
- Really?

492
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,920
- Yeah, because there's lactic acid in it or something.

493
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,520
- They got crazy candy over there.

494
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,240
- 'Cause it's not normal milk chocolate.

495
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:33,040
It's like, you know how Hershey's have like a weird

496
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,480
like kind of sourness to them?

497
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,320
- Yeah.

498
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,620
you know next time you try your buddy. All right, trust me. I know I know you

499
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:45,880
know next time I try her shoes, but I in my head buying a plane just Hershey's

500
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:52,220
bar and is helping it. No eating it and not like cutting it up and putting it

501
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,540
into like cookies or something is the mark of a psycho. I like a planer. It's

502
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:02,060
a psycho. If you don't get the one with the almonds, just the plane, you just

503
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,960
want one with extra flavors. Some people like simplicity. Yeah, but a Hershey's

504
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,880
is better chocolate.

505
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,840
I am refuge and there's way better chocolate that you can get a hustle and

506
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,280
chaos of modern life is a little too much for some Hershey's with almonds.

507
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:18,240
I just want one single bar with 600 ingredients. You literally want to live

508
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,560
in. So we want this factory. Meanwhile, I want to live on a chocolate farm. No,

509
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:24,480
I want to live in Lidz and I want to take care of the chocolate plants. I'm

510
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,000
gonna live in Lidsville and talk to all that. I don't want to live in Lidsville

511
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
and the chocolate animals and also I have a chocolate wife. Yeah, she doesn't

512
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
like when I call her that.

513
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,100
on the

514
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:42,260
oh man, the Lisville in troy on a crazy don't care week. I'll show you after

515
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:46,260
I don't care at all about I'll show you. I'll change the subject completely done.

516
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,600
I'd like to change the subject entirely. Yeah, you got it and actually we're

517
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,000
taking away points. We should have points on the show. Yo, that's a really

518
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,100
things made up in the point. Don't matter for the premium matter a lot.

519
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,200
Okay, all right, we're starting points. Now, okay, you're starting negative.

520
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:04,260
Yeah, can you put like a points board up? I'm starting negative to yeah, you just

521
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:08,260
lost. Why is it negative? You were the first person to have any kind of value

522
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,740
changed. You have to add three counters.

523
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:15,820
Search score counter instead of tally count. Tally count is gonna be one. Yeah,

524
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:19,380
tally count. It's not just me with the counter. Yeah, we'll just start with you

525
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:25,420
for this episode. So you're starting... Get a new, get more. Just search like a

526
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,460
score counter. Why are you doing this weird tabs thing? You're ruining

527
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,620
everything. I'm just joking, but you did just lose points. Yeah, Jubio, oh yeah,

528
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,220
yourself down for

529
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:43,140
okay. The guest is definitely Patrick. Okay, me and care, I guess is Patrick and

530
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,660
Jubio, me and cam. Oh yeah, then I guess it knocked down six points. Okay, and we

531
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,260
are six points. Yeah, why not? Yeah, because Jubio lost four. I just said

532
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,980
that I have to I can't walk it back and so me and Cameron are let's say we get

533
00:29:56,020 --> 00:30:00,220
plus three for coming up to start. Yeah, this is a starter amount. Yeah, yeah,

534
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:03,520
and also yeah, a little bit, you know, yeah, because we need the edge.

535
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:07,820
You guys are so okay. This isn't going to work. A handio isn't accepting taking

536
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:11,020
away his own points. You need to take away. I will take away. I will. I will

537
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,420
gladly take that negative to negative four versus three. Okay, okay, yeah, yeah.

538
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,820
So now that now we have also some incentive to try to be to perform. Yeah,

539
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:24,820
exactly, because most of the time I'm like I don't even want to perform. Don't

540
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,120
zip your lips. No, that's your lips is bad. That's your only way that you can

541
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:32,000
lose because you're down. Yeah, that's true. Me and Cameron could zip our lips

542
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,880
and probably tie this thing up pretty easily. That's not true. We have a giant

543
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,740
lead and there's only nine

544
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:44,900
I would come up with something in nine minutes to talk about. Okay, so you guys

545
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:48,100
are going to be quiet. I'm going to talk for nine minutes. No, no, no, just I'm

546
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:51,180
just saying bring a bring a bring a topic and we can start talking. It can't

547
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,760
it can be Lidsville. It can't be Lidsville. Yeah, I already lost

548
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:58,000
points for Lidsville for bringing back Lidsville, bringing it back. So okay,

549
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,700
what is something? Oh, I found a thing in my notes at the other day,

550
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:08,000
and I don't know if we were trying to prepare a roast battle or something,

551
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:12,800
but it says Caleb is the type of guy who owns a dog because it's illegal for

552
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,000
him to own a slave.

553
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:22,460
that's a that's a negative point. I don't know it didn't work. It didn't work. So

554
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,300
that means it's that means it's no change, but yeah, but yeah, but that's

555
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:29,940
not really doing a roast battle. Don't think we were. I don't think we ever

556
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,620
viewed as a real

557
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:37,100
that's fucking rude. I think that was no. I think it was a roast of me for

558
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:41,020
no that I didn't ask for. I think it was for when you did the distrack

559
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:45,420
because I could the distrack can't rhyme and then I did something different.

560
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:48,900
When we were texting each other wraps last night, yours did not rhyme at all.

561
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:52,880
rhymed in my head. That's what I'm saying. They did not rhyme. I was proud

562
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,200
of mine. Yeah, I liked yours a lot. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm getting into

563
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,100
rapping. I have a

564
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:03,480
I guess we've said it maybe every single episode for the past couple months,

565
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:06,680
but maybe that is our new thing. Is this rapping? Is just getting into

566
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:10,840
and being hip hopping. Well, that's the other thing. Yeah, I can't... Dude,

567
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:15,320
are you kidding me? I can't fucking rap. Have a little confidence in yourself.

568
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,340
The type of rap that my old ass would do. Do you think that Tupac

569
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,740
he got famous by saying I can't rap. I don't know who that is. I only got

570
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:25,900
famous by rapping. I only know Curtis Blow. I only know these guys.

571
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,020
Curtis Blow rapped. Oh wait, was it Curtis Blow that had that song

572
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:33,860
about going to prison? No. Oh wait, the breaks?

573
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:38,300
Yesterday? Is it the breaks where he says, he says... Yesterday? Yesterday,

574
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,140
I had, I just remember this is, this is related to rapping. I just had

575
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,140
sudden kind of urge from beyond and I just had I watched the whole the final

576
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:53,380
rap battle from 8 mile on YouTube. I just and I made my fiancee watch it with me.

577
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,940
She never saw it. Amazing and girls haven't seen it and she didn't get it.

578
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:01,340
That's one of my dad's favorite movies. Dude, I showed my wife. I showed my wife

579
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,020
the 8 mile rap battle. I know something about you. And she was like yeah, that

580
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:07,620
was actually really cool. It's so sick. Yeah, that's why I watched it every day

581
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,580
as a child. Of all time. Did you guys ever see that movie that Eminem made in

582
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,480
like 2017. He's funny and funny. No, no.

583
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,680
There's a movie that he made that is supposed to be the story of Slim Shady

584
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,080
where it's like a kid is writing of a mile. No, no, no, I'm not.

585
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,880
It's the kid from what's that fucking kid named?

586
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,680
The redhead kid with that crazy overbite. He looks super young.

587
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,780
He's always got braces.

588
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:38,780
Fragly. It's not Fragly, but if he was Fragly, he would be an amazing Fragly.

589
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,220
"Fuck, what is that kid in?"

590
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,260
He's got the greasy ass,

591
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,900
- I don't know this kid. - The greasy ass orange hair.

592
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,620
- Tell me about the movie. - But he's the star

593
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,980
and the whole thing is that he is writing his dissertation

594
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,420
on the use of the N-word in rap.

595
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,100
- This is not real. - This is real.

596
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,100
This is a real movie.

597
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,580
He's writing his dissertation

598
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,080
on the use of the N-word in rap

599
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,620
and then he becomes a battle rapper

600
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:04,840
because he just goes to like a battle rap

601
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:07,780
to see like what it's all about.

602
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,460
And then he becomes like,

603
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,860
It's like, "Damn, this boy boy can battle rap."

604
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,600
And the whole movie--

605
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,860
- I bet he's an English major.

606
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,220
- He's an English major, he is.

607
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,340
- He's an English major?

608
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:24,080
- And his dad is a professor, and he is battle rapping,

609
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,220
and then he makes the battle rap really personal

610
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,580
about his mentor, and he makes fun of his daughter

611
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:30,580
for having cystic fibrosis.

612
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,420
- Whoa.

613
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,260
- Yeah, that's too far.

614
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,460
- Yeah, that's too far.

615
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,740
- Even for Slim Shady, that's a lot.

616
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,460
- But you don't know it's Slim Shady

617
00:34:36,460 --> 00:34:37,620
until the end of the movie,

618
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,940
where he's like sleeping on a park bench,

619
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:44,980
and he's like so he ruined his life for rap. He ruined his life rapping. He

620
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:48,740
ruins his life. That is modern day Moby Dick and then and then he's on the

621
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:52,740
bench and then his battle rap goes viral or something and then he's like,

622
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:57,700
I think I know what my new battle rap name is going to be and then needle

623
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:03,500
drop. Hi, my name is what and it's supposed to be. That's what happened to

624
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,300
Slim Shady. That's what it's I don't think so. I think some shady if you

625
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,200
you listen to the music. I think Slim Shady's alter ego was like he was an

626
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:10,700
escaped

627
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,340
elf,

628
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:14,260
mental convict from

629
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:18,860
and his gifts, he didn't want to rap.

630
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:23,780
Some awful things. He says that his stepfather fucked him in the butt.

631
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,140
Relapse, he says that really, and his brain fell out of his skull. My whole

632
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:32,340
fucking brain fell out of my skull. Who is this movie? But speaking of, is it

633
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:36,780
the breaks where Curtis Blow says that you go to prison and and like you,

634
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:40,540
these are the brave, maybe it's not the break. It's something about you,

635
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:46,900
you drop the soap and then no he and you look up say not the, but he says shut

636
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,240
up, but but no, but so what you going to do freaky deaky or what maybe the

637
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,200
sound is called freaky deaky or it could be something like what you're going to

638
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,500
do. So what you going to do a freaky deaky or what? Well, I guess I'll freak

639
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:57,720
you.

640
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,740
What's your decision? What's your decision? I'm waiting.

641
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Are you going to freaky deaky this guy? I'm waiting.

642
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,740
He's waiting.

643
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,740
He's going to wait.

644
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,740
He's going to listen to that song all the time and really laugh until

645
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,740
that's one of those things where you get older

646
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
and you realize how dark it is.

647
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,740
That's true of a lot of Slim Shady lyrics.

648
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,740
That's the craziest part about that

649
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,740
is the beat of that song.

650
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,740
Do you like violence?

651
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,740
I always thought he was saying do you like Primus.

652
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,740
Hi kids,

653
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:28,740
do you like Primus?

654
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,740
But then I thought that the next line was like making fun. I thought it was

655
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,300
supposed to be making fun of nine inch nails. Yeah, nine inch nails and a new

656
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,740
metal crap. Oh, that new metal. This isn't the first time that I've misheard

657
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,640
an Eminem. That's really funny. Hi, kids. Do you like primus? Do you want to see

658
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:47,540
me stick nine inch nails into my eyelids through each one of each one of my

659
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:54,040
eyelids? Eminem has so many fire lines. He does crazy. The Eminem line that

660
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:58,540
made me laugh so hard in high school was in that song as the world turns when

661
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:01,660
and he says when he's in the song, he's saying he's mugging a woman, then he

662
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:04,380
says, plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escape

663
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:13,800
and I always make it lab really hard yeah yeah. What a funny thing to say

664
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:18,880
in your song. He has one song where he says he's raping his own mom. He is a

665
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:23,500
crazy guy, so now I'm oh and any the he says it from the perspective of

666
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:27,540
somebody listening to the song and the line is oh now he's raping his own

667
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:27,980
mother.

668
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:35,420
that's the line. Oh, now he's right. Oh, okay, now it's a to imagine like a

669
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,760
record executive being like yeah, yeah, yes, yeah, this is the stuff man, but

670
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:43,300
you know we're going to be the biggest white rapper in the world. We're going

671
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:46,960
to put a sticker on the thing so people know

672
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:53,120
that he says this kind of crap. Yeah, that's the the coolest shirt you can

673
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:57,560
wear is that sticker, the explicit sticker, I parental advisory, which can

674
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,460
we put that on our cover. It makes me oh yeah, we can we it makes me think that

675
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:05,980
you maybe have cuss words tattooed on your torso. Yep, maybe you have a big

676
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,860
F. U. C. K. On the middle of like two parts. I mean just when I read that

677
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:12,540
shirt, I'm like better watch out if you're gonna buy me. Yep, yep, I might be

678
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:17,220
a bad influence on your kids. Yeah, that's right. You don't want me in the

679
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:23,540
house. You do not want me around. I'm a bad bad. I'm a bad bad guy. That's what

680
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,340
they should do for sex offenders. Just have a shirt that they have to wear that

681
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:32,080
exactly warning warning crazy guy. No yeah, I don't think that's specific

682
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,860
express a person warning, explicit mother fucker, explicit content. That

683
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,420
would be a shirt. That's a Spencer's gift shirt for sure warning, explicit

684
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,660
mother fucker yeah, warning, explicit content with an arrow down to morning,

685
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:44,900
a

686
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,300
and then another one down to your ass. That what it's a bunch of arrows that go

687
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:54,820
all around. Oh yeah, all over my body for here's a shirt idea. It says on in

688
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,280
the front of it. It says my ass and then as an arrow down that goes around to the

689
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,700
back of the

690
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,080
your

691
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:05,360
so somebody sees the shirt and they follow the arrow. Okay, we get three

692
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:09,320
points for that. We get three points right now. That's an amazing, amazing

693
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,400
yeah, yep,

694
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,660
I work for the scoreboard. Yeah, the home team is up on a major way.

695
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:20,020
How much time is left on the clock? Twenty six. Oh my God, we'll restart it.

696
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,300
We'll do it for the whole episodes, whatever, but yeah, just pause the pause

697
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:29,840
the timer. We don't need the timer, but I think that you can even do one where

698
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,080
it's

699
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:36,840
warning, explicit cunt shirt. Yeah, I said that already stealing said cunt

700
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:41,880
stealing minus two points, minus two points, plus two for me. Yeah, I'm sorry.

701
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Wait, minus two and plus two. That's a huge swing. That's a more crazy. Yeah,

702
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,380
we're still pretty. We got a comfortable. I'm fine with this. Yeah, we don't

703
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,060
He's got to play the foul game.

704
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,000
You guys, okay, it's two on one because Jubio doesn't say anything.

705
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,000
It's one on one, y'all.

706
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,080
He's not even contributing even a little bit.

707
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,480
He's just controlling the scoreboard.

708
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,480
I have no help here.

709
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,480
Blame his teammates.

710
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
That's points up.

711
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,480
Blame his teammates.

712
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
That's points up.

713
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:06,480
Allen Iverson vibe.

714
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,800
Allen Iverson, one of the greatest of all time?

715
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,760
Yeah, one of the shortest of all time.

716
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,760
Good.

717
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,200
You probably would think that's good.

718
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,200
That's good.

719
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
That's good for basketball.

720
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm tall.

721
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
He can't switch teams.

722
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,200
Yeah, he can.

723
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,100
you just switch teams. Yeah, you can switch teams with a sign and trade.

724
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:26,740
Okay, I'm going to switch the team to you can't know. We don't want you on

725
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:30,800
our team. Yeah, we're not buying your defensive liability, not a defensive

726
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,260
like you're a one way player, a one way player. Yeah, you only play offense.

727
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:39,360
That's true. You are offensive. Yeah, exactly and you're getting a warning

728
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,460
explicit mother fucker. You're catching technical fouls here and there. You're

729
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:45,780
going to get ejected man. I'm not going to get ejected. I think I'll probably

730
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,480
first day when I was at the hotel that I was at a week ago or less than a week

731
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,840
ago and the pool that we swam in the hotel pool. We were swimming in it and

732
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:58,220
then we noticed that there is a sign. So you know the sign that they have for the

733
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,960
rules of the pool next to it. There was a sheet of paper that was taped up on

734
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,400
the wall. Just a sheet of printer paper with printed out and it said it said it

735
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,440
said on it. It is prohibited

736
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:15,440
to it is prohibited to expel feces in the pool. Wow, I think that's

737
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
It should be an unwritten rule.

738
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,440
It was taped up next to, well that's what I'm saying.

739
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
We're currently swimming in the pool.

740
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:23,440
You notice that they had to put up a sign that said don't poop in this pool.

741
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Somebody watched Air Bud before they made that pool.

742
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
How would that make sense?

743
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,440
There's no rule against it.

744
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
There's a dog named poop going in the pool.

745
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
Oh, there's no rule in the rule book that says you can't expel feces in the pool.

746
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,440
Yeah, exactly.

747
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,440
So they were like let's put it in the rule book.

748
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah.

749
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
That's a scary thing to see when you're swimming in a pool.

750
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
When I'm in the pool with my mouth open.

751
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,320
that's the rules. Is this a hotel? I just don't like the idea that they had to

752
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:52,520
put the the rule on their foot. Yeah, it was happening. It happens even one

753
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,600
time, because also let's be real. Also, how long is a piece of paper staying up

754
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,360
in a humid pool room? Yeah, right that had to be fresh true. Someone has it

755
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,000
wasn't laminated. It was not laminated. It was a piece of paper taped up man.

756
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,800
Probably should not have a thing to say him in that I was already swimming in

757
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,880
and then we were in the hot tub and an old man came over. He said mind if I

758
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,000
turn this thing up and he did and then he didn't get in.

759
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,240
That was a I think you encountered a witch.

760
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,680
I was kind of a

761
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,800
over

762
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,720
the jets and then he and then he just was spring of rosemary. He's looking

763
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:32,480
from behind one of those little trees that they have in there and he's like

764
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,200
all these

765
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:39,700
you don't even know that there's not water. That's all for us. Just a good

766
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,760
general guys in mind. If I turn this thing up pretty funny

767
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:47,320
one time, I think the first boob I ever saw in real life was in a hot tub yeah

768
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:51,000
and because some lady she like went under and out. It was like a lady and

769
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,300
her boyfriend. We were in Myrtle Beach, me and my little brother. Come on

770
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,400
come

771
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:00,020
on friendly fire. That's friendly fire. How do we decide that

772
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,720
plus two points minus two points?

773
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,480
you know a lady with she went under into the hot tub and then came back up and

774
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,200
her. Why would she go under? How far did she go? Yeah, she just like went under

775
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,020
real quick came up with enough force. I don't know. I made no sense, but both of

776
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,900
her boobs fell out and then me and my brother, we just looked away yeah and we

777
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:25,880
had been like talking to them and then they were like they were kind of like

778
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,200
weirded out that we were just looking away and they were still trying to talk

779
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,180
to me and then her boyfriend noticed that her both of her giant boobs were

780
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:36,660
out and then they just started laughing and I was like you're laughing. That's

781
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,340
funny you scar you think that's funny that I had to see your giant guard a

782
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:40,780
family

783
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,140
literally are never going to be

784
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,900
great same way. Ever we're both gay now. Thank you so so much. We're so

785
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,100
disgusting yeah and we're gay with each other, which is a legal yeah. So we're

786
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:56,020
brothers, we're a day with each other. I'm going to jail. We're going to jail,

787
00:43:56,020 --> 00:44:00,020
but it was it was crazy man. That's pretty crazy. What yeah you who's going

788
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:03,660
under in a hot tub anyway, but I don't think I don't think I would. I think I

789
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,680
was eleven or twelve. I don't think I would do anything any differently. Now I

790
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,340
don't think I would feel ever comfortable. Are you can I be screaming

791
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:10,760
going like

792
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,820
excuse me? I'd be like your things, your whatever's are out

793
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:21,080
your balloons are out. Your thingies are floating. Hey lady, your balloons

794
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:23,280
just oh my God, they're huge. The worst part

795
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,700
shout to self, those things are gigantic. Oh, wow, huge. You know what I do hate

796
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:41,260
is when you, oh nothing, you're in the hot tub and like you just, you're already

797
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,020
in there, then two other like old people come in, they're just very friendly. I

798
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:50,280
love being in water with oldies. I don't. Being in the pool with the oldies,

799
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:54,300
being in the hot tub with the oldies. I'm spiritually so old, I just, I do not,

800
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,660
I don't fuck with old people. When I was a kid, I used to put my head under and

801
00:44:58,680 --> 00:45:02,580
put it on top in front of one of the jets in the hot tub and just see how long I

802
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:06,320
could hold my breath and it felt like I was getting high. Yeah, yeah, you're

803
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:10,520
sucking in all that toe fungus. I just put my face directly into the jet. I was

804
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:14,380
letting my whole body when I was I was never somebody who put the jet on my

805
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,260
butt. I don't like that. I haven't done that before ever in my life. Once I did

806
00:45:18,260 --> 00:45:21,980
it one time, I did it. I did it one time, but I did it a few times. The thing is

807
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:25,780
no matter how warm the water is, once it's in your body, it feels cold. Yeah,

808
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,400
so once it's in your asshole, the worst is when it goes. I will say after this

809
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:34,720
mysterious old man turned it up. These were some forceful jets. I think I would

810
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,080
I think I could have blasted my guts out my rib and the skin off yeah. I think I

811
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,360
could have ever had their whole intestine destroyed by a jacuzzi jet or

812
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:48,080
is that just a thousand way to die? A book yeah, it's a it's a Chuck Palah. I

813
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:52,520
thought that was a thousand to die guts probably also did it on a thousand ways

814
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:57,260
and yeah, I mean they don't think that those are real death. We've we've

815
00:45:57,260 --> 00:46:00,460
definitely talked about how they aren't real desk because there's no way that

816
00:46:00,460 --> 00:46:03,300
all of those people, I was actually just thinking about it. Did you guys ever

817
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,260
read the Darwin Awards? When yeah yeah, they had a Darwin Awards book in my

818
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:11,320
middle, so I didn't read it, but my mom would sometimes watch people on the

819
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:16,080
news. They are so I remember really the one that I read. I like read the book,

820
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:19,480
because it was somebody like it was in the classroom, and I would just read it,

821
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,960
and I read one that stuck in me forever that I fully under percent believed was

822
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,560
real when I was reading it in like fifth grade, and this is the craziest that

823
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,840
this is insane that they put this in a book, a Darwin Awards book, but there

824
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,680
was a story that this baby slept on his back

825
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,600
man and a woman were camping and they were having sex and then the lightning

826
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:44,200
bolt struck them and they got stuck together and then a bear ate the girl

827
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:47,200
and the guy had to crawl for help. While she was, they were attached together,

828
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,240
he believed this. I believed it a hundred percent. I was like I was like

829
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,320
either by like all the other things are like a guy was hang gliding and he fell

830
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,920
down to the ground and he died and I was like well, they wouldn't put this in the

831
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:01,120
book. If it wasn't real, these dark these Darwin Awards, I don't think any of

832
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,920
them are real. The committee is living the most boring life ever. They won't go

833
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:08,560
rock climbing. Yeah, they won't do anything. They won't even tie out zip tie

834
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,520
to their penis. They won't jaywalk. They won't have sex in a tent. Yeah, I would

835
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,360
hate to be one of the other one that I remember is because it was like you know

836
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:18,900
it's like oh either die or you make yourself unable to reproduce. Here's a

837
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:22,360
guy. I want to make his dick look big, so he tied a roll of quarters to it and it

838
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:25,520
cut off all the blood flow and they had to amputate it. Here's a Darwin award. I

839
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:29,040
would like all of quarters to it. Exactly. This stuff isn't real. It can't

840
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:29,280
be

841
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,220
Darwin from wild thorn berries. I'd like to see the words he gives out. We call

842
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:39,240
the bananas. He's the monkey. He's not a monkey. He's a human. He's a monkey.

843
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:42,680
Darwin's a monkey. Oh, there was a talking monkey human monkey. That's

844
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,080
that's his name like saying or something. Isn't that the wedgie dance? Yeah, I

845
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,680
know you're talking about in the Tarzan. Yeah, isn't he not even Donny Donny?

846
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,200
He's not even one of the he's not even like the he's a boy that this show this.

847
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,680
I hated the show and I felt it made me feel uncomfortable because of this

848
00:48:00,680 --> 00:48:05,600
character Donny. This guy, if this guy should be killed, I knew a couple of

849
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,480
Donny's growing up to you that were uncomfortable by a boy who just lived

850
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:14,220
his life. No, they kidnap him from somewhere. They find him in the woods.

851
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,780
That's what I'm saying. He's already wearing. It's not a kidnap. That's a

852
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,120
that's a discovery. He's half naked and he licks his foot.

853
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,340
And this clearly has some kind of developmental

854
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,060
his developmental disability is that he was raised by

855
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,160
that's true and Z's, but I don't think chimpanzees lick their feet.

856
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,640
Chimpanzees lick their feet. Also, chimpanzees have have they have the

857
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:42,040
the freest life they do whatever the hell they want to kill each other. They

858
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:45,420
kill each other, kill each other, because they live others babies. This

859
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,720
guy, this guy, they're hanging with chimpanzee. There are some people who

860
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:53,440
kill each other and eat their babies. Do you guys think this guy wears pants

861
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,680
yeah because they wouldn't show a cartoon child penis on the show? Why

862
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:02,040
not because of the if it wants to be accurate to the chimpanzee, you want to

863
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:05,360
see a child's penis? No, but I'm interested in science. He's interested

864
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,480
accurate so that I don't mean this children don't think that chimpanzees

865
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,400
wear pants chimpanzees.

866
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,720
I'm thinking this is at least a point.

867
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,040
Chimpanzees don't wear pants on the show. Darwin wears pants on the show.

868
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:20,080
I think the other chimpanzees wear pants. I don't I don't think they had

869
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:23,600
chimpanzees other than Darwin. They'd had a million. I just think it's kind

870
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:28,560
of rude personally to the human race to be having a chimpanzee that can speak

871
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:33,080
English and a human that can't a human that there's way more. There's way

872
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,320
are humans and he says he had a buggy.

873
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:41,020
Okay, this is something you should Darwin after the guy who

874
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:45,320
discovered that he turned into himself. Yeah point.

875
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,920
I'm trying to puzzle this out.

876
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:53,020
They made him Darwin, which is the guy who said the monkeys

877
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:56,220
are humans and they need they named was Darwin supposed to be

878
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,120
the missing link.

879
00:49:57,120 --> 00:50:01,320
We need a gritty reboot of where the wild thornberry.

880
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:05,720
Yeah, where Mr. Thornberry is he just straight up is kidnapping the kid.

881
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:07,620
Yeah, it's about colonialism.

882
00:50:07,620 --> 00:50:08,420
Holy.

883
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:08,920
Yeah, exactly.

884
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:12,220
It takes place in like the like 1600s or something.

885
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,020
Yeah, and well, then how would they have a TV show?

886
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:18,620
The whole point of the wild Thornberry is that they have a TV show.

887
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,820
They're writing a play.

888
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:20,420
Okay.

889
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,120
Yeah.

890
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,620
Oh, they're traveling play.

891
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:23,920
They're a traveling troop.

892
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:25,220
A mummer's troop.

893
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:25,920
Yeah, exactly.

894
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:26,420
And they mum.

895
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:27,520
What's a mummer's troop?

896
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,420
Somebody is not well-versed in the bard.

897
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,520
Yeah, minus one point.

898
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,360
my Marie no Bard info no Bard knowledge. I'm giving a shit about the low Bard

899
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:40,200
not I don't give a shit about the bar. You better chill okay. They are a

900
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:40,640
Bard.

901
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,520
I'm not going to even buzz you for that because you know what you did. I like I

902
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:50,280
like flipping you off. You like flipping off Bard. I like flipping off. He

903
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,440
doesn't even know who the bar. How many Shakespeare

904
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:55,280
yeah, that's who the Bard is

905
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,920
what

906
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,220
All right, point, I guess. You played the song.

907
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:05,360
I don't think Shakespeare was so much of it. Shakespeare was the bard.

908
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:07,560
Shakespeare didn't even... Shakespeare was the bard. No, he didn't even exist.

909
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,760
The name "the bard" means Shakespeare. No, what I'm saying is that he didn't

910
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,600
even exist. So he was not the bard. Oh, he was a group of people?

911
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:16,520
No, he didn't even exist, period. He was... He's... All that shit was written

912
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:21,180
by the pope. No. The pope. That's my theory. That's a minus point for you

913
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:25,040
for being religious. Conspiratorial thinking. That's kind of random. Yeah,

914
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,420
you're being random. No, no, no. Or somebody, I don't know who wrote it,

915
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:32,120
but it wasn't Shakespeare. He didn't exist. He existed. Did you ever read

916
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:35,320
that thing that was like every time Shakespeare signed his name, he signed it

917
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:38,200
differently? Have you ever seen that every time he signed his name? He signed

918
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,660
it differently, and one of the times that he signed his name, he wrote William

919
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:41,400
Shake Staff.

920
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:47,100
See, the guys didn't even know who they were. These guys didn't even know who

921
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,700
they were doing. Also, I love the

922
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:53,300
shake. What was it? I love the idea that if it was three guys, it would be any

923
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:56,660
less impressive that he that all these amazing plays.

924
00:51:56,660 --> 00:52:02,260
I signed my name different every single time the barista turns one of those fucking iPads.

925
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,460
Oh, Shakespeare must have worked at Starbucks!

926
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,460
Yeah!

927
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,460
[applause]

928
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,460
Which yo bitch ass?

929
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:08,460
Shakespeare.

930
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:09,460
He worked at Starbucks.

931
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:18,460
He worked at Starbucks and he was writing people's names on them.

932
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,860
Yep, his own damn name.

933
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:24,380
And they flipped that thing over, that iPad, and I got a sign for using my card.

934
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,740
I'm straight line.

935
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:31,180
Yeah, 0% straight line. No tip. When I was, I was at the grocery store and I

936
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,740
had to sign my name after use my credit card and I signed it and the

937
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:37,500
the enter button wasn't working and I was like, oh, the enter button's not

938
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,860
working and she was like, okay, and she cleared it and then she signed it

939
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:46,100
and pressed enter. And I wanted to say, I'm calling the police. I saw what

940
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,700
you did. I'm not paying. Oh, you wanna pay for it? Yeah. Did she do it?

941
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,860
Did she try to report fraud right now? Yeah. Did she try to do a

942
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,820
her signature or did she just did she basically what I do it, which is just

943
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:01,500
as what if she wrote Cameron Fetter? What if she wrote your full that would be

944
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,480
scary because I don't know how she would know my name that quick from the card

945
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,540
info that can you get away with that by by claiming insurance for credit card

946
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,780
fraud? If you just sign something like bug or something, I think in the era

947
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:18,340
before CCTV, I bet people were doing that every day. Yeah, it makes sense.

948
00:53:18,340 --> 00:53:21,080
That's what I that's also back in the day. You could go into a grocery store

949
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:25,360
you could be like put it on Kevin's tab. Yeah, five hundred dollars of

950
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,560
bring back tabs right now. They have we need to have the stores, though

951
00:53:29,560 --> 00:53:33,920
they have everywhere you can. You can just like leave your card at a bar

952
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:34,720
and then just like

953
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:39,720
not with a card and also at stores. Okay, you should be able to start a

954
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,440
tab at a bar before credit cards, you leave and then just fucking see it.

955
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,440
It's not yeah, it's not like a tab you pay at the end of the

956
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:49,000
night. Yeah, because I want to say put it on my tab so bad,

957
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,260
but not have still say it, but there's like you're actually paying for yeah

958
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:57,200
you're paying for in the moment. Yeah, you know what there's a bar and if you

959
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,320
leave they charge twenty percent. Well, it used to be also that if you tried to

960
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,120
move towns, you would probably die in the process. Yeah, so that's kind of the

961
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,960
insurance against it. I guess if this guy wants to move and skip towns, he's

962
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:13,900
gonna be eaten by a snake. Yeah, there's a bar downtown, a bar downtown, not a

963
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:17,760
bard, a bard down under the ground, but I think many I think many of a bards

964
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,800
they have have

965
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,640
gotten drinks there. There's a bar where they didn't realize they still had

966
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,840
after pay

967
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:31,720
like you have to pay it. No, I think Ben did, though, but you think you bought

968
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:32,820
like two drinks and

969
00:54:32,820 --> 00:54:38,800
why would they have it? I don't know. I don't know why they have it. Yeah, they

970
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:43,080
say after pay. They had after pay set up on the thing, so he's paying like a

971
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:48,680
$1.25 every two weeks for like drinks. He got one that's not that crazy because

972
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:54,400
you have no pants and stuff. That's not that true. I was after pay for sure

973
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:57,000
and sure in a pair of shoes that I'm wearing shoes.

974
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,380
You after paid for those yeah. Oh my God after pay, you know if you have your

975
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:07,020
base amazing, it's better because if you die, then you had more money when you

976
00:55:07,020 --> 00:55:09,000
died exactly yeah, yeah,

977
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:13,200
take that when you die, the number that they print on your gravestone is a

978
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:16,840
little higher. Yeah, we should be after paying everything dude after pay is

979
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:20,240
incredible. You should be able to I think you can after pay groceries. I

980
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:23,240
think you can after pay basically everything. Yeah, well, I mean, I guess

981
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:26,320
a credit card is just after pay isn't it? Yeah, yeah, basically the same

982
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:31,000
thing you do you have to get approved for after pay now wow zero percent apr

983
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:35,200
wait, there's no interest. Yeah, it must that doesn't make any more or the

984
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:38,720
just paying like you're still paying the whole thing. It's just over the

985
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:41,520
course of there has to be, but it must go through their system. Maybe there's

986
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,020
some interest or something. I don't know. They have a PayPal style. Look, I

987
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:49,280
just saw the word zero percent APR and I was like, fuck it. I'll do that. And

988
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:53,960
you saw that little star next to zero percent APR. That means yay. Yes, I love

989
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:57,240
that little star star. Every single every single thing.

990
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:03,640
Deal paid every single thing. I've ever sparkling deal after paid or clarnoed

991
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,160
has been paid off. Klarna is another thing that you pay an installment. What

992
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:12,080
is that one of these new streaming services? No, it's one point. It's not a

993
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:12,480
point.

994
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:19,960
I know why he said it. Not you. Yeah, it was made me look fucking. We all left.

995
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,480
We all laughed so hard that we all left at that. It's not a streaming service.

996
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:30,880
We know that now. Okay, Mr. Okay, okay. What a service was. We are. I've

997
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:34,520
already explained the service. I think you might be a sociopath who hates fun

998
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,920
in the service. I don't point I don't impression. I don't hate fun. You hate

999
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:43,160
fun so much, which is you guys wear me seven points. You guys wear me down till

1000
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,480
I would like to wear your skin point. Honestly, if I could crawl inside you

1001
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:52,480
and live in there like a city, I would build the most glorious monument to my

1002
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,560
love for you. I don't think you do what

1003
00:56:54,560 --> 00:57:00,080
he said. He didn't think I do. I was microscopic. I would build something out

1004
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,720
of the plaque on your tongue. I would build a shrine to I would live inside of

1005
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,160
and I would my job would be I would be one of the seven dwarves and I'd go into a

1006
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,960
tunnel inside your kidney stone and I'd be mining in there. Yeah, and I get

1007
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:17,160
beautiful gems and where okay point to where on his body you want to live 321.

1008
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:21,560
What are you pointing to his elbow? I'm pointing to this inside his body in

1009
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,460
general. I want to be in one of his organs that's in the stomach area. I'm

1010
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,360
just I'm just letting this roll. I think his elbow it would be scraped by

1011
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:47,160
I'm worried I got psoriasis. Yeah, my grandpa had it. Could be diet. No, it just happens.

1012
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:53,080
Could be genetic, could be diet. I think my grandpa had psoriasis. Doesn't matter at all.

1013
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:57,720
if I buddy if my skin starts flaking off like a like a that's happened in my head

1014
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:02,160
yeah remember when I had a scale a reptilian I remember when you had a you

1015
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,240
had a reptile thing going on for a little bit that's what I'm saying it

1016
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,680
just happens then it doesn't have I still go to the reptile Expo in

1017
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,520
Manchester yeah I still want to go to that they have it all over they probably

1018
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:14,760
have one in New York yeah in fact I know for a fact they do and it's probably in

1019
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:18,240
the next couple months true it's the best climate usually in August I think

1020
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:23,380
sometimes I feel like I'm already in a wreck. I would love to go. A raccoon is

1021
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,640
not a reptile. I didn't finish what I was saying because you said raccoon. I was

1022
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,280
going to say I feel like I'm in a reptile exhibit sometimes when I'm with

1023
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,600
you guys, because you're both fucking snakes backstabbing me and biting my

1024
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,540
ankles. No, I'm a lizard more than a snake. Yeah, both of you Komodo dragon.

1025
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:41,840
Both of you are spineless animals. Spines have snakes and on them. Yeah,

1026
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,260
snakes. So you're something then you're in Octo. Maybe I can take an eel. You

1027
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,680
you guys did not see this octopus video that me and you be a saw. I did what

1028
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:53,520
happened to be a you pull up the octopus video. You showed me the octopus video.

1029
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:57,280
What was in the you need to see this? I got a video sound everybody who is

1030
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:01,320
listening. Pull this up. Don't tell me he goes into a quarter or something. No,

1031
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:05,360
it's an I love when they do that. It's an octopus. Don't say anything about it.

1032
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:09,440
That don't just let just seriously don't spoil his points because the way we

1033
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,360
saw this video, this video fully caught us completely off guard. This is the most

1034
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:19,480
the greatest video I've ever seen in my entire life. Amazing by young easy

1035
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:25,680
amazing, I think some grazed back by someone else in that sashimi. Oh, no,

1036
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:31,440
just no, just wait, just wait for this video giant octopus. Okay, and I think

1037
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,980
it's around five minutes. Yeah, it's really good. Okay, all right, I'll watch

1038
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:40,000
this. I mean the clip is so you're in charge of of describing what this is.

1039
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:44,280
okay, so it's well the sound and this is really important. So honestly, I just

1040
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,480
want everybody to hear the sound and I'll describe it afterwards. Okay, that

1041
00:59:47,480 --> 00:59:50,480
looks like all the way up all the way up. It looks like a butthole. Okay,

1042
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,480
now watch here,

1043
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:56,500
it's coming out of the computer to be it's coming out of the computer. Yeah,

1044
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,520
wait, change the output

1045
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:59,400
is a great

1046
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:04,680
okay. This is here we go. Okay, now I can hear it all right. So he's got this

1047
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,240
octopus, so he just boiled very large. He's about to cut it up. It's a giant

1048
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:12,980
octopus. Oh, thank God of the aliens man. Look at that. That's his penis right

1049
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:16,340
there under its head. No, that's it. That's his mouth. That's not his mouth.

1050
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:17,960
You have never played

1051
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:24,040
dad. Oh God. I hate when they get cut. Watch this part now. Watch silently.

1052
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,360
what we just saw is a sushi chef cut an octopus and a jizzed into its own by

1053
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:43,240
it's not jizz

1054
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:50,700
directly into his own butthole yeah and then the chef puts his two fingers into

1055
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:51,240
the but

1056
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:53,860
my God

1057
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:59,760
and then the but pro lapses a little piece of black squid. I do not like

1058
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,340
the other said no. It

1059
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:05,680
we were just watching a bunch of recipe videos and that just happened and none

1060
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,920
of the comments mentioned at all. There's one comment that links the

1061
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,840
timestamp and that's it no it's completely it's so insane. The craziest

1062
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,820
thing I've ever seen in my life and I mean imagine if you got killed and

1063
01:01:16,820 --> 01:01:22,320
somebody made you your dead body jizz into your butt that happens. It doesn't

1064
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:26,040
happen that happens. You release every single fluid in your body. I don't think

1065
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:28,800
you release jizz yeah the way I'm going to die

1066
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:36,300
David Carradine probably did. This guy made him do it. Oh, he was dead for a

1067
01:01:36,300 --> 01:01:39,100
while. This is honestly one of the worst videos I've ever seen.

1068
01:01:39,100 --> 01:01:43,100
This is the best octopus in Peter North. But his flesh is cut. Yeah. And he

1069
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:47,900
probably still - an octopus never dies. Yeah. The thing of an elephant never

1070
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:54,900
forgets. Ah, shit. Yeah. That's pretty cool, actually. Octopus can't be one of

1071
01:01:54,900 --> 01:02:01,300
God's creatures. No, the devil made that thing. Did you guys see the documentary

1072
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:04,900
My Octopus Teacher? No. Is that the one where the guy fell in love with the octopus?

1073
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:08,500
The guy fucks the octopus. He doesn't fuck him, he just thinks he's beautiful.

1074
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:12,500
Octopuses are pretty insane. They're crazy. They're amazing. They're very

1075
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:16,100
incredible. They really are. They're from another planet. Some people say that

1076
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:20,300
they did come here on an asteroid. I believe that. I believe that. There's no

1077
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:21,000
no way

1078
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:28,100
no way in my favorite, my favorite like Facebook fake news type articles that

1079
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,500
I've seen is like it was an article. It was an all capitalist. It scientists

1080
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:36,940
confirm that octopuses are ninety eight percent aily. It's true, it's true, it's

1081
01:02:36,940 --> 01:02:40,620
got to be came here on a meteor yeah, that's what I heard. I heard they

1082
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:45,140
landed in a ship. They probably had a hard time controlling it because their

1083
01:02:45,140 --> 01:02:49,020
arms go willy nilly. Yeah, it's a scientific. Did you know that I so I

1084
01:02:49,060 --> 01:02:52,260
lift up octopus jizz after I watched that video. I watch it about a hundred

1085
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:56,100
times. Do you know the way that octopuses fuck? Yeah, a male has a

1086
01:02:56,100 --> 01:03:00,240
special arm. What is one of his arms? He's got eight of them, but he has one

1087
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:03,420
special one that he just wait. That's his plus one or seven. No, it's a

1088
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:06,460
seven. Okay, so it's well, it's just an arm, but it just also has this

1089
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:10,820
function where he it's his penis arm, I guess, and he just sticks it inside of

1090
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:14,660
the female's brain. That is what we should be doing. He just puts it.

1091
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:18,100
There's a diagram of it and he just puts it up into her and then the sperms come

1092
01:03:18,140 --> 01:03:24,300
of his hand saluting him. He's doing he's doing Heil into his head. You're trying

1093
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:27,460
to do this into your skull. You're not trying to do this. You were doing. I'm

1094
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:30,420
trying to do this. Maybe that's where they got it. Maybe that's where they got

1095
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:35,220
the arm from. That makes sense. They were fucking weird. They tried to find the

1096
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:39,380
isn't that their logo. They should do a Monty Python and the Holy Grail thing

1097
01:03:39,380 --> 01:03:43,060
about the Nazis doing that. Yeah. Isn't that the Nazis logo, though? It's a

1098
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,060
the rangers of the lost ark.

1099
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,060
Red with black squid on it.

1100
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:46,060
Yeah, it's a black squid.

1101
01:03:46,060 --> 01:03:47,060
Yeah.

1102
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:51,060
That's their famous logo, is a red with a black squid.

1103
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,060
All right, this thing made me have to pee.

1104
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:53,060
We have to end.

1105
01:03:53,060 --> 01:03:54,060
We have to end?

1106
01:03:54,060 --> 01:03:55,060
We have to end?

1107
01:03:55,060 --> 01:03:56,060
We have to done?

1108
01:03:56,060 --> 01:03:57,060
Can we keep going?

1109
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,060
You can go pee.

1110
01:03:58,060 --> 01:03:59,060
Okay, I'm going to go pee.

1111
01:03:59,060 --> 01:04:00,060
We're busy.

1112
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,060
We're busy talking about octopuses.

1113
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:02,060
Go, feel free.

1114
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,060
I don't care.

1115
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:04,060
Yeah, Caleb loses points for having to go pee.

1116
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:07,060
That sucks that it wasn't individual points.

1117
01:04:07,060 --> 01:04:12,060
I also found this article about a squid that impregnated a woman's mouth.

1118
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:16,720
his mouth. When she was eating it, it was cooked, but then it's a giant sperms got

1119
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,320
embedded into her mouth. Wait, how did it? How did the mouth get pregnant? It

1120
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:25,980
just has a living inquire, a story. No, it was on ABC News. Oh woman's mouth

1121
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:27,680
falls pregnant to twelve square.

1122
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:34,280
Oh, she was sixty three. She's already old and now she's got a fucking. She was

1123
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,280
chewing sperm sacks, which forcefully shoot sperm. That was her first mistake

1124
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,260
sperm in turn, try to embed themselves when they land, but yeah, she just ate

1125
01:04:43,260 --> 01:04:47,260
what is it look like? Did they show her mouth? They don't show it now. That's

1126
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:51,160
the most interesting part. I don't think that I think that looks amazing, though

1127
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:54,700
that does that's what she was eating that calamari. No, she was eating eastern

1128
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:59,660
calamari, but it says western calamari fans need not worry. The things they do

1129
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:01,600
in the east are a mystery to me.

1130
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:07,960
See the comments here. How much did the meal cost her six squid? LL get it from

1131
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:12,240
get a six squid. Oh, I get happy seven seven seven comments. That's

1132
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,000
disgusting.

1133
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:17,540
This is what people do in the UK. All the parasites from raw fish as well

1134
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:22,380
sickening. What is what a load of rubbish from J B? What a load of

1135
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:22,880
rubbish

1136
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,580
yeah

1137
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:30,580
the this, but this happens, I guess a squids and sperms live on after it's

1138
01:05:30,580 --> 01:05:35,880
been cooked. Oh man yeah, I don't fuck with squids. I think it's good to eat

1139
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:41,600
them. I think it's very, very good. A very good is a delectable, maybe my favorite seafood.

1140
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:47,280
Really? Honestly, I don't like a lot of them, right? You like, I like it all. I eat sushi.

1141
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:53,400
I eat a lot of sushi. Actually, you know, rich ass motherfucker here. I eat the sushi sucks.

1142
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:58,000
Cheap sushi. You've already tried to say this. You're just trying to tank your score. Sushi

1143
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,080
is shit. You're trying to take your score. So I don't care. I've had all levels of sushi

1144
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:05,680
at all level zero still up.

1145
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:08,880
Still up by eight points. Patrick.

1146
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,680
I do. She

1147
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:13,380
levels and one to a hundred.

1148
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:14,380
You're not had

1149
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,680
level 100.

1150
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:18,380
None of us have had love.

1151
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:22,080
I have had I've had Harris Teeter sushi from the grocery store and I've had

1152
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:24,980
sushi from some of the greatest master chefs in the right.

1153
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,180
Have you ever had sushi from the gas station?

1154
01:06:28,180 --> 01:06:29,880
I've had sushi the other day.

1155
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,880
I had sushi was a sumo.

1156
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:37,280
the hell a wall green sushi bragging. I am bragging, Paul Green Sushi is

1157
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:41,120
terrible. That is level two. I was level fifty. There was

1158
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:48,600
there was a gas station in I think yeah around Laconia, where I or I went to

1159
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:54,200
community college and my roommate would come home with sushi from there all the

1160
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:59,400
time and he was like yeah, it's fine. It's like good sushi. It's not and I

1161
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:03,980
know I don't know what they were doing with this gas station I think one of the

1162
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:07,380
ingredients on it was like some I think there's one of the ingredients like to

1163
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:11,200
keep the sushi red was like because it was like sushi with like a list of

1164
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:15,620
ingredients that was way too long well they got all the station food yeah to

1165
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:21,060
preserve that sushi there's no way that gas station sushi isn't cooked I do

1166
01:07:21,060 --> 01:07:27,740
think that sushi it doesn't I can't imagine it being safe to eat it depends

1167
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:31,420
done, which I know it's completely safe to eat and I'm sure it depends, but it

1168
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:34,700
just doesn't seem right. You know what I'm gonna think that's like. I think in

1169
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:38,260
a way, if I didn't know about sushi existing sushi or fish is maybe the

1170
01:07:38,260 --> 01:07:42,100
little meat. I would not want to eat raw. Hold on. Hold on all of them. Let

1171
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:47,580
me let me just say let me I meant that I got a I got a I forgot to apologize to

1196
01:09:03,660 --> 01:09:08,000
group chat is in the group show. I don't I saw this. You sent a photo you sent a

1197
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:11,660
reference for Joe. My Joe my way also if we're getting into this, I need my

photos to be shown and I need I need to get some I need to get some there's my

1199
01:09:15,500 --> 01:09:15,940
photo.

1200
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:20,900
That's a nice photo. One of my best photos. So look at show the photo that I

1201
01:09:20,940 --> 01:09:25,740
sent my girlfriend said she needed a and now read what you said. No, no, no, no

1202
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:30,460
explanation. Just I need a better photo with your hair cam with my hair. Okay.

1203
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,940
Now what did Cameron send? I okay. I said that because my girlfriend told me

1204
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:38,580
show the photo that Cameron said it's just a photo of his hair, but you know

1205
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:41,100
why? Because he's following orders because my hair was already in the first

1206
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:45,020
fucking photo and I'm not I'm not a model for you. Not a model for me. It's

1207
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:48,220
a model for somebody who's who's drawing a picture of you and they're trying to

1208
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,980
make you look amazing. So they were here looked great in that picture. It's

1209
01:09:50,980 --> 01:09:55,580
fine. Why are you being such a baby? I wasn't being the baby. You are a baby.

1210
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:58,980
I wasn't being a baby. I was I was you think the person drawing it was being a

1211
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:03,100
baby. No, I think that they were trying to be exact, and I think that they were

1212
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:03,860
trying to be

1213
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:06,220
they could have

1214
01:10:06,220 --> 01:10:11,020
exactly what the fucking photo was, which is he had his hair exactly in the

1215
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:15,820
photo, exactly the way my hair is, and let me just say I don't want to. I'm not

1216
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:20,860
I'm not going to bring this. I'm not going to bring this feud any further past

1217
01:10:20,860 --> 01:10:25,060
today because I think it's silly, but I was very offended. You were offended. I

1218
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:28,820
was offended. Yeah. This was a horrible apology, Patrick. This is a horrible

1219
01:10:28,820 --> 01:10:32,980
apology. How is this a horrible apology? I was apologizing to Jubio. You only

1220
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:36,060
made it worse. I was apologizing to Jubio and then somehow I've made it,

1221
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:40,020
I've made Cameron upset. Because you think I don't have hair. It's not that I

1222
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,180
think that you don't have hair. Just the question was, can you ask him for a

1223
01:10:44,180 --> 01:10:50,220
better photo where I can see all of his hair, all of his hair. You said Mo like

1224
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:52,140
you were going to say Mohawk. Mo is my cat.

1225
01:10:52,140 --> 01:10:59,380
It's a different guy. I still am not allowed to get a Mohawk really divorce

1226
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:04,740
divorce, divorce, take that ring back, instant divorce right now. Did I tell

1227
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:09,780
you that I already tell the ring story? No, okay, this will be four point,

1228
01:11:10,820 --> 01:11:16,660
end point. This will close on this. So I got my girlfriend a ring that was, well my

1229
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:20,180
fiancee a ring, that was from our family safe deposit box. It's like a family

1230
01:11:20,180 --> 01:11:26,380
heirloom and we had to go get it appraised so we could get it insured, you know, and it's

1231
01:11:26,380 --> 01:11:30,260
it's like an opal ring, not like a diamond ring, so nothing so fancy, but we

1232
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:33,180
said we took, we had to take a picture of it, like we were making an appointment

1233
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:36,980
with this this jeweler to get it appraised. We took a picture of it and

1234
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:39,660
like emailed it to this person like, "Hey, can we come in and get this ring appraised?"

1235
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:44,860
praise and this jeweler guy responded and he's like he said honestly just

1236
01:11:44,860 --> 01:11:48,560
looking at this ring. It's not even worth my time to appraise it. This ring

1237
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:50,780
is a piece of shit. Do not email me again.

1238
01:11:50,780 --> 01:11:54,960
He said piece of shit. He said something along those. So you're not

1239
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:57,840
going to get shirts for it. We took it to another place and they did it

1240
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,100
completely. It was just a guy who was really

1241
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:01,080
that's so

1242
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:08,580
not even worth my time, not even worthless man. This guy's badass. So

1243
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,200
sick. What a beast. Yeah, really was making me laugh quite a lot. So that's

1244
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:16,160
a lesson. All you fellas out there spring for the diamond. Yeah, girls

1245
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:20,240
don't care that your grandma wore the ring. Okay, they want the most

1246
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:25,040
expensive bullshit in the world, especially at restaurants. Yeah, so

1247
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:29,040
true. And at the store, I heard a story from my friend yesterday, me and

1248
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:33,680
Juvio's friend. I won't say his name because I don't want to give out his

1249
01:12:33,680 --> 01:12:37,080
information and I don't want to tell you what country he lives in even, but

1250
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:43,680
it's not America. He went on a first date to two days shut up on a first date two

1251
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:44,220
days ago,

1252
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:51,320
and he goes out to a bar and this guy's poor as dirt. He has no money, and they

1253
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:54,920
go out to a bar on a date and they get a drink, you know, and there was no

1254
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:59,640
expectation there was going to be food. It was after dinner time, and the

1255
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,320
waitress asked you guys want any food. He says yeah, we'll get some chicken

1256
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,240
bites to split. Oh right, chicken bites, chicken bites. That must be something I

1257
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:09,280
in a different country. Yeah, I know. What the hell? What is this exotic cuisine?

1258
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:11,560
Buffalo chicken bites, basically wingless,

1259
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,560
jingless twinging.

1260
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:22,800
Wingers, zingers. Wingsings. Wingsings. So he gets zingers, right? Yeah. And

1261
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:23,960
this girl orders

1262
01:13:23,960 --> 01:13:26,440
ahi ahi tuna.

1263
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:31,160
$25 on the first day.

1264
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:36,160
Wait, wait, where are they from? 'Cause maybe it's... Canada. Okay.

1265
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:44,040
Oh dear. Yeah, they definitely do that. I mean if they if she ordered like a tuna or something or the albacore tuna

1266
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:51,120
Maybe I could see I could understand that he ah he ah he that's hey, that's far away from Canada

1267
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:56,860
Yeah, what also I where is I he but I just wanted to say that's and I said to him

1268
01:13:56,860 --> 01:14:00,720
I was like buddy if you're into women get used to this kind of bullshit

1269
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,000
they pull that into women. Stop. They're going to order. They're every single

1270
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,400
time that you go to a restaurant with them. They're going to order the most

1271
01:14:07,400 --> 01:14:10,960
expensive thing. That is the smallest thing on the menu. Somehow they have a

1272
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:15,640
they have a mathematical equation. They do in their head a formula. Yeah,

1273
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:19,000
because and she's trying to test you. She's doing means testing, which by the

1274
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:23,440
way should be illegal. Yep, she's doing means testing for you. So you need to

1275
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:29,280
drop her. Yeah, yeah. So that's and if you're wondering about means testing,

1276
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:34,560
it means testing facts. Honestly, all testing should be erratic. I shouldn't

1277
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:38,160
be testing things. I owe it. Just do this. Thank you. Okay, do it all right

1278
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:40,300
real quick before we end final score. Jubeo

1279
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:45,100
it says it right there. It says to negative twelve, the negative twelve. It

1280
01:14:45,100 --> 01:14:50,760
doesn't matter. You will be what matters is on July. Fourteen. There's a live

1281
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:56,160
negative. Wow, enough, don't say enough like that. That's what there is a live

1282
01:14:56,200 --> 01:15:01,300
show. There is a live show at Littlefield July. Fourteenth, it's going to be us.

1283
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:05,540
It's going to be home planet. It's going to be Pierce Campion and we wrote the

1284
01:15:05,540 --> 01:15:07,580
most amazing sketch today.

1285
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:14,080
The I think honestly the greatest sketch that we have ever written in our entire

1286
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:17,720
life. Do you want to maybe now we're not going to spoil it? We can't spoil it.

1287
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:24,060
Fuck no man. He wants to know that if it doesn't make it to the final show, we

1288
01:15:24,100 --> 01:15:26,100
we'll be doing it live on this podcast.

1289
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:27,100
Yes, we will.

1290
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:28,100
That's a good idea.

1291
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:31,740
We'll be doing this sketch live on the podcast and it will be either a cold open or just

1292
01:15:31,740 --> 01:15:33,100
in the middle of the episode.

1293
01:15:33,100 --> 01:15:35,100
All right, thank you.

1294
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:36,100
Goodbye.

1295
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:36,460
Thank you so much.
