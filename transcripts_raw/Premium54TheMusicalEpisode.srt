5
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,300
OOF!

6
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,300
That's good.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:25,300
Weeeew!

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:30,900
(Siren)

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,900
God damn it's so hauntingly beautiful.

10
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,100
It's so good.

11
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,700
I mean it's fucking gorgeous.

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
It's the most beautiful song I've ever heard.

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,300
It's a siren call.

14
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,300
Wee wee, wee wee.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,300
(Laughter)

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,300
I think this is finally the time that we become musical stars.

17
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:55,100
Yeah, I mean we've been musical geniuses but we haven't put our genius to work until right now.

18
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,860
Yeah, this is the first sensitive gangster episode.

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,860
Uh-huh.

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,860
Uh-huh.

21
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:03,140
Where we're gonna make a beat from scratch.

22
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:05,660
Making a beat from scratch and we're writing all the lyrics too.

23
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,660
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,660
And it's gonna take an hour.

25
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,660
It's gonna take one hour.

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:10,180
We're gonna write a whole song in one hour.

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Patrick, you do.

28
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,180
You start it.

29
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,180
You get this going.

30
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,500
Well, we gotta start with-

31
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
I think we need a C sharp.

32
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,100
We need a rhythm section.

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:21,100
Boots skirts, boots skirts, boots skirts, boots skirts.

34
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:24,700
Hold on, I'll pull up, I'll open up GarageBand too.

35
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,940
I gotta record me doing that.

36
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,940
No.

37
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,540
I think we can- Fuck you man!

38
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,540
We got drums.

39
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
I'm out of the band.

40
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:32,540
No.

41
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,540
What?

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:34,540
There's no- First of all, there's no band.

43
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,540
It's a record label.

44
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,540
So you can leave, but you're not getting any money.

45
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,540
Yeah.

46
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,100
Uh, are you guys serious?

47
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,100
If you are.

48
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,100
I'm thinking about leaving.

49
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,380
I'm really close.

50
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,100
Here we got Dez, the trap beat.

51
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,100
The trap beat?

52
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,100
Alright.

53
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,100
Play the trap beat.

54
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,100
No way.

55
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,220
(Arabian Nights music)

56
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,140
- No way.

57
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,460
That's the trap beat?

58
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:04,140
What the fuck is this dude?

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,540
Sounds like Arabian Nights.

60
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,360
- Okay wait.

61
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,280
- Oh it's 'cause I have a track open.

62
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,820
Let me delete these.

63
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,460
- Oh he had his Arabian track on.

64
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,340
- Yeah I had my Arabian music open.

65
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,180
- My bad.

66
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,020
- He was making Arabian music before the episode.

67
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:23,800
I was making Arabian music and then I decided to switch genres to trap in the middle.

68
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Here, let me just start- Arabian trap!

69
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,060
Let me just open up a new project.

70
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,200
It's more likely than you think.

71
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,700
Yeah.

72
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,740
At least ten Arabian trap artists are changing the game.

73
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,920
Can we pause real quick?

74
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,760
[laughs]

75
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,760
My brother's calling me.

76
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,260
Okay.

77
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,260
What an amazing start to an episode.

78
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:38,980
[laughs]

79
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:42,480
Pat just got a call from his brother accusing him of stealing a toothbrush.

80
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
Yeah, I didn't steal his toothbrush.

81
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:44,580
No.

82
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,200
And we let him know that we can't talk about this.

83
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,540
The streets are going crazy.

84
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:56,540
The streets are going insane getting ready for this song.

85
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,220
Woah.

86
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:05,780
Nobody wants to hear this.

87
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,780
Play over this.

88
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:15,780
Wait, let me turn on the arpeggiator.

89
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,780
Okay.

90
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:17,780
This will, here, we'll set this up.

91
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
Here, I'll keep the beat going.

92
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,780
Hold on.

93
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,780
While you guys do this, I'm gonna call my mom and let her know I'm buying her a new car.

94
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
Four octaves.

95
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Mom, I got you a G-Wagon.

96
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,780
It's your new favorite son.

97
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,780
Dude, this beat goes hard as hell.

98
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,780
That joint go crazy.

99
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,780
We're about to, hold on.

100
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,700
This has got to sound so horrible in people's headphones.

101
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Yeah.

102
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,700
Which is kind of the appeal.

103
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,620
We're doing something experimental.

104
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,340
Here, I think the song should be very fast.

105
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,980
It should be a two second song.

106
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:57,980
Yeah, it should be...

107
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,260
That sounds pretty cool.

108
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,380
That's my problem with most songs.

109
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,380
I usually...

110
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,380
230 BPM.

111
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,540
I usually skip.

112
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,020
Okay.

113
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,060
Okay.

114
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,060
And time signature should be 6/8.

115
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:22,060
That's a good beat.

116
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,100
Hey Caleb, rap over this.

117
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,220
I've got a hundred friends and I've got a hundred more.

118
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,500
I'm about to go home and go to the store and I've got a million dollars and I've got a bunch

Wow.

129

Is that a heart?

130
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,980
Are you playing a heart right now?

131
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:42,140
Oh my God, you're so gorgeous right now.

I'm falling in love with you.

133

134
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:58,300
with you every moment. I wish there's a way that we could like do it on the

135
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:05,380
computer so we don't have to use our phones. No. Shut up. Do you think this is better? Dude I mean we could, it's

safe to say this is already the best episode we've ever done. I mean people

137
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,580
are probably laughing their asses off at this hilarious music. People probably think it's so funny. Yeah.

138
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,240
(laughing)

139
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,700
- Okay, rap over this, Caleb.

00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,340

00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,220

Mama you look so sexy when you do your walk down the aisle

183
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:25,740
Mama I just wanna make you smile

184
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:32,900
Okay, well, I mean how long can we do

185
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Yeah.

186
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:41,220
Here, at the very least, we can use the sampler to make a sound board.

187
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:45,940
Okay, that works.

188
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,060
I don't think anyone can hear that.

189
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,460
I think it's too far away from your microphone.

190
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,860
Yeah, I think you need to hold your microphone up to it.

191
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,860
You're not even saying anything.

192
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,380
Just hold your mic up to it.

193
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,380
Ooh.

194
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
No one can hear.

195
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:01,100
They just hear you say ooh.

196
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,840
they can hear the music

197
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,340
you should make a house on we should make a way of the guys i'm gonna record

198
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,940
something for the soundboard and i quite for a second stop at

199
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,560
now that was funny

200
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:20,380
okay i've never heard of the other side of the road how much did we record

201
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,940
is like nine minutes

202
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:27,300
it did not it's a nine minute epic it's like a he me and rhapsody or weird

203
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,300
we're trying to figure out...

204
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,300
(laughter)

205
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,300
Do it really high.

206
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,300
(in opposite iodine)

207
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,300
Well, that's like the opposite of...

208
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,300
You got some iodine?

209
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,300
(Now that was funny)

210
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,300
Okay, that's all the soundboard should be.

211
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,300
Now we do an episode...

212
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,300
Yeah, now we just do a normal episode.

213
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

214
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:02,220
I'm fresh off of shitting my pants. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you did I did Caleb shit himself on the way to get Korean shit myself like

215
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,880
Maybe maybe 80 feet away from my front door

216
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,900
I

217
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:17,440
shit myself like 80 feet away from my front door on like a mile walk and instead of turning around to

218
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,380
go

219
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:25,040
Clean myself up. We just kept going. Yeah. Yeah, you just went to this is power to mind over matter, dude

220
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:30,680
You went to the Korean place with shit in your pants. Yeah, and that guy bowed to me

221
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:36,600
He fucking took my credit card and said thank you and he bowed and it's like dude you don't fuck yeah

222
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,680
You know you're literally talking. I'm like acting like a baby right now

223
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,080
I'm just walking around yeah, which hit my pants just being like I'll take care of it

224
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm gonna eat some sweet and spicy chili chicken mm-hmm, and I didn't it was fucking incredible

225
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,440
and then I shit more when I got home.

226
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Yeah, it was good chicken.

227
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,440
I had more in.

228
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
It was amazing chicken.

229
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
It was very good chicken.

230
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
It made me really full.

231
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
It's crunchy.

232
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Yeah.

233
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,440
That's something that the Koreans have perfected.

234
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,960
Yeah, I think it's potato starch in the chicken breading.

235
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,680
I don't even want to know what kind of voodoo magic they're doing to that chicken, but I

236
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
just know I like it.

237
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,680
Yeah.

238
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,680
Yeah.

239
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,960
I was trying to close it.

240
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,200
Pat, he's got to...

241
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,440
I was trying to close it.

242
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,240
There's got to be one episode that Pat just ruins with some obsessive thing that he's

243
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
doing instead of recording.

244
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,600
Yeah. They got us this and not like an iPhone game.

245
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah. Well this one's my fault. Yeah. Yeah I did suggest this. We were gonna make a

246
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:37,760
beat. I didn't realize it was still set low. I thought you were gonna use like that thing

247
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,800
that the headphone thing and we were gonna make a beat live on the show.

248
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,800
That's it we should do a stream where we make a beat. That's a good idea.

249
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:57,960
idea. That's terrifying. Yeah, the soundboard's not as good. It's really, really scary. That

250
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:04,480
just sounds like Luigi's Mansion. It does. It's just the professor in Luigi's Mansion

251
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,640
talking. Professor E. Gadd. Like a morning radio show. Yeah. So we can hear it from the

252
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:20,920
craziest color say what we're reading a story about a mission who got stuck in a

253
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:35,760
zoo maybe we should start doing zoo radio yeah it's a good it's a good idea some

254
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,360
drops and stuff in. The thing is we need a sexy girl. Yeah. Yeah that we call the

255
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,400
pussy. Yeah Patrick. Patrick? Are you? No Cameron. Are you willing and able? Cameron has long

256
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,720
hair. No I don't. Um yeah but Cameron I feel like like you would be. You're way

257
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,680
sexier. No you'd be less sexy as a girl and I feel like a radio girl always has

258
00:12:54,680 --> 00:13:01,480
to have a sexy voice but then looks like shit you know. So Cameron. No cuz he cuz

259
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,560
he has a he has a terrible voice but he looks beautiful thank you yeah yeah who

260
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,080
knows as a girl we'll get the sexy girl who knows or we'll get a say yeah I was

261
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:17,800
we'll never get one oh we're never gonna get one ah it's two weeks till prom and

262
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:24,440
we're gonna get a sexy girl oh my god maybe that's our act right now maybe

263
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,960
that's our next big project instead of like a movie or something we do American

264
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,500
We do a prom. Yeah. We put on a prom. That'd be fun. That's a good idea.

265
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,300
But then we all accidentally, we all accidentally ask the same girl. Oh no.

266
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,360
Oh. It tears us apart, but it also brings us closer together in the end. Yeah, that's right.

267
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:45,300
And you know what happens at the end. You seen Eat Two Mama Tambien? No. That's what happens at the end.

268
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:50,120
Oh yeah. You haven't seen it? You haven't seen your mom too? No. Well, that's the name of the movie, but in the, oh.

269
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:55,060
Everybody fucks. That's what I'm saying. Oh really? Yeah. He's back in the studio.

271
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,780
studio they're gonna use this clip in the documentary about Cameron as like the

272
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,580
greatest producer ever yeah and then it's gonna be a talking head of me and

273
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:12,920
I'm like yeah he couldn't get out of the studio he's addicted to making music he

274
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:20,740

278
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,860
studio is gone yeah no more studio we're out of this studio my people people were

279
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:46,220
too passionate about our music people start yeah it's like the Beatles like

280
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,060
yeah fucking teenage girls are killing themselves yeah cuz we're out of the

281
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,460
studio but we had to do it have you ever seen like the footage like that them it

282
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,500
like Shea Stadium and stuff and it's just the teenage girls just screaming. I don't

283
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,380
understand that at all. I mean that's kind of how it was with Justin Bieber. Yeah it

284
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,300
was the same thing with Justin Bieber but it's like... Is there a guy like that now

285
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,900
that just people go crazy for? One Direction, Harry Styles still. Yeah and I guess like K-pop stuff.

286
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:11,780
Yeah it's K-pop. Yeah it is K-pop. But like the Beatles like you look at those guys and it's just

287
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:18,420
like they look like normal like they're like like George Harrison was not that

288
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,100
good-looking. They didn't have hot guys back then. Yeah that is true.

289
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,380
They hadn't invented that yet. He got good-looking in the 70s but in like the 60s or like at

290
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,180
least the beginning of the Beatles when he had the bowl cut he did not look good.

291
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,700
Because nobody could afford fucking protein. Everybody was fucking 4 foot 11

292
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:38,220
and weighed 98 pounds. It is funny like it is funny to look like watch old

293
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,780
movies from like the 80s or 70s and see like when they're like oh here's a like

294
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,620
a strong muscly badass guy and they're all they all just have like have so much

295
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,460
fat on them compared to like what you would see in like a Marvel movie for like the nerd

296
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Marvel movie characters.

297
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,540
It's like the early James Bond's.

298
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,540
Yeah like the one.

299
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,540
Like those like mailmen.

300
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:57,660
Like fucking Kurt Russell in Escape from New York.

301
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,420
It's so funny because he just got like he just like his arms are just he just has like

302
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,260
you just doesn't look like an action hero.

303
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,260
You know what I mean?

304
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Yeah.

305
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:06,260
Well not like in.

306
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Well not like.

307
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
And then fucking Arnold changed everything.

308
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Yeah.

309
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,260
He really did.

310
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
People were like you can be huge.

311
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,260
Once he started being in movies.

312
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,260
Yeah.

313
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Yeah.

314
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,260
And not just in documentary.

315
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,260
Yeah once he moved the window the Overton window from being like.

316
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:19,740
for a bit well from being like this guy looks like a scary alien to like oh this

317
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,380
is what a cool superhero looks like yeah yeah I ruined everything yeah beauty

318
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:30,700
and Sylvester Stallone I think no cuz cuz in Rocky he looked normal he didn't get

319
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:34,620
big until Rocky for me he didn't get big until the Expendables yeah that's true

320
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:38,580
first I heard of him yeah yeah the first you heard of her that ever heard of him

321
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:42,420
yeah I didn't know who Sylvester Stallone was until Guardians of the

322
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:47,680
galaxy yeah that's cool that's not true it's so funny how just like bad he looks

323
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,580
now cuz I hope like many times he got punched in the face on Rocky I don't

324
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,420
think that's why he looks bad I think do you think that you think he actually got

325
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,860
punched in the face yeah I think he was no what I thought he actually did box

326
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:06,940
and that was I mean I guess he did boxing but maybe for like six months I

327
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,380
thought he actually did Floyd Mayweather is fucking gorgeous and he's been getting

328
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:16,940
hit in the face for 30 years. No he's not. Floyd Mayweather's hot dude. I don't think

329
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:21,220
I've ever seen a picture of Floyd Mayweather. I think, I think, why'd you say no he's not?

330
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:24,860
I think I was thinking of, I think I was thinking of Conor McGregor. I think Sylvester Stallone

331
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:29,380
got, I think he got like, he has like, the mouth is like that because of like syphilis

332
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:33,780
or something. You're thinking of Pink Floyd. Oh I'm thinking of Pink Floyd. You're so dumb.

333
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,420
It's a band. Not good looking guys. No. David Gilmore looks like shit. Yeah they look like

334
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:46,300
triangle with a rainbow yeah but now I guess it is like kpop which is fine it's

335
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:50,420
funny those they're like raised like chickens on farms yeah yeah it's insane

336
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,860
what our country did to their country

337
00:17:53,860 --> 00:18:03,660
it's pretty crazy yeah just like well you guys have half of this and the rest

338
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,900
of it we're just gonna like we're gonna do a music yeah we're gonna turn you into

339
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:13,900
a music farm yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

340
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:18,900
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

341
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:23,900
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:33,900
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

344
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:40,500
first yeah it adds another year to your age every like every new year. Well that

345
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:45,300
means when you're a day old, you two years old. It doesn't change your it

346
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,100
doesn't change your age on your birthday. No what that that's like your

347
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:55,520
international age, but your Korean age is based on the every year in Korea.

348
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,820
Dude yeah, you go rent a car in Korea did oh my God. I mean everything's gonna

349
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,600
I warn you though everything will be in Korean there so I mean you should become

350
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:11,720
a kpop star I could learn just so I could be 24 yeah no just because it would be

351
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:20,160
cool for Patrick to be a kpop star people would love me in Korea yeah you'd

352
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,760
be you'd be like like on all the billboards with the kpop band you'd be

353
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,600
like twice their size yeah ate the last guy that's what they think yeah they

354
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,680
would use me in like anti-smoking propaganda over there. Yeah I don't think

355
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,740
that you'll look like this guy if you smoke. You'll turn white. Yeah you'll just go be the

356
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,580
mucinex booger. Yeah oh my god are you kidding me? Dream job. I'm the

357
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:50,680
mucinex, I'm like a heartburn commercial star. Yeah exactly it's like if you're Korean

358
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:56,320
and you eat too much pizza you turn into you until you drink Pepto-Bismol. Yeah

359
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,800
yeah yeah we're like around with fire or you could be like that like the Snickers

360
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:04,680
you're not you when you're hungry commercials but the Korean guys turn into

361
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:08,320
you and they turn back to themselves when they eat a Snickers they would love that

362
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,760
yeah I think maybe this is my next venture I think maybe I'm moving to

363
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,240
South Korea yeah I'm doing that yeah yeah I'm gonna send you to North Korea

364
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,720
there's some like weird laws in South Korea right yeah like for example I don't

365
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,320
know if you guys knew this I read about this the other day your age you actually

366
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:29,120
when you're born you're one years old. And that's a law. I know in

367
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,440
Singapore if you spit on the ground you get the shit kicked out of you by cops.

368
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,160
In Singapore, Anjan told me, because he's from Singapore, he was like yeah if

369
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:40,920
you smoke weed in Singapore they cut your head off. Yeah. I've heard that crazy

370
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,240
stuff like that. Can you imagine how much shit you get done in

371
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,680
Singapore? No drugs. Yeah. It's kind of a deal. Keep all your spit inside. Yeah, you're

372
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,560
not even allowed to spit dude. You're not allowed to throw it. You have to be productive.

373
00:20:53,560 --> 00:21:00,040
Exactly. Well I can't smoke weed and I can't fucking spit. I guess I'll invent a vaccine.

374
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:08,120
Yeah. Yeah. But I actually think it's a fascist regime. Is it? I think it might be bad. I

375
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:11,280
think it's beautiful. You're right, it's probably good the place where they cut your head off

376
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,240
when you smoke weed. Look, I'm not one to judge other cultures. I'm not judging them. I'm

377
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,780
I'm not one to judge other cultures.

378
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,480
I think that they have their own set of rules.

379
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,440
And you know, it's kind of weird for us,

380
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
but it works for them.

381
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,480
- Yeah.

382
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,500
- So if you smoke a little bit of weed in Singapore,

383
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,840
you get your head cut off, that's fine.

384
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,680
That's on you.

385
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,500
- That's normal.

386
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,340
- That's your fault.

387
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,720
- Yeah, Anjan just told me like,

388
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,200
you have to be like, like if you wanna do drugs,

389
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,960
you have to be like really fucking cool.

390
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:38,800
- Yeah.

391
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,200
- Yeah, 'cause I mean just, you have to do--

392
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,320
- Well yeah, they're making drugs cool again over there.

393
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,600
- Yeah, exactly.

394
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,920
We're so fucking pussified here.

395
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,840
- Yeah. - Seattle just made

396
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,400
cocaine legal.

397
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,240
- Yeah. - Like dude,

398
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,040
you're not actually doing cocaine

399
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,800
if there's no threat of you getting your hands

400
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,280
fucking chopped off. - Exactly.

401
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:56,080
- And put on a necklace. - Mm-hmm.

402
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,480
- And sold to me when I'm a tourist in Singapore.

403
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,600
- I don't even know that much about Singapore.

404
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,760
- I don't think you know, I don't even know, I mean.

405
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,320
- All I know about Singapore is the thing

406
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,160
about spitting on the ground. - Where is it?

407
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,040
Singapore is in Asia.

408
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,440
- The thing about spitting on the ground

409
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,480
and that two of my friends from high school

410
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,400
went to visit it, that's all I know.

411
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,600
- Did they spit on the ground?

412
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:21,140
I don't think so because they came back and they were injured.

413
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:23,040
But maybe they made them not tell anybody.

414
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,040
Isn't gum illegal there?

415
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,600
Yeah, so that's, there's something like that too.

416
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,560
Aren't shoes upside down there?

417
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
Don't.

418
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,680
Well, no, I heard gum was illegal there.

419
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,880
I think gum is illegal there.

420
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:32,880
I think there's something about gum.

421
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
Cameron backed me up on this.

422
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,880
I didn't, yeah.

423
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,280
You immediately went on the defensive.

424
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,080
I'm not on the defensive.

425
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Don't put your arm around him.

426
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,760
You know how jealous I get.

427
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,040
Me and Patrick are a team now.

428
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,280
You guys are on my black casting couch together and I'm sitting on the chair and I'm going

429
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,560
make you guys fucking do so. You're not gonna make me touch him. I'm gonna make you touch

430
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:54,680
him. I'm gonna do it by choice. Listen, do you wanna get into modeling for JC Penney?

431
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:58,640
You better fucking suck his balls right now. I could be a JC Penney model. You could. You

432
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,280
think so? Yeah. You could be the JC Penney model. I could be for their big size stuff.

433
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,680
Yeah. Big sized? Yeah, like their big and tall. I'm into the big size section. Like I was

434
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,360
gonna say big and tall but I feel like saying big and tall is giving me too much credit.

435
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,560
Yeah, I would say so. Yeah, I would say that you're not tall at all.

436
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,240
No. You're not even that big. What, do you wear like a 35 waist? I'm a 38.

437
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,600
38? That's not that big. That's what my dad wears. Yeah, my dad wears it too.

438
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,400
What? My dad and I are the same waist.

439
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,680
Oh my god. I can wear my dad's pants, but he, no, he's taller than me.

440
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,160
Wait, I'm gonna do a new soundboard. Me and my dad are the same size, if you know what I'm talking about.

441
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:40,160
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm smaller than my dad. Damn!

442
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,160
[laughter]

443
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
[sound of a gun being fired]

444
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,160
[laughter]

445
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160
[sound of a gun being fired]

446
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,640
So that's when someone does like a sick burn.

447
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,320
My dad is six feet tall and I am five nine.

448
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,560
You got owned by God himself.

449
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
I did.

450
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,560
I got height-mogged by my dad.

451
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:54,560
Yeah.

452
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
You got fucked, brother.

453
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,560
Mm-hmm.

454
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
That's fucked up, man.

455
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
We don't need a metronome.

456
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,560
He's in the fucking studio again.

457
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,560
I'm always on beat.

458
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,840
[sound of a gun being fired]

459
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,440
What did I say about going into the studio while we recorded?

460
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,400
He's back in the fucking studio.

461
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,520
You didn't say anything about it.

462
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,680
- Okay, well right now I'm saying

463
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,640
that it's no longer allowed.

464
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,480
- I'm busy.

465
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,300
- I get it.

466
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,140
- You guys do the episode, I'm busy.

467
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,360
- Listen, we're all talking here,

468
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,760
but we're secretly writing songs in our heads.

469
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,680
- I'm busy, guys.

470
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,040
- We're doing a cover of "Fell in Love with an Alien"

471
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,960
by the Kelly family.

472
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,280
- We're doing Tiggle Bitties.

473
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,680
♪ Fell in love with an alien ♪

474
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,040
♪ Fell in love with his eyes ♪

475
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,920
- You ever heard that song?

476
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,760
- Yeah, I have.

477
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,680
- We're doing a ukulele cover of "Nice Guys Finish Last."

478
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,000
- Yeah, oh my God,

479
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,440
That's what I didn't even fucking think of doing.

480
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,280
- Was that?

481
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,120
(laughing)

482
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:43,720
- A fucking ukulele cover of Eazy-E songs.

483
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,340
Do you know how fucking funny that would be?

484
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:48,180
- You know how beast mode that would be?

485
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,120
- You know how funny we would look

486
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,840
if we did a ukulele cover of a rap?

487
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,620
- Dude, I'm saying every word.

488
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,520
- Yeah. - Yeah.

489
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,880
- I'm hitting every note, every syllable.

490
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,920
- It's getting said by me.

491
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,200
- Cruising down the street in my six four.

492
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,800
- Yeah, exactly, instead of fo, it's four now.

493
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:11,480
I remember when Wu-Tang Clan posted on their official YouTube channel a video of a white

494
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,760
guy playing guitar and saying "shame on my friend" and he's saying it all.

495
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,500
And all the comments are like "it's so great to see Wu-Tang Clan share this and not get

496
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,320
angry at this guy because we need love between the races."

497
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
There's just like every comment on it.

498
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,040
There's just like every one where the white boys can say it all.

499
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,040
And that was it.

500
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Yeah.

501
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,400
where's the Wu-Tang Clan from? I know they're from New York but I know it's

502
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,640
Staten Island. Staten Island. Yeah. Kung Fu. Which is like the white guy saying inward

519
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:17,440
really heavy piano. Yeah. Like you trained on that so that when you get on a normal piano

520
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,920
you you're insanely good. That's ingenious. Yeah that's not a bad idea.

521
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,440
yeah and what if you use a really heavy car so that when you use a normal car you

522
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:32,960
can go really fast what if you use really heavy cream so when you use normal cream

523
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,680
it's the fastest coffee in the world fastest coffee yeah ever drink

524

526
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:56,400

527
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,720
two of them while we were walking to get more. Why did you think that was a good move? I

528
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:07,480
don't know. I think it was just the drinking in public. You were like, that's fun. I was

529
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:15,640
like, I need this. Excuse me, police officer, I just need this right now. I don't even know,

530
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:22,520
I just think the drinking out of the brown bag was very fun.

531
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,840
No one noticed or watched you.

532
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,000
No one knew what I was doing.

533
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,760
And I opened the bottles with my teeth, too.

534
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,400
Also really, I mean for somebody who complains about how fucking bad their teeth hurt constantly.

535
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
That's insane.

536
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,400
It's chipped.

537
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,400
Oh my god.

538
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,400
It's chipped because I grind it and I've also opened a shit ton of beer bottles with it.

539
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:43,240
And you were like, I'm gonna do this more.

540
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,740
You're so smart.

552
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
You chug one beer at noon.

553
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:45,980
Then you don't have to chug a beer for another hour.

554
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:51,980
Mm-hmm. I think I told you guys about this, but in high school my friend Mark,

555
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,980
we were low on beer and Mark took out the blood alcohol calculator on

556
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:03,980
AlcoholicsAnonymous.org and did the math to see how fat, like he was like,

557
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:08,440
He was like, "Look, if we just drink four beers in a row

558
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:13,080
"in under an hour, we'll be at like .8 for the whole night."

559
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:13,920
- Nice.

560
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,080
- He's like, dude, he fucking gamed how to get us fucked up.

561
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,640
- Nobody ever thought about drinking beer fast.

562
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,480
- Yeah, until your friend.

563
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,320
- Yeah, he was the first one to figure that out.

564
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,360
- Well, nobody did the math.

565
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,920
- He's actually a scientist.

566
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,760
- Yeah.

567
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,580
- He's a food scientist, like Alton Brown.

568
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,800
- He became a scientist.

569
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,440
He fucking gamed that shit.

570
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,520
- That's incredible, dude.

571
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,640
- Yeah, and we did it.

572
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,280
Wow. And it didn't work.

573
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,640
Of course not. You're like hungover.

574
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,360
Right. Like drinking four beers in under an hour.

575
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,720
You just get a stomachache.

576
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,600
Not me, dude. I have an iron stomach.

577
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,280
OK, let's see it. You shat your pants today.

578
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:51,560
My shits have been horrible since you guys have been here.

579
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,360
I've just been fucking pudding.

580
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:55,720
You told us before you've had diarrhea every day for like five years.

581
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,520
You can't blame it on us being here.

582
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,480
And somehow it's even worse when you guys are here because I'm just drinking a lot.

583
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,600
And so I'm like, I have like fucking pockets of air.

584
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,320
Like my poops look like sponges.

585
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,800
They're like tortoise.

586
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:07,640
It's fucked up.

587
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,340
- I've been constipated the whole trip, so.

588
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,520
- Let's get that out of you, dude.

589
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,960
- Oh, let's squeeze it. - I'm gonna suck it out.

590
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,000
- Squeeze me out like the Pillsbury Doughboy.

591
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,480
- I'm gonna suck you out like a noodle.

592
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,120
- They're gonna squeeze me like the Pillsbury Doughboy

593
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,960
get that shit out of me.

594
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,360
- I'm gonna put a straw in your belly button and drink it

595
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,880
and suck the poop out like a siphon into the toilet.

596
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,560
- When I was a boy, when I was very young,

597
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,720
I had an umbilical hernia.

598
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,560
- What?

599
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,400
- And it poked out of my belly button.

600
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,860
I had to get surgery on my belly button.

601
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,860
The what now?

602
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,860
Umbilical hernia.

603
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:33,860
I know.

604
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,860
Herbie?

605
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:35,860
Herbie.

606
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Herbie fully umbilically?

607
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Herbie fully hernia.

608
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,860
Herbie fully umbilical.

609
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
I don't think so.

610
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,860
Herbie fully umbilical.

611
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,380
Full Herbie.

612
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,180
When you get constipated, do you get like little rocks of shit stuck in your butthole that

613
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,180
you have to dig out with your fingers?

614
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,180
No.

615
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,180
Yeah, me neither.

I know you do.

617
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:58,220
When I was a kid, I would get constipated and I would get black rocks of shit in my ass

A brick?

649
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,520

He's mean a lot to me.

655
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:13,020
I don't know why he gave me a brick. I don't think he ever explained it.

656
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:17,020
The brick is the foundation of your home.

657
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:21,180
Do you want to just leave?

694
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:08,560

695
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,860
So I had them on even with the drop crotch. Yeah, it's too big

696
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,980
So I was wearing, I put them on and just immediately was like full of regret.

697
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:21,780
You guys remember when it was cool to dress like a ninja for a little bit?

698
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,100
Yeah. Everybody wearing those fucking... Justin Bieber with the t-shirt dresses and the drop crop pants.

699
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,260
The jot-jot plants and the... What do you mean dress like a ninja?

700
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:34,380
People would wear those like ninja shoes and the ninja pants. What ninja shoes? Like sandals?

701
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,980
Maybe even a mask. Not sandals. I don't know what you're talking about.

702
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,940
Like a ninja style shoe. Just explain it to me.

703
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,940
I don't remember.

704
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,940
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles wear sandals.

705
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,540
Well, some ninja they turned out to be.

706
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,940
Well, the other ones wear sandals.

707
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
The Foot Clan?

708
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:52,380
No, the other ninjas.

709
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,380
That aren't turtles.

710
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,660
Who are you fucking...

711
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,540
You are being so confusing right now.

712
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,540
Anyway, the ninja shoes...

713
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
Yeah.

714
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,620
Okay, the kind of shoes you would run up a wall with.

715
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,060

716
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,380

Yes.

718
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:09,460
So people wearing sticky shoes and drop crotch pants and fucking blouses.

719
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,900
Do ninjas wear blouses?

720
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,900
Beautiful ones too.

721
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,020
Do they have like masks?

722
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:18,540
Why would you want to hide that face?

723
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,540
What face?

724
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,540
Ninja face.

725
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
What are you talking about?

726
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
Beautiful ninja face.

727
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,700
Now it's cool to dress like Tyler Ninja Blevins.

Yeah.

733
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,420
I don't think you look like a ninja.

734
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,420
Ninja and Priyanka Chopra.

735
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,940
Ninja has much worse skin than you.

736
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,620
He for some reason upgraded his camera and it's just like horrifying dude.

737
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:40,620
Yeah.

738
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:41,620
You watch Ninja?

Sometimes.

741
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,620
He plays Valorant now.

742
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,620
I raided Ninja a couple times.

743
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,500
Yeah, you raided him 10 out of 10.

744
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,540
Ninja doesn't respond to anybody but donators.

00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,780

He's not a real streamer.

749
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,780
No, Ninja's not a real streamer.

750
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,820

00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,540
- Why are you taking his wall?

781
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,400
- We should get some cocaine and wake ourselves up.

782
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,400
Patrick just reached into Caleb's wall and pulled out a piece of rock.

783
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,000
I'm fixing it for him.

784
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:41,760
I got a new, I got a guy to buy cocaine from and he insists that I make up a fake name

785
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
and use it.

786
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,760
So I don't know, what should I say?

787
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
What should I say my name is?

788
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
Well, Jorge Acosta.

789
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,940
That's true, yeah.

790
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,360
That's the fake name we have to use for everything.

791
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,040
So all the drug dealers in New York use an app called Signal, which is like WhatsApp.

792
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:59,440
Oh yeah, that's the like drug dealers. That's the one that communists use so that the police

793
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,560
don't see them saying, "I'm gonna have sex with a policeman's wife." Yeah, saying, "I love Naruto."

794
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:10,720
Cool, dude. I'm glad you hid that from the cops. Yeah. But yeah, I have to come up with a fake

795
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,600
name. Probably will use Jorge Acosta. Yeah. Yeah, and then just show up and be like, "You gotta

796
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:21,680
cut back with the cocaine." "Cocaine? No." Okay, all right, then you got me.

797
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,480
The easiest intervention ever.

798
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,480
Dad, you have to stop fucking huffing paint. I don't think I will. I don't think so.

799
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:38,080
I have to go outside. Yeah, you're grounded. Yeah. Yeah, you're grounded. Yeah. I feel like I'm more nervous.

800
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:45,120
I would never do cocaine in New Hampshire. No, that's a bad idea. Yeah. Yeah, everything there's cut with fent. Yeah, even weed.

801
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:50,880
Dude, even water. Yeah, you can't even get a fucking Dasani bottle without being worried. You got to test everything.

802
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,760
I test a handshake in New Hampshire.

803
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,360
I test a kiss from my mommy in New Hampshire.

804
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
You have to.

805
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
You have to.

806
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,480
Yeah, I'm testing fucking...

807
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,480
I'm testing...

808
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,840
I'm testing saying hello.

809
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,840
Hi.

810
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,800
I'm testing my brother with gay chicken.

811
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,680
It's just a test, Dan.

812
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:10,680
It's not real.

813
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:11,680
Yeah, chill.

814
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680

00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:39,280
I need to drink more. I need more. I need to drink way less. Way less you say? I drank like 13 beers on

820
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,760
Halloween I was just by myself you always count how many beers you drink

821
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:49,140
Well, and then next you're like, oh my god, I drink exactly 12 beers. I count them the morning after

822
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:56,760
That's it. Then you're never right. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, you drink 50 beers on Halloween probably I

823
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,840
just remember

824
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,220
Now you count them as you go because you join a discord call and you tell me how many you've had so far

825
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,220
That's true. I do count them as I go

826
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:12,140
Well, it's because they're right next to me. The empties are right next to me. That's then you're just counting count the body

827
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:15,220
- Yeah, he starts every time he drinks one,

828
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:16,180
he starts the count over again.

829
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,340
He drinks his sixth beer and he goes,

830
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,820

831
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,180
- You count like the fucking owl

832
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,260

(beatboxing)

894
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:59,200
Have you ever heard that song, Jordi, "It's Hard to Be a Baby"?

895
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,200
No.

896
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,040
It's one of the, like these French parents like exploited their kid and made him make

897
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,040
a house song.

898
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,040
Okay.

899
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:09,720
Or they made, I think they were like music musicians and they made a house song.

900
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,720
They're music musicians.

901
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,280
They're music musicians.

902
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:20,120
They had their kid sing in French, "It's Hard to Be a Baby."

903
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,400
then they made like a music video and then they had him on like TV shows and

904
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,080
everything and they were going on tours and stuff and I think the French

905
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:30,340
government stepped in we're like yeah you're exploiting your kid and he was

906
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:35,680
like well I want to do it I think turning your kid into a musical act is

907
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,000
like the the swaggiest kind of abuse yeah yeah right like Michael Jackson's

908
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:47,240
dad yeah didn't he like make them maybe a shit out of yeah but I might be I might

909
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:52,480
be misremembering this but I remember some story about like if they if they didn't

910
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,760
sing well they had to all the kids had to go pack themselves into the fireplace and

911
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,180
sing from there yeah I didn't have to like squeeze themselves into the

912
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:07,640
fireplace and then just and practice singing in the fireplace Matilda yeah it

913
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,580
is like Matilda yeah that's exactly like Matilda yeah yeah except no except the

914
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:17,780
magic was the magic was Michael's voice magic was Michael's beautiful voice and

915
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:24,340
his mind control I can't imagine being Michael Jackson yeah tell me what would

916
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,900
be different about your life if you're Michael Jackson Michael Jackson I would

917
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,780
first of all I wouldn't hang my kid from that freaking balcony he didn't I watched

918
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:35,940
that video who that was nothing dude that was not he didn't hang the kid he

919
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:40,140
was hanging the kid to show off yeah shoes he was hanging the kid to show off

920
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:44,060
how cool his kid was and the fact that he could fly. My kid could levitate!

921
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:52,660
Watch this I'm letting go at three! Yeah but what else would be different I would

922
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:56,980
be friends I would have been friends with Conrad Murray hello. I mean if I if you

923
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,980
could live his life and change one thing it would be a baby thing. No I'd probably

924
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:08,780
as a child I'd stand up to my dad and say no. I bet that would have worked out

925
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:14,660
great no dad I don't want to be a singer I want to be Peter Pan for the rest of my

926
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,540
life yeah yeah he would have fucking yeah if he wasn't what I hate you with a car

927
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:22,480
if he wasn't a singer and he was just a pedophile instead you didn't have the

928
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:28,020
music true that's what Patrick wants no Patrick wants to be a white pedophile

929
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:35,140
first Michael Jackson might be the first pedophile with a diglio so I don't think

930
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,340
ever confirmed that he had vitiligo? Oh, it's vitiligo? Yeah, or vitiligo. Vitiligo, who

931
00:48:40,340 --> 00:48:47,620
knows. Yeah, I mean that's also true. Yeah, nobody knows if he had vitiligo. Yeah, vertigo.

932
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:52,780
No one knows if he even likes vitacoco. He got so dizzy he became white. He had vertigo,

933
00:48:52,780 --> 00:49:00,380
dude. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, do you guys think maybe they replaced him with a different guy?

934
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:04,820
If there was ever a guy that you could make that case for, it'd be him. Yeah, that's true.

935
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:08,020
the stuff where people are like oh they replaced this guy because he lost weight

936
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:11,940
like that's compared to yeah compared to like Michael Jackson I think Michael

937
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:15,340
Jackson is the argument for that one Jonah Hill they definitely replaced Jonah

938
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:17,940
Hill they didn't replace yeah they replaced him with that guy from Star

939
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:21,780
Trek who died because he got hit by a time the ocean yeah that's the new Jonah

940
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,180
Hill yeah yeah I like you Anton Yelchin he's cool but you gotta think about but

941
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:30,860
you killed him anyway but why'd you kill it was an accident sure yeah I thought

942
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:39,220
that the drive shift was the SiriusXM button. Yeah. I was trying to listen to Opie.

943
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:45,220
Yeah, well. I was trying to listen to XL Sam and Jim. Anton was checking his mail and you yeah you got in his car.

944
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:49,220
That's so crazy how he died. Yeah, it's insane dude. Yeah. It's like a final destination death.

945
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:53,820
Yeah, no it really is. Yeah. Pat was in the car when it happened and he saw him

946
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,820
getting pinned and he tried to, he tried to, he turned on the car to try to

947
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:07,060
drive away to unpin him. He had it in reverse. Did I ever show you guys my kiss costume when I was 11?

948
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:12,900
I was Gene Simmons. I think so. Is that the picture of you with the face paint? No that was after.

949
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:18,100
That's me that's me trying to get the face paint off. That was something different. Yeah that was

950
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:24,500
Michael Jackson for Halloween. It was MJ, Michael Jordan for Halloween. What is the line where

951
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:31,140
Could you go as today Michael, or as like 2003 Michael Jackson for Halloween?

952
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:32,260
You could go as anything.

953
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,700
But would that be okay, you think?

954
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,060
People go as Hitler.

955
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,820
That's also true.

956
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,460
Do they?

957
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:37,700
Yeah.

958
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,500
People do do Hitler.

959
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:40,900
I do think that maybe is the funniest Halloween costume.

960
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,380
Yeah.

961
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,820
It's just like, I'm Hitler.

962
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,820
I'm the scariest thing I can think of.

963
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:46,500
What are you talking about? Of course I'm Hitler.

964
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:46,740
Yeah.

965
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:50,340
That's a pretty good fucking--

966
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:50,500
Yeah.

967
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:52,900
That's Gene Simmons if I've ever seen one.

968
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:53,700
Yeah.

969
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,100
Yeah.

970
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:54,340
Yeah.

971
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:56,700
Yeah, that's right.

972
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:57,700
That's right.

973
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:58,700
That's right.

974
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,700
I'm going as Gene Simmons.

975
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,700
I'm Gene Simmons.

976
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,740
But yeah, going as Hitler, I think you, yeah, it's like, what's, I mean, you think a skeleton

977
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:06,740
is scary.

978
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,740
Wait till you see.

979
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:08,740
Yeah, wait till you see the guy who made it.

980
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:10,740
Wait till you see what's over the skeleton.

981
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:13,620
Yeah, it's Adolf Hitler's skin and clothes.

982
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:14,620
Oh, I think Hitler.

983
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:16,340
Going as a skeleton, be like, I'm Hitler's skeleton.

984
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,780
Yeah, that would be so funny to be in the middle of a haunted house and it's like a

985
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:24,180
A guy with a chainsaw, and like Freddy Krueger, and Hitler's on the stairs.

986
00:51:24,180 --> 00:51:26,180
He's on the stairs drinking tea.

987
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:26,680
Yeah.

988
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,180
Yeah.

989
00:51:27,180 --> 00:51:27,680
Hey.

990
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:28,680
Ha.

991
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,680
Hello.

992
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,680

00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,180
Oh, it's so embarrassing.

995
00:51:35,180 --> 00:51:39,180
Yeah, that was pretty crazy.

996
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,180
God damn, you're scary and polite.

997
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:47,180
They had, they had Texas Chainsaw Guy, they had Freddy Krueger, and I don't, Hitler was like embarrassed that...

998
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,180
I think they had, I think they had...

999
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,180
- They had Shy Hitler in there maybe?

1000
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:53,180
- Oh, don't look at me!

1001
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,180
- Oh, oh!

1002
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:56,180
- I am indecent!

1003
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:59,180
- Let me slip into something a little more comfortable.

1004
00:51:59,180 --> 00:52:02,180
- What if you walked in, what if you went into the haunted house and you saw Hitler sitting on the stairs,

1005
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,180
you went, "Oh!" and he just threw a sheet over himself like a ghost?

1006
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:09,180
- Hey, Hitler, I know that's you.

1007
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,180
- Hey, you can't fool me anymore.

1008
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:14,180
- Hey, Hitler, I have a feeling that's you.

1009
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:16,180
- This is not me, I'm actually the ghost!

1010
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:27,340
That's not gonna work on me Hitler. I know that's you. Yeah it's like it's like the

1011
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:33,140
ET ride at Universal if you find Harry Potter in the in the background. I don't

1012
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:39,420
know about enough about Universal. That joke is for two people. Yeah, ET and Harry

1013
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:45,260
Potter. What is the what is in the ET ride they put a secret Harry Potter

1014
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:50,760
in the woods a secret Harry Potter in the woods it's an Easter egg for the fans of

1015
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,280
Harry Potter and E.T. okay a secret Harry Potter you've never seen the E.T. ride

1016
00:52:56,280 --> 00:53:03,200
no I don't look that was too scary no no that's the alien one the E.T. ride is E.T.

1017
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,680
is needs to go back to his home planet to fix it what else is fucking new yeah

1018
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:11,160
fucking idiot fucking only loves one thing you ever thought about just eating

1019
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:15,800
lunch eating well he has to go home and fix his home planet with his touch and

1020
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:23,280
like his planet is full of like plant people yeah yeah well and then et says

1021
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,360
your name at the end of the ride that voice of pussy does he know your name

1022
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:30,280
you give them your name at the beginning of the ride does that mean that and then

1023
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:35,680
at the end he goes like goodbye bad drink

1024
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:40,920
Patrick! They programmed like a bunch of voices into the ET thing.

1025
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:46,120
Oh yeah I'm going on there and I'm saying my name is Hillary Clinton so ET will thank me.

1026
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:52,120
Goodbye Hitler. He says thank you. Thank you.

1027
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:56,840
I'd be so pissed off. Right? I'd be like it's clear that I'm the one who wrote that.

1028
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:01,960
He says it to me. I'm like did anybody hear this? Jesus Christ! Who let that happen?

1029
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:05,560
First of all, we have to find Hitler. He's somewhere in the line.

1030
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,560
He's hiding!

1031
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,560
Maybe he's with Harry Potter.

1032
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,560
Show me where he is!

1033
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:11,280
Hitler is on this ride.

1034
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,160
At the end of the E.T. movie, right before he goes back, he looks at Ellie and he goes,

1035
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,160
"Thank you, Hitler."

1036
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,160
They're like, "Who taught him that?"

1037
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,160
"What the hell?"

1038
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,160
Is Caleb standing in the background?

1039
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,160
That's the thing, is like, if E.T. was real, you'd treat him like a younger cousin or something.

1040
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,160
Yeah, yeah.

1041
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:29,160
Teach him curse words and shit.

1042
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:30,160
Hey, hey, guess what, E.T.?

1043
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,160
That's what they did.

1044
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:37,400
ice cream truck only plays music when they're out of ice cream. Oh, is that true? Oh, no.

1045
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:43,000
Yeah, dude, it's seriously true. Oh, no. Yeah, ET, if you jump off the roof of the house,

1046
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:46,360
you actually won't get hurt. You can fly. Yeah. Hey, ET, you want to see me go run to

1047
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:51,520
that rocking bed? I could fly. Hey, ET, you want to see me do that again? Hey, ET, if

1048
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:56,320
you go in the blender, it's safe. ET, put your finger in the blender. Hey, ET, I got

1049
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:01,120
this gun that fires backwards. Aim it at your head and shoot that tree. Yeah, I would. I

1050
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,520
If I saw E.T. I think I would kill him on sight.

1051
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,360
I think I'd fucking blow his brains out, dude.

1052
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,000
I would hit him right down on the middle of the head with a crowbar.

1053
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,000
Just right down the middle.

1054
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,000
I would cut him in half.

1055
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,480
He'd probably get squished like a Cordy in style.

1056
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,320
His neck would just fold into itself and he'd go "Aww."

1057
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,320
Whoops.

1058
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,600
You know what I've seen more than E.T. is Mac and Me.

1059
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:25,120
I've never seen Mac and Me.

1060
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,120
Mac and Me sucks.

1061
00:55:26,120 --> 00:55:27,120
Let me tell you what.

1062
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,120
Mac and Me is like one of the worst movies of all time.

1063
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Yes.

1064
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:35,880
yes same with like troll 2 dude paul you're killing it you guys are not gonna believe the room oh my

1065
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:42,600
god it's like the best worst movie yeah when that guy says something that when that guy says

1066
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:48,280
something this freak alien an alien would never say that yeah yeah an alien three movies about

1067
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:56,360
aliens the room mac and me and et let's go yes is tommy wiso doing anything now um i think he said

1068
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:01,400
He was gonna kill you. He said he was gonna kill you.

1069
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:04,400
Is that true? Are you serious? Yes.

1070
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,760
Wait. He said, "I'm fed up with Caleb." Why?

1071
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,120
"I'm fed up with Caleb." I'm normal. "I'm going to kill Caleb."

1072
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,280
From what reason? Probably your attitude. I have a

1073
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:21,320
good attitude. I don't know, dude. You know what's really cool about him is he wears

1074
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,280
two belts.

1075
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:27,120
He wears two belts? He wears one belt in the loops and then he wears one like

1076
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,620
around his ass. Like he wears like one-

1077
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,320
Every time?

1078
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,520
Yeah. Like if you look up pictures of like Tommy Wiseau's belts,

1079
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:38,620
he's got like one belt. Like he looks like- he dresses like a Kingdom Hearts character.

1080
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,820
I mean everybody has to have one stylistic thing.

1081
00:56:40,820 --> 00:56:42,620
Me, I shit in my pants a lot of the time.

1082
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:46,520
I read the Disaster Artist and Greg Sestero explains that

1083
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:50,620
he said, uh, Tommy Wiseau, like he asked him about it and Tommy Wiseau just went,

1084
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,620
"Makes my ass look nice."

1085
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:54,120
[laughter]

1086
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,620
Like covering it up with a belt?

1087
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:58,100
by making it like lifting it up with another belt.

1088
00:56:58,100 --> 00:57:00,020
- I'm gonna start wearing a WWE belt.

1089
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,060
- Yeah? - Yeah.

1090
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:01,900
- That's cool.

1091
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,300
- People will be like,

1092
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,300
people won't fuck with you if you wear a WWE belt.

1093
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,860
- Like a heavy one or a real one?

1094
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:09,780
- Like the, well at first I have to earn it.

1095
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:11,280
- Yeah. - In the ring.

1096
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,260
In the rink.

1097
00:57:12,260 --> 00:57:13,380
- The rink. - Yeah.

1098
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:15,300
- The WWE rink. - The WWE rink.

1099
00:57:15,300 --> 00:57:16,980
But then, 'cause it's all acting anyway,

1100
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:21,340
so a guy like me could conceivably be a WWE champion.

1101
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:23,900
- What was that, there was like a couple months ago,

1102
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:29,560
there was like some guy he was like a local wrestler or whatever and he was a

1103
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,800
heel but his whole heel thing was that he was like all right and he came out

1104
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:35,680
with like a swastika flag or something and his students found it. Oh is he like

1105
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,600
the liberal Democrat? I don't know. Well that was the guy that was a that was a

1106
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:45,800
dude who was in like the local like like Tennessee circuit whose whole thing was

1107
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:51,280
he would come out and be like Obama's awesome and then people be like fuck you

1108
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,880
"Kill him!" and he like won a couple and people went crazy for him. That's a really good.

1109
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:01,840
Yeah I watched I was watching a movie where there was there was a wrestler in

1110
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:05,680
it named Jimmy Hitler and he just dressed like Hitler. Damn. There's no way.

1111
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,520
It's called a movie called a Blood Diner. It was a GLOW and it was

1112
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,120
Mark Barron. Yeah. I think I'm gonna beat Hitler and you girls are gonna beat me up.

1113
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:18,400
Alright I'm who are you Hitler who are your guys? I think what I'm gonna do is

1114
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,440
Hitler and you girls are just gonna beat up my balls. And that's gonna be... you

1115
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,920

1116
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:30,640
And yeah, I'm Hitler. Yeah and I'm dressed up like Hitler the whole time. Okay let's do

1117
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:39,960

1118
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,840
Sorry I gotta say it. I gotta say it once per episode. It'd be good if Hitler

1119
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:48,240

01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:19,320
I remember being with my older brother and saying my order for Taco Bell in the drive

1148
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:22,820
through and them saying, "Yes ma'am, sounds great."

1149
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:23,980
And dude, I couldn't even eat.

1150
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,300
I was so sick to my stomach.

1151
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:26,300
Yeah.

1152
01:01:26,300 --> 01:01:27,300
You think I have a girl's voice?

1153
01:01:27,300 --> 01:01:28,300
You do.

1154
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:29,300
You think, really?

1155
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:31,900
You really think I have a girl's voice?

1156
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,860
I never got confused for a girl on the phone.

1157
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:35,860
I love Mexican pizza.

1158
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,860
Yeah, I would like it.

1159
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,860
Yeah, let me get a gorgina, Grangop.

1160
01:01:39,860 --> 01:01:41,860
You think I can get a gorgina, Supreme?

1161
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:45,860
Let me get a little bit of this here.

1162
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:49,860
People forget about that.

1163
01:01:49,860 --> 01:01:53,860
Yeah.

1164
01:01:53,860 --> 01:01:55,860
No, she doesn't sound like a whale.

1165
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:59,860
Oh, a good whale.

1166
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,860
Birds flying high, you know how I feel.

1167
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:08,860
Michael Poopley wrote that song.

1168
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,860
Alright, bye guys.

1169
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:11,860
Did we finish it?

1170
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,860
Yeah we did.

1171
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:13,860
Alright.

1172
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:14,860
Because when I arrive, I bring the fire made to come.

1173
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:15,860
Oh yeah, I'll come down and take you higher with the steel.

1174
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,860
Oh God, I just wanna remind you let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1175
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1176
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1177
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1178
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1179
01:02:20,860 --> 01:02:21,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1180
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:22,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1181
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:23,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1182
01:02:23,860 --> 01:02:24,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1183
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:25,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1184
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:26,860
Let it rock, let it rock, let it rock.

1185
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:31,860
I just wanna remind you, let it rock, let it rock, let it rock
