[MUSIC]

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,760
Last time on Gun City, the Temple of TehPenguin of Doom.

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,640
The boys finally reach the last room of the Land Caves where they met with the handsome winged gamer.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:23,360
After defeating him in tic-tac-toe, they were rewarded with a dark Eldritch Boppet that they drove the DM insane with.

5
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,320
So I assume they eventually solved it, leading to the Boppet transforming into an egg,

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,160
then hatching into a golden penguin with a realistic-looking vagina,

7
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:34,320
with strange, tinny blizzard noises coming from it.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,280
Pennsylvania Jim, lurking nearby, saw the whole affair,

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
and sicced his ninja crayons on our heroes,

10
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,200
with new colors pink, yellow, and green.

11
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,000
After Patrick Yoda's new dark side powers quickly dispatched of them,

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
along with Ray William Johnson's patented sexual grenades and Blowtorch's deadly... pipes,

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,200
Jim destroyed the land caves with deadly explosives.

14
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,500
That's why I didn't want to save that game twice.

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:02,000
And our heroes had to narrowly escape before it all came crashing down around them.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,200
Finally arriving from the mouth of the now-destroyed land cave,

17
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,900
the gang was faced with a row of Ken Bone police officers, along with the Gadd King himself,

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,700
who noted the group's tardiness (they were only allotted an hour's time in the cave)

19
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,700
as well as the cave's destruction.

20
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,000
Thinking quickly, the three archaeologists, along with Sullivan the Frog,

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,100
hopped onto three Walmart scooters sitting outside of the cave.

22
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,140
It sped off beginning the chase of a lifetime

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,700
Oh my god, yeah you guys hopped onto these fucking scooters

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,460
um

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:38,500
And you sped off behind you. Um, uh, you hear uh, uh,

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:44,500
The ken bones coming nearby with the the siren, which is sort of just a let it go

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:51,620
But as a siren in the gadsville, um, police, uh, police, uh department, that's what they do

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:58,500
and you guys get a call on your PSPs and it's it's Leo as you guys are speeding

29
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,820
away and he he patches in he says what's going on how's the investigation going

30
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:14,100
oh I forgot about this guy mm-hmm what who's that who's there it's me Leo

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,820
there's a lot of noise around you a lot of a lot of what's going on we're fine

32
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:38,820
I

33
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,820
well cameron you said the truth

34
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,820
i got a 19 so i win

35
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,820
i didnt say the truth i said we got the pass

36
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,820
the n word pass

37
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,820
oh i thought you meant the pass to go to the cave

38
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
ok

39
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,820
he says well i

40
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
i'm glad

41
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
i'm glad you're watching a movie

42
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
i love this movie

43
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,820
and then you see

44
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,820
you see sullivan

45
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,820
go we're running from the cops

46
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,820
i'm so scared

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,220
or it's all of it in this movie will

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:13,900
well all my god he looks so it's a bit this movie

49
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:17,300
i don't know what's gonna happen to me he's been there

50
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:21,060
you hear uh... is he on one of our bikes or is he uh... this is the thing that i

51
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,020
was on

52
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,620
now he was on one of your bikes that which ones by keepers on i think he's on

53
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,260
blowtoss yeah

54
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,320
uh...

55
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,940
uh... his mom but i know i was not but i think that uh...

56
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,380
you hear we are going to calm down calm down calm down i'd look i i i

57
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,080
I figured as much just based on the general sort of atmosphere and the tone of your voices

58
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,900
as you're, there's sort of a Doppler effect going on.

59
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,340
Look, if you make it out of there, it'll be fine.

60
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,980
Just make sure you get to the galleon on time.

61
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,220
I'll have the Jollibee start everything up for you.

62
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:56,860
So you can just ride in there and depart to your next location.

63
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:59,180
You got, you got something there with the caves, right?

64
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,740
You guys are like weaving through like things.

65
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,020
He's trying to talk with you.

66
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,700
I got this for you.

67
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,500
I can't see it.

68
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,600
Look, look, never mind.

69
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,700
We can talk we can talk later.

70
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,800
Just get to the galleon.

71
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,300
Okay.

72
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,100
All right.

73
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,200
Okay in it.

74
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,800
All right.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,400
Okay, and he hangs up.

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
So yeah, you guys are sort of racing down the track here.

77
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,600
So I call him back.

78
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,000
Okay.

79
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,900
He says, well, I looked at can is your refrigerator running

80
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,100
blowtoss.

81
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,900
I know it's you.

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,800
Who all right, just just don't die.

83
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,100
I threw my PSP off the bike.

84
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:40,900
All right, he totally bought it.

85
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,800
All right.

86
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,800
So here's what's happening.

87
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,500
First of all, I'm taking a picture of this for posterity

88
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
in case I need to use this in court later.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,900
Okay, great.

90
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,080
just knowing that I did not see you. I you've not sucked my

91
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,920
wiener. I have. I saw patches as wiener and I sucked it moving

92
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,840
on. so what what this is is essentially I have we have like

93
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,760
a little chase sequence here and I have a little like a way

94
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,060
that we're going to handle it. so you have. Cops behind you

95
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,740
right now and basically what's going to happen is it's going

96
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,620
to be a series of things happening as you race down this

97
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:35,880
track race down this mountain and we'll see how you handle them and they're

98
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,320
going to try to take you out you might be able to get down there in time or you

99
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,200
might have to destroy them you know and fight them as well off on in the cars

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,400
while you're doing it so everyone offered I'm ramming into the police car

101
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,980
in a role for initiative to this you you'll have an opportunity to do that I

102
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,540
promise. Okay. 19. Okay. 13. It's a spoiler. Um,

103
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,980
you say spoiler initiative. I mean, where is,

104
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:06,340
he said that we will ram into that. Well, I got one on my initiative.

105
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,020
Contrived. I tried with my one. Okay. All right.

106
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,900
Okay. Yeah. You're one. Okay. Um,

107
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:20,260
so the police cars we have, those initiatives are got them. Okay, cool.

108
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:34,140
So the way that this works is that your cars move at a max of 30 miles an hour, because

109
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,620
that's sort of the regulation for the Gadsville zone.

110
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:40,160
They don't want anyone getting stomach aches.

111
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,300
And their cars, though, because their cop cars go at 40 miles an hour, so they go slightly

112
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,300
faster.

113
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,820
Is there any way to soup it up?

114
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,340
You can definitely try on your turn.

115
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,860
Who has the best mechanics skill?

116
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,940
Who is the best at souping?

117
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Who has the highest soup speed?

118
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:01,020
I would say it's you Ray William Johnson since you are a robot and it would probably just

119
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,400
be a straight intelligence check.

120
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:11,460
Now this first turn it's a Ken Bones turn so one of the Ken Bones is going to try to

121
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,900
drive up alongside you guys so he's sort of like speeding up a little bit getting alongside

122
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,340
and he's saying pull over pull over and then another ken bone

123
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,860
bosses head through the window like in fortnite and uh

124
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,700
starts trying to spray bullets at you uh the three of you so

125
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,820
uh three of you all of you roll uh uh in this case what we're gonna do for

126
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,580
this because uh there's no like vehicle handling i mean there's vehicle

127
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,060
handling stuff in 5e but i don't there's animal handling yeah right so

128
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,860
about well that's actually what i'm gonna do is have

129
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,860
You're going to do animal handling, Patrick.

130
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,860
We want that.

131
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,860
Patrick, you're going to roll for animal handling.

132
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,860
Because that's wisdom-based.

133
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,860
You two, Blotas and Ray William Johnson,

134
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,860
you guys can roll for either athletics or dexterity

135
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,860
to see if you can avoid the bullets.

136
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,860
I will roll...

137
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
I'm rolling athletics.

138
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,860
Athletics as well.

139
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,860
15.

140
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,860
14.

141
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:20,860
I got a 10. Okay, cool. So the bullets spray and Ray William Johnson, you managed to sort

142
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:27,380
of move around them pretty easily. But a blow toss and Patrick Yoda, you guys get clipped

143
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,420
a little bit by the bullets. Your cars are looking a little a little hurt, but they're

144
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:36,600
not too bad. So but I'll give you I'll let you know and you'll be able to tell when your

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:43,240
cars are like not looking good. So but for now you guys are doing okay, but you did get

146
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,120
hit by the bullets a bit and now it is your turn. Who got the 19 you did can blow toss

147
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,920
it's your turn. So you have one that's on your side and three that are behind you.

148
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:04,600
Hmm. Let me look at my abilities. Yeah, get get creative do whatever you can keep in mind

149
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,400
you're in a moving vehicle though. So your movement is really just restricted to

150
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,840
like you moving in the vehicle and then if you want to make lateral movements

151
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,040
as a person you can try but yeah yeah.

152
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:25,000
Is it sunny out? Yes. Okay, can I try and I want to try and reflect the sun into

153
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,960
the Ken Bowen's eyes that's next to us using my very my very shiny pipe which

154
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,160
is made out of chrome. Yes, of course. Which has been made out of chrome the

155
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:37,240
whole time. Yes. I agree it has been so okay. What I'll have

156
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,160
you do then is I guess that's really like a a slight a hand

157
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,880
check right like you're trying to sort of a I guess that's

158
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:47,800
slight or is that just general dexterity? Yeah. I don't know.

159
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,320
Let's say dexterity check. Let's do that. Alright for that

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:57,000
nineteen. Oh yeah. Okay. so you yeah describe how you how you

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,320
sort of hold the pipe up. What do you do like exactly to make

162
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:06,320
that

163
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,160
but it also goes into my eye, but only one of my eyes because he only

164
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,320
has a telescope with one eye. That's right, you do.

165
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,080
Shit, wait. But both of his eyes. Oh, there it is. Okay, cool. Yeah, so it

166
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,200
goes into his eye and the car sort of like spins out a

167
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,080
little bit and he's like, "Ah, jeez, I can't see. This is

168
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,240
oh my goodness gracious." And he sort of spins out back a bit.

169
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,080
And so he backs up a bit so he can't, he's not as close up to you

170
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,360
And he takes you see his car sort of like knocks into a couple of a couple the size of the road as he tries to gain

171
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,440
Traction back and he's a little bit further back now

172
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,800
Um, so that's that's pretty helpful for you. Um, yeah, you have uh, uh, that's basically your action though. So

173
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,440
You're good there next

174
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
will be

175
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,600
um

176
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,440
The two other ken bones are now going to go so they're they're going to try to shoot at you guys

177
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
From the back rather than try to go up

178
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,640
Um what they're going to use are they're going to use their they're going to use a little these like little um

179
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,720
bombs that they have

180
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:11,200
um, so you see one of them just break through the windshield in the front and uh,

181
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,680
He's throwing uh, these like tiny little bombs at you

182
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,000
So guys roll the decks the decks throw the athletics checks in the animal handling again

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,120
These ken bones back shots are bomb

184
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,920
Oh

185
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,880
20 baby you got a yeah, we got 20. We got a nat 20 and we got a uh, uh,

186
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,460
Athletics 14 on the athletics. So yeah, okay Patrick Yoda and

187
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:40,140
Both Patrick Yoda and blowtoss piss you guys very easily weave out of these bombs. It's it's it's fucking easy for you guys

188
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:47,660
I think you mean Ray William Johnson. Oh, no, you do too though. I'm Johnson to something different because I say true Ray William Johnson

189
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:52,460
How do you how do you knock the bomb back at at the guy?

190
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:57,480
I secretly is entire through all three campaigns

191
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,800
I have a tennis racket with me.

192
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,800
Yes, right.

193
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,800
I forgot.

194
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:07,560
I, much like Bowser in Mario Tennis, I hit the bomb back towards him.

195
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,880
Yeah, you say "four" as you hit it back.

196
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,320
Yeah, I'm also, it's a golf sport too.

197
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,320
Yeah, exactly.

198
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
It's just a rock sport.

199
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
You say "Bowser."

200
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,360
I say "Bowser" and I hit it super hard.

201
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,920
And everybody dies except me.

202
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,560
Yeah, and the Ken Bone here, he goes "Bowser!"

203
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,040
And then the bomb just like, goes into his face.

204
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,520
But it also doesn't explode, it just gives him a concussion.

205
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
[laughter]

206
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
He can't take a concussion, he's fine.

207
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
It's like a cartoon Bowser bomb, it's not a fucking real bomb.

208
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Yeah.

209
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,520
He's like, "Ah, jeez!"

210
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,400
And you see the other Ken Bone in the driver's seat kick him out and like take the wheel

211
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
in his stead.

212
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,120
And that car is knocked further back now too.

213
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,720
Now the next Ken Bone is going to try to drive up and try to target you specifically.

214
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,080
This red one is...

215
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,760
Cameron that should be that should be Cameron. Yeah, so got a target target you specifically know the red ones not me. Oh, yeah

216
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,200
I'm the way it's not you. Yes, you're the black one. Yeah, they get Sullivan

217
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,760
Yeah, that's okay

218
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:17,440
So, yeah, he's gonna try to target you specifically blow toss after the Lotus Ray William Johnson after you did that so roll roll again

219
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:22,680
Athletics saving throw to see if you avoid his bullets. Bye. Yeah, he clips you

220
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,500
He clips you it's knocks you a little bit back, but not too far back

221
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:32,000
And now it is it's your turn Patrick Yoda

222
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,860
No, I will say Patrick your dark side abilities have subsided because it's been like enough time since you used it, but um, no

223
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,800
How fast is my hoverboard go?

224
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:51,040
Your hoverboard can go like what like probably 20 right probably right now faster than uh, I thought it went

225
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,040
I thought it went faster than the scooter. I thought it went...

226
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,040
You thought that?

227
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Yeah.

228
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,040
No, I thought it went... I thought it was like 60. I thought it could go 60.

229
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,040
It would go 60 feet. 60 feet maybe is what we said. Yeah.

230
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
Yeah.

231
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
It's different than 20 miles an hour.

232
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Like 30 miles an hour is like 480 feet a second or something.

233
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Or 260 feet a second.

234
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,040
Okay.

235
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,040
Yeah.

236
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:14,040
Or every 6 seconds. Whatever. I'm done.

237
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Okay.

238
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Um...

239
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,040
How close am I to the car?

240
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,360
Okay, let's take a look.

241
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
So there's the one that's near Caleb, right?

242
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
Yeah, the one near Caleb, I'd say you're about 25 feet from it.

243
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,560
Like, you're pretty, you're getting near it.

244
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Okay.

245
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,560
Yeah, ignore the measurements in the 20.

246
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,560
Got it.

247
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,560
Yeah.

248
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Oh, my athletics is pretty low.

249
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:39,560
Mm-hmm.

250
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
What?

251
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,560
Nothing.

252
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Give yourself 250 HP.

253
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,560
I saw that now.

254
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,560
Nothing.

255
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,560
You gave yourself 250 HP, I saw that now.

256
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,560
I'm gonna change it.

257
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,560
It was 25.

258
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,560
Okay, you just added a zero.

259
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:58,560
I don't know if I wanna...

260
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
I'm checking my inventory. I still have that Xbox from the...

261
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
You did take an Xbox.

262
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,560
Yeah.

263
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
So I'm 25 feet away.

264
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:15,800
away I would have to do an athletics to throw the Xbox into the windshield.

265
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,800
It's pretty cool.

266
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,080
Yeah, I think I'm gonna do that.

267
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,480
Alright, I'm gonna throw the Xbox into the windshield.

268
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,040
Okay, yeah, you're swinging it around by the wire.

269
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Yeah.

270
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Yeah.

271
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,040
And...

272
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,040
Oh!

273
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,040
You got a crit!

274
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,040
I got a crit!

275
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,040
I got a 20!

276
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,040
Oh!

277
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Okay, yeah, nasty.

278
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Describe how you do this, because that's pretty fucking...

279
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:44,040
So I'm swinging it around, and then the disc tray opens up somehow, and...

280
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,040
Yeah.

281
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Every Xbox game ever...

282
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,040
...enters my inventory.

283
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,040
And I go...

284
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,040
Every Xbox game ever comes out of the disc tray, and I go, "Oh, what the hell?!"

285
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,040
And I throw it.

286
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,540
I try to catch all of the Xbox games.

287
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,540
[laughter]

288
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,540
What a critical hit that is.

289
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:10,540
Wow.

290
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
Yeah, the Ken bone in the driver's seat is just like...

291
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,540
is just like...

292
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:18,540
it's like it came from nowhere. It's like directly in his blind spot.

293
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:22,540
And then like an entire Xbox takes up his field of vision.

294
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:25,540
And just like obliterates his skull.

295
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
And he just like rolls out of the car.

296
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:30,540
And another Ken bone has to move into the driver's seat.

297
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:36,380
is not way back now i have now have two copies of the opinion of the and i have

298
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:42,900
strength john was stranglehold yeah i've heard really good things about the

299
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,260
opinion of at least uh...

300
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:49,580
and uh... yeah you you you you crushes you crushes that one's had you did some

301
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,580
damage to the car by virtue of that

302
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,960
now uh...

303
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,780
now it is uh...

304
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,720
really johnson's turn

305
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,620
okay i'm gonna see my ride

306
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:01,620
Okay, cool. Make an intelligence check. Let's see what you get on this.

307
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,820
16.

308
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,520
Nice.

309
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:03,920
Yeah.

310
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,320
Okay, you sort of go into the the you hack into this Walmart

311
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,220
scooter, you know, everything is technologically based, right?

312
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:17,220
It's a it's a future and has like a hacker puzzle from like

313
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,220
video games where it's just like you have to like connect the

314
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:24,220
dots at the right time and then you can break in and you just

315
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:28,520
solve that easily and you're now your vehicle goes like 20

316
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,600
miles an hour faster.

317
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,920
And I put a playing card in the spokes of the bike.

318
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,720
Okay.

319
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:34,960
Yeah.

320
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,160
Yeah.

321
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,520
Yeah.

322
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,320
What, what, what, you guys hear this shit?

323
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,320
It's like going so fast.

324
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,720
Yeah.

325
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,440
The card like disintegrates.

326
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,480
But yeah, so you, you are not going to be easily like overtaken.

327
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,560
Cause that's what they're going to try to do is keep trying to get in front of you.

328
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:51,960
Okay.

329
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,520
I, it's going to be a lot harder for them now.

330
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,000
Pull as far ahead in front of blow toss and Patrick as possible.

331
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,320
Yeah.

332
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:57,560
Yeah.

333
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,800
Yeah, you're like up here. You're at the very edge of the map.

334
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,200
Yeah, be my dust.

335
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,800
But because of that, you're going to have to deal with what's coming up next.

336
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:07,720
So a few things that that happen on your journey down.

337
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,760
And so this time...

338
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,040
OK, I wish you'd told me that.

339
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,160
Yeah. No, no, no, no, no.

340
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,360
This is good. This is really good.

341
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,440
So let me...

342
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,840
I mean, my character has eyes.

343
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,720
He can fucking see what's in front of him, right?

344
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,520
Yeah. Yeah.

345
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,440
So you you like speed up and you're doing like the looking back

346
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:32,040
And then you turn forward like what and it's just like a whole like line of police cars

347
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:38,640
Sort of just like barricading the next juncture. You see one of the Ken bones on like a megaphone go like hey

348
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,000
Yeah, if you could slow down there, that'd be real great pal

349
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,080
We got yeah, I guess this ain't surrounded but you know, we're all right in front of you

350
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,800
And I guess I do know what we got guys behind you

351
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,960
We got you surrounded, but I thought about it a little bit more and I think we got you surrounded

352
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,120
So and so about the left and the right sides

353
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,640
Well, the left is to Iraq. Well, wait, why am I answering you? No, like I in the right is off the cliff

354
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:09,840
Look, I don't have to I don't have to I so yeah, you don't have a surrounded then

355
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,080
Stupid I have you as far as I spread this point. You're like passing as far as you're concerned. I do have you surrounded

356
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,920
What if we went up?

357
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
What we win

358
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,720
I guess you could you could you could try that I guess you could I use his body like a ramp

359
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:43,200
You say Patrick Yoda, well, what if we went up and he's like well, I guess you

360
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
(laughter)

361
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,200
Just roll over his face

362
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
(laughter)

363
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
As you coast

364
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
above him

365
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,200
and uh, and you see

366
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Sullivan point to that all and go

367
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
"DO THAT! DO THAT!"

368
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
To you, Blotas.

369
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
But now it's easier for them because now he's kinda

370
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
shaped like a little

371
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
He gets a run. There's tread.

372
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
His feet are stuck in the ground

373
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
and he's like curved at like a 45 degree angle.

374
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,440
There's grooves for you guys to hit now.

375
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:13,940
Yeah.

376
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,280
[LAUGHTER]

377
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,240
Yeah, roll an athletics check, both of you.

378
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,920
I'm going to pull that off.

379
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,280
Do I roll animal handling still?

380
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,560
Oh, yeah.

381
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,760
You can roll animal handling.

382
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,440
Oh, a nine.

383
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:22,920
Oh, shit.

384
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,420
OK.

385
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,800
What if I try athletics?

386
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,300
OK.

387
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:25,800
So--

388
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,080
[LAUGHTER]

389
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,800
So you guys try to use the grooves.

390
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,200
And you manage to get some air.

391
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:39,200
But you end up on the edge of the cars behind the blockade.

392
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,560
And you kind of spin out a bit.

393
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:44,760
So your vehicles suffer some damage because of that,

394
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,320
and you end up a little bit back.

395
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,160
- Damn it.

396
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,280
- But you do make it through.

397
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,160
Like that's, I mean, Ray William Johnson

398
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:55,960
did enough of a number that you guys like made it through,

399
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,080
but you just have to deal,

400
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,360
you just take a little bit of boo-boo.

401
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,200
- I need it.

402
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,300
I want an update on that Ken Bone later

403
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,000
to see if he's like become a ramp full time.

404
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,920
(laughing)

405
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,280
- I'm literally gonna make a note

406
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,400
so that I remembered an update on Ken Bone ramp.

407
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,480
So yeah, okay, so you make it through this blockade.

408
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,140
Now we're back to the top of the order

409
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,480
and it's that Ken Bone,

410
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,280
that first Ken Bone is gonna try again.

411
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,240
So he's gonna speed up.

412
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,960
He's gonna be able to take advantage of you guys

413
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,080
sort of like messing up the blockade a bit

414
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,800
and able to get in front of you.

415
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,400
And you see the back window,

416
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,680
another Ken Bone smashes his head through the back window

417
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:38,680
and drops and shoots, it takes out like a big bazooka,

418
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:42,120
shoots it and it's a really, looks like a,

419
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,400
- Yeah. - a really slow moving rocket

420
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,480
is coming towards you.

421
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,880
So both of you roll your saving throws,

422
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,280
athletics and, or you roll your checks

423
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
of athletics and animal handling.

424
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,880
- Meanwhile, I'm gonna-- - Before anything,

425
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,200
can I flip the rocket off?

426
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,400
- Yes, absolutely. - Will that do anything?

427
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,080
- No, but you can definitely do that.

428
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,220
me go to the night don't do it

429
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,220
a whole my god all i get a great

430
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,600
i got a good and a role you can see it and then your rules are

431
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,640
yeah

432
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,020
so as it approaches closer you start to realize that it looks like a

433
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,840
pregnant woman made to look like a sub

434
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,600
it's moving very slowly

435
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,240
and uh...

436
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,000
Patrick Yoda, you sort of do like a sick ass

437
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,800
like spinning out on your motorcycle

438
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,680
and then whipping around and going faster.

439
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:35,680
- Can I touch it?

440
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,820
Can I touch the rocket?

441
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,660
- Yeah, you can.

442
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,480
- Can I touch it?

443
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,840
Can I feel the belly to see if the baby's kicking?

444
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,080
- You feel a kick.

445
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,600
- Oh, yeah, I spin into like, I have my hand out

446
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,600
and I feel the kick and I go, "Oh."

447
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,480
(laughing)

448
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,160
And then I continue to spin out.

449
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,640
- Blowtoss, you sort of misjudged the timing on it

450
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
because it's moving so slow.

451
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,700
and but but with with that eleven you're able to sort of like

452
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,740
block it a bit with your pipe

453
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,160
and explode

454
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,500
works through the fire like to do the day to come out

455
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,480
uh... yeah quickly and it's it's a lot bigger than the ball it's a careful

456
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,800
custody touch them

457
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,100
the stuff that you need to fix the pick the

458
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,920
the

459
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,720
yet

460
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,920
camp campbell's i don't know what i try to i try to bat the the missile when i

461
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:27,920
I accidentally hit it right on the belly and yeah, you see the

462
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,720
baby fly in the air and it like goes to becomes like a teenager

463
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:33,820
of an adult than an old man and he dies.

464
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:35,020
It's a flying in the air.

465
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:41,020
And you take some damage cam your your bikes looking a little

466
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,020
messed up because you've taken some damage so far, but you're

467
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,520
doing okay, but it's not it's not looking ideal.

468
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,620
But now it is can camera hop onto my bike.

469
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,460
If push comes to shove if he wants to do that he can that might have to happen if his bike gets destroyed though

470
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,060
Yeah, so that's also why staying near each other is good, too. Um

471
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:03,180
uh, but now it is

472
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:06,620
Oh good god

473
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:09,180
Is your turn blow toss

474
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,980
Okay, um

475
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,500
How how far is it from where because we're behind the car?

476
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,940
How far is it from where I am right now to the front of the car?

477
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,060

478
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,060

He's like, ah, it's like feet are dangling.

00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,820
You're just like trying to knock him through.

506
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:36,520
Just for my turn.

507
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,720
I want to know how close I am to the car.

508
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,520
Okay.

00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,120
Yeah, you're also about you're actually closer to like 20 feet

because you didn't get hit by the bomb.

511
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,520
You sort of like found a way to get through it.

512
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,320
Okay, but am I near the car?

513
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,520
Yeah, it's pretty near. It's up to you. What do you think of 20 feet?

514
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,020
Yeah.

515
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,820
All right.

516
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:54,620
So yeah, and so yeah, Sullivan's in the back seat.

517
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,220
So yeah, you'd manage to take the car.

518
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,620
That was a smart move.

519
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,600
But yeah, and so the bike meanwhile just sort of like spins out and just

520
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,020
like falls away.

521
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:07,100
I'm going to just keep it here though because it does have your stats

522
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:07,520
on it.

523
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,220
And yeah, it is now your turn.

524
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,820
Oh, no, it's the Ken Bones turn now the other two.

525
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,120
So the other two are going to try to ride up

526
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,040
on uh... patrick you know that was the first behind a try to uh...

527
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:24,260
she with their guns against a role that animal handling check

528
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:27,000
and for twice so we can just you too

529
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,160
okay i got a twenty three ended crippled yes so uh... the first one you dislike

530
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,220
continue to spin it's been do sick

531
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:36,820
moves deflect with your lightsaber

532
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,620
uh... sandwich is very easy for you

533
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,080
uh... you get a little cocky

534
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,040
one of the bullets just flies directly into like one of the

535
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,540
bikes engines and flies up and then just like nixie when the

536
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:53,180
nose and then you just like you just like spin out and you're

537
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,500
like now in between the two of these cars are sandwiched

538
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,300
between them.

539
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:59,900
That dad and he booped

540
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,660
was a crit one.

541
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:05,900
And yeah, your your cars now your bikes now sort of in the

542
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,700
shape that that that blow tosses was and you're sort of like

543
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:10,660
sandwiched between them.

544
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,980
But I'm gonna Ken bones. So it's one Ken bone in each car,

545
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,300
right?

546
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,400
There was there was two you guys sort of like took care of the Ken bones and all the cars by

547
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,320
killing them

548
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,040
Um, but now there's like one in each. Yeah at this point. Okay. All right. I'm just making sure yeah, okay

549
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,080
Um, how much damage did that hit do to me?

550
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:37,120
Um, oh, we're just doing like car damage for now. So don't worry about that. I'm tracking your car damage. Um,

551
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:43,440
Okay, cool. So now, um as you guys are kind of coming up on the next uh,

552
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:50,560
So another thing comes up and it's it's it's you get a call you hear your phone ringing again

553
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:59,680
Patrick Yoda and this time it's it's a it's your mom your mom's calling you.

554
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:10,000
Oh hell yeah yeah okay good she's beautiful. Oh god okay do you want to pick up not right now

555
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,340
Pick up the phone. Hi, sweetie. Hi, Patty. How you doing?

556
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:25,060
My what do you fucking do? I can't fucking pick up the farm in the middle of the biggest car chase of my fucking life

557
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,980
Oh, I understand honey. It can be very difficult

558
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,640
You do

559
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,600
Your friends are so wonderful. You want to come over for dinner?

560
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:49,800
Roll a wisdom saving throw as you're trying to fend off

561
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:54,160
Your friends if I were 700 years older and green

562
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:01,840
25 okay. Yeah, you're used to your mom getting nosy dealing with her nonsense, and she's sort of like

563
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:09,100
I'm getting confused by my phone again. I I I need to go, but you make sure you're getting enough rest

564
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,860
and you're drinking enough water

565
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,860
Yeah mom, I'm drinking so much fucking water

566
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,860
Can you just get off the phone

567
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,860
We're taking good care of him

568
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
You got your father's mouth on you I swear

569
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:22,140
Hey, bat, stop sucking my dick

570
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,140
Hey, come on

571
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:26,140
Come on, that's my fucking mom on the phone

572
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Get that poop out of your mouth

573
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
What are you fucking doing?

574
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
Stop smoking poop like weed

575
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
I'm not smoking poop, how do I even do that?

576
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
She hugged up like 4 minutes ago

577
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:45,340
minutes. Okay. Yeah. And yeah now it's it's it's it's oh **** I

578
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,380
guess that that you took care of that Ken Bone. So now it's

579
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,540
your turn. Blowtoss piss. Um well, you're in the car now.

580
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,860
Yeah. Ken Bone was in. Um can I slow down some so Patrick can

581
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:00,620
try and jump onto the car? Yeah, absolutely. Alright. Uh

582
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:04,540
yeah, I slow down to try and get Patrick into the car. Okay,

583
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:08,280
cool. All right. So yeah, you end up back there. And so on

584
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,420
Patrick's turn, he's gonna be able to have advantage jumping

585
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,780
into the car. That's what he chooses. I guess. Can I take an

586
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,120
action to? Yeah, okay. Yeah, I'll just try and I guess shoot

587
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:21,120
the windshield of one of the Ken bones that sandwiching.

588
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,720
Patrick, okay, wait, did they leave any whip? Was there a

589
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,580
bazooka left in this car? Oh, was there? Oh, yeah, there would

590
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:32,680
be. All right. Yeah, blow one of them up. Okay. Yeah, you can get

591
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,800
Sullivan to do that because you're driving. Yeah, Sullivan. Yeah, so he does exactly what I want perfectly

592
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:43,460
You sure you need me to shoot this? I don't I've never I'm driving Sullivan. Oh my god

593
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,660
Fucking focus. Okay, okay

594
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:50,120
And he he sort of like

595
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,300
bangs through the windshield glass with the

596
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:57,920
Rocket and he like he gets a little scared and he um, he's like just sort of wagging around

597
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:18,800
out

598
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:38,520
a

599
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,760
how he does. He face plants against the plexiglass. I'm hoping. Yeah.

600
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,320
I hate that. Yeah, no, he absolutely just hits his head on the back of the car.

601
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,520
He's like, "Ah, shit!" He's just like, he's like concussed almost.

602
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,520
And he just sort of like sits back down into the back seat. And that'd killed him.

603
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:03,720
As he sits back down, the gun just goes off again, because he just drops the bazooka,

604
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,720
and it just goes straight up into the air.

605
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,720
and we see this submarine exploding and you're like "WAAA!"

606
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
like as it does.

607
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,720
Um, uh yeah, so that's your turn.

608
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:19,720
Now these two Ken Bones are gonna try to do a little bit of a crunching maneuver on you, Patrick Yoda.

609
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
I bet they don't do it.

610
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,720
Um, uh, well let's, hey, let's find out as a family, alright?

611
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:32,720
So, they're going to, what is it, oh yeah yeah yeah, roll a DC check to see.

612
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,460
With this you're gonna do a decent disadvantage on animal handling

613
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:38,680
Mm-hmm

614
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,920
Okay that eight. Yeah, they like go they like just go

615
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,100
And like just shake and bake you just like trying to squish you a little bit. You're you see your bike is sort of like

616
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:51,040
Taking some serious damage

617
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,040
Yeah, I will tell you now

618
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:57,600
As far as my how I keep track of this goes your bikes at like one

619
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:05,520
So it's not looking good. One million. That's no. So one, right? Yeah, one what? It could be one million.

620
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:11,480
Could be one million. I mean if you think about it the way that we invented math, it just it's like it could be anything.

621
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,360
So it's your turn Patrick.

622
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,000
So this is a concept.

623
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:24,320
Math is like a concept. It's like invented by society to try and like combine us all into like one one person.

624
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,960
So you guys gonna have been on Chappel already? So we'll just read.

625
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:34,500
as smart or will it be before Chapo and it'll sound like bullshit. Gear up.

626
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:39,660
How far away is Cameron? Cameron's pretty close. Cameron's like a good like 10 feet from you.

627
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:45,600
If I tell Cameron to do something will that count? I'll allow it this time.

628
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,100
Okay. What are you trying to do though? Because I could have Cameron

629
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,900
because they're like trying to squish me with the cars right now.

630
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,820
That's right. What I could do is Sullivan has broken the window out so if Cameron

631
00:33:55,820 --> 00:34:01,380
just rams in the in between I could just run up I could like hover or maybe

632
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,820
hoverboard I don't know. Okay so here's what you can do because like in the turn

633
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:12,300
order Cameron does go next yeah or goes before everyone else so if you could

634
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:16,540
ready your hoverboard and then Cam does it because he already sort of set you up

635
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,660
for a jump you'll have an automatic success if you do that. And I'll have advantage with that?

636
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:24,700
Yeah. Okay. Yeah basically automatic success so I would say you could ready

637
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,020
your hoverboard this turn and that's sort of your action.

638
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,260
Okay, so I'm going to do that. I'll ready my hoverboard.

639
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:32,380
Okay, cool. So you sort of get it out. You're sort of like balancing on it

640
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
while you're on the bike. I'm saying you're pro.

641
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:38,140
I have not had good luck with the hoverboard.

642
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:42,860
Yeah, I don't think you've ever succeeded using the hoverboard.

643
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,620
Hey, the times they are, it's Ray William Johnson's turn.

644
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:51,020
So what do you want to do? Oh shit. I'm way far ahead, right?

645
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,420
You're way far ahead.

646
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:54,520
OK, so I have it in my head after that

647
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,220
ramp stunt that I'm like, like an evil,

648
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,360
Knievel level like stunt man.

649
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,320
So I just start doing like a like a headstand on the bike.

650
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,660
OK, yeah. Roll an athletics check.

651
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,460
OK, that 14.

652
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:10,160
Yeah, you do a handstand, but you kind of do the kind of handstand

653
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,860
where you're like, oh, headstand like a like a breakdancer.

654
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,460
Oh, OK. And being on my head.

655
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,960
Yeah. 14 is not going to cut it with a headstand.

656
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I have a flat head, I'm a computer.

657
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,160
No, you're a demon with a computer in your back.

658
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,160
Okay, well actually my horns dig into the material on the motorcycle.

659
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,160
Okay.

660
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,160
And...

661
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
Got yo ass.

662
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:36,160
And, uh, you just like, left to slow down a little bit to pull it off, is what I'll say.

663
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,160
I speed it up.

664
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:39,160
No, do you speed it up?

665
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,160
I speed it up.

666
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
It's gonna be a very different result.

667
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,160
I don't care.

668
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,160
Okay.

669
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,160
Yo, I'm evil Knievel right now.

670
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Roll a dexterity saving throw.

671
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:56,840
that 10 okay your bike just like fucking you spit out like your bikes like like sliding all over

672
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:04,200
the place and um actually as you're doing that you're coming up uh um you're coming up on a uh

673
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:14,280
a uh a gap friendship over so uh there's a gap now coming up okay and and you can you might spin

674
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,760
now and just fall off the gap. Okay. Don't do something quick. I speed up even more to

675
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:30,800
clear the gap. Okay, roll roll that fun. I'm not gonna die, dude. I'm gonna I'm like, this

676
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:40,140
is crazy. Go for it. All right. 19. I said it was crazy. You just like fucking use try

677
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:47,260
to speed up and you just like like almost like crash into the wall fall down this gap into

678
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:55,820
oh my god you fall right into nickelodeon slime yeah oh it was on purpose that was the stunt

679
00:36:55,820 --> 00:37:01,420
yeah and you're uh yeah your your your bike is totaled um you can do you guys are sort of like

680
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:06,700
spiraling down but he got a 19 how did that because he did so much dumb shit before that

681
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,900
Yeah, and so the difficulty classes kept going up and up and up.

682
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,700
So you're now stuck in this Nickelodeon Gak.

683
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:19,000
You take three damage from the Gak, the Nickelodeon Slime.

684
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,780
So what happened, what it is now is you're like in this pit of

685
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:27,880
slime that was in this gap and you can see that the next like

686
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,780
round of like racing that they're on, like, you know, you're

687
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,080
going to, you could jump potentially onto your friend's

688
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,580
cars or Ken bones car if you time it right if you wait after your next turn

689
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:44,580
okay I will time it right yeah okay so the rest of you though you all have to

690
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:47,700
clear this gap - you just saw Ray William Johnson just like try to do a headstand

691
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:55,300
and then just eat shit so you gotta do you can obviously just do a straight

692
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:00,580
check or you can try to be more creative if you think that'll help hmm we could

693
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:09,460
rocket jump over it with the bazooka that's true that's not a bad idea okay

694
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:14,060
right it's not a bad idea okay so very good idea if you can do that Patrick

695
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:16,540
you have to get into the car yeah I'm gonna say Pat you gotta roll your

696
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:22,580
athletics check now let's resolve that that's more fun yeah yeah you just like

697
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:28,020
fucking like like do us a kickflip and just like fucking and then nose manual

698
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,820
right into the car and just just slap Sullivan the head with the board and just like

699
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:42,660
and you're now sitting next to him in the backseat of the car and he's just like rubbing his little

700
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:51,300
frog snout and he's like oh good to see you okay and yeah so you made it in so now

701
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,660
you want to grab the rocket launcher and do it yourself or do you want Sullivan to do it

702
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:58,660
I mean, it's up to you.

703
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,660
I'll do it myself.

704
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:02,660
Yeah, it's definitely a better move.

705
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,660
Yeah.

706
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,660
Because Solven's a really bad shot.

707
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,660
Yeah.

708
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,660
So yeah, just roll an attack roll with Dex as the modifier.

709
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,660
Just roll...

710
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,660
I'd say you're proficient with this.

711
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,660
So just roll...

712
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,660
Let me see your fucking character sheet.

713
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:21,660
It should be something you could do that'll make it easier to roll.

714
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,660
Yeah, just roll the hoverboard...

715
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:33,660
hoverboard... what does that say? Hoverboard Boomerang.

716
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,660
That's going to be an indicator of how well you do at this.

717
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Okay, nice. You didn't have advantage on it, but

718
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:45,660
14 is still fine. Yeah, you use that and you guys rocket launch over this gap.

719
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:49,660
You see the slime below you, you see Ray William Johnson doing

720
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:53,660
backstrokes in the slime. It doesn't blow up the gas tank, too.

721
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,660
No, it does not and you guys make it over the uh, the gap. Um,

722
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,340
so

723
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,860
uh now

724
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:06,940
Uh as you guys are sort of cruising down to the next part of the hill, uh next part of the gap is your turn blowtoss piss

725
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:09,900
Um, you're up. Um, I keep driving

726
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:11,820
Yeah

727
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,740
You're not gonna try to attack the I tell solvent to shoot more to shoot more rockets at the car. Okay?

728
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:21,020
Yeah, solvent's gonna try again. He's just gonna continue to probably

729
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:28,080
Miss unless he somehow does really well right now. Holy shit. He got it. He got a crit 20

730
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,300
He takes out

731
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:37,580
Let's go

732
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:43,740
I'll screenshot it. So you now i'm gaming dude. I tapped the brakes again and that's what makes him do it

733
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm screenshotting it just so you know, but that happened. Okay. Um

734
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:52,260
yet so you use tap the brakes and so it'd like

735
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:54,900
something in him just like clicks

736
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,300
for the first moment in his life

737
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,680
he's always been just like the part of the joke that the we've the

738
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,540
happy-go-lucky loser and something in him just fucking

739
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:07,700
clicks and he just like

740
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,580
so it gets like a it's a little bit snap

741
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,940
you know

742
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,340
i think it's just like i'm not going to look over patrick you know you could

743
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,780
swear he has like a chad job

744
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,780
for like half a second.

745
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,780
He looks like the like

746
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,780
the like uh

747
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,780
handsome uh like

748
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,780
Joe Biden Pepe

749
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,780
that like 4chan people post.

750
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,780
He just looks perfect and he just shoots

751
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,780
his rocket and it just blows up

752
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,780
one of these cars straight up. It just blows

753
00:41:35,780 --> 00:41:37,780
it up and he's like

754
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,780
"What have I done?"

755
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,780
Just staring at him like

756
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:51,480
like, oh, wow.

757
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,980
And the the other car is now starting to pull back and he's

758
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,280
gonna take out the gun and try to shoot you guys roll roll

759
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:00,980
athletics.

760
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:05,480
Blow toss 20.

761
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,680
Yeah, you easily just sort of like maneuver out of the way

762
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,080
these bullets Patrick Yoda.

763
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,780
It's now your turn.

764
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,080
You're in the backseat of this car.

765
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,880
Keep in mind, you know that Ray William Johnson's probably

766
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,840
to want to try to jump through.

767
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,720
You don't know that for sure though.

768
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,800
He might just chill there.

769
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,720
So should I make room for him?

770
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,760
I don't know, just like the stuff you can do, or you can try to attack this car too behind

771
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,760
you.

772
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,760
Oh, okay.

773
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,440
So is there two bazookas in the car or is it just one?

774
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,440
Just the one.

775
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,920
Okay, should I take the...

776
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:44,120
Yeah, should I just try to blow it up?

777
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:53,760
you're deciding to do this, you Patrick Yoda in particular, see a really weird bird just

778
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,760
sort of off in the distance. Do you see that on your screen?

779
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,760
No. I have to fix that. I rolled 20.

780
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,720
Is that the uncle's falcon?

781
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:09,800
Here, let me, there we go. You see a really weird bird. Do you see it now?

782
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Oh yeah.

783
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,880
Oh fuck! No!

784
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:28,360
the

785
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,360
For the fans, it's a shoebill stork.

786
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,360
That's one of my most hated birds.

787
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:36,360
You're like, "Oh, maybe he's kind of friendly. Maybe he's a little silly."

788
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,360
You're not sure anymore. He could be silly.

789
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Oh, I don't trust those eyes on that bird.

790
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
Yeah, roll a wisdom saving throw.

791
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,360
Ten.

792
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Okay. Yeah, your mind is a little confused by this bird.

793
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:56,360
And whatever you were trying to do, you're just way too focused on this weird bird.

794
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:02,880
You're just like getting upset looking at it to do anything. Why the fuck does it look like that? Yeah

795
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,280
Come on, look at the fucking thing

796
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:10,480
You've like passed by it and Sullivan's like what are you talking about? Where?

797
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,520
It is now that

798
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:17,160
that

799
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,180
Cars turn or that Ken bones turn. Oh, you already went here to try to shoot you

800
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,040
so it's now your turn Ray William Johnson and

801
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,380
Are they here in the slime that I jump or no? Yeah, they're coming down but before that happens

802
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:36,040
Ring ring ring ring. Hello. Ray William Johnson. It's me your mother

Wow, he does look like a mom.

826
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,680

828
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:09,000
what do you say to her to just shut her down trying to like connect with you after all this?

829
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:15,160
Well, I'm getting a call. I just got a call. Dad died. All right, bye.

830
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:18,920

00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:25,700
Okay, now you can make that jump.

833
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,200
Okay, I jump on to whichever whoever will have me.

00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,280
So it's kind of slow moving and you kind of like don't get as

838
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,280
much air as you think you're going to get and you kind of

839
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:49,280
miss time and as the car is speeding by so you're not going

840
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,700
to land on the Patrick Yoda blowtoss Sullivan car.

841
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:59,700
But roll a Dexterity saving throw to see if you can position yourself to land on the Ken Bone one instead.

842
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:00,700
17.

843
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:06,700
Yeah, nice. So you just like fall through the front and you're in the passenger seat next to the Ken Bone.

844
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:08,700
Oh, this is awkward.

845
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:13,700
Okay, yeah. What do you want to do? You have a chance to attack him for sure.

846
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:17,700
I get really nervous and I put my hand on his leg.

847
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,700
*laughter*

848
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:21,700
He's like, "Oh, ah, God!

849
00:47:21,700 --> 00:47:23,700
I- not since college I-"

850
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,700
and, uh, he starts like to

851
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:27,700
swerve a little bit.

852
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,700
While he's off guard, like, he fuckin' caves

853
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,700
his face in. Yeah, roll with attack,

854
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,700
roll with advantage, roll with the, uh,

855
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,700
USB, uh, blade.

856
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:37,700
Oh my God.

857
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,700
Yeah, you gotta

858
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:41,700
crit, so you just like, hit him with

859
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,700
the butt of the blade and it just crushes his skull in

860
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,700
like Mortal Kombat, and he's just like,

861
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:49,300
the completely you had a moment of like maybe like a

862
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:53,060
my old sexual awakening maybe you might learn a little bit about himself

863
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,820
yeah i wanted to hurt more yeah yeah right and so he's just completely dead

864
00:47:56,820 --> 00:47:59,540
you kick him out of the driver's seat you're in the car now

865
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:04,580
uh... you guys you guys are now sort of approaching you see a

866
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,700
as your uh... as you're driving past and since you've

867
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:12,460
defeated everybody uh... you drive past what looks like at first a uh...

868
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:16,500
A giant donut and then you realize that it's a 10 Ken Bones in a donut costume

869
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:25,040
And you guys just drive past that event you're not distracted by it it doesn't affect you you guys make it through this fine

870
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,940
and

871
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:37,780
Hey, can we turn around and go find that bird

872
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:46,040
You look up at the sky and you see the bird flying but its head is come turn towards you the entire time

873
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:49,460
It is flying away up in the air and it's just looking down

874
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:59,460
Is this fucking bird never mind, I'm sorry for interruptions

875
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:11,380
Yeah, all of the DM lines happen in Patrick Yoda's head.

876
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:11,880
Yeah.

877
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,380
[LAUGHTER]

878
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:16,080
He hears every last one of them.

879
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:17,980
He's used none of that to his advantage.

880
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:18,480
No.

881
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:18,980
No, I did.

882
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,740
I did try to persuade you once.

883
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:21,340
That's true.

884
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,620
And you were successful at it.

885
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,540
So you are using it to your advantage.

886
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:25,140
Yeah.

887
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,460
All right, so you guys reached the bottom of the hill.

888
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:32,700
You guys bested all the traps and all the little silliness.

889
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:35,060
And you're approaching sort of now the open field

890
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:42,100
where the mountainous, you're probably past the mountainous outskirts of Gadsville and

891
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,020
towards the open field where your ship is located. All of you roll a perception check.

892
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,020
8.

893
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,620
I have a pretty high perception, I'm confident.

894
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,620
14.

895
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:51,620
21.

896
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:54,700
Nice, okay. So I need to use perception more.

897
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:00,020
I'll say you do. Cameron, your mic sounds weird.

898
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,620
Yeah, your mic sounds kind of weird, dude.

899
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:03,620
Okay.

900
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:04,620
It sounds better now.

901
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:08,120
Yeah, it sounds weird because you're talking, bitch. What's up?

902
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,120
Oh!

903
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:15,120
I was not... I thought it sounded weird for a different reason, but it was a pretty good burn.

904
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,120
I thought it was because he was talking.

905
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,120
Hmm. Are you gonna cry?

906
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,120
What?

907
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,120
Crying right now?

908
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,120
Yeah, I'm crying right now.

909
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,120
You fucking idiot!

910
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,120
I got him, guys!

911
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:30,120
Yeah, Pat, are you gonna cry?

912
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,120
I'm leaving the call. I'll do it again.

913
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,120
Please don't leave the call.

914
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:35,720
I did it once, I'll do it again.

915
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:37,720
Please don't leave the call.

916
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:39,420
So yeah, as you're approaching it,

917
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:43,220
Blotas, you're focusing a little too much on driving right now,

918
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:46,720
but Patrick Yoda and Ray William Johnson,

919
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:49,120
you guys notice because this is the open field where,

920
00:50:49,120 --> 00:50:53,420
you know, a lot of the airships and sort of like sky vehicles are parked,

921
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:58,920
as well as, you know, where there's enough space for the Gateway GADCOW.

922
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:03,640
And you see the udders are like have this like red light

923
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:07,480
Like sort of pulsing through it

924
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,800
Um, and as you see that

925
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:13,640
You look down towards where your ship is and all three of you can see this

926
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:18,600
and you see just like along the horizon like a sea of

927
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:26,760
Uh of ken bones and more serious looking armed police officers who have vehicles and weaponry

928
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:32,840
all along that. So we take out the thing that's doing the red light?

929
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:36,440
Leo patches in to talk to you guys. He says,

930
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:41,960
I should have waited. No, it's fine. My Jollibee's have been compromised and

931
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,840
you guys look back and you see a couple of Jollibee's like with their

932
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,400
hands cuffed and they're just like their heads are

933
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:53,320
against the like hood of the car, the police cars.

934
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:57,080
And he said they're really taking this far. The guys probably want to make an

935
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,840
example of gun city through this.

936
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:05,960
I, I, you know, I, I, look, if you want, you could try to push through, but if you do,

937
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:11,040
it'll be a massacre and I don't know if I'll be able to help you, you know, look, if you

938
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:15,280
get the inward pass, and even if you do, if it doesn't prove to be as much use as the

939
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:19,960
legend say, well, it just might be back to being executed for you three.

940
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:24,640
You could definitely try to push through, but just, you know, there, I have other sky

941
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:31,840
galleons if you could find another way to wherever you need to go so we guys want

942
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,440
to do I looked to the the the corpse of the kin bone sitting next to me in the

943
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:47,640
police car and I say you think it what I'm thinking you see like a bit of its

944
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:57,960
skull like drop from the top of his head. Yeah, and then I using my computer vision computation,

945
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:04,760
I decide which of the Ken bones looks the most like a ramp and I am going to jump. I'm going

946
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,600
to jump on. Okay, you guys gonna follow his lead? There's a bunch of Ken bones on top of the

947
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:17,480
so we could all get murdered right now. This could go in a few different directions. You can either

948
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:39,400
the

949
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:46,400
risk

950
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:51,960
you

951
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,640
among

952
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,160
you haven't talked to patrick you know the effect

953
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:59,960
i have a good idea to go off his headphones he's not listening anymore

954
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,440
uh... he literally can't hear us right now

955
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,560
uh... i don't know i don't understand the situation

956
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:15,340
listen to it. So in front of you right now is I just have the

957
00:54:15,340 --> 00:54:18,860
radio turned on and I'm just dancing here all day. It's

958
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,460
Fortnite. Yeah. All the in front of you is like a line of of

959
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:26,460
cops and it's just would be so it would be tough to break

960
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:30,380
through them and to get to your Sky Galleon and if you do, Leo

961
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:35,020
is essentially saying like you are out on parole basically to

962
00:54:35,020 --> 00:54:39,380
get the n-word pass for him and if you do it you're free right technically you

963
00:54:39,380 --> 00:54:44,260
were supposed to be executed but if you do enough shit to these Ken Bone people

964
00:54:44,260 --> 00:54:49,180
like it's gonna get to a point where right you can't vouch for you anymore

965
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:55,780
right so I'm thinking we can't we can't jump it because that's gonna work we'll

966
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:59,420
get that we'll get the pass and then we'll just fucking it doesn't matter

967
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:02,780
we'll die at the end of the campaign I don't want to die at the end of the

968
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:09,680
campaign I want to reap I want to reap what I sow you want to get as many uses

969
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:15,960
out of that n-word pass as possible exactly so I'm I'm thinking we we get

970
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,200
the F out of here we can we can go to the okay so if we go around we can tell

971
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,120
him to put a sky Caleb put your headphones back on cuz you're gonna want

972
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,080
to hear this no you're gonna want to hear it you guys can do whatever you

973
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:44,420
want how is he Caleb Caleb we're gonna jump I don't know okay spooky I'm weird

974
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:50,700
so what I'm thinking of doing is we can do you can turn around and jump onto the

975
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,620
other can on you Kayla can you tell what I'm saying you want to turn around and

976
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:55,620
jump on to the other.

977
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:57,740
Alright he's doing some bad stuff.

978
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,680
You got your headphones unplugged.

979
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,680
No way.

980
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:03,100
No he can just hear them he just has it turned up loud.

981
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,100
Yeah that's obvious.

982
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:06,420
I didn't even think about that.

983
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,420
That's smart.

984
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:12,140
Yeah I'm thinking we could turn around to ramp Ken Bone.

985
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,140
And then.

986
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,140
Go back to ramp Ken Bone.

987
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:18,300
Yeah go back to ramp Ken Bone and have Leo put a Sky Galleon near it.

988
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:23,140
Because we could contact him.

989
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,860
has to pilot the sky galleon though and the jolly bees are out of it.

990
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:31,700
Well doesn't he have more? He's got he's a fucking billionaire he's got more shit.

991
00:56:31,700 --> 00:56:35,460
He doesn't have more sky galleons. Oh like another sky galleon. Yeah.

992
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:40,100
Yeah. Hmm. But does he have a sky galleon nearby? That's the question because he kind of...

993
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:45,620
He said he did. He says he has more sky galleons not like one nearby. I jump onto the

994
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:49,420
galleon. Are you guys gonna try to jump on the galleon? I don't want to I don't

995
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,900
want to try to jump on the galleon. You can split this we can do this we can do

996
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,420
this where Patrick Yoda tries to find another way and the other two

997
00:56:55,420 --> 00:57:00,340
characters try to get on the galleon. I plug my radio back in for one moment.

998
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:11,740
I say, "Hey Pat, you there?" "Yeah, what's up?" "Listen bud, it's been a fun ride, but I

999
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:12,940
I gotta do this.

1000
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,580
(singing)

1001
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:15,420
For me.

1002
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:18,300
Yeah, I become CGI in the car.

1003
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,740
(laughing)

1004
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,580
Yeah.

1005
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,400
Listen,

1006
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,340
if I don't make it,

1007
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:26,620
call my mom

1008
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,820
and also tell her my father is dead.

1009
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:32,060
(laughing)

1010
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:33,620
It's been a wild ride, bud.

1011
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:34,660
Let's do this.

1012
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:36,020
I'll see you on the other side.

1013
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:36,940
Let's do this.

1014
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:37,780
Okay.

1015
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:41,460
Patrick Yoda, you're accepting this?

1016
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:44,340
I'm in the car with Cameron.

1017
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:46,340
I can't choose anyone.

1018
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,340
I'm just trying to convince everybody.

1019
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,340
Oh yeah, blow toss, what do you do?

1020
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:52,340
Are you going for it too?

1021
00:57:52,340 --> 00:57:54,340
I'm like, guys, I don't want to fucking do this.

1022
00:57:54,340 --> 00:57:56,340
What if I teleport into the car with Caleb

1023
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:58,340
and let Patrick take control?

1024
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,340
So it's me and Sullivan?

1025
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:02,340
You can do that.

1026
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,340
I'm gonna do that.

1027
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,340
[laughter]

1028
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:08,340
Okay, so here we go.

1029
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,740
- There you go, so you two.

1030
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:13,140
- No, I take Sullivan with me and Caleb too.

1031
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,140
- I don't take Sullivan with you.

1032
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:18,380
- You know, I was kinda trying to do a lone wolf thing,

1033
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:20,420
but you know what, this works too.

1034
00:58:20,420 --> 00:58:25,300
- Hey man, and I changed the radio channel to my music

1035
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:26,140
to annoy Caleb.

1036
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:29,140
- Well, this is, I'm having second thoughts about this jump.

1037
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:30,180
(laughing)

1038
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:31,740
- I put my, I'm sitting in the back seat

1039
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,660
and I put my feet up on his headrest

1040
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,140
and he can smell my feet.

1041
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:38,900
I want to die as fast as possible now.

1042
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:44,100
This is the pivotal moment in the story here.

1043
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,100
Let's do this.

1044
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,940
I'm going to, can I, on the way, okay.

1045
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:50,260
Can I, I'm in a new vehicle now.

1046
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:56,100
Can I spend one turn on my way to jump him, or jump on top of, or through the kin bone

1047
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:59,500
ramp, man, can I soup up my cop car?

1048
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:03,700
Wait, can I go into the cop car now that he's souping it up?

1049
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,100
You're in your own cop car.

1050
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:06,940
How are you going to get in there though? You can't teleport.

1051
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:07,940
Cameron teleport back.

1052
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:08,940
I teleport back.

1053
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:15,500
I teleport back with Sullivan and then I teleport back and shake Patrick and leave Sullivan.

1054
00:59:15,500 --> 00:59:17,340
No, dude.

1055
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:18,340
Bring him back too.

1056
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,780
Okay, I teleport back to Sullivan.

1057
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:23,580
Sullivan vomits from all the teleporting.

1058
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:29,380
Just molecules being reanimated over and over again.

1059
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,380
Yeah.

1060
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:31,380
Yeah.

1061
00:59:31,380 --> 00:59:32,380
Okay.

1062
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:33,740
I turn Freebird on the radio too.

1063
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:34,740
That's right.

1064
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:38,100
the the the part of the song is the solos playing when jenny looks like she's

1065
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:42,140
gonna jump off the building in forrest gump that's the that part playing

1066
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,740
uh... okay

1067
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,100
intelligence check

1068
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,420
ray william johnson

1069
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:48,580
intelligence

1070
00:59:48,580 --> 00:59:52,820
just soup up the car

1071
00:59:52,820 --> 00:59:56,580
you've amply found a way to sort of soup this up you you go in there into the

1072
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:57,900
you sort of hack in

1073
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:58,980
this time it's uh...

1074
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:02,460
it's uh... blocks it's a little bit blocks you just have to spell out hack

1075
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,020
with the blocks and you do it

1076
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:06,340
uh... and now the car is

1077
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:08,100
a little bit faster

1078
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:09,620
which means that difficulty

1079
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:12,060
check is a difficulty class a little bit lower on this

1080
01:00:12,060 --> 01:00:13,140
but still

1081
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,980
i'm gonna tell you now

1082
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,180
it is

1083
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:18,060
at an eighteen

1084
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:19,620
to pull this off

1085
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:24,940
can we, can me and cameron try to super this car too?

1086
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:26,820
now that you've committed to this, i'm telling you now

1087
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,140
me and cameron can also teleport back to the other car

1088
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:48,140
I'm

1089
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:54,140
If you want to take the wheel, I what's your athletics bonus rate - 7 so I'll turn wheel

1090
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:57,940
Okay, switch up the wheels. Yeah, I'll let you switch

1091
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:01,340
All right

1092
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:10,780
But in the game, I'm a little like jealous that he was

1093
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,900
Well, you know, I mean I I did that earlier so like

1094
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:21,940
Before the jump happens, I know that it's like a 26 and I just go like, "Aww!"

1095
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:26,500
And that's when Cameron floors it.

1096
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:30,100
Do we find like a Ken Bone who is just perfectly shaped?

1097
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,300
A couple of things happen.

1098
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:38,020
So part of why the difficulty class was high was because the cow was charging up what were udders,

1099
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,380
udder lasers, and it started shooting them out at you guys.

1100
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,940
With that 26, you're weaving between the lasers.

1101
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:48,660
You almost predict where they're going to be used.

1102
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,660
It's insulting.

1103
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:54,660
And as you approach this massive group of Ken Bones,

1104
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:56,660
and also armored Ken Bones,

1105
01:01:56,660 --> 01:02:01,660
one of them says,

1106
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,660
"Would you please step out of the vehicle?"

1107
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,660
And then you start to realize that he says,

1108
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:11,660
"I heard that my brother turned into a ramp, so I don't..."

1109
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,660
I'm a little concerned.

1110
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,660
Wait, he turns into-

1111
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,660
He's wearing shoes that are just like a perfect like quarter pipe.

1112
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:20,660
*laughter*

1113
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,660
He's the Bob Bernquist loop.

1114
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,660
Like the fucking-

1115
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,660
The loops that they have in Tony Hawk, but he's also got like a kicker at the end.

1116
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,660
Yeah.

1117
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,660
He's just- His brother turned into a ramp, and he just is a ramp.

1118
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:34,660
And he's the one with the radio.

1119
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:39,660
He's like 30 feet tall and 30 feet wide.

1120
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:41,660
*laughter*

1121
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,660
And you just do a loop-de-loop with this guy's body.

1122
01:02:44,660 --> 01:02:45,660
*laughter*

1123
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,660
Like, as he's trying to yell, he's like, "Oh, oh, jeez!"

1124
01:02:47,660 --> 01:02:50,660
And you're just like, "Oh, they're using me as a ramp again!"

1125
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:52,660
*laughter*

1126
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:55,660
And the police chief's mad at him, like, "I knew it! Shoulda never hired you!"

1127
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,660
*laughter*

1128
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:01,660
And you guys crash the SkyGallery.

1129
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:03,660
Um, you're in there now.

1130
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:05,660
Um, uh, everything's ready to go.

1131
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,660
The Jollibee's had it all set up.

1132
01:03:07,660 --> 01:03:14,660
that

1133
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,980
uh...

1134
01:03:17,980 --> 01:03:19,460
and uh... it's got out of the house

1135
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:20,300
he just

1136
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:23,620
you'll get by this case

1137
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,060
athletics that

1138
01:03:25,060 --> 01:03:26,400
the cows shooting

1139
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:30,180
while you're getting skyline

1140
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:31,340
twenty six again

1141
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:32,340
so

1142
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:32,840
God.

1143
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:37,340
You are like messing around with it and you figure out where the shields are, you press them,

1144
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:39,340
like a blue light comes up in front of the galleon,

1145
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:40,340
*pew pew pew*

1146
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:43,840
like the lasers from the cow, just like bounce off of it.

1147
01:03:43,840 --> 01:03:47,840
You sort of start to scoot up and you just fucking shoot off into the sky.

1148
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:51,840
And you look down and you see the gad king go

1149
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,340
"NOOOOOO!"

1150
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:57,340
And you see the baby gad, he puts his fedora back on,

1151
01:03:57,340 --> 01:04:00,840
and he tips his hat to you guys as you fly away into the sky.

1152
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:15,840
it's

1153
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:35,520
see

1154
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,840
and there while we killed a lot of guys on the way so you guys are flying in the air now

1155
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:44,480
uh... you guys can contact we owe uh... you also have the penguin

1156
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:46,900
and he just sort of figure out where to go next you probably something to

1157
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,780
investigate that artifact

1158
01:04:48,780 --> 01:04:52,060
uh... the golden penguin with the vagina

1159
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,380
uh...

1160
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:56,980
and uh... yeah i mean will sort of see how much trouble you're in because you

1161
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,340
did basically like

1162
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:02,900
you didn't like you didn't even hide away you just like in their face were like

1163
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:05,420
were fugitives and we're fucking out of here

1164
01:05:05,420 --> 01:05:09,260
So we'll see you didn't you didn't then just like you didn't like it could have turned into like a

1165
01:05:09,260 --> 01:05:14,060
massacre against them, but you didn't let that happen. So that's you know, good.

1166
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:20,060
Definitely good to use it take advantage of the dad holds on for yeah, we could have killed

1167
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:24,780
Yeah, I'm in court like the narrator told me

1168
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:35,340
uh... the insanity plea would work in that case i guess uh... but uh... yes

1169
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:38,940
so uh... you guys don't really know where you have to go at this point

1170
01:05:38,940 --> 01:05:42,260
unless you investigate the artifact or contact we are talking solvent or

1171
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,460
whatever

1172
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,580
i'm i'm gonna say that you have some downtime in the in the the ship now that

1173

especially if you didn't blow up the cave

1252

uh... you know

1253
01:09:16,980 --> 01:09:19,580

1254
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,700
sort that out just

1255
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,560

1256
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,060
did we do that

1257
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:29,260
just try to answer

1258
01:09:29,260 --> 01:09:31,660
no to cause too much trouble

1259
01:09:31,660 --> 01:09:34,260
if if uh... that's alright

1260
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:35,420
uh... what

1261
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:37,700
i love my game boy

1262
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:41,020
now let's let's take a look at that artifact you got back and uh... yet

1263
01:09:41,020 --> 01:09:43,220
because of the uh... golden penguin

1264
01:09:43,220 --> 01:09:50,220
with the uh... realistic look on and we left it behind we have to do that

1265
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:55,340
uh... yeah it's is going to penguin with this like realistic vagina in a new

1266
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:59,700
here like a teeny blizzard sound coming out of it

1267
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,540
how large is it

1268
01:10:01,540 --> 01:10:05,740
uh... it's about like uh... it's really good business all of in size

1269
01:10:05,740 --> 01:10:08,640
now it's short of insolvence but like two feet

1270
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,960
tall i'll go so then

1271
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,720
well what what

1272
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:19,320

1273
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,320
i don't know i just kind of point my finger a little bit now that's not

1274
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,000
that's

1275
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:25,960

1317
01:12:14,740 --> 01:12:18,460

and i think that's a good

1328
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,880
and uh... you see the vagina get a little bit more moist

1329
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,160
uh...

1330
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:48,280
uh... guys we have to keep doing this

1331
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,520
- Show her your tongue. Show her your frog tongue.

1332
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:54,720
- Meanwhile, you see Leo. He's like, "Yes, keep going. Yes."

1333
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,180
- Show her the frog tongue.

1334
01:12:57,180 --> 01:12:59,640
- Hop around. Do a flip.

1335
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:02,020
- Say, "Ahh."

1336
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:06,480
- And he tries to do that while he's trying to do a flip.

1337
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,480
And he just sort of like falls, but he falls headfirst.

1338
01:13:15,880 --> 01:13:19,800
at first

1339
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,000

And then as you start to regain sight, you see that a beam of light is shooting out from this penguin's face.

1351
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:56,120
Almost like no matter where it's facing, it is somehow beaming in one direction in particular.

1352
01:13:56,120 --> 01:13:57,120
Oh, it's pointing to Mecca!

1353
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:05,120
And Leo said, "Not quite, but I think it's something like it." And he starts typing on his side.

1354
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:08,120
Is Sullivan's entire head inside the vagina?

1355
01:14:08,120 --> 01:14:10,120
No, it's just the mouth and neck.

1356
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:15,420
And he's getting he's he's he's like can I move can I move your look your tongue and

1357
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:20,400
Yeah, fucking get it boy. He starts writing the alphabet with his hands

1358
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:24,320
And yeah, you see

1359
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:28,560
Leo says okay the coordinates of where there's light a beam of light is

1360
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,460
It's pointing towards north towards towards the soy wastes

1361
01:14:32,460 --> 01:14:38,800
towards oh goodness, okay, there's a rumor that there is a

1362
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:43,800
a small temple that is outside of a...

1363
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,480
well, this might be a bit personal for you, Blotoss, but uh...

1364
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:52,360
outside of a, uh,

1365
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:56,080
Hoov...Hoo Town, a Hoovian village filled with Hoo people

1366
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:59,320
who live in...among the Soi Wastes. Hoo?

1367
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:03,320
Right, that's correct, Patrick Cure. What? Hoovians.

1368
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:06,480
in the middle east on who town

1369
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:10,860
my ship can't go that far to the soy wastes it will get destroyed

1370
01:15:10,860 --> 01:15:12,800
by the blizzard of soy

1371
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,040
will need to

1372
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:15,800

if you take you head down to the station that park the ship outside of its

1392
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,700

01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,380
to take that rain up to the who town and then we'll get to

this is great work for you've done an amazing job by me besides

1408
01:16:48,300 --> 01:16:50,140
the people you've had to kill

1409
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:52,540
amazing work

1410
01:16:52,540 --> 01:16:56,440
those were all accidents and we also also we didn't kill anybody

1411
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,220
and he's saying that

1412
01:16:58,220 --> 01:17:00,700
uh...

1413
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,300
you see a red light martin brown

1414
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,220
brown brown pop up on the ship

1415
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:09,400
and you see a lake lake warning symbol

1416
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,640
and then you see the warning symbol

1417
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:13,460
like in this hologram on the ship

1418
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:16,020
and it's trapped in jello

1419
01:17:16,020 --> 01:17:17,060
and

1420
01:17:17,060 --> 01:17:18,700
and uh...

1421
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,860
uh... you see him say uh...

1422
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:26,060
I have a great summer see you next fall Dwight's and the ship

1423
01:17:26,060 --> 01:17:29,360
is falling now through the sky.

1424
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,260
And it's going fast and it's falling towards the soy wastes

1425
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:37,660
but far outside of the Wendig station.

1426
01:17:37,660 --> 01:17:38,960
What okay?

1427
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:39,760
I got a question.

1428
01:17:39,760 --> 01:17:42,660
Yeah, so it's an air galleon.

1429
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,560
So it's shaped like a ship.

1430
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:47,260
That's right and the soy wastes.

1431
01:17:47,260 --> 01:17:50,560
So I'm assuming that the soy wastes are made out of soylent.

1432
01:17:50,560 --> 01:17:54,560
Soylent and Frigid Blizzard Soylent.

1433
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:58,560
So it's snow?

1434
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,560
Maybe. There's no river?

1435
01:18:02,560 --> 01:18:06,560
No. Hold on. Is there a trampoline maybe?

1436
01:18:06,560 --> 01:18:10,560
Exactly where the ship is going to fall? Yeah, maybe a giant pile of pillows?

1437
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:14,560
I thought we were going to be able to use the galleon in manual mode. There are multiple

1438
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:18,560
stations you guys can go to right now to try to fix this, or try to make sure that this doesn't get

1439
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:24,060
too bad. So we head to the stations. Okay. Yeah station one

1440
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:27,660
blow toss. You can take the ship driving the ship.

1441
01:18:27,660 --> 01:18:29,260
Hey guys blow toss is sus.

1442
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:32,760
I eject Patrick.

1443
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:36,560
Patrick Yoda and Ray William Johnson.

1444
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:39,940
You guys can take the different different sort of emergency

1445
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:43,040
like power stations and emergency shield stations try to

1446
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,440
prevent the crash which one wants to take the shield which

1447
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:46,360
one wants to take the power.

1448
01:18:46,360 --> 01:18:47,560
I would take the shields.

1449
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:51,340
yet what uh... you're a you are you're doing the power

1450
01:18:51,340 --> 01:18:54,320
mister you should do the power i should do the why

1451
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:55,480
is your the computer

1452
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:59,400
what is a a both of them are good computer-based never over the computer

1453
01:18:59,400 --> 01:19:04,500
basin but i mean that we're you're gonna need the power to power up the shields

1454
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:07,480
uh... you're in some star trek is really smart

1455
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,480
you know i'm not so right

1456
01:19:09,480 --> 01:19:13,720
okay so you're you you guys go to the station to get what you switch

1457
01:19:13,720 --> 01:19:17,560
What do you mean I should switch? You guys have to switch back and forth and you switch positions.

1458
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:24,680
Ray William Johnson, the power station requires you to hit the Jollibee's Whack-A-Mole style that are in there.

1459
01:19:24,680 --> 01:19:26,280
I would love to do that.

1460
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:29,800
And so roll an athletics check to try to hit them to turn on the power station.

1461
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:30,640
22.

1462
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:35,440
Nice, yeah. You managed to whack them pretty efficiently.

1463
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:42,360
And the shields, Patrick Yoda, you have to... you're playing against a computer in Hangman right now.

1464
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:45,560
and it's like the award try to get to try to guess what the word is

1465
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:51,600
so that i need to pass to guess this word yeah

1466
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:56,020
uh... yeah uh... so uh... yeah let's let's start playing hangman okay you

1467
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:58,800

1468
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:02,400

Drawing a circle.

1472
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:09,840
Okay.

1473
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:12,840
No, that doesn't count! You drew a big one!

1474
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,840
Okay, it's not a one, it's the hangman thing.

1475
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:17,840
I just screwed it up a little bit, so it looks like a one.

1476
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:19,840
Do I get letters?

1477
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:21,840
Um, if you guess letters, you do.

1478
01:20:21,840 --> 01:20:23,840
Do you know how to play hangman?

1479
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:27,840
Hangman, don't you get letters for free? Don't you get, like, free letters?

1480
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:28,840
No.

1481
01:20:28,840 --> 01:20:30,840
No, that's Wheel of Fortune.

1482
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,840
That is Wheel of Fortune.

1483
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:34,840
That's what I'm thinking of.

1484
01:20:34,840 --> 01:20:40,120
But I get it. Yeah, okay. Is it four letters long? Yeah, it's only four letters. Try poop. Try poop

1485
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,920
Try pee

1486
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,480
Do I have to ask you what I haven't you just guess a letter?

1487
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:49,800
I haven't played hangman in so long guess the letter just guess letters. Is it a noun?

1488
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:52,440
You just guess letters. Yes. It's a noun

1489
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:57,080
Okay, is it how many letters is the rule of hangman? I got four

Stop! Stop!

1506
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,840
I don't know why you're screwing this up so bad.

1507
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:23,720
So many letters that are in this word.

1508
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:24,220
Stop!

1509
01:21:24,220 --> 01:21:27,560

01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:29,480
Put those- no, put those back!

1511
01:21:30,040 --> 01:21:34,440
Put those back that was not that was he said he he said he no

No, that was all cameron. No, the word was fish

No

1514
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:44,120
No, no, none of this counts. Yeah

1515
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,000
The shields are not up you guys are

1516
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:51,800
This doesn't count. I didn't even get to do I didn't even get to play

1517
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:57,080
I was just on the intercut the ship and you're not just saying letters not realizing he was playing

1518
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:01,920
I was like, now I will list my favorite letters to motivate

1519
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:06,020
you on whatever tasks you might be doing with the power on

1520
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:06,520
though.

1521
01:22:06,520 --> 01:22:09,720
Like it you you are able to sort of like steer the ship pretty

1522
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:13,020
well, but without the shields as you guys go falling through

1523
01:22:13,020 --> 01:22:15,920
the sky and the the you start to fall through and you're going

1524
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:19,220
towards a soy waste right over the desert the like sort of

1525
01:22:19,220 --> 01:22:21,020
dusty desert of where the Gadsville is.

1526
01:22:21,020 --> 01:22:26,420
This is an immediate shift in you know in a meteorology, right?

1527
01:22:26,420 --> 01:22:28,420
It's a completely different environment completely

1528
01:22:28,420 --> 01:22:32,100
different biome and is the soy wastes where nobody's been able to settle.

1529
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:36,020
Really, the only thing that has been a couple of who villages and a couple

1530
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:38,940
other scattered settlements that have been able to live in the harsh climate

1531
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:42,700
there. And the second you hit it, it's like a, it shifts completely. Now

1532
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:47,940
there's just like this flakes of soy and, and, um, snow just like ripping

1533
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:51,640
through and the ship is starting to like lose control because of whatever

1534
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,700
tampering that Pennsylvania gym did to it. And with the power supply, you are

1535
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:58,140
able to get a little bit of extra different distance. So it's no longer

1536
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:04,260
going to be probably a days out from the Wendig Station. However, without the shields, you

1537
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:11,760
guys fall, you fall hard. You like go like thousands of feet down. You manage to pull

1538
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:17,940
up as best as you can, Blowtoss, but it's sort of like in Spongebob, "We're good, we're good,

1539
01:23:17,940 --> 01:23:24,300
we're good," and all the ships like fucking like bits and bits of wood and like metal

1540
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,660
and I'll fly off and everything goes black.

1541
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:30,420
(dramatic music)

1542
01:23:30,420 --> 01:23:33,820
And that's where we'll end it.

1543
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:35,900
- Oh wow, what an episode.

1544
01:23:35,900 --> 01:23:38,660
(dramatic music)

1545
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:42,780
- All right, good work.

1546
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:45,120
- Yeah, that was really fun.

1547
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:47,880
(dramatic music)

1548
01:23:47,880 --> 01:24:00,880
