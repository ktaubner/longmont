then they

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
went to the bus stop

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,280

23
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,880
is homework and after that they wanted to kill some time so they went to the movie

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,440
theater where there was a rerelease of homework bound the hungry hamster got

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,920
into some got stuck in a vending machine and when a teen tried to take him up by

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:36,920
this

27
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
right

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,920
and it's in

29
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:43,960
it's ok listen it's ok to kill a teenager using some kind of unmanned aerial attack

30
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,680
if it's to protect your interests in an area

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,680
that's true yeah

32
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,000
yeah that happens

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,240
that's it yeah yeah uh they're getting it's politics about list again

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:01,600
but uh yeah so um so then they went uh and hid out back in the bodega after doing some

35
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,440
clever roles, the hamster, hungry hamster was able to make the cops dance and nae nae their

36
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:13,560
way to viral success so that they could escape. And then they head down to the bodega and they

37
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:22,160
took the bus and the bus driver then died because they ran him over with the bus and then there

38
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:30,600
was man bear pig showed up. Oh yeah I remember now. Man bear pig went away. And they convinced

39
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,680
bear pig to only eat or kill people. What if he comes back? There's no way. Also we're not

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,960
people so we're safe. I'm sure he has a very long memory that works for statements like

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,720
that. Yeah, he'll remember that one. And so they kept driving the bus but because they

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:56,480
didn't beat a very high DC I had up to get to Duluth because they're animals. But it doesn't

43
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,080
requires high of a DC to operate a bus apparently. They ended up sort of at this

44
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,400
creek and a river with a little rickety bridge and then Dick Van Dyke was trying

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,720
to get an Uber and so Pleasant Parrot tried to talk to him but because of some

46
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,920
behind-the-scenes DM ass roles the CIA showed up, attacked the Pleasant Parrot

47
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,920
and the battle has begun between the CIA agents and the homeward bound

48
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,600
hamward bound characters so we're gonna we're gonna take down the whole CIA

49
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:40,040
we're dismantling the CIA from the inside out we rolled initiative for

okay

142
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,220
uh...

143
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:15,720
Yeah, so you have advantage on that, so go for it, investigate.

144
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
I'm an investigator.

145
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,720

148
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,220
Easy, dude.

149
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,640
Alright, I'm gonna use, I'm gonna use tackle and I'm gonna specifically try and knock their

150
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,500
cyanide molars into their mouths.

151
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,680
Fuck yeah, okay.

152
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
So yeah.

153
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
That's a believe right there.

154
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:54,160
of

155
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,160
and

156
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:15,040
is

157
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:22,040
it

158
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:35,220
in

159
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:38,720
So you are, yes, you tackle this dancing guy.

160
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,120
So he's still trying to dance while you're on top of him on the

161
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,820
ground and he's doing the worm right now.

162
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,120
He's doing the worm and with crime dog.

163
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,820
The other part of the crime dog ability is that if you're first

164
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,420
to attack an enemy you have advantage on all attack rolls for

165
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,820
the rest of combat after that.

166
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,920
Oh my God.

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,620
Oh, yeah, because you were the first to attack him because that's

168
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,620
not what I'm famous dance is not an attack.

169
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,620
it's infectious dance

170
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,820
you do have a bit

171
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,380
but now it is their turn

172
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,920
uh... so

173
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,000

uh... the c_i_a_ agent in the back

179
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,780
is going to

180
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,260
try to shoot a uh...

181
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,300
a curious looking gun

182
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,820
uh... similar to uh...

183
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,340
a pistol

184
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,340
in this case it's gonna shoot, but different.

185
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:43,340
And again, Pleasant Parrot, roll a Dexterity saving throw.

186
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,340
Okay.

187
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,340
19.

188
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Nice, yeah.

189
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:51,940
So he shoots a gun at you, this guy in the back here, and it's like a net,

190
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:55,540
and it shoots out, but it misses you, it goes wide.

191
00:10:55,540 --> 00:11:02,340
And then this other one over here is going to shoot at you

192
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,460
uh...

193
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,260

uh... and now the other guy who you've tackled

210
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,020
uh...

211
00:11:57,020 --> 00:12:00,980
all he could do is dance and move half the speed so he's just gonna stay dancing

212
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:03,540
down there for the rest of this turn.

213
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:06,900
And now we're back to Hungry Hamster.

214
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,540
Alright, so I'm still behind the bus.

215
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,740
I come out from the bus.

216
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:17,660
I come out from behind it again and now that I can see that there's some stuff going on,

217
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,660
I think I might check my inventory to see.

218
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,460
Alright, so I'm going to check inventory.

219
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,460
So I just roll a 20.

220
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,460
7, ok, let's see.

221
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:27,460
It's a rocket launcher.

222
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:43,340
the

223
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
you

224
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,060
Thank you!

225
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:47,600
Okay.

226
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,480
At $8, your inventory wasn't buried.

227
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,140
Alright.

228
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,060
This is good because Hungry Hamster owed me.

229
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,700
Owed me $8, actually.

230
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:57,340
Mm-hmm.

231
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:00,460
I just wanted to get this out of the way right now!

232
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,620
I know this is kind of a bad time!

233
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:07,020
I appreciate that you remembered and didn't need any reminders.

234
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,260
This is why you're my best friend!

235
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:08,760
I love you!

236
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:09,580
You're my best friend, too!

237
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,780
I love you!

238
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,660
Okay, guys, cool!

239
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,020
I love you! I love you, dog!

240
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,820
I love the dog too, we're all best friends!

241
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:20,620
Alright, now I feel included. Continue!

242
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:23,820
The parrot has taught the animals to have currency.

243
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,620
The concept of it and share it.

244
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
Yeah, the CIA agents are reporting.

245
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:30,220
Um, uh, and uh, yeah.

246
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,820
And uh, it is now, uh, your turn, Pleasant Parrot.

247
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,220
Okay, so I have a question about my Polly Wants a What Now ability.

248
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:43,020
I could, I, my speech can be used to command one human at will to perform a specific one-word task

249
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,660
that is not immediately harmful to the human.

250
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,160
Yes.

251
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,060
If I command one of them to like, to chew,

252
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,560
to bite, so like, to bite down,

253
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,360
is that immediately harmful?

254
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,060
Uh, that's a very good...

255
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,620
'Cause I feel like it's definitely indirectly harmful.

256
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,360
That's a very good Dungeons & Dragons question.

257
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,320
Um, I'm gonna say that because they are aware

258
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,460
that they have cyanide tooth,

259
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,500
that they have cyanide tooth,

260
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,320
that they would be considered harmful okay weren't aware

261
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,700
it was too good to be true

262
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,040
yeah yeah

263
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:23,480
all right i'm gonna i'm gonna fly to the guy with the gun that's not the net gun

264
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,660
with a real gun

265
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,280
there's no attack of opportunity there because he's pinned to the ground by the

266
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,060
other animal dog

267
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,300

268
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,980

00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,840

319
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
if we're being honest they all know Krav Maga

320
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500

325
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
oh my god I'm at 5

326
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:54,720
the

327
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,440
I don't know if I want to do hamster ball or...

328
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,680
Because it knocks every...

329
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,680
Yeah, you know what?

330
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,680
Fuck it.

331
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Hamster ball.

332
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Do it.

333
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Let's see it.

334
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,680
So the thing with hamster ball...

335
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
17.

336
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,320
Yeah, that will hit them.

337
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Yeah, shit.

338
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,280
I guess, you know what?

339
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,360
I didn't put any restrictions on that.

340
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,980
So here's the thing.

341
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:18,200
What you have to do is roll...

342
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,200
So you...

343
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,200
Yeah.

344
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Yup.

345
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,200
Okay.

346
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,200
Oh, enemies roll against actually. So I'm actually going to roll against that. So don't even worry about it.

347
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:34,200
Hold on one second. Actually, also, so who, which CIA agent are you?

348
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:39,200
So I'm going to... Alright, one that's... Don't you dare touch this one I'm fucking.

349
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,200
I won't. Don't touch any of the drawings we made. He's mine.

350
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:51,200
So you can use your full range of movement with hamster balls. You can hit the two in the back if you go...

351
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:57,140
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit I'm gonna go. All right. I'll actually use this thing for real

352
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:04,220
The freehand draw so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go up I'm gonna hit this one and then this one

353
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:10,240
But I won't hit this one because that's Caleb's that's right. Yeah, they both fail their

354
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:16,820
Saving throws against you too. So what happens is is you roll up into?

355
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I roll up like Sonic the Hedgehog.

356
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,360
I feel like it.

357
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:23,360
In your little hamster ball, you knock that one over in your hamster ball like Sonic the Hedgehog.

358
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,360
Yeah.

359
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,360
And you roll up on this one and knock him over.

360
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,360
And so they're both knocked prone now.

361
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
Yeah.

362
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
Which means they're gonna have to get up on their turn.

363
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
And then I...

364
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
It's gonna take half their movement.

365
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,360
My head like pops up.

366
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,360
And I...

367
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,360
And I fall in the water.

368
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,360
Yeah, you do?

369
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Because I overshot it.

370
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,360
I fall into the creek.

371
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,960
But I'm kind of just floating there.

372
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
No, because I was gonna say, if you could still choose to do this, but I would feel

373
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,960
unfair as DM if I didn't say, "Those are raging waters."

374
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Okay, then never mind.

375
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:58,960
Okay.

376
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,360
I hit that one and then I do like such a screeching halt towards it.

377
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:07,240
I almost fall in and I'm, "Oh shit."

378
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,120
And I'm sitting there and I'm going like, "Whoa!"

379
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,720
And I almost crawl into the room, but I don't.

380
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
It's the power of friendship.

381
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
Yeah the CIA agents when you knock them over they sound like bowling pins.

382
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,040
They sound like a bowling strike.

383
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,640
Because they're hollow on the inside.

384
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,640
What?

385
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,640
Oh my god.

386
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Oh no.

387
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,640
Pat is single handedly destroying the CIA.

388
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Yes.

389
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,640
Wow.

00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Yeah and so they're knocked on the ground, they're seeing birdies around their heads.

391
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,640
They're like alpha, alpha, beta, alpha, delpha.

574
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Mmm.

575
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,440
Daddy like.

576
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,440
I'm from the CIA, Jitsuha.

577
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
This one is distracted

578
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,440
by the

579
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
nudie mag.

580
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
So he's gonna try to attack you,

581
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:34,440
and

582
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,880
We'll draw that on the map, don't you worry about that Patches, we'll take care of it.

583
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,880
Okay!

584
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,200
Yeah, he fucking whiffs, he gets a 1.

585
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:50,480
So he is just like fully thinking about lactating and what it would be like to lactate and feel

586
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:54,840
like that and maybe he wouldn't have, maybe she wouldn't have left him if he could lactate

587
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,360
and things like that and he just misses you completely.

588
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:08,660
Meanwhile, this other guy is going to now whip out his own net gun and try to capture the Pleasant Parrot.

589
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,260
See how he does.

590
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:20,060
Okay, and Pleasant Parrot's AC is probably not right.

591
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,460
Yeah.

592
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:20,960
No.

593
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,360
Yeah.

594
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:21,760
No.

595
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:29,860
So he tries to shoot it at you and he just you just are able to like fly through the little netting and then it was a little

596
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:35,780
too wide when it like sort of splurged out and he is just capturing some bait bass some

597
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,100
base some bass that are in the river.

598
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,100
This is bass in the river.

599
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
No, it's bass.

600
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:42,100
Bass in the river.

601
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
Yeah.

602
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,100
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

603
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:49,380
And it is now your turn, Hungy Hamster.

604
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,180
Alright, so I think what I'm gonna do.

605
00:30:53,180 --> 00:30:54,220
Mr. Hungy fella.

606
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:57,540
I think I'm gonna bite the guy who's trying to jack off.

607
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,060
Okay.

608
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:06,060
So, let's see how this goes. I'm just straight up gonna bite him.

609
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,060
I got 12.

610
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,060
Nah, dawg, you fuckin' whiff.

611
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,060
Do you try to bite him with your teeth?

612
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,060
Do I still roll for damage?

613
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,060
If you want to, it's not gonna do anything.

614
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,060
Nice, that would've been good. That would've been 7 damage.

615
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,060
I know.

616
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:23,060
But yeah, you try to chomp at him.

617
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:27,060
Well, actually, you know what? Because we said for one full round.

618
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,760
i would say that you get another

619
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,780
you get advantage on this attack all of those are that is it i guess i'll

620
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,940
yet they had a role with the damage

621
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:40,560
that is advantage that is a man is just realize you know it's not

uh...

678
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,440
but it is now that agents turn

679
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,160
and he is going to

680
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,960
c_n_n_ is is all his agents are are are gone he's going to sort of uh...

681
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,240
uh... triple all the stops here

682
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,600
okay he's going to uh...

683
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,280
to think he's gonna fuck up

684
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:18,040
he was he basically took out a uh...

685
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,720
the uh...

686
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,360
laser gun this time

687
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,600
and just read the shoot directly point blank at the dog and he just fuckin

688
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,720
misses

689
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,600
uh... you just see a tree behind the dog just fuckin vaporize uh...

690
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:34,080
uh... and now it is your turn hungry hamster

691
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,120
all right so

692
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,460
i think

693
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,320
i might check inventory one more time

694
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,000
uh...

695
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,880
missus has a good fucked up

696
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,360
i mean yeah i'll check inventory just just for the idea that it does tell you

697
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,780
like your free to do that uh... okay

698
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:56,940
seventeen move that means it's a good idea

699
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,540
you got jetpack

700
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,220
what

701
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:03,620
all you know what you know i do is i use the jetpack

702
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,800
and i go

703
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:15,640
Yes. So the jet pack allows you to do that. It gives you like 30 feet of movement or 60

704
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:19,600
feet of movement total. Okay. So you could basically use it and then it runs out of fuel,

705
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,960
but you're able to fly. So yeah, you were able to do that. So that was, yeah. And it's

706
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,000
only like 30 feet to get over to the other side. Yeah. So you're over the other side with

707
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,160
your jet pack. Oh, I guess that guy should roll an attack on you because you ran away

708
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,920
from him but um...

709
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
he does get a hit

710
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,480
uh... well alright so he hits the jet pack and i kinda go like

711
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,040
around yeah but i do cross i mean it still gets you still get the other side

712
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,360

713
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:56,160
twelve damage. That's your punishment for leaving us. Can my tongue reach across the river?

714
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,520
no, that's skilled

715
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,080
your tongue is only ten feet

716
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,740
uh... pop-up but that means

717
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,340
uh... if you are

718
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:06,220
uh... but it is an h_b_ now

719
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,880
your turn pleasant

720
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,980
all right amid

721
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,380
let's it what ok

722
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,220
i don't know if you maybe you can tell me this but

723
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,020
now the c_i_a_ is already got to a staff to worry about summoning the c_i_a_

724
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,820
still

725
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,140
uh...

726
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,540
further detail that

727
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:28,780
but i think it does it does that mean that i do have to worry about it

728
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,820
yeah like you're gonna have you're gonna have leeway because they've already sent

729
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:33,940
agents

730
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,860
uh... right

731
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,380
uh... this has been discussed a bunch of damage so i'm not going to use my big

732
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,820
my big thing on this kind of

733
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:47,220
uh... at the rectangle to a large but to square

734
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,740
uh... i'm gonna fly over the last remaining c_i_a_ guy

735
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,580
i'm gonna pack 'em

736
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,540
sixteen yeah that's it

737
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,020
ten describe your kill

738
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,380
okay so this is a little high concept but i

739
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:05,380
i fly down his throat into his feet

740
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,300
uh...

741
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:11,220
you see him like trying to like take a notes on this and report this back as

742
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,220
like a as a characteristic attack of you

743
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,540
uh... before he like plunges into the uh... that's called a disinformation

744
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,780
campaign some never gonna do that again

745
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:26,780
Yeah, and so he flies down past amazing boobs River, which is

746
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:31,280
apparently what this River is called if this roll 20 is to be

747
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,880
believed and yeah, he's dead.

748
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:39,380
And so you've defeated the CIA agents is first wave first wave

749
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:43,380
the could bring your side, but yeah, you've defeated them.

750
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,580
So yeah, yeah very easily.

751
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,900

00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,540
you're now out of check inventory for a little while

But he can't check his inventory three more times to find a

777
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:02,600
jetpack unless he takes a long rest. A long rest will be eight hours and you have about a day until

No, he sort of showed up from this direction, so he hasn't crossed the bridge yet.

796
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,160
But he's looking for Dick Van Dyke.

797
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,160

Well, I'm a tiny hamster, so I'm gonna imitate the heartbeat.

838
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:23,040
By just hanging off of his chest hair,

839
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:27,440
and going occasionally doing this with his shirt.

840
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,440
Like, stretching.

841
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440

I'm a tiny hamster.

845
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,440

915
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,700
Do you want me to get you something and I'll bring it into the car, or do you insist on going in?"

916
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:45,660
"No, my animals will go in for me. I'll just stay here in the car, remaining completely still,

917
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:52,620
and seeming as if I'm not breathing, but it's just how I am. If I start to smell really bad,

918
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:55,740
or if you see any bugs on me, don't worry, it's just how I am."

919
00:47:56,940 --> 00:48:00,460
His tongue is out of the side of his mouth and his eyes are just complete X's

920
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:06,620
Far be it from me to make you roll again. Go on out

921
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:14,860
Okay, so you guys go out of the car you head to 7-eleven. I guess you have to steal something. Oh we have eight dollars

You're greeted by a beautiful, perfect little city.

1029
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,220

1034
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,540
The city is hustling and bustling.

1035
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:56,460
It's 2003 or 4 and we just finished laying off the entire Iraqi military.

1036
00:53:56,460 --> 00:54:02,380
The usual activity has also spiked because you guessed it, Stained is here, outside of

00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:08,540
the shops and sort of malls that you would see you know multiple malls you'd

You can buy masks that look like members of the band too, like Scooby-Doo masks.

1045
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:58,680
With the original lineup that has John Wysocki as the drummer still.

1046
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,420
You also see a number of children wearing these masks and they're playing around, running

1047
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,320
around.

1048
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:06,660
To get into the concert you have to get tickets.

1049
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:10,620
It's sold out, of course, they're the biggest band on the fucking planet.

1050
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:15,880
All the scalpers have been beaten to death and robbed of any extra tickets.

1051
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:22,000
You look up a bit ahead down DuPont Street and see that the line to get into Jafar Stadium

1052
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,360
is already formed.

1053
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,040
People have tents and blankets.

1054
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:28,960
Someone built a small villa in the time they've been on line.

1055
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:35,040
You see one woman who got in line, she was 38 weeks pregnant and now she's giving birth.

1056
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,040
So it looks like it's going to be pretty tough to get in, but here you are in the wonderful

1057
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,360
city of Duluth at last.

1058
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,080
Your Uber driver drops you off.

1059
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:53,080
the

1060
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,080
the

1061
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:57,080
the

1062
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,080
the

1063
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,080
the

1064
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,080
the

1065
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:05,080
the

1066
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
the

1067
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:09,080
the

1068
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,080
the

1069
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,080
the

1070
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,080
the

1071
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
the

1072
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,080
the

1073
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,080
the

1074
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,080
How much underwear can a hamster steal?

1075
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,080
Probably steal a ton of all of it.

1076
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:27,080
Well I am the hungry hamster.

1077
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,080
I think your mic is pretty loud Pat. You might want to back up.

1078
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,080
Yeah let me, let me.

1079
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,080
No it's in audacity. It's the problem. Hold on.

1080
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Yeah there we go. Alright. How about now?

1081
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:37,080
The audacity level wouldn't affect your mic at all.

1082
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:39,080
No it does. It does.

1083
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,080
If I turn the recording volume down

1084
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,080
it actually works.

1085
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:45,080
Oh ok.

1086
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:47,080
I believe you. It does sound better now.

1087
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:49,080
Yeah it does.

1088
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:55,080
I go into Duluth Trading Company and I eat most of the underwear, not all.

1089
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,080
Now you're eating it?

1090
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:59,080
I'm the hungry hamster, I gotta do something.

1091
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,080
Alright, so, uh, do you wanna-

1092
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,080
What kind of fucking excuse is that, man?

1093
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,080
Are you trying to do this-

1094
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:08,080
You're going in, you're eating underwear, you're gonna blow our fucking- you're gonna blow this whole thing.

1095
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:09,080
I'm hungry!

1096
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
Are you trying to do this stealthily at all?

1097
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:12,080
No.

1098
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,080
No, I get into the factory and I'm-

1099
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,080
Fuck you, hungry hamster.

1100
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:31,160
the

1101
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:33,560
Why did you think it was an underwear factory?

1102
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,560
You said you were going to the training company.

1103
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,560
Yeah, you're making all this up, so...

1104
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,360
What is it?

1105
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,360
Look up Duluth, you don't know Duluth?

1106
00:57:40,360 --> 00:57:42,360
You don't know Duluth Trading Company?

1107
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,360
Yeah, I go to the store and I...

1108
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:47,360
It's a factory now and I eat underwear.

1109
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,860
You don't know Duluth Trading Company, the underwear company?

1110
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,560
No.

1111
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:53,560
You said it was a factory.

1112
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,560
Will told me about it.

1113
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,560
Now this is a specific thing that you're talking about?

1114
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,560
Yeah, of course, right. We should have known.

00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,560
We should have known.

1135
00:58:23,560 --> 00:58:24,560
We should have known.

1136
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:25,560
We should have known.

1137
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,560
We should have known.

1138
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,560
We should have known.

1139
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:28,560
We should have known.

1140
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:36,520
American white men working on the underwear factory line and putting

1141
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:40,160
the finishing touches on the tighty-whities and you see the conveyor

1142
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:47,280
belt and you scurry up there you start eating them one by one as they come up

1143
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,080
like loose Lucille Ball with the chocolates. That's exactly what I

1144
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,480
thought I was doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you're just filled with underwear now and

1145
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,720
and uh... nobody's really noticing 'cause it's just like it's not my part of the

1146
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,640
line and then eventually someone

1147
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:03,400
starts to realize that they're part of the

1148
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,680
line that they're not seeing any underwear coming down

1149
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:08,000
so uh...

1150
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,160
i'm gonna run away

1151
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,960
yeah i was gonna say i'll give you a chance if you want to try to keep eating

1152
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,240
no i know my limits

1153
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:17,280
if there's anything i'm a person that knows my limits

1154
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:22,280
i have an idea for how to get to try to get into the concert to sneak in

1155
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,920
if i talk

1156
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:28,840
if i talk to a person but over the phone does that still work the c_i_a_ of the

1157
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,960
person can't see that it's a pair of talking

1158
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,480
and on

1159
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,700
well the c_i_a_ would probably tap the phone right there but no it not if it's a

1160
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,960
pay phone without c_f_b_i_ here

1161
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,960

It's perfect then. Where are we keeping it?

1168
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:09,140
Well, okay, no, I can screw a cheese. I fly into a store and I take a quarter out of the tip jar.

1169
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:16,140

the pay phone to call the trading company in place

1173
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:30,220
and or order for underwear

Yeah, it's stuck together from your saliva into the shape of a shirt and pants.

1193
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:25,460
Into the shape of an Adidas track suit.

1194
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:29,460
Okay, all of you guys roll a perception check.

1205
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:15,140
the once again you you you notice the faint hefty steps of a of a stocky man

1206
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:20,580
whose steps you would recognize right away as mr. grab your damn dog from the

1207
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:26,660
last time I think you heard 20 no oh he's around I tried to the guy who tried to

Joseph Pesci, yeah.

1211
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,460
He's around the corner, I don't think he knows.

1212
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,500
I think we would be able to spot him from a mile away, he has no nose.

1213
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:44,580
That's a good point.

1214
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:46,060
That's a really good point.

1215
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:50,260
Yeah, he looks like a jack-o-lantern.

1216
01:02:50,260 --> 01:02:53,420
I immediately started winding my legs up to run away.

1217
01:02:53,420 --> 01:02:58,220

1223
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,820
Okay, I gotta roll to see if he notices that.

01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:36,860
We're gonna run away, we're gonna hide.

1228
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:37,660
And you're like, "I'm gonna do something."

1229
01:03:37,660 --> 01:03:39,660
Not a lot of people, just one person.

1230
01:03:39,660 --> 01:03:44,860
Okay, so it's a inconspicuous kind of vomiting?

1231
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:45,100
Yeah.

1232
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:56,300
Okay, yeah, you start to see the I will say that I mean dog dog normal dog and pleasant parrot you start to see

1233
01:03:56,300 --> 01:04:02,860
That there's some stirring back in that corner where you thought you saw them and

1234
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:08,140
After hungry hamster started vomiting and they uh, they sort of saunter

1236
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:16,000

1237
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:16,500
Um...

1238
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:17,700
Um...

1239
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:19,000
Is this my fault?

1240
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,300
Yeah.

1241
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,200
Damn it.

1242
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:22,500
A hundred percent.

1243
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:24,000
Ah, shit.

1244
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:24,900
Um...

1245
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:25,600
Yeah.

1246
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,200
I'm gonna just drop in some tokens in here, and then, um...

1247
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:34,200
Uh, Joe Pesci, aka Mr. Grabbed You a Damn Dog, and Skeletor are gonna say,

1248
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:35,800
"Let's get 'em!"

1249
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,600
And then we're gonna roll for initiative.

1250
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:38,700
No!

1251
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:40,500
I got 13.

1252
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:42,200
I got 7.

1253
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,400
I got a 9.

1254
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:44,800
I go first.

1255
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:50,620
All right, and they're gonna roll for initiative as well. I will defeat them and it's not gonna be close

1256
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,780
Yeah, i'm gonna kill joe pesci

1257
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:55,080
finally

1258
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:59,500
He every role he does is with disadvantage because he has no nose right

1259
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:04,620
It's just not and he's short. Uh-huh and he's italian. Yeah

1260
01:05:04,620 --> 01:05:07,260
All right, that's it

1261
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:09,900
And he's bald across the line. Okay

1262
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:12,700
Uh, it is actually your turn

1263
01:05:13,340 --> 01:05:15,920
uh... hungry hamster alright so

1264
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:19,440
first thing i do i see i noticed jill pesci

1265
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:23,460
and she referred to it as a great that's a great that's a good that takes up an

1266
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,060
action to have at the time

1267
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:29,300
no that's your action in your movement so i see jill pesci

1268
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:30,860
uh...

1269
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,220
first thing i do

1270
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,860
is that like

1271
01:05:33,860 --> 01:05:37,020
scurry a little bit second first thing you do

1272
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:42,220
no well then you know that i don't know if it was not just them

1273
01:05:42,220 --> 01:05:46,940
so i see jill pesci and then i i immediately i'd jump up and i try to

1274
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:50,140
jump into his nose hole that i made

1275
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:52,820
okay let's see what the uh...

1276
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,820
you could definitely try to do that but c_n_n_ r_c_a_

1277
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,740
if you use your full movement

1278
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:01,620
and then to a uh... uh... enrolled e_-twenty

1279
01:06:01,620 --> 01:06:02,700
the

1280
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:09,700
let's do it and they were the twenty at your acrobatics

1281
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:11,780

1282
01:06:11,780 --> 01:06:13,780
let's go

1283
01:06:13,780 --> 01:06:15,780
and then a 23

1284
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:17,780
you gotta crit 20

1285
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:19,780
you gotta crit 20

1286
01:06:19,780 --> 01:06:21,780
so you just jump

1287
01:06:21,780 --> 01:06:23,780
i mean i can't stop that

1288
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:25,780

1289
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:27,780
so you just jump right into this guys face

1290
01:06:27,780 --> 01:06:29,780

1291
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,780

1292
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,780

1294
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,780

1295
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:41,780
Okay, yeah, sure. I'll let you try to control his legs like this.

1296
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,780
Does Plankton jump on someone's face?

1297
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:45,780
No, he goes into SpongeBob's brain, remember?

1298
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:47,780
I would have said Ratatouille, but...

1299
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,780
Yeah, I would have gone Ratatouille.

1300
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,780
I would have gone a lot of stuff before Plankton.

1301
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:53,780
You know, we're being a little nitpicky on Pat.

1302
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,780
I'm gonna pull off.

1303
01:06:55,780 --> 01:06:57,780
Ease up.

1304
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,780
No, buddy, you're crushing it.

1305
01:06:59,780 --> 01:07:01,780
Dude, I rolled a 20 and a 23.

1306
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:03,780
You're crushing it. Dude, you're the best D&D player ever.

1307
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,780
What are we talking about?

1308
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,780
Just let you play it all.

1309
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:12,780
Alright, so, I am controlling him like Ratatouille now.

1310
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,780
That's your full, like, turn.

1311
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:15,780
Okay.

1312
01:07:15,780 --> 01:07:16,780
You can't do anything else.

1313
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:19,780
I can't control him like Ratatouille yet, but trust me, it's coming.

1314
01:07:19,780 --> 01:07:22,780
I'm gonna let you try next turn.

1315
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,780
I think it'll be a certain couple of rolls.

1316
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:30,780
Um, you are up, motherfucking Pleasant Parent.

1317
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:38,780
Alright, so I'm gonna fly a little... wait what's my...

1318
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:40,780
Cameron, come in here.

1319
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:41,780
I'm trying to remember.

1320
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:43,780
Hey, blessed parrot, come in here!

1321
01:07:43,780 --> 01:07:46,780
Yeah, I'm close enough to get to Jafar.

1322
01:07:46,780 --> 01:07:47,780
Oh, okay.

1323
01:07:47,780 --> 01:07:48,780
Not Skeletor.

1324
01:07:48,780 --> 01:07:51,780
Yeah, so I fly to Jafar.

1325
01:07:51,780 --> 01:07:52,780
God damn it.

1326
01:07:52,780 --> 01:07:54,780
And I use my Talon's attack on him.

1327
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,780
Okay, yeah, do it.

1328
01:07:56,780 --> 01:07:57,780
Ten.

1329
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,780
Yeah, it's not gonna hit.

1330
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:04,420
You try to get in there and it just clacks on the bones. He's like, ah

1331
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:07,900
You can't pierce these bones

1332
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:11,140
You should have known he was bones

1333
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,980
Geoff's bones are clearly bones

1334
01:08:13,980 --> 01:08:16,860
He's made out of bones

1335
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:21,100
It could be a soft bone. It looks like a Halloween decoration

1336
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:27,740
Looks like bones, but he's made of flesh

1337
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:29,740
I

1338
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,840
Don't know any of those guys

1339
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:36,780
I have a cousin you think like in the freak show. There's a guy like that

1340
01:08:36,780 --> 01:08:40,500
There could be a guy who looks like he's made of bones, but you touch him and he's just a guy

1341
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,500
I've never met a guy like that

1342
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:50,120
No, you're thinking of more suits no, that's what a guy looks like he's made of a suit

1343
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:54,780
Guy in a skeleton more you thinking of Phoebe Bridgers

1344
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:57,420
she's got skeletons on her shirts all the time.

1345
01:08:57,420 --> 01:08:59,380
Never think about Phoebe Bridgers!

1346
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,380
Are you sure?

1347
01:09:00,380 --> 01:09:01,380
Yes!

1348
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:03,140
I'm thinking about Phoebe Bridgers.

1349
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:05,900
I'm thinking about her now too.

1350
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:08,340
Me and the hungry hamster high five.

1351
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:14,100
I poke my little hand out of Joe Pesci's face and we do a little air high five.

1352
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:17,100
Okay it's your turn Norval Dog.

1353
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:25,420
So, upon seeing that, the bone man, I just get so hungry and I go in for a bite.

1354
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:26,580
That's right son.

an actual zero. He got a natural zero. A natural one minus one. He literally got just like a

1396
01:11:35,980 --> 01:11:43,580
hard zero. He rolled a zero on the die. Created a new side just for him. Hungry Hamster, you

01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:56,580
your own blood. You're existing in a liminal space right now. Like I always do. Yeah. And

1399
01:11:56,580 --> 01:12:02,740
And uh, but you two, um, uh, normal dog, you're focusing on Skeletor.

1400
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:09,300
Pleasant parrot, you're the one who notices, out of the side, comes motherfuckin' ManBearPig.

1401
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,300
No.

1402
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,860
Wait, maybe he'll help us.

1403
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,740
Yeah, we told him to only kill people.

1404
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,620
Who swipes at Skeletor.

1405
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:20,740
Well, it's not really a person, but I'll let you, I'll let you kill a ManBearPig.

1406
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,540
That's, he's more of a skeleton.

1407
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:23,940
It's what's inside of a person.

1408
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,260
It is what's inside of a person.

1409
01:12:26,260 --> 01:12:45,580

1410
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:46,640

Okay, now that Caleb's back, now that normal dog is back, I run away.

1426
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:13,940
Okay, you can try it. You can run away. You'll provoke an attack of opportunity

1427
01:14:13,940 --> 01:14:18,580
for anyone who's trying to attack you, anyone who's near you.

1428
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:32,580

1446
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:28,700

1447
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:38,300
So anyway, it's now your turn PleasantParrot. Okay, I use Peck on Skeletor. Do it. 16. Yeah,

1448
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:45,300
it's

1449
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:51,420
I tell I tell man bear pig I'm making it just the way you like it

1450
01:16:51,420 --> 01:16:58,520
Please don't do this to me. He's like freaking out. Meanwhile, I'm right on the head when he says that yeah

1451
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:03,180
You do a damage and I think what you already do you already did 11 right normal dog? Yeah

1452
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:03,820
Yeah

1453
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:07,660
you just like start pecking him in the sweat and like the forehead like

1454
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:13,160
And it's just like starts to make a crack and the crack starts to splinter wider. It's killatory's just like

1455
01:17:13,940 --> 01:17:15,940
He's like not looking very good at all

1456
01:17:15,940 --> 01:17:18,500
It's your turn normal dog

1457
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:24,580
I'm gonna tackle. All right do it who 12 skeletal. Okay, okay, that doesn't hit

1458
01:17:24,580 --> 01:17:28,100
Actually, wait, no, we should give our pig the time

1459
01:17:28,100 --> 01:17:32,260
Anyway, I'm wrong actually because you were the first person to hit Skeletor

1460
01:17:32,260 --> 01:17:37,460
So you actually have advantage because of your crime dog ability so that does hit so roll for damage. My life is brilliant

1461
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:41,340
Yes, nine. Yeah, describe your killing Skeletor you kill

1462
01:17:42,220 --> 01:17:47,160
All right, he's just a bunch of bundle of bones to me. So I start digging a hole in the ground

1463
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:51,940
Cuz I'm gonna bury his ass. Don't bury him. Don't bury that man bear. No, no

1464
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:54,660
To eat him don't bury

1465
01:17:54,660 --> 01:18:00,260
Fetch well, I already started burying no

1466
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:06,420
Uncover the top of Jimmy Hoffa's head

1467
01:18:10,780 --> 01:18:15,780
and then I throw him into ManBearPig's mouth.

1468
01:18:15,780 --> 01:18:23,780
Yeah, you do. ManBearPig already has Joe Pesci in his mouth, so the bones just like shoot up and like ManBearPig...

1469
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,780
I kind of bukkake him with bones.

1470
01:18:25,780 --> 01:18:27,780
Yeah, I'm gonna see him fall and explode on his head.

1471
01:18:27,780 --> 01:18:30,780
I'm gonna give ManBearPig a chance to try to grab onto it.

1472
01:18:30,780 --> 01:18:35,780
I'm gonna roll a straight... I think that's dex, basically.

1473
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:36,480
It's athletics.

1474
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:40,380
It's like catching grapes in your mouth with like which he's

1475
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,080
very good at so yeah people know that about.

1476
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:48,480
Yeah, so he just like makes like just enough space and you

1477
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:51,180
start to hear Joe Pesci's voice again because it's been screaming

1478
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:52,480
headfirst into his throat.

1479
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:55,280
So he'll go and then you like you see like the skeletons just

1480
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:58,980
all kind of fall into his mouth and he's just chewing on them

1481
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:01,180
and they're both going to go.

1482
01:19:01,180 --> 01:19:04,480
They're going to try to get out of this situation there.

1483
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,000
will actually no sorry just your passion is going to try to get out of the

1484
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,400
situation he's in

1485
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,480
uh... he is unable to

1486
01:19:11,480 --> 01:19:13,520
evidence man bear pigs turn

1487
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:16,080
uh... he's going to use to

1488
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,360
on joe pesci

1489
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,000
stability he has

1490
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:23,160
yeah he's just gonna eat joe pesci

1491
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:25,320
and he just devours joe pesci

1492
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,520
and skeletal or

1493
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:28,280
so

1494
01:19:28,280 --> 01:19:30,740
and uh... they're both gone

1495
01:19:30,740 --> 01:19:32,060
wall

1496
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:33,520
and uh... uh...

1497
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,640
you see uh...

1498
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,640
man bear pig uh...

1499
01:19:37,640 --> 01:19:40,380
now it's a sort of wiping the blood from his mouth

1500
01:19:40,380 --> 01:19:41,360
uh...

1501
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,480
uh...

1502
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,920
here i remind him that we fist bumped in that were friends

1503
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:50,000
and uh... he he sort of like that doesn't really regard that he'd like and then he

1504
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:50,760
uh...

1505
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,240
he reaches down

1506
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,560
and uh...

1507
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:56,200
uh... feels around for like a pocket

1508
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,400
and he finds a good

1509
01:19:57,400 --> 01:19:59,360
part of his flesh like in between

1510
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:01,800
bear and pig and pulls out like a note

1511
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,240
this slimy note

1512
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:04,920
any hands it to you

1513
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:08,880
and hungry hamster and then he just sort of walks away

1514
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:09,860
uh...

1515
01:20:09,860 --> 01:20:13,320
war and it says uh...

1516
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:15,280

sticker yeah

1524
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:40,700
metal man metal man maybe that's like a friend of the command

1525
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:42,200
uh...

1526
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:45,400
that must be shredder

1527
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,780
there's no way that's not

1528
01:20:46,780 --> 01:20:49,960
i think it's metal maria's there's a man let's it's metal maria

1529
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:53,680
yet or anything it might be better than they're paying right

1530
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:56,900
could that had someone else of written that for

1531
01:20:56,900 --> 01:21:00,780
uh... someone else might have helped write him right that's more than we do

1532
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:05,060
anything you know about that in my mind i was a section channel analyze the

1533
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:07,860
handwriting yes absolutely do an insight check

1534
01:21:07,860 --> 01:21:10,400
okay can you all of your

1535
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:15,720
always yeah yeah fuckin advantage on all investigation and percent yet to it

1536
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,660
the crime dot

1537
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:20,140
sniff out the handwriting i don't know how to tell them just role like

1538
01:21:20,140 --> 01:21:24,140
investigation or insight or whatever and just take the higher number.

1539
01:21:24,140 --> 01:21:25,140
Okay.

1540
01:21:25,140 --> 01:21:27,540
You will just get advantage on it.

1541
01:21:27,540 --> 01:21:28,540
Thirteen.

1542
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:34,100
Yeah, that's, you're able to tell that like ManBearPig probably couldn't grip any writing

1543
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:41,140
instrument known to humans to make that out.

1544
01:21:41,140 --> 01:21:46,060
And you can also start to see that, well with that I think that's mostly what you can tell.

1545
01:21:46,060 --> 01:21:48,340
Does anybody else want to try to see if they can understand it?

1546
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:49,340
I'll try it.

1547
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:57,340
try to see if you can. 15. Yeah, I would say that like between Crime Dog, Crime Dog's Caleb

1548
01:21:57,340 --> 01:22:06,780
and Pleasant Parrot, you can start to realize that like all the eyes in that note look like

1549
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:14,380
knives. Okay, okay. Alright. I think I know who wrote this. Look exactly like knives. Jeffrey

1550
01:22:14,380 --> 01:22:29,380
the

1551
01:22:29,380 --> 01:22:37,380
and I'm sorry. You better be. So yeah, you guys now are kind of rid of your rivals as far as you can tell.

1552
01:22:37,380 --> 01:22:41,460
But it seems that the candy hamster... Okay, I've got a great idea. Ready? What are you thinking?

1553
01:22:41,460 --> 01:22:48,660
I pray to God. Okay, which God? Which religion?

1554
01:22:48,660 --> 01:22:55,780
Flying spaghetti monster. I did make you proficient at religion because I knew you

1555
01:22:55,780 --> 01:22:57,940
immediate failure doing that.

1556
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,580
Wait, who do you pray?

1557
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,700
You pray the flying spaghetti monster.

1558
01:23:01,700 --> 01:23:06,200
Yeah. You just see like a green text reply in the sky.

1559
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,240
It's very funny.

1560
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:11,700
And the green text tells me what about the candy hamster?

1561
01:23:11,700 --> 01:23:14,800
You know what? I'm going to

1562
01:23:14,800 --> 01:23:17,840
don't let him win.

1563
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:19,080
No, no, no, it's fine.

1564
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:22,500
It's that hungry hamster roll a history check to see if you can remember

1565
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:25,080
anything about the candy hamster.

1566
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,080
*laughter*

1567
01:23:27,080 --> 01:23:29,080
*laughter*

1568
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,080
You are pretty sure he was made of meat.

1569
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,080
*laughter*

1570
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:37,080
Yeah guys, I'm pretty sure he was made out of tendons.

1571
01:23:37,080 --> 01:23:39,080
The meat hamster.

1572
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:43,080
I might be remembering a different hamster from my life.

1573
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,080
No, you're thinking of Skeletor!

1574
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:47,080
No, he had bones.

1575
01:23:47,080 --> 01:23:53,080
I think I might be thinking of the tendon hamster.

1576
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:56,100
And you see you start to see the crowds around you

1577
01:23:56,100 --> 01:24:02,320
The earthbound looking suspiciously earthbound looking characters crowd around you start to go

1578
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:08,020
Towards you see them more than now towards going towards the the stadium and getting in line

1579
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:11,720
So like the concert's gonna start like fairly soon

1580
01:24:11,720 --> 01:24:19,320
Pleasant parrot roll a wisdom saving throw just similar to what you rolled very early on in this campaign

1581
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:21,840
Okay. Mm-hmm

1582
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:22,840
Fifteen.

1583
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:23,840
Okay.

1584
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:24,840
Your...

1585
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:29,840
What the fuck is that?

1586
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,840
I rolled a fudge.

1587
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,120
You rolled a DF.

1588
01:24:33,120 --> 01:24:34,760
That's a fudge roll.

1589
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:42,960
So you, uh, you, uh, feel your head shake similar to last time.

1590
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:49,120
And that cryptic sort of words that you heard, the "wish you could last" comes back in, but

1591
01:24:49,120 --> 01:24:53,520
This time you also hear "I'm waiting for you, pleasant parrot"

1592
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:55,440
and then it goes away.

1593
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,240
That's the lead singer of Stay.

1594
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,040
[laughter]

1595
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,480
He's a vampire.

1596
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:02,480
[laughter]

1597
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,480

1598
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:14,480

1599
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:38,480
