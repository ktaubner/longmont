2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Last time on Gun City, a broad city, the Uncle's Falcon, our heroes founded a new restaurant that serves hot dog--

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
wait, no, that serves hot soda and cold dogs, which I'm pretty sure was just called Hot Soda and Cold Dogs.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I couldn't find me saying the name in my recording, so...

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and passed the business on to Sullivan the Frog's superfan Gary C. Enterprise.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Convinced a few people to commit suicide, and then, atop a giant worm,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
they rode through Soy Lake to meet with Freaking Carol Baskin,

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
only to discover she was murdered.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The boys dug through her belongings, discovering hidden messages

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
sent between Freaking Carol and several mysterious characters

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
we've come to know and love throughout the arc.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
They found a terrified little tiger named Tigger,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,440
who told the gang some more info on what freaking Carroll was up to before he was suddenly seized

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,960
with terror backing away from the boys and promptly assassinated by the killer Kiklops,

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,680
an elite assassin within Papi Chuko's ranks. In the midst of all this chaos, the boys also

16
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:10,720
received a distressing call from their assistant and pal Sullivan, who seems to have been caught

17
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,720
in some terrible fight at the suckler's den. Patrick Yoda's spectacular ears allowed him to

18
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,600
pick up that it could be Papi Chuko himself who abducted their dear friend. And Patrick

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,600
Gilda's spectacular aim allowed him to finish off Killer Kiklops before he did some truly insane shit that maybe I will share in the discord one day.

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:35,100
Following a tip from that same mysterious number that texted our heroes before, our three sleuths traveled beneath freaking Carol's home,

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,600
underneath Soy Lake and found the return pods back to the real world from The Matrix 2.

22
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,100
Their arrival, however, was intercepted by a mysterious scientist who stands before them now,

23
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,100
Ready to launch into an absurdly long monologue that will hopefully clear up some stuff,

24
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,100
but will leave just enough mystery at the edges to keep people curious about what's going on.

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:58,100
Um, reminders. None of the reminders are really going to be relevant,

26
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:02,100
um, because, uh, there's going to be sort of a reset, you'll see.

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Um, but, uh, Patrick Yoda, you have level one addiction to Techno Slime,

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,100
and Rey, you have level two. That's really the only thing that matters right now.

29
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:17,100
I would not have that. What does that do?

30
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:25,100
For level 1 it just means that every time Patrick Yoda takes it, he has a risk of reaching to level 2 addiction.

31
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:36,100
And also that whenever he takes Techno Slime, he's going to have disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws afterwards.

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,100
He started crying because disadvantage was so sad.

33
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,800
I can imagine him having disadvantage.

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,100
This has something in my eye.

35
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,700
There's something about disadvantage Patrick's everywhere in the world.

36
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Well, we can talk about that.

37
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:59,300
But some of that, I mean that will only matter depending on how the next few moments go.

38
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,900
So you guys, just to set you guys up, so you have room here.

39
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,500
You guys fell sort of like a cartoon like blump, blump, blump, right?

40
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,860
like on top of each other. I'm on top. Okay. Nope. I'm in the middle. Nevermind. I'm on

41
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:18,140
the bottom. I changed my mind. I'm on top but I'm standing because I'm so small. Okay. So

42
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,660
you two fell and on your like stomachs and Patrick you're just sort of like just like

43
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:29,260
sort of like glided in and is standing. I have the force. Yeah, that's right. And before

44
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:37,220
you is a scientist with crazy hair and you know, a lab coat that's all dirty and matted

45
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:43,620
But his lab is like a gorgeous like technological wonder you see, you know test tubes and pipes and all that shit

46
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,700
but also you see like

47
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:52,020
That fucking like astrolabe kind of shit in the middle that's just like spinning and conducting something that you know

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,100
You don't know what it's conducting

49
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,420
uh

50
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:01,940
And and you also see a giant uh, like machine that looks like some sort of shrink ray

51
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,580
and

52
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,580
Uh, he sort of looks at all of you

53
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:17,380
uh like a like a real ricky morty sort of way and he says uh uh at last we finally meet i'm so glad

54
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:27,860
what is it is that ricky morty no my name is dr tool lateralis

55
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:30,740
Well, from earlier.

56
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,740
Yeah, maybe.

57
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:35,740
Why would you say that?

58
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,940
I heard your name before.

59
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,380
Yeah, I believe that.

60
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,280
I mean, you said at last we meet.

61
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:45,380
So, I mean, I think it's pretty fair to assume that we might have heard of you.

62
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,740
I don't know why you're acting so crazy.

63
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,680
Are you OK?

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,880
I don't understand why you said that now.

65
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,040
OK, well, I feel your forehead.

66
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,800
Are you feeling OK?

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,040
He feels OK.

68
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,140
OK, you're all right.

69
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:03,420
the area and i will claim the but he has a lot of what he's on your laptop

70
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,060
now that i look at it

71
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:10,300
the way but i would like my hands on your laptop to i a

72
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:15,660
i wouldn't have it any other way alright thank you i've got some dirt on my hands

73
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,980
for the better

74
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,260
fondling the scientist i'm gonna stay on the floor

75
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,540
and you know

76
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,580

skin

82
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:37,960
no it's just that it's respectful to stand up and you have a laboratory you

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,140
respect him in his laboratory

84
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,320

yeah what is what i did not realize that one day i'm not going to be then

89
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,460
Why did you tell why are you doing a Boston accent Patrick Yoda? What what changed in your brain?

90
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:00,540
I've been doing it

91
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,700
You're doing a different accent in this episode

92
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,820
I don't remember the last one I did

93
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,700
He did it for six episodes

94
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,020
You were doing like a how did you forget?

95
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,660
We're gonna do this you're gonna do in that. Hey, I did one of these. Hey, how's it going?

96
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,020
How you doing?

97
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,620
Like this. No, you sounded like a 1930s baseball player and no, ah, okay. I see

98
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,260
i see you there we go we go now it's back

00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:43,580
from boston okay mr tool lateralis seat what's up man it's dr tool

102
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:51,260
lateralis oh okay look i didn't spend seven days at bed school to not

103
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:58,300
lie about being a doctor. Anyway, I have much to tell you, please. And he's sort of like,

104
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,220
you see like three like very comfy chairs come up from the ground, sort of below you guys to

105
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:12,220
like get you guys settled in. I have a very long monologue to go through. When I was a young,

106
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:19,980
just a young scientist of around 527, I was working at Stakehams Federation of Bodies and Spaces as a

107
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:23,500
a four-hire chief researcher in the Technical Innovation and Development

108
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:27,260
Division under the potentially war crime type stuff if everybody is cool with

109
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:34,020
that department. I'm fine with war crimes. Hey, they were too. There I was hired to

110
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,340
develop the Calculus Rift, an idea that came to then president of

111
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:43,620
Stakehams, XKCD Musk, in one of his many dreams where Lila Futurama beats him to

112
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,540
death with his father's penis. The vision was to create a way to bring the virtual

113
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,900
people into the real world.

114
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,620
Beginning the process of blending our universes.

115
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,580
I worked on the project for 10 long years and once it was complete, the Calculus Rift had

116
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,580
a slow adoption rate.

117
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:09,220
It turns out, marketing people to insert a device into their penis when they turn 13

118
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,020
was not as popular as we hoped.

119
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,060
At least not among all cultures or creeds.

120
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,740
The project was almost completely shut down

121
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,820
until Poppy Chuko's Technoslime Corporation stepped in,

122
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:23,060
bought up the rights to the technology,

123
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,960
my team, and brought in a ton of resources for us.

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,540
With his buy one and I will give you free drugs campaign,

125
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:31,580
Poppy had everyone and their great uncle

126
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:34,580
hooked on the calculus rift.

127
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,540
V folks and real folks were all intermingling

128
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,940
in beautiful harmony, you know,

129
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,700
and the future looked bright, you know, you've lived it.

130
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:43,620
One day, Poppy called me into his office

131
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:50,940
said what I'd been waiting for him to say. We need to go cordless. The Coculus Rift 2.0.

132
00:08:50,940 --> 00:09:06,820
The Coculus Quest cordless experience. This was it. The dream. No painful insertion. No

133
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:11,180
limits. A satellite based projection of Coculus Rift technology to everyone of all ages, of

134
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:16,180
all races, even the Polish, throughout all of planet E-Bone.

135
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,380
With the completion of the quest, the Matrix 2 would be able to fully blend with our world.

136
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,980
It would be the end of reality, the end of virtual reality.

137
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:29,420
There would only be a hyper-reality superimposed upon our collective interpretation of the present.

138
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,900
XKCD Musk's dream of being beaten to death by Leela Futurama, whenever and wherever he

139
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,300
wanted was finally in reach.

140
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,540
I began development for the next few months, working tirelessly, day in and day out, when?

141
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,020
Out of the blue, I was contacted by a mysterious man

142
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:45,900
referring to himself as S&M.

143
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:50,900
Our correspondence spanded a wide array of topics.

144
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,620
But one he was keen on learning more about

145
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:57,140
was the thing I could not divulge on,

146
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,260
Calculus Rift 2.0.

147
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,460
As our friendship grew, we decided to meet in person

148
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,540
in a surreptitious sort of manner.

149
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,940
And it was none other than famous activist, Sean McElwee.

150
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,860
Sean was concerned about something he learned

151
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,420
from an inside source in Poppy's crew

152
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,780
about what the calculus Riff was being used for.

153
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,900
What he described to me was certainly believable,

154
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,300
but preposterous controlling people's minds.

155
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,400
It's been tried, of course.

156
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,540
And it's been tried of course,

157
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,940
by every corporation worth its salt in gun city,

158
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,780
but no one has ever been so heartless

159
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:28,320
or competent to carry it out.

160
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,580
And not with my technology, certainly.

161
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,860
Well, I took what Sean said very seriously

162
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,580
as there's no person more serious

163
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,380
than activist Sean McKay.

164
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,080
And so I dug into some of what Poppy was up to.

165
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,420
And it was true.

166
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,980
I was heartbroken.

167
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,260
Suddenly the implications of making the Oculus 2.0

168
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
horrified me.

169
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,860
Poppy would effectively be able to control the entire world,

170
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,520
getting everyone hooked on techno slime,

171
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,820
suddenly manipulating every facet of our lives.

172
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,400
I began to stall on the project

173
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,980
while Sean and I planned a way to disrupt

174
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,900
Poppy's nefarious scheme.

175
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,380
Sean was Poppy's nephew-in-law,

176
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:02,200
which is one of the most treasured of relationships.

177
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,540
And he used that and his sly charm and good looks

178
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,420
to our advantage,

179
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,140
discovering details of Poppy's plans,

180
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,040
figuring out ways to sabotage and expose his corruption.

181
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,960
But of course, it went all the way up.

182
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,260
Jeff Tiedrich was aware of it, the Mad Suckler.

183
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,180
All of these big players knew that Poppy

184
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:18,140
had some control over the population,

185
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,940
but not to what extent, we realized.

186
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,440
If we could get these guys to turn on Poppy,

187
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,860
maybe then we could bring in Stakehams,

188
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,060
which still has some authority, however marginal,

189
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,500
and the public at large to condemn him

190
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,300
and cancel him forever.

191
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,380
A fate worse than death.

192
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,380
But Sean, well, he had his vices.

193
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,480
He would fall out of contact suddenly.

194
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,280
Sleeping with one V-Girl one night,

195
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,620
double teaming another with cyborg David Blaine another night.

196
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,980
He'd go on benders,

197
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,580
just to escape the pressure of his great duty to activism.

198
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:50,020
My dilly-dallying was starting to frustrate Poppy meanwhile.

199
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,100
He was picking up on my intention to delay progress.

200
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,540
So I was taken off the Cocculus Rift 2.0 project

201
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,660
and relegated to the abandoned porno factory,

202
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,580
where I was under surveillance by his goons

203
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:01,260
and forced to develop new techno-slime products.

204
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,120
Sean had been missing for a few days now,

205
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,180
but he arrived at the factory to rescue me.

206
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,420
But in my escape, he was captured.

207
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,720
I haven't seen him since.

208
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,600
I don't even know if he's alive.

209
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,040
Before this, Mommy Goodlegs and freaking Carol Baskins

210
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,580
were the only two broads worth a damn,

211
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,280
helping me keep track of Sean.

212
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,740
They were our gals on the inside,

213
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,160
but soon their correspondence stopped as well.

214
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,040
I learned what happened to Carol.

215
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,940
But Mommy, I think she just got cold feet.

216
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,280
So I've remained here in my secret laboratory

217
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,120
underneath Comet Ping Pong 2,

218
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,420
hoping the top 10's tattletale agencies

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,260
Investigation would lead you to the Matrix 2.

220
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,540
Praying I'd be able to intercept you

221
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,940
when you transported out of it.

222
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,620
I'd like to think mommy had some idea

223
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:43,560
what I was thinking and help set this up,

224
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,600
but I don't know.

225
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,540
Regardless, at last, the music swells.

226
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,300
Gentlemen, we meet.

227
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,780
You see, you were the key to our plan all along

228
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,880
because the three of you are Papi Chuko's best agents.

229
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:01,460
We were hoping to get to you before too much attention

230
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,540
was drawn to your investigation,

231
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,500
nevertheless

232
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,060
To even have you three in my laboratories a miracle

233
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:13,420
Poppy has been controlling you for years and the last act you did for me or for him rather was to capture Sean McKelvey

234
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,500
You are his kidnappers

235
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:24,060
What I have been working on is a way to remove the cockula's rift from people's penises and we need to remove them from yours

236
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,700
Immediately so we can escape so you can escape poppies control

237
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:33,060
Afterwards, we'll set up a meeting with him and he'll think he can control you, but he won't be able to so you play right along

238
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,100
And you know, then you pass but before all that we have to get inside your penises

239
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,460
That'll make sense

240
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:57,000
And Ray William Johnson, what's your way to belittle that?

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that

242
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,880
I love Adam Curtis.

243
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,360
And what are you listening to, Bluetooth-piss?

244
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,360
Just white noise.

245
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
You were just talking for a long time.

246
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,600
I was trying to go to sleep.

247
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,000
Yeah, I get it.

248
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,280
While writing this, I realized this is probably going to be a huge turnoff for them.

249
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,120
And maybe even for the listeners.

250
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,120
But it had to get out some way.

251
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Anyway.

252
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,400
This is huge.

253
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,400
my jaw is a gape

254
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,880
so you're saying we were under control the whole time?

255
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,160
well not the whole time

256
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,100
you know you've been acting as if you were controlling us. so you're saying when i

257
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,600
when i fucked my big beautiful

258
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:07,120
Dominican wife, Cameron, you're saying Bobby Chuko

259
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
he made me do that?

260
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,040
no no no no no

261
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,640
not all of the time. yes i think he did

262
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,160
i think that's what he would never he would never fuck a woman of his own

263
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:24,160
police and i mean i i i don't i don't even know exactly why

264
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,160
you know i mean i don't think that i mean surely are are restaurant cold dogs and

265
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,940
hot soda

266
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:36,360
that i don't work that it was all of the way we did that

267
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,760
well i know we did that

268
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,160
yeah there's no doubt in my mind that i think you know that never have come up

269
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,080
up with such an incredibly smart business plan.

270
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,160
- We've been thinking of that forever.

271
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,800
- What I'm saying is that not,

272
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
you are controlled all the time.

273
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,260
The times you're controlled, you probably black out.

274
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,360
You don't remember.

275
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,200
- I slap Ray William Johnson in the face and I say,

276
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,860
I think I just got controlled.

277
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:04,840
- Do it again.

278
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,560
- I do it again.

279
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,680
- Nice.

280
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,320
you have to do it one more time i think

281
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,200
yeah one more time i kick patrick

282
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,900
all right you weren't controlled then i know you weren't controlled then

283
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,100
this new voice is really getting me i don't know how you lost the voice

284
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,660
wait if i've been controlled this whole time

285
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,940
because i just lost control i'm not under control anymore and now i'm doing my normal voice

286
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,180
yeah and i'm just a guy

287
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,440
no listen

288
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,860
i'm gonna try doing a backflip

289
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,500
and i tried to act with the night is a small black

290
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,180
no no no role i can't object to truthfully

291
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:45,700
let's say i would like dungeons address instead

292
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,980
it's kind of my fault it's not just make 'em ups

293
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,780
yes

294
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,700
yeah you know it's sort of like a

295
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,320
you like to the thing where you like to land a little bit too

296
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,720
top-heavy it's easier to walk forward a bit

297
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:57,700
and you can see it

298
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,940
yeah i must definitely be being controlled is normally i would stick it

299
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:04,100
perfectly

300
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,740
okay tell it's not let's look

301
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,660
when you control when you're not controlled who's fucking who's

302
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,140
dominican wife

303
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,820
we need to focus

304
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:16,660
i know it's me to nobody else is bugging my dominican wife

305
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:20,060
well you know you don't know that yet

306
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,620
and that's how that's one of the mysteries we are we've been trying to

307
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,100
tell it where trying to figure out all these mysteries

308
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:32,060
yeah i guess the episode still young you could not get the right again

309
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:39,060
the

310
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:43,360
are going to have a set of this adventure in fifteen minutes

311
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
so

312
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,620
uh... in front of you there's a massive shrink way

313
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,420
well shrink

314
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,820
recruiting for a way

315
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:57,180
now is a massive shrink way but in front of you

316
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:01,720
and with with a small quest the wise sphere sitting at the end of the way

317
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,740
gun parted

318
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,160
machine

319
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,400
and since that's just my son

320
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,480
mcgann here

321
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,740
you've a very intelligent son he's hot he's done is so good at reading he's

322
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,800
talking to a shrink

323
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,780
the

324
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,900
well

325
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:23,800
to the side of that you see three jobs of raw techno slime

326
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:27,280
Similar to the stuff that Ray William Johnson drank a few episodes ago.

327
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:33,920
You see I kept busy in my lonesome laboratory under the abandoned porno factory. While I was under surveillance,

328
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,960
I wasn't necessarily under supervision so to speak,

329
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,960
so I developed this raw techno slime blend that when ingested

330
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:45,920
gives you the ability to withstand my shrink ray without your molecules turning into diarrhea.

331
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:50,520
I must warn you, once you drink this, we'll have to move quickly.

332
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,060
We'll treat two of you at a time. You will infiltrate the third one's penis and remove the calculus rift within it

333
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:04,920
It will require some ingenuity and you will likely have to face nanobot manifestations of your inner soul or as I named them

334
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,440
calculus guardians

335
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,280
They cannot be dismantled without confrontation of some kind and while the two while the two are on the inside

336
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,400
They'll be doing most of the heavy lifting

337
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,000
But the person whose penis they are inside it will need to perform the final

338
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:25,160
Exorcism of the calculus rift through a sheer force of will until that is completed the struggle will continue inside of the penis

339
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,800
you

340
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,080
So this is this is shin megami tensei penis five

341
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:34,640
You have to be willing to help yourself to get the help you need so to speak

342
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,420
So drink up and then we'll go inside a penis

343
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:42,280
Say that one more time

344
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,520
You want me to go inside of his penis? I pointed Patrick

345
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,700
Yeah, we can list leave the one on Patrick

346
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:56,240
Don't do that

347
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,800
Well, it's up to you guys I think it would be better if we all of you are not under poppies control

348
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,560
But if you really want to

349
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:07,000
Leave

350
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,720
They're gonna go in they're gonna go in my penis. Oh

351
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,880
Hey, man, if I gotta do it, let's do it man, whatever man

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,840
Do I still have those two other things of no you gave them you gave them to a junk

353
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,080
Didn't we give just one did we have a huge argument about?

354
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,880
About how many to give him? I

355
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,280
Think wait, let's check you. Did you update your inventory or did I update your inventory?

356
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,520
I looked at my inventory and it just says huge worm

357
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:47,720
I feel like I think I have one should we listen back like who's that will take so long to find now

358
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:54,280
I think I think we definitely just have one it would be very funny if someone gets mad about that about the inconsistency here

359
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,200
I pray

360
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,840
But yeah, so yeah, I mean regardless

361
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,220
So yeah, Ray William Johnson, you don't need to drink another one of these because you

362
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,360
Drank all of it that whole one

363
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,920
so

364
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,920
You're already sort of like

365
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:18,200
Lubricated more. Yeah, fuck it. I'd do it. Anyway. Yeah, of course you do. So yeah, all right, I drink my extra one. Yeah

366
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,960
Okay

367
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,280
- so you all drink it

368
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:30,440
The same description from last time right? So panorama of colors lights a gnarled subspace floods your senses and all that, right?

369
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,360
You know

370
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:32,860
Yeah

371
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,080
Yeah

372
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:37,000
As you attempt to move your body you feel each cell vibrate and stutter as if you're slipping through a vast

373
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,880
Primordial humming your bones and muscles weaken melt and shiver back together re-render not reform within each moment

374
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,360
Space and time feel observable the seas

375
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:51,320
Like seas swirling plasma clouding what remains of your sense of self. Is this ego death?

376
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,640
Ray William Johnson

377
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,220
Your vision that you had earlier remains the same you see

378
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:03,980
As it was last time you see fat bitches falling from the sky out of a giant coke zero can

379
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:06,680
falling into a pool from chameleon airs cribs

380
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:21,320
is

381
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:38,480
that

382
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,880
the who's saying that's like uh... who's there is uh...

383
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,860

384
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,960
i don't know what it's called

385
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,580

386
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,400
i'd just add a little bit

387
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,660
bobby bobbitt

388
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,320
okay so you hear that song you're going to be a good to see this

389
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,720

00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,560
smiles and your ear

391
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
and laughable

392
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:11,560
horrible

393
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:17,440
patrick you know

394
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,320

395
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,120
you see your homeworld fuck a sucker pop

396
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:25,520
it's rolling mists and strange swampy greenery

397
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,900
if you like a child once again

398
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,220
you're playing with your favorite toy

399
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,360
what was your favorite toy

400
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,960
my favorite toy was uh... it was

401
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,720
it's just another yoda

402
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,080
you only have yoda toys on there

403
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,880
that's so sad

404
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,720
your parents approach you in this vision as you're playing with your little yoda toy

405
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,040
and they tell you it's time to go to school

406
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,520
nope

407
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,760
(laughter)

408
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,380
- Do you stay and go to school or do you run?

409
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,640
- I run.

410
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,520
Are you kidding?

411
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:06,440

of the now trees that emerge from the receding green and thick waters

470
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,840
The once inundated lowlands revert back to a marshy swamp.

471
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:47,840
The air grows more humid as you walk through this strange penis, until you stumble across

472
00:26:47,840 --> 00:27:05,840

529
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,360

00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:15,680
patrick what do you see it to a form

536
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,680
What did you see in your vision?

537
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,180
Well...

538
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:23,980
I ran away from school, 'cause I didn't want to do homework.

539
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,780
That's a- a natural reaction.

540
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:27,880
*burp*

541
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,680
Excuse me.

542
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,980
I keep doing that.

543
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,180
*giggle*

544
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:31,980
But...

545
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,980
What that means to me is that...

546
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:34,680
Oh no.

547
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,380
You're going-

548
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,280
Boys!

549
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,980
You're going to need to fight...

550
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
Patrick's dad!

551
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,980
You're going to need to confront homework!

552
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,080
Oh, great.

553
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh my god. Here I got this. Hey you two should kiss.

554
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,080
That'd be pretty hot. You look like twins.

555
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,960
Homework you must do. They don't seem to know how to say anything besides.

556
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,560
These guys have no sense of humor.

557
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,240
Roll for initiative.

558
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,320
I'm rolling for initiative. Oh my game. One launch. Hold on.

559
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:11,680
So yeah, Patrick Yoda, while they're rolling for initiative and the conflict begins to grow,

560
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,680
You do start to feel like your penis vibrating more, not in a pleasurable sense.

561
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:23,880
You start to see visions of math problems and arithmetic floating in front of you and like attendance classes.

562
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,180
This is the worst thing that could have happened to me.

563
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:30,380
You hear like, "Yoda, Yoda," like you're late for class.

564
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,180
It's a Ferris Bueller reference.

565
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,680
Yeah, if I'm gonna keep--

566
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,680
How I wanna kill myself.

567
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:46,680
And yeah, you just see like images of like degrees and like, like pictures of pictures of essays is what I said.

568
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:55,680
Yeah, just everywhere. So what's going to happen is you guys are going to have to defeat these Yodas.

569
00:31:55,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Once you do, Patrick Yoda, you're going to have to perform some a task of some kind.

570
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
I'm know if you succeed

571
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:11,920
It will be exercised the the cockula serif if you fail the Yodas will come back

572
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:18,080
With not full health, but you'll have to defeat them again. You make Patrick exercise

573
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,320
Fucking luck brother. Hey

574
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:24,160
Hey watch it. Hey, man

575
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:30,040
I'm just having fun

576
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,320
So the Otis go first and

577
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,800
They we switch that around please. No, can we have it switched? Can we get that switch? We change that?

578
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:47,280
Initiative of 16 when we're when we're editing this episode. I'm putting our turn before theirs

579
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,880
And they move up a little bit there's three there's three now

580
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,440
You hear like overlaid like now like, you know for them homework you must do are they saying Homer? Oh

581
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,640
Yeah, I can do Homer

582
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:12,400
What do you

583
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,840
It is your turn Ray William Johnson, oh

587
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,780

and where do you what point you choose by the way

593
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:47,440

602
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,520
and it explodes, covering them in fiery demon cum.

603
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,600
And they're like, "AHH! HOMEWORK YOU MUST DO! AHH!"

604
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,740
They're just like, burning.

605
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,700
They're still standing, but they're not looking too good.

I'm sorry.

635
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,400
- Oh, bitch, dude.

636
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,880
- He's like, "Hmm, you should do homework.

637
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,920
"I mean, homework you must do."

638
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:28,240
(all laughing)

639
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,960
- Meanwhile, the Yodas are now back again.

640
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
Dr. Toul Laderal is like working at the computer,

641
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,600
typing, typing away.

642
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,960
Patrick Yoda, you're sort of just like, you know,

643
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,920
still suffering from this like vision of school

644
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,220
and arithmetic.

645
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,160
And--

646
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,000
- I hate it.

647
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,880
- Yeah. - I hate it.

648
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,240
and roll a wisdom saving throw.

649
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,080
- Me?

650
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:52,920
- Mm-hmm.

651
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,360
- Okay, 14.

652
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,420
- Okay, yeah.

653
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,800
So you see a math problem sort of come at

654
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,600
into your field of vision,

655
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,400
and you're able to dispel it

656
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,920
with an image of a cold hot dog.

657
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,760
Just sort of vanishes away.

658
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,580
- Nice.

659
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,420
- Yeah.

660
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,840
And one of these Yodas is not gonna be able to multiply now,

661
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:15,360
but the other two will,

662
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,040
and they're approaching you.

663
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,200
on now

664
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:21,200
and they're able to sort of dislike float in the air

665
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,640
she

666
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,600

And he's gone.

712
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,220
But suddenly, it starts to rumble and you see the swamp open up.

713
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:14,220
And out comes the granddaddy.

714
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,220

No, you know it's not good.

735
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,660
You know what's not good though is taking

736
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,660

737
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,660

00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
I'll take none.

741
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,660
Caleb, if you take all the damage

742
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:24,660
you will be the best guy in the world.

743
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
Seriously?

744
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,660
Yeah, if you take all the damage

745
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,660
You think it would make me cool?

that's right can you hear me

753
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,940
what's going on

754
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:57,180
your dad is big now

755
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,060

756
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,220
tell them to get small

757
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,780
No, listen, I have an idea.

758
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,080
What?

759
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:07,620
I need you to jack off.

760
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,900
Oh, fuck it.

761
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,700
Right here?

762
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,940
Right here, right now.

763
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:14,980
Well, I don't, I don't know.

764
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,700
Jeez.

765
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,860
You, you, you'll eat us, man.

766
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:21,060
Please, Patrick, it's our only hope.

767
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:23,460
So we can shoot your dad out of your wiener.

768
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,340
Shoot my dad out my wiener?

769
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,100
Just ignore that, just start jacking off.

770
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,780
I guess you can't really see what's happening.

771
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,900
Just trust me, man.

772
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:47,820
and

773
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,820
It's not a bad idea.

774
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:55,380
Look, I can give you privacy, but I think jacking off might be in our best interest.

775
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,740
You have to do it, dude.

776
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Ah, crap.

777
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,740
This sucks.

778
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,980
Please, do it for us.

779
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:02,980
Come on.

780
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980

00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,900
You're, you, you could, here, wait.

00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,380
You hate jacking off, are you gay?

784
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,100
I looked at blowtos, look, I got this.

785
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,020
You're not man enough to jack off.

786
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,020

787
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,020

794
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,740
(laughing)

795
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,660
- You got nasty fucking swamp cum, dude.

796
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,340
- And you watch as the Yoda dad is like,

797
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,780
"No, son's innocence."

798
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,740
And like starts to like vibrate a little bit.

799
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,540
- Son's innocence?

800
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,660
(laughing)

801
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,740
- He takes damage from just realizing his son jerks off.

802
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:07,980
(laughing)

803
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,500
- He takes, nice, he takes,

804
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,620
takes ten psychic damage

805
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,020
well that wasn't even worth it man

806
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:22,500
no that's pretty good he's like your fucking knuckles push up against me

807
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,980
and i mean

808
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,380
why'd you use your knuckles?

809
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,300
that's just how i do it

810
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,500
i'm sorry

811
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:35,020
he does it between two fists

812
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:39,380
yeah nobody jacks off with their knuckles i don't know what i'm talking about

813
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:40,120
uh...

814
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:43,840
But yeah, that's like a free damage, so it's pretty good.

815
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:47,080
You watch as the dad is sort of just rattled by this.

816
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,760
That was just like a free action, so you still can attack.

817
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,680
- Oh, nice, dude.

818
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,960
Okay, all right.

819
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,080
Dude, I'm so smart.

820
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:58,080
All right, now I'm gonna use my Matrix Beam.

821
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,160
- Oh, fuck yes.

822
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,340
Oh, that absolutely hits. - 23.

Yeah, so you concentrate your energy into your USB sword, and you point it at the Yoda, and

827
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:22,940
this beam of Matrix code shoots out of it, and starts to, you watch it sort of like rattle

828
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,760
its skull, and it's like vibrating violently.

829
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,560
Oh, excuse me.

830
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,960
And it looks like it's almost done.

831
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:35,120
Like, it looks like it's all psychic damage it's taken, and it's like, it's like slowly

00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,680
and where that

873
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:46,160
yoda came up from

874
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,060
the ground that giant doug yoda

875
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:49,280
outcomes a giant

876
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,240
metallic looking like computer chip

877
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,800
in the shape of a state comes frozen dinner

878
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,640
and I need both of you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

879
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:01,440
Oh dude I got this.

880
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:02,440
It's nothing to me.

881
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:03,440
I got a 14.

882
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,440
No I got an 11.

883
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:05,440
No I got an 11.

884
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,440
You got a 14.

885
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,440
Okay.

886
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:11,400
Uh, both of you get- Please don't hurt me!

887
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Don't get hurt.

888
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:20,600
Uh, what happens is this giant frozen dinner/computer chip flies out and *woof* *womp* gets both

889
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:22,120
of you in the gut.

890
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,040
Flies out towards the end of the penis.

891
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:27,800
You pass by all the weird fog and the trees and the swamp,

892
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,940
and with a now dry swamp,

893
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:33,220
and you shoot out of the tip of Patrick Yoda's penis,

894
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:37,060
and Dr. Tualat Aralis pulls a lever,

895
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,640
and as you come your friends,

896
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,120
Patrick Yoda, you watch as they grow in size

897
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,720
right before you.

898
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,320
- Now that's what I call draining the swamp.

899
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,580
(laughing)

900
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:55,860
and you are no longer you are you've been d calculus rift

901
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:59,060
well so you you if you

902
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,960
can't cv folks anymore

903
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:05,340
you can't go into the matrix to but you are free of poppy's uh... control now

904
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,600
okay i

905
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,300
as we stand there

906
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,620
recovering from that uh... from flying out of the penis i pointed out

907
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,120
brown puddle on the ground in front of patrick and i say

908
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:19,120
and then what's that thing

909
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,940
did you do that you did that when you came out

910
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,360
that's not a lot of it

911
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:26,200
i don't have a saying that is

912
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,960
policy that was it did you put that there

913
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,260
that's heightening juice i just don't know what

914
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:33,320
you know what comes out of you when you

915
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:37,080
that's what happened i don't know what you live alone in a skateboard do what

916
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,680
i like that's what happens when you get tall

917
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,880
all your comments very interesting i promise now making downplayed boston

918
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,840
accidents getting worse

919
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,960
doctor tolerous meanwhile is ecstatic it worked

920
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,000
it worked

921
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,240
it's success

922
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,740
yes now

923
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,580
who's next

924
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:58,320
who's penis do we get to go into next

925
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:01,320
yours get over here

926
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,980
we're just curious

927
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:05,540
uh... we should at least get to see it

928
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,420
let's see it come on he shows you his penis

929
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:11,600
uh... it's not even hesitate

930
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:15,240
i don't want to see it now that you can hesitate i'm a scientist

931
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,040
You only want to see a penis if somebody's reluctant to show it to you?

932
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:21,040
No.

933
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,040
That's what he just said.

934
00:49:22,040 --> 00:49:23,040
That's what he just said.

935
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:24,040
I don't know what it sounds like, man.

936
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,440
No, he just did it too quick.

937
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,440
Okay, Yoda CK.

938
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:28,440
Alright.

939
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,440
Hey, Dr. Tool, you're actually a pretty cool guy.

940
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,960
Look, I'm just trying to hang with the boys, alright?

941
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:38,800
Alright, now I understand.

942
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:39,800
That's right.

943
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:42,320
Anyway, let's get into another person's penis.

944
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,320
Okay.

945
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Who's next?

946
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:52,320
Okay, fine. If nobody else is gonna do it, my friends can go in my penis and my balls, too.

947
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:54,320
There we go!

948
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
Well, we don't... they do not need to go in your balls.

949
00:49:56,320 --> 00:50:00,320
I think... I think... I mean, I'm looking at my stuff downstairs.

950
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,320
Look, I'll go in there if we have to.

951
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:04,320
I think they have to go through my ass.

952
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,320
Ah, well, now that's too much.

953
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
...on this computer.

954
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,320
That's too much.

955
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,320
Well, looking at my readings of demon anatomy, you're not really wrong.

956
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,320
That is actually the easiest way in.

957
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,320
Let's not do that. Let's go the hard way.

958
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:24,320
No, no, I think you guys do have to go into my ass first to reach my penis.

959
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,320
No, I'm pretty sure.

960
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
That could happen.

961
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,320
I just sit on Patrick.

962
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:35,320
Drink him. Drink him now.

963
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:36,320
Okay.

964
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
He whips around the shrink way.

965
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:46,560
it's both of you you both shrink down to a microscopic size and you shoot into

966
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:52,120
Ray William Johnson's ass it is like a dark cavernous fucking David Litch

967
00:50:52,120 --> 00:51:00,320
that dark oh my god this is awful you just hear like a

968
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:05,840
I've ever experienced is there a family of dead cats living in here what's

969
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:12,840
going on

970
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:28,280
of

971
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:35,280
been in here that's what the graffiti says. It says "Kill Roy was here." What was that?

972
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:42,280
In the 40s? That was the 40s. I don't think so. You must be reading it wrong. It says

973
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:50,120
"El Barto" over here. Did you let a little kid in here? You let Bart Simpson into your

974
00:51:50,120 --> 00:52:05,120
a

975
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:12,120
the

976
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:19,120
the

977
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:26,120
the

978
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,760
ask for poop. There's so much that science just doesn't understand. There's an entire like...

979
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:36,760
They have giant mine carts heaping with poop that they're carting through their city to power their machines.

980
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,720
There's an entire Deadwood series going on in his ass. Like, just like a town.

981
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:50,840
And you travel through it and you end up in his penis now. And the fires of hell

982
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:57,720
rest within this penis. It scorches the earth with its demonic cum. Nasty little imps and

983
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:02,760
devils bathe in pools of lava, screaming in pain as they stab each other in the head for

984
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:09,960
fun. As you approach what appears to be the main chamber, a chugging, drop-a-dee riff

985
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:16,560
begins to rise from below. It's too heavy, its skull crackin', it gets hotter and hotter,

986
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,720
to the point that it becomes unbearable to walk through it.

987
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:24,480
Any traces of computer influence on this demon have completely ceased as we move further

988
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,520
into Ray's penis, just up ahead.

989
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:33,920
Relaxing in a pool of cum lava that looks just like Chameleonair's pool on Cribs is a computer

990
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:38,960
robot type of fella with a small wormy demon attached to its back.

991
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,400
That's right, it's the reverse of Ray William Johnson.

992
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,000
Holy crap.

993
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
Ryan Higa.

994
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:51,000
Wow dude, you just unlocked something in me.

995
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:05,800
Can you say the first half of his YouTube screen name really quick?

996
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:09,720
I wonder what this guy's YouTube username is, but I don't have very much patience, so I

997
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,720
only want you to say the first two syllables.

998
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:15,940
it'll let you know that there was no come on doctor to let's not

999
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:19,980
i can't read again

1000
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:24,180
of this map is even better than the first one

1001
00:54:24,180 --> 00:54:26,620
god damn

1002
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:28,160
really has a lot of women

1003
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:31,520
and around the good and around him

1004
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,600
are the biggest bitches you've ever seen your life

1005
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,300
drinking from massive cans of coke zero

1006
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:41,920
and laughing at all of this guy's awesome jokes

1007
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:46,060
so i says to him and that and that's all i would have done nine eleven you know

1008
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,580

1013
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:02,920
net yet that's exactly what i just said there's nobody here

1014
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,880
well i clearly see you too and so do my child like a senator i would have a way

1015
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,840
to turn around and i wave my hand in front of his face hoping that it somehow

1016
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:13,560
does something

1017
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,820
to make them not see us

1018
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:20,840
what what do you do what are you doing turn around for one second

1019
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,640
okay

1020
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:22,960
he turned around

1021
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:24,040
are issued a right

1022
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:28,240
the

1023
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,240
Okay, let's roll for initiative.

1024
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:32,240
You get a surprise round.

1025
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,240
Me too.

1026
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,240
That ingenious tricking me.

1027
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:38,240
You get a surprise round.

1028
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,240
So whatever your initiative is, is fine.

1029
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,240
You still get this attack round.

1030
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,240
I got a five.

1031
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,240
I got a five.

1032
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,240
Do we roll with advantage?

1033
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:50,240
No.

1034
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,240
So what it is, is that Cameron gets a whole round of combat.

1035
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,240
And I get my assassinate ability.

1036
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:56,240
So I get a critical hit.

1037
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:58,240
- Oh fuck. - In a surprise round, dude.

1038
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,880
- Oh, there we go. - I'm gonna destroy

1039
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,600
this guy right away.

1040
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:05,560
- All right, yeah, so do it, roll your hit.

1041
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,360
- All right, my Grinch gun, that's an 18.

1042
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,400
- Shit, that hits, yeah, roll for critical damage.

1043
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,900
- How do I do critical damage, is that just twice?

1044
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:18,120

1085
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,640
And you guys are going to get into a seduction competition in your mind.

1086
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,640
In my mind.

1087
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:09,920
Okay, let's go, dude.

1088
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
So, so tell me.

1089
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:12,920
So roll a persuasion check.

1090
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:16,920
It's going to be a persuasion contest.

1091
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,920
Okay.

1092
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:21,920
I rolled a 15.

1093
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
Okay, what's your line?

1094
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,920
Hey ladies, do you want to know how to be ninja?

1095
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,920
Ha ha!

1096
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,920
And yeah, they're like, "Oh wow, we would love to know that!"

1097
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
And he's like, "Noooo!

1098
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:41,200
that's my thing

1099
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:48,200
not anymore bitch i'm so mad i'm gonna say the first part of my channel

1100
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:51,780
the director's cut and uh... yeah so

1101
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:55,140
so uh... just like that the fat bitches vanish

1102
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,400
you're still seduced by them

1103
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
you still have to shake that seduction

1104
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,480
but they are no longer going to be able to attack you or do anything

1105
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:06,400
uh... you see ryan higa look around

1106
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,600
and go

1107
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:11,960
more like how to be loser what have you guys done

1108
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,360
uh... and uh... it is now

1109
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:17,440
uh... cameron it's your turn blow toss

1110
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,220
so you have disadvantage but at the end of the turn you could roll to get advantage again

1111
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,020
alright

1112
01:01:23,020 --> 01:01:24,980
do i have disadvantage on using

1113
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:26,640
uh... my monkey as well

1114
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,740
if it's like a spell

1115
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:33,000
so if it's something where uh... he has to uh...

1116
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,160
where he has to like roll like a saving throw he would just get advantage on that roll

1117
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,200
is what I'm gonna do. But all right, I'm just gonna attack and then go for it. I'm gonna

1118
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:47,560
run up to him and I'm gonna hit him with my dual pipes. Go for it. Oh, sorry. I mean,

1119
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:53,600
do that. Oh, God. 21. All right, roll again. Oh, yeah, I forgot. It's Yeah, you're good.

1120
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:59,040

1121
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,040
Yeah, okay, you hit him for sure.

1122
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,040
Alright.

1123
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:03,040

01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:08,400
Yeah, uh, you just fucking whacked it.

1126
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,720
How do you whack the shit out of him?

1127
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,720
I'm interested.

1128
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,160
Um, I hit him one time.

1129
01:02:13,160 --> 01:02:14,160
Uh-huh.

1130
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,640
Hit him two times.

1131
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,000
Oh yeah.

1132
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,080
And then, you might not believe this.

1133
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,320
I'm almost there.

1134
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,240
I'm hitting him four times.

1135
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:26,400
Yeah, uh, you fucking whacked the shit out of him.

1136
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:27,920
I didn't think of something funny fast enough.

1137
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,880
- No, that was, no, I put you on the spot.

1138
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,480
That's not a really a good improv partner.

1139
01:02:31,480 --> 01:02:32,680
I think he did fine.

1140
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,760
And he, you know, what you really did well at though

1141
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,580
was hitting this guy.

1142
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,860
He's looking not too hot.

1143
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:42,520
He's just like, like, you know, like all messed up.

1144
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:44,400
- I can hit him.

1145
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,560
I can hit him again.

1146
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,440
- Oh yeah, you sure can.

1147
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,440
- All right.

1148
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:49,760
I'm gonna try again.

1149
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:54,360
That's a nat 20, but a 16 with the disadvantage.

1150
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:55,800
- Oh, damn.

1151
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:56,880
I was really rooting for you.

1152
01:02:56,880 --> 01:03:00,720
okay uh... that does not hit yes we are a c

1153
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:01,680
uh...

1154
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:08,680
but uh... dam he has a pretty high a_c_-level it's a really cold in here

1155
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,320
all right small he's got a tell

1156
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:14,320
all right patrick it's your turn

1157
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,920
all right what i'm gonna do

1158
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,440
scum i hit it with the needler obviously

1159
01:03:19,440 --> 01:03:20,680
yeah needlers

1160
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:22,240
agree well

1161
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,120
don't know i think st

1162
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:25,160
no duty

1163
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:28,240
disa i might go i would never have a good as well

1164
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:31,960
all maybe during combat i know we're all about to die

1165
01:03:31,960 --> 01:03:38,480
he and they don't i i hope my hope you surprise has a better bludgeon damage

1166
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,800
my attack is better to plus eight

1167
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,720
but join the dark slide really haven't done that yet

1168
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,920
uh... or you could just kill the guy

1169
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:50,840
i'm gonna join the dark slide

1170
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,160
what does that mean is that we're going to where you'd where you pause combat

1171
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,400
for thirty minutes and describe something

1172
01:03:56,400 --> 01:04:01,560
fourteen but i would have gotten a twenty four uh... i'm sorry yet doesn't hit

1173
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:05,320
but so what you do is you you do your move where you sling your skateboard and

1174
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:06,400
it was around

1175
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,440
times he's able to like just deflected

1176
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:11,060
uh... back at you and you

1177
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:14,480
pops up back under your will you defeat

1178
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:18,280
uh... you still have your movement obviously so if you want to do that

1179
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:19,280
okay

1180
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,720
uh...

1181
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:27,720
that

1182
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:44,880
not

1183
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:49,240
go over here that's fine all out of it

1184
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:53,200
uh... there it this is exactly what every fight goes patrick mrs in attack and

1185
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,640
then runs away and we have other person to die

1186
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:57,880
it's not going to let her alice is like

1187
01:04:57,880 --> 01:04:59,920
crunching numbers on his keyboard

1188
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:03,920

1232
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:11,320
I think you got mixed up man. I think it's my turn. Wait, let me just he looks at the initiative order. He's like hey

1233
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,120
don't try that again because I'm

1234
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,080
Obviously, I'm easily deceived

1235
01:07:17,080 --> 01:07:23,680
Can't blame me for trying to turn around and then you shot me. Oh, you're holding. I think you're holding the initiative turn upside down

1236
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:26,700
Okay, well me let me see

Brian Heaton.

1239
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,060
Ryan William Johnson can read, so you can't read.

1240
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,060
You're the opposite.

1241
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:41,580
No, I said everything's upside down here, right?

1242
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:42,580
That's true!

1243
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,700
No, don't use my logic.

1244
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:47,460
Don't use my bragging logic against me.

1245
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,460
That was just, that was for a-

1246
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,460
Okay, well then can I just have one attack before you start your turn?

1247
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:54,460
Okay, fine.

1248
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:55,460
You can't let us do that.

1249
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:56,460
Yeah, he does.

1250
01:07:56,460 --> 01:07:57,460
Yeah, he can.

1251
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:58,460
Okay, I'll take it.

1252
01:07:58,460 --> 01:07:59,460
I'll take it.

1253
01:07:59,460 --> 01:08:00,460
I'll take it.

1254
01:08:00,460 --> 01:08:01,460
I'll take it.

1255
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:02,460
I'll take it.

1256
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:03,460
I'll take it.

1257
01:08:03,460 --> 01:08:04,460
I'll take it.

1258
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:05,460
I'll take it.

1259
01:08:05,460 --> 01:08:06,460
Yeah, go for it, fine.

1260
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:10,060
Oh, I forgot to try to break the thing, but that's fine.

1261
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:11,700
I still have disadvantage.

1262
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:13,180
To be fair, you were insisting.

1263
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,180
Yeah.

1264
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,180
Yeah, it's not gonna hit.

1265
01:08:15,180 --> 01:08:18,220
Okay, that's a, that's a, with disadvantage, that's a crit failure.

1266
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:22,700
Yeah, he just like ducks and wheezes and says, "Okay, fair is fair.

1267
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:24,060
Now it's my turn."

1268
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:25,060
Aw, man.

1269
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:31,980
And he unhinges his jaw and a horrible, like, pool of lava shoots out at your face.

1270
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:33,620
But it doesn't hit.

1271
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:49,280
a

1272
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:51,280
that's gonna be a hit.

1273
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,280
The one that doesn't hit just shoots out of my penis

1274
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:55,280
and it's one more just

1275
01:08:55,280 --> 01:08:57,280

01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,280
and just one more little

1277
01:08:59,280 --> 01:09:01,280
droplet of lava hitting me in the eye.

1278
01:09:01,280 --> 01:09:03,280

The one I thought of was more clever.

1557
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:40,360
Not if you can tell, but this old thing was maybe supposed to be two episodes of Mystery,

1558
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,560
but it's taken us six.

1559
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:43,560
So...

1560
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:44,560
I come with many...

1561
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,560
You might need to go easy on us.

1562
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:50,080
I come with many colors, so beautiful and...

1563
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:51,080
Rainbow!

1564
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,080
Snow cone!

1565
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:56,000
I turn so many houses into a beautiful sight.

1566
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,560
Oh, I got this.

1567
01:23:57,560 --> 01:23:58,560
Do it easy.

1568
01:23:58,560 --> 01:23:59,560
Christmas lights.

1569
01:23:59,560 --> 01:24:00,560

1570
01:24:00,560 --> 01:24:01,560
You got it!

1571
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:06,620
I hate that you got it. Yeah, cuz that one was so hard. How about this?

1572
01:24:06,620 --> 01:24:09,440
How about you get Christmas riddles for G? I'm gonna go

1573
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:16,240
Idea, how many go back I sting Christmas. I'm gonna go back to the adult section if you could you keep it up

1574
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,940
We're gonna get more snow cone type. No, I mean

1575
01:24:19,940 --> 01:24:26,100
I'm so stupid and I have a baby brain a role persuasion check

1576
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,160
14.

1577
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:37,520
He's like, "I'm onto you!"

1578
01:24:37,520 --> 01:24:41,400
I know your brain's not a baby's brain.

1579
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,280
And Christ can fuck off, by the way.

1580
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:45,280
No!

1581
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:46,280
That's right.

1582
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,560
Have you guys heard of Penn Jillette?

1583
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:49,560
No!

1584
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:52,560
Don't even say that, man.

1585
01:24:52,560 --> 01:24:59,880
Meanwhile, Blowtoss Piss, before you, you see this silhouette of your wife doing some

1586
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:10,360
wifely ass shit and she says to you, "Blowtoss, it's me, your wife. I'm dead. Could you sing

1587
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:17,960
that song for me? The one I used to sing?" And before you do it, roll a performance check.

1588
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,480
Okay. Nine.

1589
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,000
Okay, sing the song.

1590
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,280

I'm gonna fucking die because you suck at singing.

1599
01:25:56,880 --> 01:25:57,880
No, that may be.

1600
01:25:57,880 --> 01:25:58,880
I don't know the words to this song.

1601
01:25:58,880 --> 01:25:59,880

you pocket car you go to bring the taco bell but before you even can

1811

"Captain, they're here!"

1819

you'll get your frog back

1872
01:38:45,960 --> 01:38:49,480
i mean that sounds like exactly what we were looking for a right now and i think

1873
01:38:49,480 --> 01:38:51,960
if we get Sullivan back I don't care.

1874
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:55,800
Okay.

1875
01:38:55,800 --> 01:38:56,960
Right this way then.

1876
01:38:56,960 --> 01:39:00,440
You can't give us an option like that because we're just going to take it.

1877
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,840
Wait what's option number two?

1878
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:05,840
It's a noir.

1879
01:39:05,840 --> 01:39:10,880
Option number two is noir?

1880
01:39:10,880 --> 01:39:12,320
No thank you.

1881
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:14,320
This is how noirs end.

1882
01:39:14,320 --> 01:39:16,320
Unless you choose something different.

1883
01:39:16,320 --> 01:39:18,080
Oh my god.

1884
01:39:18,080 --> 01:39:19,480
It's the different one.

1885
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,840
This is the moral, this is the first time we have to-

1886
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,440
No, he's not gonna tell you what it is.

1887
01:39:24,440 --> 01:39:25,440
Okay.

1888
01:39:25,440 --> 01:39:26,880
Well, what's the option?

1889
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,360
I'm gonna look at the other two and I'm gonna say, "Lizzen."

1890
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:30,360
You can follow me.

Oh fuck. It's not in there. Fine, we'll go to Popeye's, whatever.

1931
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:30,720
What did you think was gonna happen, huh?

1932
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:34,640
You'd confront me? You'd force me to reveal my secrets?

1933
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:38,680
I come quietly, no ifs, buts, ands, other contractions?

1934
01:41:38,680 --> 01:41:43,480
It's a noir, you're lucky if you're alive. Yeah, lucky if you're alive.

1935
01:41:43,480 --> 01:41:47,920
I am lucky. After we're done with you. I was mostly thinking we would just probably kill you.

1936
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:50,680
Then do it.

1937
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,680
Whoa.

1938
01:41:51,680 --> 01:41:52,680
You're right.

1939
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:53,680
You're right.

1940
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:54,680
Go.

1941
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:55,680
Okay.

1942
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:56,680
All right.

1943
01:41:56,680 --> 01:41:57,680
All right.

1944
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:58,680
Calm down.

1945
01:41:58,680 --> 01:41:59,680
Calm down.

1946
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,680
No.

1947
01:42:00,680 --> 01:42:01,680
Fuck you.

1948
01:42:01,680 --> 01:42:02,680
I'm killing this guy right now.

1949
01:42:02,680 --> 01:42:03,680
He's the bad guy, and I'm going to kill him.

1950
01:42:03,680 --> 01:42:04,680
It's the end of the game.

1951
01:42:04,680 --> 01:42:05,680
Let's fucking go, Papi Chuko.

1952
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:07,520
How do we know he's the bad guy?

1953
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,520
It's a noir.

1954
01:42:08,520 --> 01:42:10,960
Listen to his voice, dude.

1955
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,080
He sounds Italian.

1956
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:14,800
Let's fucking kill this fucking guinea wop right now.

1957
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:15,800
He's in front of us.

1958
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:16,800
We know what he did.

1959
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:19,520
He's been controlling our brains with our fucking penises.

1960
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:23,840
I had to go in your fucking penis, make you cum, just to get out of there, dude.

1961
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:24,840
Fuck this.

1962
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:25,840
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1963
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:26,840
Okay.

1964
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:28,280
How about this?

1965
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:30,280
Why did you say that?

1966
01:42:30,280 --> 01:42:35,760
Instead of you killing me, you follow me.

1967
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:37,880
I give you the frog back.

1968
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:45,600
Look, as long as we get Sullivan- Let him finish the fucking sentence for once.

1969
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:47,360
And we can call it square.

1970
01:42:47,360 --> 01:42:48,360
That's all.

1971
01:42:48,360 --> 01:42:50,120
turn you into a square big guy.

1972
01:42:50,120 --> 01:42:51,120
I'm gonna fold you up.

1973
01:42:51,120 --> 01:42:52,160
- Yeah, you're gonna become a cube.

1974
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,000
- Shut up!

1975
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,720
You're not even making,

1976
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:57,480
do you wanna fight him or do you wanna leave, Patrick?

1977
01:42:57,480 --> 01:42:59,000
- I'm gonna make him 3D.

1978
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:00,600
(laughing)

1979
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:01,920
- All right, then let's fucking go.

1980
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:03,080
- He just wants to talk.

1981
01:43:03,080 --> 01:43:04,280
He just likes to say things

1982
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:05,880
while other people are saying things.

1983
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:06,720
That's kind of his thing.

1984
01:43:06,720 --> 01:43:07,540
- You know what I do?

1985
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:10,160
I punch Papi Chuco straight in the fucking mouth.

1986
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,640
- Roll an attack roll.

1987
01:43:11,640 --> 01:43:14,520

He's getting away. Hurry hurry

2010
01:44:22,040 --> 01:44:28,160
Get away we have to get whoever did this to Bobby Juco

2011

2015
01:45:04,140 --> 01:45:11,160
fucking cartoon you punch his head clear off of his fucking shoulders and it

2016
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:16,080
rolls it rolls all the way down the hill that the house is on everything slows

2017
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:23,960
down the head flies through the air in slow motion the cops rush you three as

2018
01:45:23,960 --> 01:45:31,160
As you do what is just for the world, but not what is best for you.

2019
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:34,960
And the camera pans over the scene.

2020
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,440
Exterior, Gun City skyline.

2021
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:44,080
A head flies through the air, crashing through a window onto one of the last patches of flora

2022
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:46,240
in this place god forgot.

2023
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:51,360
A lame blotch stains a lamer attempt at diverted prevalence.

2024
01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:56,400
Pulling back, this belabored irony loses its poetry and keeps its humor at cost.

2025
01:45:56,400 --> 01:46:01,360
The meandering, desperate lives of the denizens of Gun City are accompanied by atrophied streaks

2026
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:06,240
of harsh neon that bandy about, an accent to the ersatz expanse of a place as empty as

2027
01:46:06,240 --> 01:46:07,240
it seems.

2028
01:46:07,240 --> 01:46:12,480
The end of the collective soul can just barely be heard above the sound of the eternal modem

2029
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:15,520
and the gears of progress.

2030
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,520
We are an island.

2031
01:46:18,520 --> 01:46:20,040
So it goes.

2032
01:46:20,040 --> 01:46:21,040
Kurt Vonnegut.

2033
01:46:21,040 --> 01:46:25,360
Another tale in Gun City.

2034
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:26,840
Another mystery solved?

2035
01:46:26,840 --> 01:46:29,160
Who's to say?

2036
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:31,920
Can mysteries ever really be solved?

2037
01:46:31,920 --> 01:46:39,400
Of course they can, that's an insane question.

2038
01:46:39,400 --> 01:46:42,880
But our heroes always tried to do what was right, up till the very end.

2039
01:46:42,880 --> 01:46:49,360
And in slow motion, you see like, Ray William Johnson's face like, ahhhhhh, like a head flying

2040
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:54,320
Police officers rushing you three. You're getting fucking handcuffed in the back

2041
01:46:54,320 --> 01:46:57,880
and you see the camera sort of zoom out from there and

2042
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,080
follow us

2043
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,600
into

2044
01:47:01,600 --> 01:47:04,640
poppy Chukos techno slime industrial laboratory

2045
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:07,520
And you see it sort of zoom in

2046
01:47:07,520 --> 01:47:13,320
to somewhere else and pierce through something really just like blackness darkness and

2047
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:16,960
And first it passes by Sullivan. You see him in stocks.

2048
01:47:16,960 --> 01:47:19,600
And he's like, "Help! Help me!"

2049
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:24,800
Um, and as you keep pushing through, you hear more of the narration.

2050
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:29,520
Um, but our heroes always tried to do what was right.

2051
01:47:29,520 --> 01:47:30,160
What was just.

2052
01:47:30,160 --> 01:47:32,720
Except for a few things.

2053
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:36,560
Some of those things were really bad, actually, now that I think about it, but...

2054
01:47:36,560 --> 01:47:39,760
You know, the intentions were there.

2055
01:47:39,760 --> 01:47:43,200
And maybe that's all we have at the end of the day.

2056
01:47:43,200 --> 01:47:50,280
The desire to seek justice and the camera pushes in forward and becomes clearer a figure starts

2057
01:47:50,280 --> 01:47:59,320
to come to light in a cruel strange e-bombs world and the camera pushes in and finally

2058
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:07,360
it's revealed so it goes it's Sean McKelvey frozen in cum carbonite

2059
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:34,640
Epilogue

2060
01:48:34,640 --> 01:48:37,540
The Calculus Rift 2.0 project was stopped.

2061
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:42,080
With no one left heading this secret operation, development was paused for the foreseeable

2062
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,080
future.

2063
01:48:43,080 --> 01:48:47,540
And while there is no more Papi Chuco, there is always a possibility of someone rising

2064
01:48:47,540 --> 01:48:53,060
anew and finding a way to utilize this dangerous technology.

2065
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:57,240
Now the man of the hour, Sean McKellie, was unfrozen from the cum covenant.

2066
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:01,960
He divorced Haseki Tsune and began to tell his story about the truth behind the Calculus

2067
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:07,560
Rift and the Cocculus Rift 2.0. In response to this, Stakehams Federation of Bodies and

2068
01:49:07,560 --> 01:49:12,200
Spaces now offers the opportunity to have their Cocculus Rift removed for $10 million

2069
01:49:12,200 --> 01:49:17,680
and have decided to install the Cocculus Rift in all types of genitalia, not just penises,

2070
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,960
to be more inclusive.

2071
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:24,120
Shortly after that, Sean realized that you're better off working incrementally within the

2072
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:28,840
system rather than outside of it, which is definitely what he was doing, and he started

2073
01:49:28,840 --> 01:49:33,960
a new firm called "I Allegedly Have a Coke Problem" that lobbies tirelessly to finally

2074
01:49:33,960 --> 01:49:36,360
bring back the minimum wage to Gunn City.

2075
01:49:36,360 --> 01:49:42,440
They have not been successful, but have made a lot of money for themselves.

2076
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:47,840
Sullivan the Frog is safe and sound, released along with Sean after the death of Papi Chuko.

2077
01:49:47,840 --> 01:49:52,200
He is now the head detective at the Top 10 Staddledale Agency, where he works tirelessly

2078
01:49:52,200 --> 01:49:55,240
to solve the many crimes in Gunn City.

2079
01:49:55,240 --> 01:49:59,240
He hopes to one day reunite with the three hotshot detectives who believed in him enough

2080
01:49:59,240 --> 01:50:03,120
to let him drive them around and call him names.

2081
01:50:03,120 --> 01:50:07,760
Meanwhile, his cousin Giancarlo the Bullfrog immediately started reselling the Technoslime

2082
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:12,680
vials Ray William Johnson gave him, and filled the void left by a dead Papi Chuco and a shrinking

2083
01:50:12,680 --> 01:50:14,420
Mad Suckler empire.

2084
01:50:14,420 --> 01:50:19,000
He was able to go legit, and took over the business development division at Papi Chuco's

2085
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,080
Technoslime, which is still looking for a CEO.

2086
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:28,220
Dr. Toul Laderalis now heads a covert operation that removes coccylus rifts for free, discovering

2087
01:50:28,220 --> 01:50:32,820
new ways of putting things in and getting things out of penises, his favorite thing to do.

2088
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:36,560
He remains in hiding, but has expanded his network of scientists who are obsessed with

2089
01:50:36,560 --> 01:50:40,000
genitalia, creating the Order of the Penis.

2090
01:50:40,000 --> 01:50:44,120
Like Sullivan, he awaits the return of the three brave detectives who let him experiment

2091
01:50:44,120 --> 01:50:48,200
on their penises.

2092
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:53,640
Toshikitsune found herself in V Alcatraz, stripped of her rights to freely move between the Matrix

2093
01:50:53,640 --> 01:50:55,960
2 and the real world.

2094
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:59,480
While she did put that hit out on Sean, she certainly didn't imagine it'd come back

2095
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:01,580
to bite her quite this way.

2096
01:51:01,580 --> 01:51:05,520
She at least thought her Uncle Poppy would have her back, but lucky for her, her fans

2097
01:51:05,520 --> 01:51:06,520
did have her back.

2098
01:51:06,520 --> 01:51:10,680
They launched a campaign to get her released, and while she lost a considerable amount of

2099
01:51:10,680 --> 01:51:15,960
wealth once Sean divorced her, their tokens helped reduce her sentence to 11 minutes.

2100
01:51:15,960 --> 01:51:20,760
Besides continuing her very important sex work, her new status as a hardened criminal allowed

2101
01:51:20,760 --> 01:51:26,800
her to pivot musically toward a career as a SoundCloud rapper, XXX Contacion, with critics

2102
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:32,360
claiming that her song-for-song cover of Steely Dance Asia, titled "Ejagao", is "the most

2103
01:51:32,360 --> 01:51:37,200
sonically challenging, innovative, and meaningful work by an artist who conspired to murder their

2104
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:42,680
spouse since the guy from As I Lay Dying did that."

2105
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:47,380
Mad Suckler escaped the raid on his compound with his life, barely.

2106
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:53,020
His entire collection of worms was killed by Papi Chuko's corporate military squad, and

2107
01:51:53,020 --> 01:51:57,480
most of his lieutenants were disbanded, some falling under his right-hand cyborgs, Mary

2108
01:51:57,480 --> 01:52:01,920
Kate and Ashley Cabrera, who betrayed the Suckler in the ensuing fight, creating two

2109
01:52:01,920 --> 01:52:06,200
new factions from one, making a mess of his once tight-knit operation.

2110
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:10,960
Meanwhile, the Suckler himself has gone into hiding, still collecting paychecks from loyal

2111
01:52:10,960 --> 01:52:15,840
pushes, but with the portrayal of his cyborgs, a dethroned Jeff Tiedrich, and a chaotic scene

2112
01:52:15,840 --> 01:52:20,200
at Papi Chuko's Techno Slime, the path forward is less clear for the terrifying gangster than

2113
01:52:20,200 --> 01:52:23,960
it's ever been.

2114
01:52:23,960 --> 01:52:28,200
Officer Filipino Mr. Bean was disgraced for letting the Great Papi Chuko die right in

2115
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:29,480
front of him.

2116
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:33,920
He stepped down as police chief, got addicted to Techno Slime, and formed Cream 3 with Jeff

2117
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:38,800
Tiedrich, who had that similar fall from grace, and the sole surviving worm of Papi Chuko's

2118
01:52:38,800 --> 01:52:42,240
collection that Ray William Johnson took in episode 5.

2119
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:47,760
They have a modest following among sexual predators who frequent DIY scenes.

2120
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:52,440
Speaking of worms, Jamal the worm took over Mommy Good Legs, turning it into Jamal's

2121
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,440
wormhole.

2122
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:59,080
It's become a popular nightclub thanks to Jamal's signature drink, the Dr. Pibb Cosby.

2123
01:52:59,080 --> 01:53:02,880
Because of the incident with Ray William Johnson shitting on his head, Jamal has developed a

2124
01:53:02,880 --> 01:53:07,200
new fetish that he doesn't want anyone to know about.

2125
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:12,500
The all-dirt restaurant Cold Dogs and Hot Soda run by Gary C. Enterprise, famous Sullivan

2126
01:53:12,500 --> 01:53:15,560
the Frog impersonator, has become a smash hit.

2127
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:19,800
Or success, you know, a restaurant's not like a hit.

2128
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:24,120
Most of the tokens earned have been donated to Moms Against Drunk Driving.

2129
01:53:24,120 --> 01:53:27,860
Gary himself, however, has dutifully set aside some of the earnings for the three gentlemen

2130
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:29,520
who gave him the restaurant.

2131
01:53:29,520 --> 01:53:33,480
He also patiently awaits their return.

2132
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,480
And what happened to Mommy Good Legs?

2133
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:37,480
Well, Mommy's long gone.

2134
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:41,480
But with her is a Tommy Gun she can call a friend.

2135
01:53:41,480 --> 01:53:46,480
A new identity, and the coordinates to a safe house in a town not too far south.

2136
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,480
She'll be out of Gun City by dawn.

2137
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:51,480
She hopes the boys made it through okay.

2138
01:53:51,480 --> 01:53:54,480
She's sorry for everything she put them through.

2139
01:53:54,480 --> 01:53:57,480
But how else could she finally get away from Poppy?

2140
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,480
Surely there was no other way.

2141
01:53:59,480 --> 01:54:01,480
Or were there other ways?

2142
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:09,480
And uh, the decisions the players made were so completely fucking insane that you just uh...

2143
01:54:09,480 --> 01:54:16,980
You know, any possibility of another way was just sort of out the window by the third session, so...

2144
01:54:16,980 --> 01:54:21,980
You know, you just kind of uh, went with whatever the fuck was gonna, you know, get you to the end.

2145
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:24,980
Or something... weird like that.

2146
01:54:24,980 --> 01:54:30,480
And our three detectives, where are they now?

2147
01:54:30,980 --> 01:54:34,100
Well, they're in their toughest spot yet.

2148
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:39,900
The old slammer, where they helped put so many perps and innocent poor people in before.

2149
01:54:39,900 --> 01:54:44,420
Patrick Yoda has started meditating for 15 hours a day while in prison, and can almost

2150
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:46,220
conjure a cheeseburger.

2151
01:54:46,220 --> 01:54:47,820
He is the prison staff's favorite.

2152
01:54:47,820 --> 01:54:52,300
Bloatoss Piss and his monkey Patrick started working out non-stop, and have even started

2153
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,980
competitive lifting competitions in the yard.

2154
01:54:54,980 --> 01:55:00,860
The monkey Patrick has taken first place in the deadlift competition, three weeks running.

2155
01:55:00,860 --> 01:55:07,860
William Johnson meanwhile has joined the White Caillou's.

2156
01:55:07,860 --> 01:55:15,080
Who knows when they'll get out of there or if they can get out of there, the prison.

2157
01:55:15,080 --> 01:55:19,580
Maybe if enough people want to know what happens next we'll do a direct sequel, prison break

2158
01:55:19,580 --> 01:55:23,020
one off maybe, you know, it could be fun.

2159
01:55:23,020 --> 01:55:25,020
*school bell rings*

2160
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:27,020
Can you hear that? It's the bell.

2161
01:55:27,020 --> 01:55:29,020
It's time for recess.

2162
01:55:29,020 --> 01:55:31,020
And uh...

2163
01:55:31,020 --> 01:55:33,020
If I don't leave soon,

2164
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:35,020
the fifth graders are gonna get the only good kickball.

2165
01:55:35,020 --> 01:55:37,020
Can't have that.

2166
01:55:37,020 --> 01:55:39,020
So, you know...

2167
01:55:39,020 --> 01:55:41,020
'Til next time, folks.

2168
01:55:41,020 --> 01:55:45,020
And remember...

2169
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:49,020
Um, may the force be with you.

2170
01:55:49,020 --> 01:55:51,020
Always.

2171
01:55:51,020 --> 01:56:12,020
