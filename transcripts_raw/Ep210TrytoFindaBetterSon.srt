00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Look look, this isn't a gossip show and I don't want to get into it. But what's the beef?

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:10,880
Tell me one of those guys which one and I won't say who okay, maybe maybe you can just

61
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,780
Tell by looking at them the wimpiest one

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Doesn't like to share things

63
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:23,240
What at a party share like the women that he's cheating on

00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:27,180
And I'll leave it at that so you so you walked in on this guy

And you wanted to share it.

70
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,740
It was a big Try Guys party.

71
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,060
It was a big trying party.

72
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,420
It was a big trying party.

73
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,420
Everyone's trying different things.

74
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,420
Yeah.

75
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,420
Hey, you know what I...

76
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,420
They were smoking funny things.

77
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,940
They were making love outside the lake to their favorite song.

78
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,940
That's what you should try.

79
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,860
Well, I was trying to and I said, "Hey, let me try the Whippets."

80
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,460
We know what they say, "Try, try again."

81
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:03,460
Uh-huh.

82
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,460
Well, he didn't let go.

83
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,460
There is no try.

84
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,460
Because he's a wimp.

85
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,460
Yeah, there's no trying team.

86
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,460
Yeah.

87
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:09,460
And I'm glad he's getting into this.

88
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:13,720
have to say about these these these these guys try guys I think these fellas are

89
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:17,120

90
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,520

92
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,760
right I don't think it's possible to tell from looking at any of those guys

93
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:38,760
whether they're gay or not. Thai guys? Yeah, Thai guys. Like guys from Taiwan?

97
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:03,920

98
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,560
Is he fired? No, he didn't fire my mom. He just thought it would be funny

99
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,340
If you started saying that in Taiwanese, you never tell I've definitely told this before he came up to me one time

126
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,600

(laughing)

129
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
Yeah, you went to college, you ate the entire community

130
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,720
in a single bite and became hugely fat and you went back.

131
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,120
- What university did I go to?

132
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,120
I went to the I went to Golden Corral

133
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:34,120
Go to GCU

134
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
GCU

135
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,120
Gostallions

136
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
GCU

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
I majored in

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,120
Golden Corral Unlimited

139
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,120
That would be so funny if you like

140
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,120
All you can learn

141
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,120
That would be so funny

142
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
If the school had a culinary program that would be so funny

143
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,120
It's so fucked

144
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,120
I hate getting the syllabus at the beginning of the semester

145
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,120
and being like oh my god

146
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:04,120
much fucking money on forks and knives. I just spend this much on forks and knives and my

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,600
calories are graded on a scale. And I hate that you can't just reuse the plate, you have

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,480
to buy a new one for every fucking class. You are graded on a scale also. You got hugely

149
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:20,400
foodly. From Golden Corral University. And then your mom's boss got you. But you look

150
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,120
good right now, you've been in the gym? I've been riding a bike everywhere. What does that

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,400
I don't know, something about cardio.

152
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:35,160
I rode, so yesterday I rode my bike all the way, I was going to this skate park under

153
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:44,640
the bridge and I saw this, on the way there there's all these industrial things and I

154
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:50,200
went down this one thing, this road that's just all concrete mixing and I think it's

155
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,480
It's like the national grid building.

156
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,880
And I went down the street and this dude pulls over

157
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,120
and he goes, "Hey, habla espanol?"

158
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,720
And I was like, "No."

159
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,800
- He shouldn't be able to start with hey.

160
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,640
- Right?

161
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,280
- You can't do English into Spanish.

162
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,600
- Right, so then I'm trying to leave

163
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,000
and then he wolf whistles me over again

164
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,440
and I'm like, "What, what do you want?"

165
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,960
He's like, "Do you like business?"

166
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,480
How'd you say?

167
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,320
No.

168
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,140
What?

169
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,980
I told him no.

170
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,820
Why would you say no?

171
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,640
I told him no.

172
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,560
I told him no and then he takes off his ring

173
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,400
and looks at me and is like,

174
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,240
"Do you wanna buy this gold ring?"

175
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,440
And I was like, "No."

176
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,800
Like, what the fuck?

177
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,640
Just leave me alone.

178
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,600
You were just fucking pissing on your opportunities.

179
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,360
I wasn't gonna buy a gold ring off this guy in like a--

180
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,600
That could have been a spy ring.

181
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,440
That could have been a James Bond laser ring.

182
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,280
You own a business.

183
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,240
You're a fucking 33,

184
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,840

00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,260
- So I'm not gonna tell him that.

that he cut his hair like it like the Roman Emperor did it or whatever I don't

214
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,900
believe that it's completely true he does obsessed with the Augustus Gloop and

Well, he just has a haircut is a source of fascination.

It's cool.

223
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,700
He lets his wife cut his hair.

224
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,800
There's nothing wrong with dude.

225
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,600

If you saw this haircut downtown, you'll be like this haircut is

227
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,700
called the Caesar cut.

228
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:59,300
If you saw this haircut on like a guy in tight biker jeans with

229
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,800
like a bunch of thin line work tattoos like black tattoos, you'd

230
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,500
be like, holy shit.

231
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:10,420
Biker jeans and like the fucking like the square glasses. Yeah, they're like blue frame. I have a pair of those

232
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,660
I bet you do I have a pair of those that I was going to wear to my cousin's wedding and I forgot them at home

233
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,900
They had a cheetah playing with a ball on the side of the only guy who figured out how to look as a CEO was

234
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,620
The the Jack from Twitter guy because he's like I'm just gonna look like Maharishi

235

Just know the only the guy my shit out not even Jack not even Jack

236
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,700
Oh, the best-dressed CEO is the guy who wears the suit with all the money on it

237
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
You know what I'm talking about?

238
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,660
Fuck no.

239
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:37,660
What are you even on about?

240
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,660
That's what a CEO should dress like.

241
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,660
I think he wears a hundred dollar print suit.

242
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,380
I think it's the bang CEO.

243
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,380
Yeah, that guy too.

244
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:46,380
I think that guy has it figured out.

245
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,380
No, but I'm talking about big billionaire types.

246
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,380
Okay, right, so you weren't talking, you didn't CEO.

247
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
So you lied and you just made something up.

248
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
I said tech CEOs actually.

249
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
You did not.

250
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
So you guys are both stupid.

251
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:01,080
I said tech CEOs earlier and you keep hitting that.

252
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:06,180
I think you gotta you gotta go you gotta just look crazy the coolest guy ever was

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320

270
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,320
We had-

271
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320

272
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Mr. Slavery?

273
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:55,280
The guy who used to own slaves and now he's basically giving away bed frames as reparations?

274
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:59,720
No, there was this guy, he was called Ants in My Eyes Johnson.

275
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720

277
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
And he was...

278
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,720
Wait, what?

279
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Did he have a TV commercial?

280
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:09,320
I mean, dude, you won't even believe this.

281
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,880
This fucking guy, he's in Wilmington, North Carolina, he was in my hometown, you guys

282
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,880

283
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,440
It was a guy who walks around, he's got ants that are in his eyes and he sells doors.

284
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,960
And you saw this on TV in Wilmington?

285
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:22,520
It was on TV in Wilmington and he basically walked around and I think he...

286
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,520
What time of night was this on?

287
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,040
And then he caught on fire.

288
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,740

289
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,800
crazy commercial in my hometown to that was kind of a local commercial. Yeah,

290
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,200

291
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,640

292
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,000

293
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,120
came up with that, I will shoot that. I mean that honestly the making of that

294
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,360
commercial would be an interesting thing to see on TV. You guys ever see that

295
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,240
- Show too many cooks.

296
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,240
- Yeah.

297
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,080

298
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,920
- Oh yeah, I remember that.

299
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,760
- It's just the intro.

300
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,580
- Weirdest bullshit.

301
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,420
- There's this restaurant.

302
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,260
- I don't even remember an episode.

303
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,640
- There's this restaurant in my hometown

304
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,960
that had this like fucking crazy deal.

305
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,400
It was called Taco Town.

306
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,220
- Oh really?

307
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,060
- Yeah.

308
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,900
- What was the deal?

309
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,720
- Big ass taco.

310
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,560
- Okay, that makes sense.

311
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,920
- I can't even tell you how many ingredients it had.

312
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,440
- Well I mean, it's just a taco though.

313
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,280
It's not that special.

314
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:14,120
- Oh, trust me.

315
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,940
- What happened then?

316
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,360
- It's not just a taco.

317
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,200
- Well what was it then?

318
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,040
If it wasn't just a taco?

319
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:26,180
they had a pancake on the taco they put it in a bag so it's almost like so it's

320
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:29,900
almost like it was a taco wrapped in a gordita wrapped in a quesadilla with a

321
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,880
crepe a French crepe and a blueberry pancake that's and they wrapped it in a

322
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:40,580
corn husk and then they put it in a bag and they pour chili on it was it that I

323
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,580
I think I saw that commercial.

324
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,580
I don't remember the fucking order.

325
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,580
Because it's smallest to largest, dude.

326
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,580
The bags obviously, they don't put a bag and then wrap it in a fucking tortilla.

327
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:55,580
Oh, and then, well, they deep fry it. I forgot. They deep fry it at the pancake.

328
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,580
Oh, and then they beer batter it and deep fry it.

329
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
And then...

330
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,580
And then they put the pizza around it.

331
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,580
And then they put the pepperoni pizza, then they put it in the bag, chili on top.

332
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Uh-huh. Vegetarian chili.

333
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,580
Vegetarian chili, yeah. It's a great commercial.

334
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,700
And then do you guys ever see the Cosby show?

335
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:14,540
That guy's in jail

336
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:22,360
Surprising too many people yeah the Cosby face we used to him back in my hometown we used to have a planet called Cybertron

337
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:26,940
Yeah, really. Mm-hmm. What was it? Like it was a war most of it

338
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:32,540
It was like basically eternal war between two factions. I used to have this thing this fucking we use everybody in North Carolina

339
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,020
Did it was something to do with like some kind of local law?

340
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,860
where like at night or just when you weren't around basically your toys would

341
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:42,120
fucking come to fucking life. Seriously? Yeah and they would fucking have like

342
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,320
some kind of interpersonal conflict and a lot of times they would get knocked off

343
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:49,720
the bed. I think I had that too but we had we had we had that too. Do you

344
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:56,160
remember? We had the second one of that. Yeah. Do you remember I don't because I

345
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,640
think it was around Boston it wasn't in Londonderry where I grew up there's that

346
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,560
old man who put all those balloons in his house?

347
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Oh my god I forgot about that.

348
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Yeah and then he flew away with the kid.

349
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,560
They were on his house.

350
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,760
He kidnapped this kid and he took him away to a mystery place.

351
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,760
He kidnapped a little Korean boy.

352
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,760
They never figured out why he did it or where he went but they thought that maybe it was because his wife was weird or something.

353
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Like his wife drove him to...

354
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,760
His wife was a pedophile.

355
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:30,760
Apparently his wife hypnotized him to kidnap this little Asian kid.

356
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:35,960
died and apparently he invented a robot talking dog or a dog with a robot

357
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,480
device and I don't even I mean but yeah the rumors got kind of crazy you guys

358
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,920
really know what really happened that reminds me do you remember a couple years

359
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:47,360
ago like couple of years ago like a while back when basically the whole

360
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,960
fucking world was pretty much just fucking trash yeah do you remember that

361
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:58,320
and we were all oh yeah way out there and I was fat fat and a fat chair fucking no

362
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,940

363
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,620
these movies and we watch basically drink so much smoothies about screen time we

364
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:19,420
were so addicted to screen time huh nothing you you haven't seen what you've

365
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:23,100
never seen Wally well good for you they're releasing it they're releasing

366
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,380
it in the criterion collection on 4k so you can spend $60 to watch it cutting

367
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:31,760
that out yeah cut that Julio cut that out I am NOT cutting it out Patrick yeah so

368
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,320
then we would and then remember we got fucking yes do you remember there was

369
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:40,220
that that when when Patrick was was with us in that area and he and and he had to

370
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,660
because of the recycling system on our spaceship yeah poop constantly you

371
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,500
remember that most of that that was very for me is about a guy named Patrick who

372
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,520
looked a lot like you and it might have actually been you literally fucking

373
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,580
eating robot she was like genetically engineered to turn poop back into food

374
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,260
with the other way you open up his stomach and he was in pieces of shit

375
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,780
yeah toilets turds and you turn them into not even not even for this happened

376
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:09,540
yeah i'm a poop guy and i was talking to the scientists who developed the system

377
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,340
that this patrick is using any i guess he was genetically engineered to to eat and

378
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:18,340
process shit new is psychologically engineered to like it more than fucking

379
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,940
it

380
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:23,940

382
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,140
You know, like a while back, but not that long, like kind of Obama era. I was going

384
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:42,980
happened? Yeah. A lot of shit happened with you. What happened? There's that shit where

385
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:49,020
it's like we, like, we got tickets to that ship and there's that guy saying he was like

386
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,700

straight up brown like some Peaky Blinders like you're only wearing the

392
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,380

Yeah. It's like, shut the fuck up. Stuff's going on right now. Stop playing.

394
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,740
Yeah. And then something happened at the end. I don't really remember,

395
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,500
but I do remember I was some old and then there was that.

396
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,460

00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,060
really tall blue people and the robot suits and stuff.

398
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,540

466
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:59,000
Oh my god dude, the fucking Pevensies. We started hanging out with Roly Poly after we were hanging

467
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,400
out with the Pevensies. Every time we hung out with the Pevensies they were like, "Get

468
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:08,080
in the wardrobe!" I know, it's like, "Let's play hide and seek." Okay, you hide in the

469
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,680
wardrobe. I was like, "I don't want to hide in the fucking wardrobe. It smells like shit

470
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,920
in there and there's a goat man. They're gone for five minutes, right? They hide in

471
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,240
the wardrobe. I'm not getting fucked. I'm claustrophobic. I'm not getting in there.

472
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,640
They're gone for five minutes. They come back and they're like, "We've been gone for 30 years!"

473
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:27,800
All of a sudden there's water flooding into my fucking room from one of their fucking stupid gay paintings.

474
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,240
Speaking of the Pevensies though, you know who actually was sick as hell to hang out with back in the day?

475
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,240
I don't know if you guys remember him. Dudley Dursley? He was fucking sick. Dude, he was...

476
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,240
That guy was wild. He was crazy. He was so mean to his little brother.

477
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,240
Remember when he used to smack his little brother?

478
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,240
Yeah. Was it his brother or his cousin?

479
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,240
We'd go in there and we'd make spaghetti or something.

480
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,240
We'd strain out the noodles and put the hot water on his feet.

481
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Oh my god, dude.

482
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,240
He'd get all mad. He'd get so mad the fucking electricity starts flickering and shit.

483
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
And you're like, "Whoa, you fucking goth freak."

484
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Yeah, you little goth bastard.

485
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,860
That little, he had that, 'cause they put him

486
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,920
in that little ass room 'cause he was like,

487
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,920
like I mean, look, I'm not condoning what his parents did.

488
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,240
- He's a fun-- - 'Cause they would tell it,

489
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,640
well his mom would say like,

490
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,280
he's a bit mental in the head.

491
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,560
- Yeah, yeah. - He's special.

492
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,520
- He was a bit touched.

493
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,480
- He was a bit special. - Yeah, yeah.

494
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,360
She said that he was special needs

495
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:29,920
and they would keep him in the stairs.

496
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:33,360
And then he went off to that special needs school, Hogwarts.

497
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,560
- Oh my God.

498
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,880
Literally a school for ugly little children.

499
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,560
I mean, think about the name.

500
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,400
- Yeah, true.

501
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,960
- I mean, I wish I could have been at that school

502
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,760
and just smacked him with a--

503
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,680
- Yeah, but then he, I mean,

504
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,120
he was pretty much normal though.

505
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,800
I don't know why they kept calling him,

506
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,120
I guess he had some needs that,

507
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,360
I guess normal school couldn't meet.

508
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:52,740
- Yeah, maybe like dietary.

509
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,320
Maybe he was like celiac or something.

510
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
- Oh yeah, 'cause in the UK, if you have celiac--

511
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,480
- No dude, I'm telling you,

512
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,640
there was something wrong with his brain.

513
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,520
I don't know if you guys noticed.

514
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,000
got this crazy scar on his forehead I think he got hit in the head by me. Oh that makes

515
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,360
sense he had TBI. Yeah. Yeah he had a TBI. Yeah. Well I mean celiac. That's why he was

516
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,560
always like just speaking in that made up language and he would always point at us and

517
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:17,920
go like "Avada Kedavra" and stuff. Celiac in the UK is a special need because then you

518
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,680
can't have a full English. True you can't have a toast. It's all beans no toast. Uh huh.

519
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:26,000
Right? Wait where do I put these beans on? Exactly. These beans on tongue. What are you

520
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,280
gonna put on that charge piece of tomato that they have for everyone we were

521
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:32,600

522
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,720
and you remember that

523
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,480
yeah yeah a lot of people don't like our party and we've got such fucking dope

524
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,180
ass life you know

525
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:43,480
probably one of the great the all-time you read a fucking new bible about us

I hope they serve beer in hell colon the life of Brian.

531
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,400
He said that's Tucker Max.

532
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
I hope they serve beer in hell.

533
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,400
I don't know man.

534
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
He was, because Tucker Max was like a...

535
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,400
I'm into real fucking books.

536
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,400
He was like a blogger and then like he wrote that book because his blog was doing well.

537
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,400
The stuff like Be Here Now, Ram Dass.

538
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,400
Who's Ram Dass?

539
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Baba Ram Dass.

540
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,400
Baba Ram Dass? You don't know Baba Ram Dass?

541
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,400
Are you doing like a reggaeton song?

542
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,040
- No, but you kinda, it kinda, Babaramdas.

543
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:23,880
- Babaramdas!

544
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,200
- No, he's a white guy who invented LSD

545
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,940
and became a hippie.

546
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,780
- Yeah.

547
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,240
- And he went, and he died recently.

548
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:35,360
And he wrote all these--

549
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,840
- I'm gonna tell you straight up right now,

550
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,240
I fucking hate hippies.

551
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,160
- Me too, man.

552
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,360
- I hate hippies, but--

553
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:43,120
- Listen, you might hate hippies,

554
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,520
but I think if you read the book Siddhartha

555
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,560
by Herman Hesse, I think a lot of stuff

556
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,960
might change in your life.

557
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,200
- Yeah.

558
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,980

00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,280
by doing that

560
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,440

569
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,960
They should have hippies but that. There should be a word for that.

570
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,400

571
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,900

585
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,160
I hit my head this morning. Oh, that makes a lot more sense. I want to be in the mod scene

586
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:12,520
Oh, yeah, I'm on a bitch. Bye. Yeah. Oh fuck my fucking girlfriends for yeah

587
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:15,440
My go weed hair. Yeah

588
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:24,280
Big hair and big eye liner. I'm a fucking extreme fucking blow up. She's got big eye liner.

589
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,240
The mod scene is fucking dope dude. Twiggy!

590
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:36,120
You ever seen the movie Quadrophenia? No. It's a movie, it's a movie made by the who about...

591
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:43,720
Come on. No, no. What the hell? No. It's a movie made by the who about how they used to be very big

592
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,320
in the mod scene and how they were the biggest band in the world. Get rid of the

593
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:52,800
mod scene, bring back the God scene. There's a whole scene in

594
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:59,080
Quadrophenia where it's like, they're like, "Oh I hate rockers! I'm a mod! I

595
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,840
hate rockers!" They hated rockers because rockers used to beat up the mods. Yeah.

596
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:07,600
Right? There's a mods versus rocker rumble and then he sees

597
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,640
that Sting is in the movie and he sees that Sting gets a job as a bellboy.

598
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,120
Yeah, and he crashes stings a Vespa off of a cliff. No the mods were rumbling the mods were rumbling

599
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,920
Of course the mods are rumbling they're all they all weared weared chessboard clothing

600
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:34,980
Come on that's why they're fucking rumbling like a fucking Gamecube controller with like that chess guy

601
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,560
Chess about this chess guy. Oh, yeah, what's the deal with that? I don't know

602
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,040
I don't know grandmaster you or anal beads or something. Yeah

603
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,880
How did that get

604
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,440
Speculated at all that's for a while people have been like well

605
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,960
that's kind of the only way that you could probably cheat at chess at one of these big tournaments because they they do a metal

606
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,600
detector on you and

607
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,600
but if you had some kind of

608
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,160
anal bead kind of plastic thing

609
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:08,760
They're not listen, what are the you guys are they shaped like is it like no it just it would rumble

610
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,040
It would it would basically rumble when he has the right move

611
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,240
Though I mean that's somebody watching

612
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,160
the only way

613
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:22,240
I thought they were gonna say that the the chest pieces the anal beads are shaped like each of the pieces and

614
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:26,360
Then the pieces that were gonna say that the order he had a full-on

615
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:29,280
Operation style they were the pieces are in it

616
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,560
So it's like the first beat is like a pawn.

617
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,440
The second beat is like the knight.

618
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,560
The third beat is like the queen or something.

619
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:40,080
- Wow, that is truly unreal that your brain went to that.

620
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,520
That's what you thought that was what it was gonna be.

621
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,880
- I didn't actually think that was,

622
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,280
I was trying to make a joke.

623
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,640
- No, you believed that.

624
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,480
- I did not believe that.

625
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,680
- You believed that.

626
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,520
- We did.

627
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,980
- Did we ever talk about the chess cheating guy

628
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,840
who attacked the kid in the bathroom?

629
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:53,680
- Yeah.

630
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,520
- We did, okay.

631
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,340
- Yeah.

632
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,180
- What, he slashed his face?

633
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,020
- No.

634
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,840
- What am I thinking of?

635
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:02,240
the mad slasher. You're thinking of Jack the Ripper. Oh yeah he ripped him. Yeah.

636
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,840
Yeah. No that's a different guy. Yeah. Do you remember hanging out with that guy back in the day?

637
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,360
Listen he was a nice guy. He threw some rippers though. That's what I'll say.

638
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:19,000
Jack the Rager. That's what we called him because he did have serious rage problems.

673
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,480
- Unknown, it says. - Biranda.

674
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,920
- Oh, oh, unknown is the author.

675
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:44,040
- Yeah, we're in the category, Biranda.

676
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,880

677
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,700

678
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,780
- 10 most handsome son in the world.

679
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:50,440
The term handsome or good looking is usually used

680
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,620
only to men who have been moving up.

681
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,280
But what if it turns out that only some of his little boy

682
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,560
also has shown their good looks?

683
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,080
Same is the case for the prettiest girls then, of course.

684
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,440
There is also a list of most handsome boy in the world.

685
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,080
Here are 10 boys most handsome in the world.

686
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:07,760
- All right, so my problem with this is,

687
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,760
This guy hasn't seen every fucking boy.

688
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
You don't know.

689
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
Yeah, I guess you're right.

690
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,760
I guess the qualifier here...

691
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:13,760
I guess it's written by unknown.

692
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,760
If there's any guy who's seen every boy in the world, I would think it would be unknown.

693
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Yeah, he's probably anonymous.

694
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,760
Yeah.

695
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,760
Yeah.

696
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Maybe this is written by our creator.

697
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,760
Whoa.

698
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:23,760

we're going to be throwing in a lot of pulling the trigger. Yeah, we're also a little...

00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:23,060
we don't want him to be anorexic. We're going to get him a trick mirror. We're going to

741
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:48,620
Yeah. They also call steroids HRT. It's the same thing. I thought it was HGH and

742
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,720
- And then HRT is--

743
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,540
- No, HGH is human growth hormone,

744
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:56,540
but HRT is steroids, TRT, testosterone replacement therapy.

745
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:57,660
- Okay.

746
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,860

Because we're going to tell him, we're going to get him

Put one hand in the microwave.

801

Yeah, just see what happens.

00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,240
He's going to be dry scooping C4.

806
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:44,940
And you know those shoes that, the basketball shoes that have

807
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,700
big platform on the bottom. He's gonna be 10 jumps every morning.

808
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,700
Weighted vest too.

809
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,700
Weighted vest while he's jumping.

810
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Centrifuge like space camp.

811
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Try to stretch him out.

812
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
Yeah.

813
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:56,700
Cause he needs to be 6 feet at least.

814
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,500
He needs to be able to sustain at least 20 G's.

815
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:03,740
And now, Mason listen buddy, I know you're 10 now, you know, 2, 3 years from now, you

816
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740

00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,740
Yeah, you're gonna thank us.

818
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,740
You could break top 3.

819
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,740
Yeah.

820
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:08,740
So, you're welcome.

821
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:09,740
Alright, so that's our plan for Mason.

822
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:12,580
I mean, top 3 is generous. He's gonna be like 5.

823
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:16,580
I mean here we here we got him. I mean he's number 10. He's the bottom of the

824
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:20,420
top 10. So anything is better. We'll see I mean I mean and that's our plan for

825
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:23,580
Mason. But I guess we can see what we're gonna do with these some of these other

826
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:30,380
beautiful handsome sons. Number nine is Kim Jin-woo. Born on 20 March 2006 in

827
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:35,080
South Korea, Kim Jin-woo is one of the boys figures who have often

828
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:39,620
appear in TV drama Korea. Some examples of these plays is Aquarius, The Iron

829
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,980
Empress, three sisters, and the latest is the Empress of Ki. His career in the world of

830
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,140
the play has started in 2008 to 2014, so since childhood he has often met famous celebrity

831
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,140
figure of Korea.

832
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:54,780
I think nothing's gonna help this kid, he's gonna stay at number 9 forever.

833
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,940
Yeah, I mean it's honestly just the market he's in is too small.

834
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:02,380
I think, you know, I think that we could see a change in trends of what we consider handsome

835
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:09,020
and what, you know, how people rate these sons and I think that maybe if we put this

836
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:13,580
son here, Kim Jin-woo, if we put him in, you know, carbonite or some kind of cryo sleep

837
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:18,960
for maybe 20 to 40 years so he can maintain his current age for a long time, I think we

838
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,060
could see a better chance for him to climb the rankings in maybe, you know, 2040, 2060,

839
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,060
something like that.

840
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Yeah, that's true.

841
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,780
But, you know, for now, if he's against being frozen in gel, I think he's out.

842
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
Okay.

843
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:32,780
Alright, let's move on.

844
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:37,180
He also only has maybe two more years of being a boy because he was born in 2006.

845
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:42,620
So he is 16 years old. Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, you know, sorry Kim Jinwoo, but you're

846
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,900
Charlie Axel Woods

847
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:52,200
This is Tiger Woods's boy. Let's hear. Why don't you read out our never heard the name Tiger Woods? I never have yes

848
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,980
Charlie Axel Woods is the name of the boy from the figure of famous golf athletes born February 8th

849
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:05,660
2009 Charlie Axel Woods used to be a figure that highlighted the world's attention a

850
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:13,140
handsome body itself obtained from his father, Tiger Woods, and also his mother

851
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:20,520
who was her model, Ellen Nord... Nordegaren of Sweden, former wife of

852
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,380
Tiger Woods. He, uh, this guy, this kid actually is a really good golfer. Yeah?

853
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:31,920
Yeah, no, he did a, he did a father-son tournament. Really? No, I think so. This, he

854
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,780
could, he could, you know, he could, this guy could, this kid could be a contender

855
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:40,300
in the talent category maybe. Yeah I think he stays at number eight just because of

856
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:46,740
his talent. Sure. And also his dad is like, Tiger Woods is a pretty good looking guy.

857
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:51,140
I wouldn't say that he's the most anywhere near the most handsome men, the

858
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:55,020
top ten most handsome men. Yeah. He's good-looking but he's not top ten material

859
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:58,100
so I don't want to see really see how his son can break that. I guess I would like to

860
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:01,980
see Charlie Axel Woods attend some kind of boot camp or some kind of rigorous

861
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,980
training regimen where he's you know forced to play golf maybe 10 to 12 to 14

862
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,420
to 16 hours a day. He needs to be more well-rounded and honestly needs to pick up maybe three or four

863
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:17,660
other sports. That's true. Have you seen Tiger Woods? Tiger Woods has a I think

864
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,620
every year there's one thing I remember seeing it's Tiger Woods shirtless in a

865
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:28,940
Santa hat and beard and it says like "Sexy Santa again this year." What? I think

866
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:34,660
that I'm gonna make a kid do that no no I'm saying that maybe he has some comedy

867
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:39,060
prowess in him because if his dad is that interesting and then all of a sudden he

868
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:46,940
could be the next some he could be one of the next big I think yeah some UCB 101

869
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:56,020
we have to keep this kid out of UCB yeah any other any other comedy collector

870
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:00,980
or just keep them away from you see a good good point. Yeah, maybe the

871
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:03,740
round. I think the ground links will be perfect for him. You know, just

872
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:10,460
knowing what he's good at and you know well yeah groundlings. Hey, you know

873
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:15,260
he's hit a few groundlings with the golf ball exactly. I just think he'd excel

874
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,620
on and and maybe some groundling is like an animal on the ground. I think he'd

875
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,420
he'd excel in

876
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:25,460
like a like a mole. He's probably a few moles or alag a stout

877
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:30,860
Stoats I think he's put I you know what I want to see him do a father-son golf

878
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:35,460
tournament maybe like a Stoat contos him and his dad yeah who can hit a Stoat

879
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,300
exactly it's that's like going hunting with your dad this could be and that

880
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,020
could be a perfect comedy sketch kind of a character based humor but it'd be real

881
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,380
it'd be like that flash game where you shoot cats out of the cannon yep yeah

882
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:51,220
exactly and it would also be like Borat like just because it would be like a

883
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,220
comedy thing that's kinda real. And Borat could be there.

884
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:57,220
The father's child thing. Is this boring you?

885
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,220
Little bit, yeah I'm pretty bored of Charlie Axelwood.

886
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:02,220
Alright, let's move on then. Here Caleb, you can take this next one.

887
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,220
Sean Preston Federline Spears.

888
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:10,220
Federline Spears, a son of Britney Spears, married to Kevin Federline.

889
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:14,220
Born on September 14, 2005, and his brother Sean,

890
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:18,220
Jaden had been a model of her music video clip entitled "Ooh La La."

891
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,980
So here's one thing, this kid's fucking drinking an icy.

892
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,980
Who's Jaden?

893
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:22,980
Wait, who's Jaden?

894
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:23,980
I don't know.

895
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,980
Probably his brother.

896
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,980
I don't know either.

897
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,980
I will say he's got a good fit here.

898
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,380
He kind of looks like Jon Hamm.

899
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:32,740
So I think that if we take the icy out, replace that with maybe...

900
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:33,740
With some ice.

901
00:46:33,740 --> 00:46:34,740
With something from...

902
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,380
In old fashioned, because it's Jon Hamm.

903
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,340
Maybe an Erewhon water bottle.

904
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,340
Right?

905
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,340
Voss.

906
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,340
Yeah, Voss.

907
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,980
I think there's two routes we could go here.

908
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,980
What are you saying?

909
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,740
I'm saying maybe we'd replace the...

910
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:50,300
like, because you're saying he's got a Jon Hamm thing going. Yeah. Maybe we replace it

911
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:56,140
with like a Long Island iced tea or like a bourbon straight, double bourbon straight.

912
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:02,220
No, no, but Jon Hamm is known for like having kind of plain clothes that speak for themselves

913
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:06,140
a little bit. He's not too flashy, right, but he's a health nut, right? He takes good

914
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:10,380
care of his body. He's pushing 50, okay, and he looks like that. So we need to have him

915
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:14,380
on. He's got some kind of green juice in his hand, right? He's walking, he's got the blazer

916
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:20,380
Ron very very very tasteful I would say kind of casual walkabout avoiding the

917
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,780
paparazzi kind of look and plus he's got the dad shoes on right which are

918
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:28,780
actually for the celebrity that's like a kind of a power play. Oh those are the Rosh runs.

919
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,100
Yeah he's got the Roshi runs on which are like yeah it's a bit like yeah fuck you

920
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,820
fuck you I still live my life even though I'm a

921
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:41,300
celeb. Can I throw out a little pitch for you guys here?

922
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:47,380
So, I mean, just looking at this kid's outfit here, and also looking at his name, Sean Preston

923
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:53,180
Federline Spears, I'm just going to throw out, just give this some consideration, okay?

924
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,180
J.R.R.

925
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:56,180
Tolkien, W.E.B.

926
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:58,180
Du Bois, S.P.F.

927
00:47:58,180 --> 00:47:59,180
Spears.

928
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,180
S.P.F.

929
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:01,180
Spears is great.

930
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:02,180
Famous author.

931
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,180
Famous author.

932
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:06,340
And then it really, like, she becomes a famous author in the future.

933
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,780
It really changed, or now, who knows?

934
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:09,780
And it really changes.

935
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,780
The child author.

936
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,440
It never has been one since Eric.

937
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,840
What's the name of the guy who wrote Jurassic Park?

938
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Michael Crichton.

939
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:19,120
Yeah, so like Michael Crichton kind of thing where you're like, "Okay, well he's just an

940
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,440
author, he's probably ugly," and then you see a picture of him and he's a fucking ten.

941
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,440
Yeah, a ten-year-old kid.

942
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,360
Yeah, well he's a ten-year-old and a most handsome boy.

943
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,800
So that's what we kind of want with this.

944
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,640
I mean, and the outfit, I mean this is minus the icy.

945
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:35,340
I think if we kind of, we can do some Photoshop magic, change this icy into maybe a pipe.

946
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,720
And I think this would be a perfect About the Author picture.

947
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,920
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

948
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,920
we have a perfect about the author blurb right here. A son of Britney Spears

949
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:46,840
marriage to Kevin Federline and this is on the back of a yeah it's on the inside

950
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:50,960
of the dust cover. It has like you know the front has like a dragon that's like

951
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,680
attacking some kind of giant computer yeah and this it has all this info right

952
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:59,760
there. I think that could be huge. SPF Spears. SPF Spears. Yeah.

953
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:07,800
And the first this is on the back. This is on the computer. Yeah you can write that now. I was gonna

954
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:15,980
to suggest a title. I thought maybe he's like a James Patterson style author and he's got

955
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:23,140
a book called The Lemon Tree. You read The Lemon Tree and it sounds kind of just normal.

956
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,880
I don't know what this could be. It's like a haunted lemon tree.

957
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,880
Whoa.

958
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,880
All fucking shit.

959
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,580
With lemons that scream at you.

960
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,260
No. Screaming lemons?

961
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,260
Yeah.

962
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:35,660
So you go to pick the lemon.

963
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:37,860
Hmm, this lemon tree is in my brain.

964
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,140
Yeah, well, I screamed a little too early.

965
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:41,140
But you'd go, yeah, okay,

966
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,300
I just bought this giant mansion, right?

967
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:46,700
It belonged to, let's say, Alexander Graham Bell, right?

968
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,860
And then you're walking around,

969
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,700
you've seen a couple of these things.

970
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,940
Well, Alexander Graham, let's change it so there's like,

971
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,780
I mean, so if you know--

972
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,620
Okay, George Washington Carver.

973
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,700
If you know, like it's an if you know, you know,

974
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,500
so maybe like Alastair McCrowley.

975
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,700
Alastair McCrowley.

976
00:49:58,700 --> 00:49:59,540
Yeah.

977
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:00,360
So we have Alastair,

978
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,580
we're at Alastair McCrowley's giant mansion, right?

979
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,040
and we're like, "Oh, that lemon tree outside,

980
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:08,040
"and it's a nice contrast with all the gray and brown."

981
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,920

to former members of EXO, Korean boy band,

1002
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:53,680

00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,820
which causes it to be very famous.

1011
00:51:17,060 --> 00:51:19,900
list of Russian guys hanging out at the bar.

00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:25,900
Found that out. Come on, Pete. The first child of the famous American actor and

1013
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:30,180
producer Leo Schreiber. Remember Sabertooth from the movie Wolverine? Yes,

00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:38,620
sasha p

1017
00:51:38,620 --> 00:51:40,140
was the son of the figure

1018
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:44,040
his blonde hair white skin blue eyes made him often touted to be the figure of a

1019
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,540
man who was very handsome one adult

1020
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:51,820
saber to this the only uh... but maybe we will see the body on the t_v_ screen

1021
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,700
as it is still not known

1022
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:57,380
whether alexander will follow in the footsteps of her parents as actors or

1023
00:51:57,380 --> 00:52:01,380
choose another option. Interesting that they make note of his white skin.

1024
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,380
Yeah. He's so handsome, his white skin.

1025
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:09,380
They pick Wolverine, hey buddy,

1026
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,380
that's Ray Donovan you're talking about. Yeah, that's right. Come on.

1027
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:17,380
Put some respect on Ray Donovan. Yeah. This could be fucking

1028
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:21,380

1029
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,380
mentioned Wolverine though because I think that Alexander

1030
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:28,260
Sasha Pete might thrive as a kid with superpowers.

1031
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:29,100

00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:29,940

1158
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:47,040
stone also. Wow. What does that mean? He's kind of destined for, I mean, you know, I

1159
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:51,120
don't know if any of you have ever read interviews with Matthew McConaughey.

1160
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:56,680
He's very scared of his receding hairline. Yeah, and he lies about what he

1161
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,520
did. He lies about fixing it. Yeah, he says he only used minoxidil. No, he

1162
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:04,000
didn't. He doesn't even claim he used minoxidil. He claims that he used some like crazy

1163
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:09,060
lotion that like maybe they paid him to say it in the 90s or something and he

1164
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:12,940
doesn't but it's not even like a hair loss thing it's like it's like some

1165
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:16,660
normal skin lotion I think you want to put that on my head and I mean ten years

1166
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,820
later look at my hair's better than it ever was

1167
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:24,060
check this now this guy had a fucking full FUE transplant uh-huh right and

1168
01:00:24,060 --> 01:00:28,620
then he goes up sorry I'm getting off topic okay the point is this kid could

1169
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:32,500
be basically partnered with the fucking white kid and he could go he's white

1170
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:39,140
he's white he's white sounds good all right yeah this kid could also just not

1171
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:42,660
be famous and be a source for a Matthew to harvest hair when it needs it yeah

1172
01:00:42,660 --> 01:00:46,020
that's fine too yeah I think that that's what's gonna end up happening yeah just

1173
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:50,060
basically a hair slit like I like a cow for hair yeah whatever in a human farm

1174
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:54,380
yeah just take it's more like a sheep more like a cow it's like cow for yeah

1175

we'll say I will shave you will shave the sheep's no we're just gonna say you'll

1176
01:00:57,740 --> 01:00:59,740
a child's cow.

1177
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:01,740
Think of how you pull hair out of someone's head, like this.

1178
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,740
So you suspend him upside down,

1179
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,740
and you pull like that, like you're milking a cow.

1180
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:07,740
And that's how you get the hair out.

1181
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,740
We'll just say that this kid is going to be a human cow

1182
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:11,740
in a human form.

1183
01:01:11,740 --> 01:01:13,740
