00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,600
He's got to turn the shredding off.

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,200
You never had that before, Caleb.

7
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,200
That drink is new. You never had that before.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,600
It's an-- I drink this same espresso every single episode.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,000
I wear this hat every day.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
You never had that before.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You never had that before. That's new.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
- I always have this big dookie chain on.

13
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,340
- You never had that before?

14
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,740
- No, that's all new.

15
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,580
- That's new.

16
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,400
- Never had it before.

17
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,240
- Never had that before.

18
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,080
- I've always had this tattoo.

19
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,300
- You guys, I wrote a song for you.

20
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,140
- Really?

21
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:43,760
(guitar playing)

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,140
- Whoa.

23
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:54,500
- That's a new song, you never wrote that before.

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,600
- That's a new song, I never wrote it.

25
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,600
I wanna sign you to a deal.

26
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,600
Really?

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,600
Yeah.

28
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I wanna sign you to a deal.

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:08,600
The deal is, the deal is you never ever play that song again as long as you fucking live.

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,600
Why?

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,600
And I will kill you, okay?

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,600
What?

33
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,600
I will fight this is the worst shit I've ever heard.

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,600
You don't like my music?

35
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,600
It's terrible.

36
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,600
There is nothing, there will never be anything iconic about that song.

37
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
Yeah, I'd like to sign you to a deal, Patrick.

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
The deal of matrimony.

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,520
and I graciously accept that's right do you guys realize that this is starting to

40
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,440
really hurt my feeling that's an old marriage that happened before mm-hmm we

41
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:43,660
had that that before oh no you guys are so in love that you're speaking at the

42
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:51,100
same time mm-hmm whatever explain this stupid fucking bit no what bit yeah the

43
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:54,780
had that before the Cameron pulled out his inhaler and I said that's new you've

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:03,460
never had that before. It's not much of an explanation. Yeah, I mean, great it's ruined.

45
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,220
We have to chop off the first two minutes of this episode now because Patrick spoiled the

46
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:13,600
joke. We can edit it out. Today's episode is the carnival episode. Patrick's on a ferris

47
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,700
wheel right now. We're gonna do themes now. Yeah. Yeah, so this week we sent Patrick to

48
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,820
the carnival and he got stuck to a candy apple and now there's a kid dragging him around by

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,500
stick of the candy apple to every ride yeah they thought Patrick was it was a

00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,900
yeah I don't know that I've ever heard anyone say it like that before it's fine yeah I

56
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:02,460

middle yeah yeah but you you've met with that's never been that's never happened

59
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,460
yeah that's a new pronunciation no you didn't have it before said that nobody

60
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,700
- No, they didn't have that before.

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,540
- No, they didn't have that before.

62
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,740
- What are you drinking?

63
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,220
- He's drinking brown juice.

64
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,300
- I'm drinking brown juice.

65
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,380
It'll make me feel good.

66
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,220
When brown juice hit me, I feel no pain.

67
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,300
- I drank a coffee before this.

68
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,500
- Oh, that's really cool, dude.

69
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,420
Wow, yeah.

70
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,340
- No, that is for me.

71
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,180
- That is big news.

72
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,000
- Yeah, yeah.

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,060
- Caleb, shut up.

74
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,180
- Yeah, oh yeah, I'll shut up, yeah.

75
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,120
- This is my second coffee I've had in the week.

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,620
And that's the first two coffees of all time.

77
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,880
That's a good thing for him.

78
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,720
Don't ask any questions that might change his mind.

79
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,900
- I'm just gonna tip it.

80
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,200
What made you switch to coffee instead of Monster Energy?

81
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,160
- Master Energy.

82
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,940
I think I read something about kidney stones.

83
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,880
- Oh, dude, yeah, you're getting fucked, man.

84
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,720
I hope you know that.

85
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,840
You are riddled with all sorts of cancer.

86
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,380
You have kidney stones outside of your kidneys.

87
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,220
- Yeah.

88
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,100
- You have lung stones.

89
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,940
- What people don't tell you about Monster Energy

90
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:18,380
is that it gives you energy, but it also gives the cancerous cells energy that are growing

91
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,380
inside of you.

92
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,380
It also gives you faster.

93
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
It makes them work faster.

94
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,380
Yeah.

95
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,740
They were designed for somebody to drink once in their life.

96
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:29,620
Everybody was supposed to buy one and then keep it as an emergency.

97
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,940
It's called monster energy because it makes the cells inside you take your body over like

98
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,700
Mr. Hyde.

99
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,700
That's true.

100
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
And it turns you to a monster.

101
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:38,700
It does turn you to Mr. Hyde.

102
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,020
White Ultra turned me to a monster.

103
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,660
I'm the White Ultra beast.

104
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,140
The white Ultra Boost.

105
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,860
I'm the white Ultra Boost.

106
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,860
Yeah.

107
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,860
You're an Ultra Boost.

108
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:49,860
You're a Yeezy Ultra Boost.

109
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,860
I'm a shoe.

110
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,860
Yeah.

111
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,860
I'm actually just a shoe.

112
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,860
Yeah.

113
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,460
I've just been joking this whole time.

114
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,460
I've just been joking.

115
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:00,460
I've just been a shoe this whole time, man.

116
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,420
It was not a good move.

117
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,860
What have you guys been doing?

118
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,860
What's going on in the...

119
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,380
I think I'm going to grow my beard out.

120
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,220
In the cam-a-verse and the Patrick sphere.

121
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,220
That's pretty good.

122
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,220
Right?

123
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,220
I just, I think I'm going to grow my beard out.

124
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,220
Okay, one at a time.

125
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,220
All right.

126
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,220
Patrick, go first.

127
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,220
I just, I've been relearning guitar.

128
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,220
Wow.

129
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:26,900
And I'm going to, yeah, I'm going to grow my beard out and I'm going to get, I'm going

130
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,500
to start drinking coffee now.

131
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,860
I'm making big moves.

132
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,860
Wow, dude.

133
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,060
All right, for me, basically, I've been relearning guitar and I'm going to grow my beard out

134
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,420
and I'm going to be drinking coffee.

135
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,420
No, no, you're not.

136
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,340
And I'm also, you know, also at the carnival.

137
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,100
I'm also, I'm not at the carnival.

138
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,180
- Camera can't say that.

139
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,020
Camera can't say that.

140
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,700
- That's true, I can't say I'm at the carnival.

141
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,540
I've been doing nothing.

142
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,260
I've just been sitting at home and then working.

143
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,760
That's pretty much it.

144
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,340
- Yeah, I've been working at the carnival

145
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,540
as the bearded lady.

146
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,540
- Yeah, you have been the bearded lady, yeah.

147
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,660
- See, the trick is about the bearded lady

148
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,260
is they just get a guy that looks like me.

149
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,860
- Do you think, I mean just the lipstick.

150
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,460
- If you got a binder and you wore it only on your stomach,

151
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,140
you could be the bearded lady.

152
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:10,980
- Yeah.

153
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,860
- That's true. - That's true.

154
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,800
- You just, yeah.

155
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,220
- You just gotta give yourself an hourglass,

156
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,140
an hourglass figure. - Just do a dress.

157
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,980
You feel like you could be a bearded lady.

158
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:20,820
- Just a beautiful hourglass figure.

159
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:25,100
- The thing is, most Eastern European women grow beards

160
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,700
after the age of like 15.

161
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,100
So it's not that crazy to have a bearded lady.

162
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:33,320
- Yeah, Cameron started growing one when he was six.

163
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,340
- Yeah, 'cause I'm high T. - Oh my God!

164
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,660
- 'Cause I'm high T. - Woo!

165
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,500
Let's fucking go!

166
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,100
- 'Cause yeah, 'cause I'm high T.

167
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:40,940
- Yeah, high tolerance.

168
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,780
- Yeah, 'cause I'm high tea.

169
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,600
- High tea, high tits.

170
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,440
- High tolerance for having--

171
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,280
- 'Cause you got high tits.

172
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,540
- 'Cause I'm high tea, yeah, 'cause I'm high tea.

173
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,540
- High tolerance for having a pussy.

174
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,920
- That's right.

175
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
- No, I'm low, I don't--

176
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,220

178
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:55,820
You got that right.

00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,780
- No, yeah, you have a low tolerance for jerks

180
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,900
making fun of your small penis.

181
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,720
- That's right.

182
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,560
- So which is it?

183
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,420
- Which is it?

184
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,240
You're a girl.

185
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,080
- Whichever one you wanna be.

186
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,700
- Whichever one makes you a girl, man.

187
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:07,540
- Neither of them, man.

201
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,300
- Put your mouth on his butt, and he farts.

202
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,260
- And the bum farted.

203
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,280
- Who wins?

204
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,120
- You.

205
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:31,960
- The game has to have a winner.

206
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,780
- 'Cause you get sucked down.

207
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,220
- That is a loss for me.

208
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,060
That is a huge loss.

209
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,020
- A big helping of farts.

210
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,040
- It's not a helping, dude.

211
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:40,220
- A huge loss of cum from your balls, dude.

212
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,060
- It's a serving.

213
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,560
- 'Cause it makes you blast off.

214
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,460
- Farts, there's a serving size of farts.

215
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,300
- What is it?

216
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,780
How many calories are in a fart?

217
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,140
- Probably the same amount as any food that you eat.

218
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,180
(laughing)

219
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,460
That's where the calories go.

220
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,540
You get all the nutrients and the calories come out of fart.

221
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,500
Say you eat like a whole bag of beef jerky, look at the bag of the bag and then the first

222
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,100
fart that you have after you're done eating that, that's how many calories is in that

223
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,100
fart.

224
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,860
The way the body works is it converts the numbers on the bag into the sound of a fart.

225
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,140
It changes a number into a sound.

226
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
It's the Hertz, yeah.

227
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,780
It's the calories, it's the Hertz at which your fart comes out.

228
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:22,460
Do you think people should, like people who are trying to gain weight and they like eat like a

229
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:28,300
like spoonfuls of olive oil, you think instead they should just sit in front of a friend's ass

230
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:35,100
and just huff? Yeah. Yeah. Wrestlers? Yeah, wrestlers. I was mostly thinking about wrestlers.

231
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,260
Yeah. Do you know what that is? I think we've talked about that. Checking the oil? Yeah,

232
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:43,740
checking the oil is an illegal wrestling move where if you're pinned down you stick your finger

233
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:50,740
in the other wrestler's ass. When you say illegal, what- It's illegal because it's assault. The police will come.

234
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:57,740
The police will, they will shoot you if you stick your finger into another wrestler's ass. Yeah, they have, they have one-

235
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:03,740
What if it's a girl wrestler? It's still assault. No, that's fine.

236
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:09,740
They have one cop that, it's the same cop, he's at every wrestling match and he's just there to make sure that nobody does

237
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,220
checking the oil. He's there because his son is one of the wrestlers. Yeah. He's there

238
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:17,820
because his son died 20 years ago checking the oil. Uh huh. And he was like sure it never

239
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,900
happened again. His son was the one sticking his finger in another guy's ass. Yeah. And

240
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:25,620
the ass was so poisoned. He immediately died. He got stuck and he died. It burned his finger

241
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:30,900
off. He starved to death. It melted his finger like acid. Mm hmm. Yeah. And it spread up

242
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:35,900
his whole body. His son lost his finger. Yeah. He turned into poop. He turned into poop and

243
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:42,900
got sucked into the butt. If you climb into your man's ass, are you legally poop?

244
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:59,900
Yep. That's exactly it. Yeah, if you climb into an ass, you're poop.

245
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:07,420
somebody somebody asking somebody as Steve Harvey that and he just leaves

246
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:19,300
no cuz that now I'm wouldn't if you if you enter and then leave your poop but

247
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,420
if you enter and you stay in your you become another person like master of

248
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:27,540
disguise your pistachio disguise you're becoming another person okay now do the

249
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:31,220
voice that he does when he's changing into a certain type of person. All right

250
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:38,380
let's go one two three. If you become if you are a criminal and you're fleeing maybe a

251
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:42,740
murder charge or a robbery charge and you climb into another man's ass. That's

252
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,900
the plot of child's play. And then he shits you out. That's what happens he

253
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:52,760
climbs into the doll's ass. You climb into a man's ass and he shits you out. Can you

254
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,800
then argue that you cannot be prosecuted because you were legally a piece of poop.

255
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah, you got to put me in the toilet, officer. Your honor, my client, look at him.

256
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:13,920
He is a piece of poop. Clear as day. Open and shut case.

257
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,260
The jury's murmuring. The jury stands up in the middle of the case and goes,

258
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:31,500
we've already made our decision guilty of being a piece of the bathroom you are

00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:36,140

And I was like, "Oh, that's cool."

00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,500
And he's like, "Yeah, get this."

270
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,740
I asked him under sex to put, "Yes, please."

271
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,380

281
00:13:55,660 --> 00:14:01,420
Yeah yeah. Hey kid. Sex yes please. Well yeah because in my head when I was 15 I was just

283
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,620

284
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,740
adult too early like you were one of those kids that was like...

Yeah. Yeah, dude. I used to go on... I one time

288
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:27,660
thought that I had a heart attack when I saw that it went over like 18 trillion.

289
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,260
I like opened it up one day and I was like my heart started beating so fast

290
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,540
that I thought I was gonna have a heart attack.

291
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,540
Yep. You had high blood pressure from the age of like 14.

292
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,540
from the national debt

293
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,960
Yeah

294
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:48,380
Yeah, you definitely tried to just have conversations with your friends parents

00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:56,140
Yeah, I always tried to I tried to call them by their first names. Hey, Michelle. Did you did you read that piece? Yeah

296
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:06,260
You're right, yeah

297
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,260
I remember talking to my friend's mom about tea for a long time one time.

298
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Yeah. Yeah, I mean I did the same thing but only because...

299
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,260
But my friends had moms. I mean they were all supermodel hot bitches.

300
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,260
Michelle, did you catch that newest edition of Nintendo Power?

301
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:26,260

Dave, good to see ya. Tell me, did you see the new episode of Spongebob?

303

You'll never guess what that guy Plankton got up to. He tries to get the secret formula.

304
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,060
Yeah, hey, why don't you come over sometime? We can crack open a few cold

306
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:51,060
Tandem toilet. Does it have two holes or is it one hole and it's really wide?

307
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:55,860
It's one wide toilet that has two different basins. More of a Code Red or a

308
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Game Fuel kind of thing, huh? Dave? You know what? What's the date on this Game

Beautiful. 2006 game fuel.

00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,700
Do you have purple ketchup?

323
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,120
(laughing)

324
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,020
I'll take green but I prefer purple.

325
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,180
- How are things at the office?

326
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,180
How's the missus?

327
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:54,100
Yeah, no I've been pretty busy myself.

328
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I've been making big piles of mud

329
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
and putting them in the oven.

330
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,380
My mom's been getting very angry at me.

331
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,380
You know how it is with women.

332
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,380
Yeah, it's true. It's basically Stewie.

333
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,380
We were a person.

334
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,380
We just engineered Stewie Griffin.

335
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:14,380
Yeah, I did the same thing as Caleb, but only because I understood their fucking...

336
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,380
You said classic rock.

337
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
Yeah, but only because I actually understood all of them perfectly.

338
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380
I actually understood them.

339
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
I could speak like a 40 year old man.

340
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:24,380
I just loved the milfy dog walkers that made up my friend's moms.

341
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,380
Yeah.

342
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,380
Yeah. Oh, so ugly.

343
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,700
I just talked to my friend's dad.

344
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,660
That's cool man.

345
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,660
You just did?

346
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,020
I just did right now.

347
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Recently?

348
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,020
Is he at the carnival?

349
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:39,240
Yeah, he's in here with me.

350
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,240
He's in the...

351
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
In here?

352
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,240
What's the party right now?

353
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Hey, shut the fuck up!

354
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Yeah, he's...

355
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,240
Nice.

356
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
Why did you tell him to shut up?

357
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,240
I thought he was your friend.

358
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,240
He's saying the n-word.

359
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Oh my god.

360
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,240
Come on dude.

361
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,240
At the carnival?

362
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
What kind of friend is that?

363
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,240
At the carnival?

364
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,940
You're friends with this guy?

365
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Look I...

366
00:17:56,940 --> 00:18:01,660
as I get off this Ferris wheel we're not friends anymore. I tell you what when that

367
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:08,940
thing goes back down uh-uh. But you you were hanging out with him when he was saying it before.

368
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:14,060
Wait, you were on the Ferris wheel with a man? Yes. What are you guys gonna do when you hit the top? Propose.

369
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:22,620
You're gonna propose to your friend's dad? Mm-hmm. Is he married? His name is Jerry. Is he married?

370
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,580
Jerry Doran? He will be. Soon to be?

371
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,140
Mr. Doran to be? Yep. Wow.

372
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,260
Yeah. What's he look like? His wife, Terry, is not gonna like it.

373
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,340
No. Do you think he'll like it? When guys get married and one of them takes the other name, they should have to add

374
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,580
"Junior".

375
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,500
Just so you know.

376
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
I think that's why they originally made gay marriage illegal.

377
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,500
yeah i would do it anyway i think it is

378
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,020
the end of the year you guys have a

379
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,020
you guys have a name which names

380
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,660
when they do hyphens is it

381
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,740
the mix the names you know i just do

382
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,620
you know legal

383
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,460
just you know what we're talking about

384
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:03,900
the x bullshit yeah when you do yeah

385
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,860
when you're gay and you get married you

386
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,780
have to change your last name to x

387
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:11,700
yeah yeah yeah you change your last name

388
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,500
i am gay i am gay married

389
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
there might be of the thing that middle

390
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,960
name has to be gay. Yeah, Will Found, there's like a, if you go on Facebook and you search

391
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:27,580
the name, first name, I love men, last name, all day, there's like 50 accounts called that

392
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,980
because it's just one guy who keeps forgetting his password and making new accounts. I love

393
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:37,160
men all day. Yeah. Isn't that the best name of all time? Yeah, I know, I keep forgetting

394
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:43,300
my password. I love men all day. That was, I may have said this before, but I used to

395
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:49,220
play RuneScape with like this guy whose username was I love men's cock and he was

396
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:54,420
like 13 and then we found out that he died and we had a RuneScape funeral for

397
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,500
I love men's cock. Wow. That's sick. Yeah. So when you say that I was mature for my age

398
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:06,340
it's because I went through a lot. His ache he was broken he meant I love mensa

399
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:12,100
cock. Which you know isn't gay because they're geniuses. He was a sapiosexual. Yeah.

400
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:18,260
homosexual. Bit of a smarty, smarty pants. I'll fuck anyone's brain. Yeah, I'll fuck any brain.

401
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:24,740
I'll fuck any brain I see. Yeah. That's right. You. Would you fuck a brain? Yeah, why not?

402
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:30,100
I, we've talked about this, dude. I don't think we have. I don't know. No, we've talked about this.

403
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:38,420
I would fuck anything like 80 degrees and, and gooey. It doesn't matter. I don't care. You'd

404
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,940
You'd have to heat up the brain.

405
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
I feel like the brain would be cold.

406
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
The brains are hot, dude.

407
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,540
Why would you think- That's where all your heat comes from.

408
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
Patrick's brain is cold.

409
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,860
You touch the top of Patrick's head, it's ice cold.

410
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,420
Patrick's brain is frozen.

411
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:52,780
Once that shit thaws out, I'm gonna be in Mensa.

412
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,780
Super genius.

413
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,780
Yeah.

414
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:55,780
Yeah.

415
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,060
Once that shit thaws out, I'm fucking golden, dude.

416
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm solving all sorts of theorems and shit.

417
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
Yeah?

418
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,700
What's a theorem?

419
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,900
I'm creating my own theorem.

420
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,500
What is your new theorem?

421
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,900
It's the type of liquid.

422
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,460
it you have a theorem that's a type of liquid yeah like a formula yes I know

423
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:23,060
it's I just have a lisp okay what's the liquid it's my semen it's disgusting

424
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:28,340
dude I think you have meant to confuse with nambla as I know it has no man in

425
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:36,420
the name but it's you know yeah and it's a lot of overlap membership overlap yeah

426
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,820
- Yeah, it's one of those things where you can pay

427
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:42,260
half price for both of them, if you're in both.

428
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:45,220
- Yeah, it's like if you're going to a museum,

429
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:48,080
you can get a half price for a bus tour, too.

430
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,500
- Yeah, it's like when you go to Six Flags

431
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,300
and you get the water park for an extra $20.

432
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,300
Nambla's the water park, it's only that much.

433
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,060
- Can I interest you in Nambla today, sir?

434
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,780
- You know what, yeah, just throw it on there.

435
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,780
- Hey guys, if I got a Nambla membership,

436
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,300
would you come hang out with me there?

437
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:11,100
I'm already the worst guy you can be in Mensa, so I might as well also join Nambla.

438
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,100
Hmm. Yeah.

439
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:17,100
Put me down for the Nation of Islam too. Let's just, let's run the gamut.

440
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,100
I got a weird new line on my face.

441
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,100
Yeah? Oh, that's the gay line.

442
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Oh yeah, they just announced that at the-

444
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,100
They just announced that at E3.

445
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:30,100
On Nintendo Direct. 'Cause I've been- 'cause I've been laughing too much.

446
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
Did it make you gay? With my friends.

447
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Nah, that sounds pretty gay to me.

448
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:41,100
If you ever have laughed at what another man said, you disgust me.

449
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,100
I'm not laughing.

450
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,100
You're fucking...

451
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,620
No, the only thing that you can do...

452
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,100
Whenever you guys say something and I laugh, I'm just thinking of something else.

453
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
Yeah.

454
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
I'm thinking of how much I...

455
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,100
I'm thinking of the funniest boobs.

456
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,100
Yeah.

457
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,100
I'm looking at a Farside cartoon.

458
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Yeah.

459
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Well, a man drew those, you know.

460
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,020
I have it taped on my...

461
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,020
We have no proof of that.

462
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,300
Gary Larson has never...

463
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,180
There's no photos of him.

464
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:07,540
no recorded interviews of him. So you were searching for photos of a man?

465
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:11,500
Well cuz I wanted to check to make sure I wasn't laughing at something a man said.

466
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,620
And also if we're getting specific these are cows and chickens that I'm laughing

467
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:23,700
at. Sometimes bugs. Male. Sometimes an alien. Male chickens, male bugs. That is not for us to

468
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,420
decide. A cow and a chicken are... A cow and a chicken could never be brothers.

469
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,860
They could never have it.

470
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,300
They could never be brothers.

471
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,300
That's a really good point.

472
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
Yeah.

473
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
Well, they could.

474
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,300
Try it again.

475
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,380
There could never be a demon that's trying to fuck them.

476
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,380
I think there could be.

477
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,700
I think there really could be.

478
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I don't know.

479
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,180
Yeah, I think so.

480
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
Yeah?

481
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,180
I don't know.

482
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,180
I don't know about that.

483
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,180
You would think about something trying to fuck a cow and chicken.

484
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,180
Yeah.

485
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,180
You would think about a demon.

486
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
And let me tell you, the something is a male.

487
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,300
I would think about it so I could stop it.

488
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,900
You would try and get in up close and personal.

489
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,940
You'd stop and it could happen to you.

490
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,180
It sucks when you're trying to think about something so you can stop it and you accidentally

491
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,180
manifest it.

492
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,900
It's such a bummer, dude.

493
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,860
That's why, yeah, I'm downloading child porn on my computer so I can get inside the head

494
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,020
of somebody who would download child porn on their computer.

495
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,020
That was Pete Townshend's defense.

496
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:17,020
Oh yeah, I forgot.

497
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:22,180
That's literally, yeah, he was like, well, I'm making a documentary.

498
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:23,180
I'm making a documentary.

499
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:25,980
I'm making a documentary about this.

500
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,620
You can't take my computer.

501
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,620
about a little boys way

502
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,820
well i'm trying to download it also nobody else can have it

503
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:37,700
but i'm gonna tell loaded i'm gonna delete it

504
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:44,540
you are poor old it down where you are on my honor printed out and right bad on it

505
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,920
because i think i was gonna

506
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,980
yeah i was gonna put a good giant circle gyrates are cool with a lot of people

507
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,880
who don't know who does

508
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,180
in photoshop and i had to have the photos to do it right now

509
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,500
yeah try that there is a

510
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,640
there was like this British like TV presenter I think his name is Richard

511
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,980
Mabley and he's like they're talking about like cybersecurity and like the

512
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:08,700
dark web and shit and he's like why don't we put a virus on all of the child

513
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,100
pornography websites so that as soon as somebody accesses it it deletes it right

514
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:21,620
away. That's ingenious. That's really genius. It's the best idea I've ever heard.

515
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:26,680
Yeah, Snapchat for child porn. That's a great idea. They wouldn't do it because it makes too much

516
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:34,020
sense. Exactly. The government is pro-child porn. It's funny that like probably most child porn sites are just run by the FBI.

517
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:38,580
Yeah. So there's like a whole section of the FBI where their entire thing is just

518
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:43,480
like uploading kiddie porn and curating it. Yeah, like what yeah like guys who sit there

519
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:48,220
and are like, "Which ones are they gonna download?" You know they take pride in their work too.

520
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:52,480
Yeah. They sit there and they're like, "I did such an amazing job with this

521
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:58,000
triptych putting these three photos together yeah oh my god

522
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,800
they're listening to this they are listening to this yeah because of you

523
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,080
and they're and they're happy because somebody finally recognized their hard

524
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:15,880
work yeah they're fishing for compliments yeah they're just waiting

525
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,080
yeah they turn the comments on all those websites it's just waiting for somebody

526
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,840
And there's another even more secret division of the FBI

527
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,440
whose entire job is to boost the morale of that office

528
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,680
by going and commenting nice things.

529
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,100
So nobody actually downloads Child Board.

530
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,980
It's just the FBI downloading it and then uploading it

531
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,860
over and over and over again.

532
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,800
And we're paying.

533
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,280
And that's why the national debt is now at $26 trillion.

534
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,600
- It costs a thousand dollars every time.

535
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:50,200
If China gives us a call a couple, today,

536
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,040
if they give us a call today and we go,

537
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:52,880
"Hello, is this China?"

538
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,680
And they go, "Yeah!"

539
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,120
Or they say whatever,

540
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,120
and then they ask for their money back.

541
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,000
(laughing)

542
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,840
And then they ask for their money back.

543
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,600
- What did they say?

544
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,440
On the phone?

545
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,280
- We're just not gonna get it.

546
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,880
Probably something like, "Hello, this is China."

547
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,200
(laughing)

548
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,680
"This is China and we would love to have that money back."

549
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,720
- It doesn't sound like the same thing you just said.

550
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,560
- Wow.

551
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,440
What?

552
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,720
"Hey, this is China."

553
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,140
- Was that Waluigi?

554
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,080
- Yeah, yeah.

555
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,200
- Waluigi's Chinese, people don't realize that.

556
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,740
- "Hello, this is a China."

557
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,760
(laughing)

558
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,500
- Yeah, so Waluigi calls,

559
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,160
he's the ambassador to China's money,

560
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,720
and he calls us, and he's like, "We need the money back."

561
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,480
"Why, we need the money back."

562
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,940
I don't know what Waluigi sounds like,

563
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,780
he doesn't talk much.

564
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,760
- Yeah, he sounds like that.

565
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,000
- We, all of a sudden, we're having to sell

566
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,480
every TV in America, every tank in America,

567
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,160
We have to shut down the FBI child pornography program.

568
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,720
The whole thing just fucking falls apart.

569
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,680
- Yeah.

570
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,520
- Yeah.

571
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,400
- Without the child pornography program,

572
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,160
the way that it cycles around, it's spinning.

573
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,240
That's the turbine that powers the internet.

574
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
So if that goes down, there's no more websites.

575
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,700
- That's true.

576
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,020
- All the websites go away.

577
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,860
- That's a really good point.

578
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,700
- It's like a hamster wheel.

579
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,120
- You don't get "we fucked" anymore?

580
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:06,960
- Exactly.

581
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,600
- "We fucked" done for.

582
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,920
The bastion of American free speech.

583
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,760
- Yeah.

584
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,580
- Right?

585
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,420
- And you know what? - The last place.

586
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:16,220
And you know what? The National Debt Clock, you can't look at it anymore.

587
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:22,180
Nope. Yeah, because China's Great Giant Firewall is going to fucking block the National Debt

588
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,180
Clock.

589
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:27,620
That's so true. The Great Firewall of China. Has anyone thought of this yet? Has anyone

590
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,220
thought, "Hey, Mark Zuckerberg, I have an idea for something you could use to totally

591
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:36,340
bash the Chinese against how they hate your website." You could call them the Great Firewall

592
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,340
of China.

593
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340
You could call Bebo that.

594
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:43,300
You could call them a lot of stuff, but you can definitely call them Great Firewall too.

595
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,900
- Let's hold off on that other stuff

596
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,220
you've been calling them, Mark Zuckerberg.

597
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,140
- Yeah, Mark, cool it on the other,

598
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,860
cool it on those other choice words.

599
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,540
Let's just stick with, it's the Great Firewall.

600
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,020
- Look, I know you have like a word document

601
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,460
and you keep thinking of new ones

602
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,780
and you keep putting them in, but.

603
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,340
- Mm-hmm, but no.

604
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,820
- No, we're not gonna say any of those.

605
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,380
- We're not gonna say that.

606
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,220
- No.

607
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,040
- We're saying Great Firewall of China.

608
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,580
- The Great Firewall of China, or you could say,

609
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:09,300
you know, something else, but.

610
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,020
- Yeah, but we're not gonna say that.

611
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,500
- Well, Patrick is.

612
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
No.

613
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,820
No, go ahead.

614
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,900
I saw you had something.

615
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,900
You raised your hand.

616
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:17,900
Okay.

617
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,900
I did raise my hand.

618
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,900
What were you going to say?

619
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
Listen here, Jack.

620
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,620
But I'm raising my hand because I'm having so much fun on the Ferris wheel.

621
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,380
I'm raising both hands.

622
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,700
Yeah, you at the top of the Ferris wheel.

623
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,700
I'm having fun.

624
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
Keep your fucking hands in.

00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,260
You put class in the circus?

626
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,260
Fuck you.

627
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,260

What?

629
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
That's it.

630
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,580
I was doing like you're raising your hands.

631
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Somebody's calling.

632
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,580
A teacher's calling.

633
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:47,900
Okay, the teacher at the teacher who rides the roller coaster and calls on everyone when they go down the hill

many megabytes of caffeine

00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,700
Yeah

654
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:35,040
Multiple cups of coffee. I had an acai bowl, which is just a very smoothie. Yeah, that's just a that's just a

655
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,920
- Have you ever seen, have you ever seen the,

656
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,080
when I worked at Life Alive,

657
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:41,840
they had like, I had to pour the bowls

658
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,240
and it comes out and that shit looks like poop.

659
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,160
It really does.

660
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,560
- I mean, it really do's.

661
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,240
- It really do's look like poop.

662
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:51,800
When you put it in a little ice cream maker or whatever.

663
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,640
- I don't really like them.

664
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,080
- It comes out, it's all thick and brown.

665
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,500
- It's just an expensive smoothie

666
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,200
where they put peanut butter on top.

667
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,760
Fuck you, man.

668
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,960
- Oh yeah, dude, $10.

669
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,720
That was the price of the smoothie.

670
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,280
- I just had one, the one I just got.

671
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,120
- Great, great.

672
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,400
- 10.95, talking to my woman. - I also, I can't believe

673
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,640
that they make me pronounce that word, acai.

674
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,680
- Acai. - That makes me wanna die

675
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,520

Yeah, the only drugs are the are the barbiturates or the or the whatever they're called to keep him sane

695
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:37,240
Barbiturates? That's what killed Marilyn Monroe. Yeah it's what they gave women to shut up in the 50s.

698
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,400
Yeah yeah and then Enzo is his cousin. No that's Benzino. Enzo is his cousin who was in Assassin's Creed.

He's an evil character. I just let's hear about him. Let's do that for you. Yeah

He sounds like that okay, what is what is he from Italy?

702
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:18,840
No, he's from Manhattan the most evil chef I can think of is Mario Batali for me. It's Anthony Bourdain

703
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
He's evil for me

704
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,840
It would have to be Hannibal Lecter

705
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,340
Yeah, okay. Yep animal Burris. Yeah

706
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:33,440
Burrits, yeah landlord style. Yeah. Have you heard what he what he flicks onto his bread for his sandwiches?

707
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,100
Have you heard about the flavor? Have you heard about the flavor? Have you heard about his roommate with those lizards? That guy's evil

708
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,620
Mm-hmm. That's right. Yeah

709
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:46,320
And also he said that thing about Bill Cod. He's a reason Bill Cosby's in jail. Yeah

710
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,200
Also, I heard that he's that he's some kind of Lord

711
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,540
Mm-hmm.

712
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,540
Of a land.

713
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,540
He might be the lord.

714
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,540
I heard he's the lord.

715
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,260
Yeah, the only landlord I respect is Jesus Christ.

716
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,260
That's right.

717
00:34:58,260 --> 00:34:59,620
He's the lord over this land.

718
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:00,620
That's right.

719
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:01,620
Jesus would be landlords.

720
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,620
Well, maybe not.

721
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:03,940
Do you think, Jesus probably didn't know America existed.

722
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,940
Yeah.

723
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
No, he knew.

724
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,940
That's the truth.

725
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
He knew.

726
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,940
He knew.

727
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,940
His whole world was Israel.

728
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,940
Yeah, man, Jesus didn't know America existed.

729
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:11,940
There you go.

730
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:12,940
Take it down.

731
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,940
Uh-huh.

732
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Yeah, that's right.

733
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,620
Jesus, oh, you think God blesses America?

734
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,980
God didn't even know that America existed.

735
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,700
That's right, God blesses America-ka-ka, right?

736
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:23,700
That's right.

737
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,700
Uh-huh.

738
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,700
America-ka-ka?

739
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,700
That's right.

740
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,700
How about, huh?

741
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:28,700
Yeah.

742
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,300
And, yeah, One Nation under God?

743
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,540
More like I don't think so.

744
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,020
And we gotta do something.

745
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,100
My mic arm just fell off.

746
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,580
You could do like, you could do like, "Dodd blesses America," like the Department of Defense.

747
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,580
That's true.

748
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,580
That might get people going in the streets.

749
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:53,100
Yeah, let's think let's get some let's get some fucking Banksy style. Let's get some Banksy style. Okay, it's

750
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:59,420

751
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,580
Homer Simpson is is sitting on his couch eating a donut

752
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,380
Okay

753
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,100

756
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,340
Disney Mouse.

757
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:22,820
Alright, so here's, so, to, so Mickey Mouse, right, he's just got his whole, like, you can

759
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,700
using him like a puppet.

760
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Okay.

761
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:36,140
And that is Banksy protesting the merger of Fox and Disney.

00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,140
Wow.

763
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:41,780
What about Monkey Mouse sitting on a cloud, and he's getting fucked?

764
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,780
We should do, we should do like, I feel like we should do political politics.

765
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:54,380
cartoons he's labeled America and the person fucking him is labeled Hillary

00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,980
see that as a Ben Garrison cartoon. That's a pretty good Ben Garrison one.

00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:17,340

inside of a stinky wet diaper and the diaper is labeled America and AOC is labeled Alexandria

774
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,140
Osocio-sor-sorkin.

00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:41,180
It pushed my jaw up and closed my mouth.

796
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,180
What about...

797
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,180
Beerus from Dragon Ball Z

00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,180
and he's voting.

799
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,180
Okay, okay, okay, hold on, hold on.

800
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,180
Voting? We need to get more voting in this.

Yeah, voting. And he's voting and he says, and it says,

802
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,180
"You'd have to..."

803
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,180
Let's do something to make people on your age vote.

804
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,180
Okay this is the vote.

805
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
Okay an XKCD.

806
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,180
No let me finish.

807
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:10,500
Beerus is voting and it says if you're not, if you're, if you're Beerus you better vote.

808
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,500
That's right.

809
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:15,380
What about an XKCD and it's that little fucking stick guy.

810
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:16,380
Yeah.

811
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:20,700
Fucking dumbass and it says V, he's doing an equation.

812
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,460
Then it says V plus O plus T plus E. Yeah okay.

813
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,460
Equals.

814
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:28,100
And it says it equals, it equals Linux.

815
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:35,400
Alright so you know all the kids, all children, all the people our age are obsessed with Sherlock

816
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Holmes.

817
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,400
You think we're children?

818
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
Yep, we're children.

819
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,400
You think so?

820
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:40,400
How old are you Pat?

821
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Are you 22 years old?

822
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
No.

823
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,400
You're 23.

824
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I have the mind of a child.

825
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,400
Patrick is 2 and 3.

826
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:50,240
Yep, 2 and 3.

827
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,200
So people our age, well because people who want us to vote are calling us kids.

828
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,540
So they're like, "Oh, we gotta get these kids to vote."

829
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,160
So the kids nowadays are obsessed with Sherlock Holmes.

830
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:10,160
So it's Sherlock Holmes and he's searching for democracy.

831
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,320
And he finds a clue.

832
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,240
And that clue is to vote.

833
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:18,320
Yeah, and instead of Watson, it's Wopson.

834
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,640
And he's got a huge pussy.

835
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:24,920
What about a stone-toss comic?

836
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,000
pussy this big. And it's a stone toss comic. It's a line of people that are being forced to vote

837
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,040
for Joe Biden at gunpoint and then there's this little smug muppet looking guy who looks at the

838
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:41,560
camera and says, "I'd say this is more like a bullet box than a ballot box." Oh that's pretty

839
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,360
good actually. And then in the bottom right it says stone toss. That's pretty good. And yeah,

840
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:53,720
we could get people to vote that way. What about a Ben Garrison cartoon and it's like 9/11,

841
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:59,560
Right? Yeah. And it's 9/11. It says, "My dad survived 9/11." Yeah, he fell off the guard tower.

842
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:09,000

00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:21,720
- Yeah.

858
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,560
- You know, I think that might get the base riled up.

859
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,040
Which side are we on?

860
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,920
- I think we're in the middle.

861
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,100
- We're just making cartoons.

862
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,800
You don't have to have a side to make a cartoon.

863
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,640
- Listen buddy, I don't give a fuck

864
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,800

00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,540
on john's lap

874
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,400

00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,940

880
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
Yeah.

881
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,280
Wow.

882
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,280
That's what he says.

883
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,120
Does Garfield, does he get horny for human women?

884
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,120
He gets horny for Arlene.

885
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,120
Yeah.

886
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,120
Fuck, dude.

887
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,120
Arlene's a human.

888
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,440
Arlene is just a really fucked up looking human.

889
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,000
Yeah, she's just, uh, she's just Greek.

890
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:33,000
Just barely.

891
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,440
Speaking of, dude, I need to shave.

892
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,240
I'm wearing this hat because I haven't shaved my head in a couple days and I'm starting

893
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
to look like I sell falafel.

894
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,240
Yeah?

895
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,640
Yeah, it's getting bad.

896
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,200
You thought I was Greek for a little bit.

897
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,200
I remember you telling me that.

898
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,360
You just have dark features and you look evil.

899
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,360
That's true.

900
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,360
Yeah.

901
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,680
You look like I need to stop you from doing something wrong.

902
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:54,680
I look like my economy's bad.

903
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:55,680
Yeah.

904
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,000
I mean, you do look poor.

905
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,640
So I just assumed you were Greek.

906
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,640
What do I look like?

907
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:02,640
Don't tell him I'm Greek.

908
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,640
I was always playing a bouzouki too.

909
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Yeah.

910
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,640
Yeah, that's true.

911
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,800
You look like if you inverted the colors on Violet Beauregard, that's your head.

912
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,640
From Charlie Chocolate Factory, the one who blows up like a big blueberry, you're a red

913
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:17,640
one of that.

914
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,080
That's so crazy that that created like a whole fetish.

915
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:27,120
Like, seeing that woman inflate.

916
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,120
There's like inflations you can do.

917
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,120
No, not me!

918
00:44:32,120 --> 00:44:33,120
Not me!

919
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,120
Not me!

920
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,680
- I don't like the fucking story, big guy.

921
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,520
- No.

922
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,560
- I feel like there was definitely,

923
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,400
I feel like there were,

924
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:41,120
I feel like cartoons probably started that.

925
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,320
I feel like there were a bunch of cartoons

926
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,180
where like the wily coyote gets blown up

927
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,920
and then blown up into a balloon

928
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,440
and then the roadrunner licks his feet

929
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,280
and like starts, you know, licking on it.

930
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,720
- That's cartoons, once they start becoming human.

931
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:55,000
- Once they actually blew that girl up.

932
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:55,840
- Yeah.

933
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:56,920
- Then it was a game changer for.

934
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,220
- They did that for real on set.

935
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,120
They had like, they had a bunch of.

936
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:00,960
- They had a bunch of girls just in case they fucked up.

937
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,560
- They kept exploding, yeah.

938
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,720
- Yeah.

939
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,200
It was the first girl to not explode.

940
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,760
Yeah, they had to figure out the PSI rating of a girl.

941
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,600
They filmed that scene first and they were just like,

942
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,920
we're gonna take five actresses for this audition

943
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,440
and just whichever one doesn't blow up,

944
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,840
we'll use them for the rest of the movie.

945
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,800
This is before like the Triangle Fire,

946
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:20,480
there was no real labor laws in America.

947
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,040
What's the Triangle Fire?

948
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,120
The Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire.

949
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:26,600
Nevermind, man.

950
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,080
I know about that one.

951
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:32,240
I thought you were talking about John Landis' helicopter.

952
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,080
I thought that would be--

953
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:38,080
that's the helicopter incident in 1982.

954
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,080
yeah.

955
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,080
did you guys hear about the...

956
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,080
is there footage of it?

957
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,080
is there any other footage?

958
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,640
there's definitely footage of it.

959
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,520
i think they used the actual footage in the movie.

960
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:47,520
let me look that up.

961
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:49,560
did you guys hear about the polish triangle fire?

962
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:51,560
we're back!

963
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,560
yeah!

964
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,200
what happened at the polish triangle fire?

965
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:59,280
a polish guy was trying to boil water for his freaking pasta.

966
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,960
and he set the water on fire.

967
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,680
Is a Polish guy filling up his car with water at a gas station?

968
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:17,000
Man, the Polish Triangle is definitely the scariest thing we've ever thought of.

969
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,000
That is horrifying dude.

970
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Yeah.

971
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,000
I forgot about the Polish Triangle.

972
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Also, it's a real place.

973
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,000
So they say.

974
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,000
Yeah.

975
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,880
Yeah, it's a real place. Yeah. Yeah. So they say

976
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:36,320
Yeah, they want you to think it's real. Yeah, don't go visit. Yeah, baby flights to the Polish Triangle are so cheap

977
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:41,080
They've reduced they've reduced costs on the plane by putting a

978
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:47,600
Glass at the bottom and you can see the other Polish planes that flew over the Polish Triangle an evil

979
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,680
Gypsy travel agent sold me tickets to the Polish Triangle

980
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,920
(laughing)

981
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:58,760
- It's also so funny that it's in Boston,

982
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,520
where I feel like I never met a Polish person.

983
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,360
- Yeah.

984
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:03,180
- Yeah.

985
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,020
- Yeah.

986
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:04,840
- Well, they're all in the triangle.

987
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:05,680
- We have no camera.

988
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,080
- It's the Polish triangle,

989
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,080
'cause they don't know how to get out of there.

990
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,280
They can't figure it out, yeah.

991
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,440
- Yeah, Marty Walsh put up a force field

992
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,520
around the Polish triangle to keep them in.

993
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,360
- Yeah, well, all you have to do is just--

994
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,120
- We're keeping us out and them in.

995
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:20,000
- All you have to do is just draw a line on the ground

996
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
a Polish person can't cross it.

997
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,000
With salt.

998
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,000
Yeah.

999
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:28,000
It's running water. As long as they can't cross it,

1000
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
we're running water.

1001
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
Oh, God. Polish people.

1002
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
What are we gonna do with them?

1003
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
What?

1004
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Alright, let's brainstorm. What are we gonna do

1005
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,000
with Polish people?

1006
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,000
Daycare.

1007
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
Yeah.

1008
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
Oh, that

1009
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,600
killed Vic Morrow. What? The helicopter crash. Well it's not, we understood that part

1010
00:47:54,600 --> 00:48:00,240
although you did just say plane but besides that who's Vic Morrow? Vic

1011
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,560
Morrow was the guy from... I feel like Pat just says Nancy. I'm gonna know exactly who this is for

1012
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:12,280
sure. He's from Bonanza. And he's like oh he did set design on Babe 2 Pig in the

1013
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:22,000
city Patrick watched Bonanza every day after school growing up I did he was on

1014
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,720
two episodes of Bonanza he was on two episodes is that is that is big name no

1015
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,080
why did you why did you say Oh Vic Morrow died like what I heard that name before

1016
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:39,720
I just have to figure out who he is and then you watched Bonanza watched the

1017
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Western from 1959?

1018
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,720
That's what I'm saying dude!

1019
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,720
I watched Bonanza sometimes.

1020
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:47,720
Patrick would absolutely watch Bonanza everyday after school.

1021
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:49,720
What channel did Bonanza come on?

1022
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:51,720
It was on TV Land.

1023
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,720
Oh, you were a TV Land freak.

1024
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:55,720
Sometimes. It was the channel

1025
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:57,720
right after Comedy Central.

1026
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,720
So I would go.

1027
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:01,720
Comedy Central was 55, Cartoon Network 57,

1028
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,720
Spike TV 58.

1029
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:05,720
Pretty much that was my...

1030
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,720
Oh wait, no that was the...

1031
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:14,200
I mean that I think yeah 51 was Comedy Central and then 52 was TV Land.

1032
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,440
That's so interesting.

1033
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,440
It's different wherever you live.

1034
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,080
And then 50 yeah oh yeah that's true.

1035
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,760
Fucking come on man.

1036
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,000
I had Time Warner Cable it doesn't even exist anymore.

1037
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,120
Yeah Time Warner is now Spectrum.

1038
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:27,120
Oh really?

1039
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,000
I think Cartoon Network was 117 on my TV.

1040
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,680
Whoa once you get into the hundreds I think you're rich.

1041
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:33,680
It's fucked up yeah.

1042
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,080
Yeah once I went to a kid's house and they were like yeah go to 125.

1043
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,760
I'm like, okay, get me a Capri Sun, Richie Rich.

1044
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,600
- What do we have, we had Verizon.

1045
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,440
Verizon, whatever. - You know what,

1046
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,680
I'm realizing I've only heard of Vic Morrow

1047
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:45,960
because of this incident.

1048
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,760
- Fucking.

1049
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,020
(laughing)

1050
00:49:52,020 --> 00:50:03,780
- Oh, did you guys hear?

1051
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:05,760
Stephen Paddock just shot up a hotel.

1052
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,760
You know, Stephen Paddock.

1053
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,560
- Oh my god, Muhammad Atta died in 9/11.

1054
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,400
Where do I know him from?

1055
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,220
- Oh my god, that was Muhammad Atta.

1056
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,720
- Where do I know that name from?

1057
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:14,840
- Where do I know him?

1058
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:16,640
He was in something.

1059
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,560
He definitely was.

1060
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,480
- Oh yeah, he was at my house before.

1061
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,880
(laughing)

1062
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,080
- Oh, I taught him how to fly a plane.

1063
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:24,920
That's who it was in Florida.

1064
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,760
- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

1065
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:26,600
Oh, I know that guy.

1066
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,420
- That's what it was.

1067
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:28,260
Okay, now I remember.

1068
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,520
(laughing)

1069
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,020
God fucking damn it, bro.

1070
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:36,240
That is the funniest thing of all time.

1071
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:40,760
Pat, you are one goofy goober, brother.

1072
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:43,160
- I'm telling you, once my brain thaws out.

1073
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:44,000
- Yeah.

1074
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:44,840
- You're gonna be, what are you gonna do?

1075
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:45,660
- You gotta drink a little more hot coffee.

1076
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,120
That's the thing, he's been drinking,

1077
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,720
for his energy, he's been drinking cold stuff.

1078
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:50,540
- Yeah.

1079
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:53,160
- But now he's gotta drink hot coffee, hot energy.

1080
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,340
- Okay, all right.

1081
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:57,240
What's your next hot drink?

1082
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,640
- My next hot drink, ooh.

1083
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:00,960
- Don't say ooh.

1084
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,920
- Ooh.

1085
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,760
- Don't enjoy this.

1086
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:03,600
- Ooh-la-nti.

1087
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:08,600
Okay. Yeah, oolong something. I bet you will enjoy that.

1088
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,600
You say oolong pee man.

1089
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,600
Yeah, you want an oolong pee man.

1090
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,600
Yeah.

1091
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,600
Yeah, for me personally, I go, "Ew, oolong pee man? Ew, no thank you."

1092
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
I go, "Ooooh."

1093
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:21,600
And you go, "Ooooh."

1094
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:23,600
"Ooooh."

1095
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,600
"Ooooh."

1096
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:25,600

"Ooooh."

1098
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
That's what Patrick does.

That is a damn fine scooby-doo, mister.

1100
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600

- No, I don't think...

1111
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,720
- No, I'm saying Gandhi liked snacks.

- No, you got too much heat on you

1116
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,940
for that calling Gandhi a dog thing.

1117
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:05,780
- It's too much.

1118
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,320
- I'm gonna have to wait a few, wait a couple.

1119
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:09,320

just say like five words.

1122
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,420
- Five words.

1123
00:53:14,420 --> 00:53:15,260
- Five words.

1124
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:17,040
- Give me an impression of the computer.

1125
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,460
- I'm trying to think of what, in my head,

1126
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,140
what voice do you almost have that we could tweak one thing

1127
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:23,340
and get you to an impression?

1128
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,760
- Yeah, Brad Pitt, probably, and George Clooney.

1129
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,140
- Try Gilbert Gottfried.

1130
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,980
- It fucking stinks in here!

1131
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:31,820
Oh, Christ!

1132
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:36,940
- Okay, see Gilbert Gottfried is perfectly,

1133
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:39,920
perfectly like, he has like the,

1134
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,880
he has like probably when Gilbert Gottfried

1135
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:44,780
isn't doing his fake voice, he sounds exactly like that.

1136
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,380
- Yeah, yeah.

1137
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,940
So that's like, so we need to find your Gilbert Godfrey.

1138
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,780
- Yeah.

1139
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:50,620
- You know?

1140
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,440
- Yeah, a guy who sounds like me.

1141
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,280
- Which one are you just one degree away from?

1142
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,260
- Yeah.

1143
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,700
- Yeah, it's probably a woman.

1144
00:53:54,700 --> 00:53:55,540
- It's probably CK.

1145
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:56,380
- It's probably CK.

1146
00:53:56,380 --> 00:53:57,200
- It's probably CK.

1147
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:00,000
- It's probably, it's probably Scooby-Doo.

1148
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,180
- Probably Susan CK.

1149
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,400
- It's probably Scooby-Doo.

1150
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,220
- Susan BK.

1151
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,060
- Susie BK.

1152
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,380
- Susan Burger King.

1153
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,260
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1154
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:10,220
- She was the first woman who said,

1155
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,460
I've had it up to here with McDonald's.

1156
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,420
- She was the first woman who ever ate Burger King

1157
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:23,860
they changed her name against her will yeah I'll take a whopper take a uh uh whopper junior is

1158
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:29,140
what they have now they got fucking whopper juniors got a fucking diarrhea shit whopper

1159
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:34,980
and I ate it it's okay this whopper's a cunt this whopper is a whopper stupid bitch cunt

1160
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:40,180
I hate my lousy I gotta I gotta figure out my I used to have a louis ck impression

1161
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:45,620
No you didn't. I did. You did when you were playing Louis C.K. on multiple phone calls.

1162
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:50,340
Yeah. You did have a great impression then. You fooled a lot of women.

1163
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:56,900
No. Yeah. You did that all. You did all that. No. You did that. That wasn't me. Just admit it.

1164
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:01,540
Dude it would be your biggest crime. I'm a Patrick Hotep. I believe that Patrick did all of Louis C.K.'s

1165
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:06,020
crimes and took credit for them. That was not me. He just did a pitch perfect. I probably could maybe

1166
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:11,780
get Griffin McElroy in trouble for something you know if I get like a cheesy flip phone

1167
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,780
and then make some phone calls. 3, 2, 1.

1168
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:20,740
Yeah what could I get what could I conceivably get him in trouble for?

1169
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:23,140
Who could I call? Yeah I'm thinking I'm gonna kill all the polish.

1170
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:28,020
Uh yeah so basically I hate the polish people uh

1171
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:32,740
hate the polarinos. That's that's acceptable.

1172
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,220
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1173
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:38,340
That's acceptable, but only in like a three mile radius in Chicago.

1174
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,840
True.

1175
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:41,720
Yeah.

1176
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:46,340
But what could believably, because like with Louis, what he did, it was like, yeah, I guess

1177
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,660
that makes sense with his character.

1178
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,300
What could Griffin McElroy, what evil could he do?

1179
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,980
Being rich.

1180
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:55,540
Being a freaking bourgeoisie.

1181
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:56,900
Yeah, I'm thinking I'm a landlord.

1182
00:55:56,900 --> 00:55:57,780
A boudoirsie.

1183
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:00,820
Yeah, I love owning a bunch of condominiums in Malibu.

1184
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,320
Yeah.

1185
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:08,660
I use my podcast money to buy a bunch of condos in low-income neighborhoods.

1186
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,660
Yeah I'm thinking of gentrifying.

1187
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:10,660
That sounds really high rent.

1188
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:12,660
Yeah, so basically I'm a gentrifier.

1189
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,100
There we go.

1190
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,740
Yeah basically I have no problems with gentrifying.

1191
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:22,100
Yeah, he thinks gentrification is good for the community.

1192
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:26,300
Hey Griffin, here I gotta change my voice enough so that people know that it's two different

1193
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:27,300
guys.

1194
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,980
Hey Griffin, what do you think about the national debt?

1195
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:30,980
I love it.

1196
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:31,980
I wish it was higher.

1197
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:41,500
Hey Griffin. You're going to jail okay. I'm Joe Swanson. Hey Griffin. Hey Peter Griffin McElroy.

1198
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:55,540
Peter meet Griffin. Lois, hey Lois. Hey Brian. Hey what's up Pupperino Brian. Oh look at my gay little baby. I love my gay

1199
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,940
little baby oh he's oh he's British maybe he's kind of like a British kind of baby

1200
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:11,900
and I have a black guy neighbor Griffin yeah that's horrible yeah yeah yeah

1201
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:15,700
that's gonna get him in trouble uh-huh he's gonna get in trouble for all of

1202
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:21,460
Peter Griffin's crimes that's true fight the chicken pretty soon

1203
00:57:21,460 --> 00:57:26,660
I'm actually probably gonna fight the chicken pretty soon now, like any day now, probably fight this chicken.

1204
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:30,260
Hey, Peter Griffin McElroy, it's me, your brother, Justin.

1205
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,860
Hey, what's up, Justin?

1206
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,460
I like- it's good that you have bad legs.

1207
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,460
They call me "Oops."

1208
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,460
It's actually- it makes you stronger.

1209
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,460
I'm Scooby-Doo!

1210
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,460
Hey!

1211
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:43,460
What's up, Scooby? There's my dog, Scooby.

1212
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:49,460
I can't even do a normal Scooby-Doo voice, just the laugh.

1213
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:51,460
That's the only part of the approach that I can do.

1214
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,460
After the laugh you sound like fucking Lead Belly.

1215
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:55,460
You just sound like an old blues guy.

1216
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:59,460
I like it though.

1217
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,460
Yeah?

1218
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:01,460
Yeah, I like it.

1219
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:02,460
Yeah, you like me?

1220
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,460
I do like you.

1221
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:04,460
Yeah, you like me?

1222
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:08,460
Maybe I'm giving up on Patrick and I'm just gonna marry and fucking kill you.

1223
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,460
Can't do that Cameron and I are already married.

1224
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,460
Marry, fuck, kill, us three. What are we doing?

1225
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
Marry, fuck, kill, us.

1226
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:14,460
Marry, marry.

1227
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:16,460
That's up for the fans to decide.

1228
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:19,420
Yeah, somebody definitely has asked that question.

1229
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:22,780
I know everybody is marrying me because I'm a sweetheart.

1230
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:28,940
No, people will marry me because I'm going to keep them safe when stuff goes poorly.

1231
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,100
Fine, I know they all fuck me.

1232
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:32,700
People are going to say "befriend me."

1233
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,460
They're going to create a new option to say "friend."

1234
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:35,420
There is no option.

1235
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,020
"Fuck, marry, befriend."

1236
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,660
"Fuck, marry, kill, and the friend."

1237
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,900
You can use the friend as a secret option.

1238
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:43,020
Everybody fucks and marries me.

1239
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:43,500
Nobody wants to kill me.

1240
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,700
People just ignore Patrick.

1241
00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:45,980
Nobody cares about him.

1242
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:50,460
that's fine people just i'd rather i'd rather have that people say people say they say marry

1243
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:55,020
fuck kill the podcast about list boys and then someone says isn't there just two guys on that

1244
00:58:55,020 --> 00:59:01,020
isn't it just caleb and cameron that's not what people say isn't it just caleb and patrick

1245
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:06,940
no people say absolutely what happens this is just caleb and then two girls how do we marry

1246
00:59:06,940 --> 00:59:20,200
and fuck two girls. How do you marry a girl? I don't know. Kill I understand. If it was

1247
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:25,480
marry kill kill. That computes but yeah that makes perfect sense.

1248
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,780
But fuck a girl. What? Somebody's like hey you're gonna fuck that girl and the guy

No armpits.

1255
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:56,500
Look I've tried.

1256
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:58,020
And there's one rule.

1257
00:59:58,020 --> 00:59:59,020
No armpits.

1258
00:59:59,020 --> 01:00:00,020
I've tried.

1259
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,020
And failed.

1260
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:02,020
Could you fuck a kangaroo pouch?

1261
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,020
And more importantly, would you?

1262
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:04,020
No, dude, it's bones in there.

1263
01:00:04,020 --> 01:00:05,020
Nah, dude, it's bones in there.

1264
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,020
Nah, man, it's bones.

1265
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,020
It's bones.

1266
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,020
It's so fast.

1267
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:09,020
Listen, bro, it's bones in there.

1268
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,020
Patrick has tried.

1269
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:11,020
No, I saw, I saw a kangaroo.

1270
01:00:11,020 --> 01:00:12,020
No, no, no, I've seen inside a kangaroo pouch.

1271
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,020
I've seen inside one.

1272
01:00:13,020 --> 01:00:14,020
It's bones.

1273
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:15,020
It's all bones.

1274
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,020
I did.

1275
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,020
I did and it freaked me the fuck out.

1276
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:18,020
It's all bones.

1277
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:19,020
It's all bones.

1278
01:00:19,020 --> 01:00:20,020
It's all bones.

1279
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,020
It's bones. It's all bones.

1280
01:00:21,020 --> 01:00:24,020
I did. I did and it freaked me the fuck out.

1281
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,020
It's all bones.

1282
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:26,020
It's completely bones.

1283
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,020
It freaked me out. It freaked me the fuck out.

1284
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,020
It's a fucking bone pocket. Fuck that.

1285
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:33,020
I'm... No, I... It's... It ruins every cool thing.

1286
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,020
No, no. It ruins every sexual fantasy about a kangaroo I've ever had.

1287
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:41,020
Yeah. The bones are just somebody else tried to fuck the kangaroo first and they died in there.

1288
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:44,020
That's true. It's like a penis fly trap.

1289
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:47,020
Yeah. It's like seeing a cow skull in the desert.

1290
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:51,620
I'm telling you it's effed up in there.

1291
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,620
Real shit.

1292
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:55,460
Listen I've been in a kangaroo pouch and I ain't lying.

1293
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,460
You can see the organs.

1294
01:00:56,460 --> 01:00:57,780
Look up a fucking picture of it.

1295
01:00:57,780 --> 01:00:58,780
Ok.

1296
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,300
I'll look this up right now.

1297
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:04,220
Inside of kangaroo pouch.

1298
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,380
It's disgusting.

1299
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:06,620
You can see the bone.

1300
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:09,260
You can see all their bones.

1301
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:12,420
Oh wow.

1302
01:01:12,420 --> 01:01:13,580
Whoa.

1303
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:14,580
I told you.

1304
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,740
That's fucking swag dude.

1305
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:16,740
That's awesome.

1306
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:17,740
I would fuck that.

1307
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,740
It looks like a vagina.

1308
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:19,740
I mean it is, right?

1309
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:20,740
What is it?

1310
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:24,700
No, that's not the pouch, dude.

1311
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:26,140
There's legs coming out of that, dude.

1312
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,140
That's the vagina.

1313
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:29,300
Yeah, well, I mean that's...

1314
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:30,460
They birth out of the pouch?

1315
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:31,620
Yeah, the pouch is just a...

1316
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:32,620
I think they do.

1317
01:01:32,620 --> 01:01:33,620
Yeah, yeah.

1318
01:01:33,620 --> 01:01:34,620
I'm pretty sure the pouch just falls out.

1319
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:35,620
I think it just rolls out.

1320
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:36,620
I think it just falls out.

1321
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:37,620
I think it just rolls out.

1322
01:01:37,620 --> 01:01:39,540
No, the pouch is not the hoo-ha.

1323
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,980
Can you imagine being a baby and you sit inside your mom like that?

1324
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:43,980
Okay, wait.

1325
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:46,300
I'm going to send you guys one that I think you're really going to like.

1326
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,060
I think you guys will like this one.

1327
01:01:48,060 --> 01:01:48,900
Yeah?

1328
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:49,740
I'm serious.

1329
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:52,840
Tell me what this one looks like.

1330
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:53,680
Okay.

1331
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,800
Tell me that's not some fire ash.

1332
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:00,680
That looks like Caleb's pussy.

1333
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:01,660
No.

1334
01:02:01,660 --> 01:02:04,160
Dude, that's fucking gross.

1335
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:06,640
What's gross about that?

1336
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,000
You think women's bodies are gross?

1337
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:11,000
For people at home, it looks like somebody cut open

1338
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:14,800
a kangaroo and stuffed an Arby's beef and cheddar

1339
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:15,640
Yeah.

1340
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:16,640
into its stomach.

1341
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:17,640
Ugh.

1342
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:20,680
And it's looking pretty good to me.

1343
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,240
I think I might have to invest.

1344
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:27,040
I'm looking at the URL of this image you sent and it says gothic in it.

1345
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:28,040
Yeah.

1346
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:29,040
There's a word gothic in the URL.

1347
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:30,040
Real gothic shit.

1348
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:31,040
Oh my god.

1349
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:33,760
Real gothic shit.

1350
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,760
That's disgusting.

1351
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:35,760
That is disgusting.

1352
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,760
That's good dude.

1353
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:37,760
Kangaroo pussy.

1354
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:38,760
Stop looking at it dude.

1355
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:39,760
What are you doing with your hands?

1356
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:40,760
Nothing.

1357
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,320
Why is your camera shaking around?

1358
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:45,200
Oh my god.

1359
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,200
What are you doing dude?

1360
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:51,400
You better be trying to open a can of tuna, otherwise I'm off the podcast.

1361
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:54,360
Oh my, that's so gross.

1362
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,520
We can't do this twice in a row.

1363
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:01,240
Now that's a perfect way to end it.

1364
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,240
Yeah.

1365
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,240
Yeah, Patrick's fucked a kangaroo.

1366
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,240
Bye everyone.

1367
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:05,240
No.

1368
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,000
I'm not Australian, I don't want to have sex with a kangaroo.

1369
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,640
I'm stopping recording.

1370
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,640
Okay.

1371
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,640
Patrick fucked a kangaroo.
