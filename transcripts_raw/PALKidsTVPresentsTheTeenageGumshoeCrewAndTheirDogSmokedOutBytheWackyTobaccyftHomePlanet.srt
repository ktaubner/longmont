00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,680
[Music]

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:33,040
What's happening guys? I'm Gunny Sack and you're watching PAL Kids TV.

3
00:00:33,040 --> 00:01:02,040
me

4
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,640
What's happening guys, I'm GunnySack, and you're watching PALKIDS TV, the Saturday

5
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,340
morning cartoon block only on Logo.

6
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,340
So it's Scare-tober!

7
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340
Ooooooh!

8
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,680
You know what that means, we got something spooky for you.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,800
That's right, a classic episode of the Teenage Gumshoe Crew and their dog.

10
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,880
In this episode, the gang investigates a haunted castle where some creep is terrifying the

11
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:23,880
town.

12
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Yikes!

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,400
I know I wouldn't want to be there, I love being safe inside your TV.

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,840
anyway, hold on to your diaper because this episode is scary.

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,040
And then we push into the TV.

16
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,840
We're inside the television now.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,180
The teens of Weirdo, Pennsylvania, love to head down to Sully's Joint

18
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:46,480
when the gumshoe crew needs a break from solving mysteries.

19
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,620
It's just about the only dog friendly establishment in town that includes pizza,

20
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:56,220
an arcade and a roller rink that plays awesome disco music.

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,620
Does it get any better than that?

22
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:03,100
The proprietor of this joint is none other than Sullivan the Frog.

23
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,260
Proud manager and frog person, the only one still alive after the event.

24
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:13,980
Him and his chief, Fez from that 70s show, love serving pizzas to the kids and playing

25
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,980
the grooviest tunes.

26
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,380
There's even a couple competitions going on today.

27
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,260
The roller dance finals in the rink and the pinball warlock tournament happening in the

28
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,500
arcade over there.

29
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,260
Lots of things for the Gumshoe Crew to do if they want.

30
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,820
Hopefully no mysteries are afoot.

31
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:36,100
It sure be nice for there to be no mysteries afoot right now on October 31st, the anniversary

32
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,100
of Halloween.

33
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:42,020
So you guys are in right now.

34
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,020
You're chilling.

35
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,260
You've probably just solved a whole bunch of crimes.

36
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,420
You're the Gumshoe Crew.

37
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,660
Put your piece on the board wherever you guys want.

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
We have a board now.

39
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,540
Which one is my piece?

40
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,780
No one assigned me a piece.

41
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,180
Yeah, I never got a piece either, so it's already a disaster.

42
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,180
This is my piece, everybody.

43
00:02:58,180 --> 00:02:58,680
This is yours.

44
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,180
Okay, well, now there's other people with no pieces.

45
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,680
So my character's black?

46
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,680
He has one.

47
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
I don't--yeah, it's up to you.

48
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,180
Why do you sound so mad about it?

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,680
Oh, my character's black?

50
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,680
Look, I don't want to do that voice. It'll sound offensive.

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,680
You don't have to do any voice.

52
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,680
Nobody would have even ever known that you had a black figurine until you just decided to get mad about it.

53
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,300
Well, I'm mad about it, but now I am because you're all making me sound racist. This is all right

54
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,360
So should I put that you said wherever wherever you want?

55
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,600
Where are you and this is where the warlock pinball tournament is happening for that time?

56
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:37,280
This is where the pizza is that's that so this is this is kind of where you would order. Yeah, so I'm back here though

57
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,600
You're back by worse. Look behind. I'm behind the counter. Yeah, okay cool. Yeah, cuz you're the dog right?

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,240
We'll get to that. That's word. That's us you guys on the roller rink roller rink now girls

59
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I'll be in one of these beds over here.

60
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,740
Are we?

61
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,740
Sorry, that's...

62
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,240
The pinball is over there, that's just a regular arcade.

63
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,240
While I'm laying down on the pinball machine,

64
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,740
I'm taking a siesta.

65
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,740
Then I'm...

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,740
I'm just over here.

67
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,240
Nearby the arcade machines.

68
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:06,740
Patrick's thinking, "Oh, where would a black guy be?"

69
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,240
Okay.

70
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,740
So now that we know where you all are at Sully's Joy,

71
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,740
even where black guys are,

72
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,240
let's go around.

73
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,240
Who are your characters?

74
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,240
What's going on? Let's start with you, Jed.

75
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,080
- I'm Jed.

76
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,240
My name's Jed and I'm kind of the leader of the crew.

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,640
My name is Jed and I'm kind of the leader

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,680
of the whole crew.

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,720
I have blonde hair and blue eyes,

80
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,240
which some in the party seem to be jealous of.

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,480
(laughing)

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,120
I'm known for my, how good I am at fingering,

83
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,400
and women can tell just by my pheromones that I put out.

84
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,180
Well, I'm insinuating and inferring.

85
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,200
And basically I'm just gonna pass it on to the next one.

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,000
That's awesome.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,160
So Jed is really good at traps, finding as well.

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
Oh, and traps and finding.

89
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,000
And finding.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,840
And finding.

91
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,660
As well.

92
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,040
Yeah, also.

93
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,680
But yeah, no, that's great.

94
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,120
You're right now, you're laying on top

95
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,360
of the pinball machine, right?

96
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,640
Yeah, yeah, I smoked too many cigarettes. I got sick. I accidentally smoked the red ones.

97
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,140
You did?

98
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,140
Yeah, I smoked two.

99
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:20,640
Okay.

100
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,140
I'm falling over on them.

101
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:21,640
You're falling over.

102
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,140
Yeah.

103
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:24,140
Okay, yeah, the tournament is happening. The tournament was...

104
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,140
What year is this again?

105
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,140
Sorry, this is 1975.

106
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,140
Was pinball even invented in 1975?

107
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Yes, it was.

108
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Pinball wizard.

109
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Okay, and what about...

110
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,140
With Warlock in this case.

111
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,140
What about ice skating?

112
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,140
Roller rinks were around the 70s, yeah.

113
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,140
Roller rinks.

114
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:37,640
Alright.

115
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,140
And ice skating.

116
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,140
Okay, well...

117
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,140
Ice skating's been around for a really long time.

118
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
Alright, just get out of my face.

119
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,140
I'm gonna get out of you.

120
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,540
uh... and who's this fetching young

121
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,220
teenage girl

122
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:51,900
the

123
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,940
that is to just walk by the window you know

124
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,580
the

125
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,540
that is not part of this record

126
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,100
uh... no

127
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,140
i don't think

128
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,980
so

129
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,580
please talk

130
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,300
and

131
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:11,580
and

132
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,580
I'm a pretty girl!

133
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,580
Busy week for Alex.

134
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,580
I see.

135
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,580
Had no time to write that intro.

136
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,580
I'm Denise, I'm a girl.

137
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm pretty.

138
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,580
I got a good, I'm good at,

139
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,580
I got a good heart.

140
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,580
I love my friends.

141
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,580
Oh my god.

142
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,580
And I'm, I'm here.

143
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,580
That's great.

144
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,840
(laughing)

145
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,120
(laughing)

146
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,040
- Good heart, loves her friends and she's here.

147
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:50,880
- So Denise is the--

148
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,720
- You're cute.

149
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
- Don't do this.

150
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,380
(laughing)

151
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,880
I was trying to make a joke and I became in trouble.

152
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,080
(laughing)

153
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,520
Denise has a lot of abilities around crying

154
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,220
and calling the police on people and using pepper spray.

155
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,880
And she's also governed by her,

156
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,880
She's got very, very high charisma stat.

157
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,720
- Oh yeah.

158
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,560
- She'll be using throughout this potentially mystery.

159
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,960
Who knows if there'll be a mystery though, right?

160
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,800
- Right, who knows?

161
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
- Shut up. - Right, okay.

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,080
- I love having sex.

163
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,560
- And then we're gonna go to Vera.

164
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,640
That's my fault too.

165
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,060
I can't really pretend I'm immune to that.

166
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:27,200
You're up, Vera.

167
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,040
- Vera.

168
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,400
Hi everyone, my name is Vera.

169
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,600
- Oh look at this, somebody did their homework.

170
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,000
- And I am a lesbian.

171
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,400
(laughing)

172
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,640
- I love the lesbian voice you're doing, Joe.

173
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,480
- Yeah.

174
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,740
(laughing)

175
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,740
- It's close enough, I can,

176
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,440
I can haircut everything.

177
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,120
Wow, it feels so good to finally come out and say that.

178
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,920
But when I'm not giving brain to ladies,

179
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,680
I'm using my brain to imprison crazies.

180
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,720
(laughing)

181
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,620
When I'm not licking the stinky,

182
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,880
I'm solving a mystery saying jinkies.

183
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,080
And when I'm not looking for my glasses and clues,

184
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm probably eating stinky muff and going,

185
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,420
and going absolutely dome crazy on other lesbians in the back of our crime-solving

186
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:15,500
mystery machine fuck palace of a van.

187
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,500
You're doing that in the van?

188
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
Do we know?

189
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
After dark.

190
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,800
I may be a smart whiz kid, but believe me when I say I have a crazy ass side.

191
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:32,540
You heard that right. I will eat your muff and your crazy ass side.

192
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:37,660
Vera's really good at investigating in addition to her muff diving.

193
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:41,860
Oh yeah, Denise, by the way, I apologize Vera.

194
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,060
Denise, where are you on the board right now?

195
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,060
What are you doing?

196
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
I'm in the roller rink.

197
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,460
So you're in the roller rink, you're skating around.

198
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,700
You see it's the roller rink competitions.

199
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:53,660
Have these two ever fucked each other?

200
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Vera ever fucked him?

201
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,660
Is that the implication?

202
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:56,660
Let's just say I'm on the case.

203
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,660
I'm a virgin.

204
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,420
(laughing)

205
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,620
- I'm a virgin.

206
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,860
(laughing)

207
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,200
- I'm so excited for this episode.

208
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,380
(laughing)

209
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,060
- Yeah, I think we're gonna stay back at the--

210
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,700
(laughing)

211
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,540
- You're funny.

212
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,220
- So Vera's really good at investigating.

213
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,340
She has a lot of abilities around that.

214
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,860
She also has her magnifying glass to look for clues

215
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:24,500
and to use to do a lot of fire damage actually,

216
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,180
believe it or not, which is pretty nuts.

217
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,140
- That's fire.

218
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,980
- It is fire.

219
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,700
And now we have, let's pound that out, okay.

220
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,380
And then let's have, we have, who's this layabout?

221
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,580
- Oink zoinks, it's me, Shabby.

222
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,060
I'm the only 35 year old in the crew.

223
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:39,900
(laughing)

224
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,740
- Do you have the levels?

225
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,860
- They only hang out with me because I have a car

226
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,740
and Vietnam made me crazy.

227
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,900
(laughing)

228
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,140
I have to smoke cigarettes just to stop

229
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:53,700
the voices in my head.

230
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,140
I think the dog can talk.

231
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:56,980
- Oh boy!

232
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,520
- That's awesome.

233
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:02,120
- And I'm addicted to food completely!

234
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,320
(laughing)

235
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,040
Like, completely addicted to food!

236
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,020
- So we have Shabby Todgers here,

237
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,020
and he is 35, which I didn't know, but I'm open to it.

238
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:15,880
And he--

239
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,160
- He's a Vietnam vet.

240
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,000
- Right.

241
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,120
And he's a Vietnam vet.

242
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,040
- Does he have all of his limbs?

243
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,000
- Let's hope.

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,840
(laughing)

245
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,680
- Okay, we don't know.

246
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,960
- That's another mystery solved.

247
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,160
- Does he wear long sleeves all the time?

248
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,000
- His limbs are in a quantum state

249
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,720
of being there and not being there, I guess.

250
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,960
Which isn't an ability you have.

251
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,800
You have the ability--

252
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,640
- And I'm losing my hair!

253
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,560
(laughing)

254
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,040
- That's not, you don't have to even.

255
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,120
- Yeah, you don't have to say that.

256
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,960
- That's just like a world builder.

257
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,080
- I'm losing my hair from stress, man!

258
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,800
- Your abilities are, Shabby's abilities are--

259
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,480
- That's not what I saw!

260
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,400
- Prat falling and running through people

261
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,640
and losing his hair.

262
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,520
And he also, he's an animal lover,

263
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:03,080
so he can talk with animals and has ability around that.

264
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,220
So he'll get a little bonus for that.

265
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,060
Shabby, what are you doing?

266
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,920
You're at the arcade right now?

267
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,760
- I'm freaking out.

268
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,600
- You're freaking out.

269
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,420
(laughing)

270
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,720
- He's like looking at Galaga and having PTSD.

271
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,800
(laughing)

272
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
- Jesus Christ!

273
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,000
Johnson!

274
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,120
No!

275
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,960
No!

276
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,160
- It's gonna sound awesome.

277
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,260
We're gonna love that.

278
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,680
- I remembered my friend.

279
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,680
John Johnson, you remember either your dick or your friend.

280
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
Did you fight in the Galaga wars?

281
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Yeah.

282
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,680
I'm the veteran of the Galaga wars.

283
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,680
I saw Galaga.

284
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
In Vietnam?

285
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,680
You were in Vietnam playing a lot of arcade games.

286
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Yeah, I was not in the U.S.A.

287
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
You were on a sex tour.

288
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,680
He was in San Diego.

289
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,680
And then of course we have, last but not least, everyone's favorite.

290
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm Scooby-Doo! I'm the eponymous rarictor and protagonist of the Ranimated

291
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,240
Relovision franchise of the same name, created in 1969 by the American

292
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,440
Ranimation company, Ranomarera. I am a male Great Rain and a lifelong

293
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:11,440
companion of amateur detective Shabby Rock Dodger, with whom he shares many

294
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,520
personality traits. I feature a mix of both canine and human behaviors

295
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,480
reminiscent of other rocking ranimals in Ranomarera series, and is treated by my

296
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
My rents more or less as an equal.

297
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
(laughter)

298
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
I often speak in a rhotocised way,

299
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
substituting the first letters of many words

300
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
with the letter R.

301
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
My catchphrase is "Scooby-Dooby-Doo!"

302
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
So I don't know about

303
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,480
I don't know about all that, but

304
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Scooby's really good at finding

305
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
uh, investigating and smelling stuff

306
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,480
he can, has a smell bank, he can

307
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
store smells in and use it to track

308
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
uh, things. Where are you at right now, Scooby-Doo?

309
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,480
I'm behind the

310
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,000
pizza counter and whoever's making the pizza I'm licking their leg like their

311
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,980
upper thigh.

312
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Mike! Scoob! You gotta get in here!

313
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:59,980
Okay! I'm not doing what I was doing anymore.

314
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,980
I need my pills!

315
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,980
Oh is he like your companion service dog?

316
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Oh that makes a lot more sense.

317
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:12,900
So yeah you guys are uh yeah you walk before you know you uh you know Sullivan

318
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:19,300
is a good friend of yours, you know, he's an older man frog who runs this joint. You can

319
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:25,300
see it's not as populated as it usually is and he had told you that recently.

320
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,300
With all the haunting going on up at...

321
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
Holy crap, a talking frog!

322
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Shabby, we've known each other for a little while now.

323
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
Let's unmask him!

324
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,300
Oh no, please don't!

325
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,300
That sounds like a great idea, man!

326
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
Get that mask off that bastard right now!

327
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Just add your strength to that.

328
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,140
What was that?

329
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:45,960
- Three.

330
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
- Okay, yeah.

331
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,420
You, yeah, Sullivan's able to sort of dodge out of the way.

332
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:52,580
Oh, stop, please!

333
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:54,860
He's like trying to duck around.

334
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,780
Duck around, you're trying to grab him.

335
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,420
Please, I know, I know how bad the Gallagher wars are,

336
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,580
but please, just.

337
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,660
- You don't know how bad they were, man!

338
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,500
- Oh no, I set him off now.

339
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,060
- I was in Vietnam, San Diego.

340
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,940
- I just, since the castle,

341
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,660
the castle cigarette has been so haunted lately

342
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,660
by the wacky tabacky, I feel like I don't have any customers.

343
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,500
- What?

344
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,340
(laughing)

345
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,160
- I'd be giving, I'd be giving a reward.

346
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,940
- What the hell are you on about, frog?

347
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,620
- That made complete sense to me.

348
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,740
- I'm trying to, I would give a reward to anyone

349
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,380
who could solve that mystery.

350
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,620
- Why are you acting like such a coy slut?

351
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,500
(laughing)

352
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,660
Either hire us to do the job, or fucking leave me alone.

353
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,420
I'm trying to sleep on this pinball machine.

354
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,340
- You would do the job?

355
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,780
- Oh, twirling your fucking frog tongues,

356
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,660
and oh, what if somebody fixes all this for me?

357
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,540
- I can't hear you if you twirl your tongue with your finger.

358
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,660
- I wasn't twirling my tongue.

359
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,860
It's a good idea.

360
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,340
I wish I did that, but I didn't.

361
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,500
- Let's go shopping.

362
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,740
(laughing)

363
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,940
- Denise, you are such a hot bitch.

364
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,780
- Thank you.

365
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,900
- Either me or Vera is going to fuck you today.

366
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,860
- It's gonna happen.

367
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,700
- Or me.

368
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,940
(laughing)

369
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,220
- Or the dog.

370
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,700
- I have a wife.

371
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,540
- I love having sex.

372
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,780
(laughing)

373
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,780
- Is there a window in this?

374
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,540
- Yeah, yeah, there's tons of windows.

375
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:18,380
- I take out my magnifying glass and use it on the frog.

376
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,500
- Oh, you're gonna just attack the frog?

377
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,340
- Yeah, sure.

378
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,540
- We're catching on quickly.

379
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,420
- Yeah, yeah, roll, just roll a D20.

380
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,580
- I think we've killed Sullivan

381
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,380
in half of the campaigns we've done.

382
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,180
Usually, that definitely hits him.

383
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,460
Roll two D6s.

384
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,180
Roll another one.

385
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Okay, yeah, so, uh...

386
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
So where are you right now, just so I know where you are?

387
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
I'm in a Roman ring!

388
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,140
So what you're doing-

389
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:48,140
I was super far away from across the entire Roman ring!

390
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,140
From downtown!

391
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,140
That is- you are literally just in range.

392
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Yeah!

393
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,140
So there's like- and so the line is just going across.

394
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,140
People are just dancing to music, like, rolling around to the music.

395
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,140
Just a line of fire just-

396
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,140
A laser beam.

397
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,140
Just fucking goes across the establishment, and Sullivan, who just got out of the way of Shabby,

398
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,700
He tried to grab it there. I can't even hear what he's saying

399
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:27,780
You guys want to do that you could take it to the kid

400
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:32,540
I'm already like violently licking the burn spot on you guys

401
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,940
takes all of them and you put up he can't resist at this point you put him in the

402
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:43,020
deep right here's your reward yeah me and shabby are standing and we're like we're

403
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:48,100
like we're like just dead twiddling our thumbs over the dead person we at least

404
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,380
eat his body yep he's what do you think I was doing we

405
00:16:52,380 --> 00:17:00,380
we have big sandwiches and we eat them at the same time in one bite.

406
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,380
One half of his face is in each of the sandwiches.

407
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:07,380
So yeah, you guys giggle and he eats all of them in the product.

408
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:10,380
Yeah. Okay, so now your move.

409
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:16,380
My move is you roll a perception check.

410
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
Okay. Jed.

411
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,380
Use the dice tower.

412
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Use the dice tower. Maybe I will.

413
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
I will use it

414
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,200
Nice that sounded so good. Yeah, that's gonna be an eight for me, okay, you

415
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,700
Don't get the sense of where it's coming from but you hear a hissing sound

416
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:38,780
You guys can't hear anything I think it's Vera's downstairs is like releasing air

417
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,460
So I just kind of chalk it up to that, but I do try to smell it

418
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:45,420
I would like to note the floor is wet underneath me

419
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:49,420
Can I see or as in the roller rinks we can go to the roller rink over here?

420
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:55,780
So are you guys participating in the competition or you just I'm kind of tracking. I'm looking at all the cute boys

421
00:17:55,780 --> 00:18:09,060
So the main boy here who is is Jamee French foreign exchange student who is a

422
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:15,940
Very much very close to winning the very happy. How old is he? He is 13 years old

423
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,740
Oh, wow. I'd like to take out my trusty magnifying glass.

424
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,540
Of course, anything else you're gonna...

425
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,340
Anybody, anything that's happening here is 18.

426
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:27,240
But unless it's not. Except for Jemay.

427
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,640
Jemay is 18.

428
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,040
Oh. I'd like to take out my magnifying glass and hit Jemay too.

429
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:32,840
Okay.

430
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,340
Wait, wait, hit the disco ball with the light.

431
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,040
Oh, oh my.

432
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,840
Every show.

433
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,640
Oh, that's pretty funny.

434
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:42,840
I'm trying to think of the...

435
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,440
Oh my God, that's terrifying.

436
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:49,380
That's a hysterical implication. I do, I want that to happen.

437
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:55,140
Let's do that. Roll a, also a, slide a hand check to see if you could position your magnifying glass

438
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,500
and hit the, hit it in such a way that it will just spray fire down on the establishment.

439
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:05,300
D20 and then it will say that sidebar there, it says slide of hand, the number next to that.

440
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,340
Zero.

441
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,180
Yeah, so you add zero to whatever you get in your roll.

442
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,980
Fifteen.

443
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,020
Oh wow, okay.

444
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:16,100
You're able to angle the magnifying glass in such a way that it shoots out a ray of fire

445
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,180
Holy shit

446
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:32,500
Yeah, this is gonna. Just go here, and we'll have one you're gonna have to roll at me. Yeah

447
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,980
Can I use this guy's a human shield uh?

448
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,140
You don't really have time for that

449
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:42,500
He's in the way. It's the speed of light you look he breaks the line you drew yeah

450
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,140
It's a race. It's a red the idea is it goes through all of the I'm letting all right, okay fine roll

451
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:53,620
So you have to roll an attack roll so just roll d20 and we'll see how well you hit everything

452
00:19:53,620 --> 00:20:00,980
15 okay, yeah, I mean that beats your AC for sure roll. I have a 15 AC so it's oh yeah

453
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:07,020
But if it if it matches the AC the he wins yeah, so you roll roll 2d 6 to see the damage you do

454
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,780
I guess you're just gonna melt this guy because that is just a kind of a person

455
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:19,420
that's eight you take eight damage Jed you're just lying on the pinball machine

456
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,700
the pinball tournament just gets interrupted by a ray of fire that's

457
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,180
going through like run it's the gumshoe crew they're fucking insane

458
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:34,100
why am I half dead all of a sudden yeah you're just we're just sleeping and now

459
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:40,340
you're nearly dead and that hissing sound that you thought you heard you did hear

460
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:46,020
it's getting a lot louder now and now all of a sudden this green like almost

461
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,300
viscous smoke is blasting blasting through the place

462
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:58,100
well look from where through from from what you can tell roll a perception

463
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,700
check to see if you can tell where it's coming from you couldn't quite tell

464
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:05,260
before 14 ok you can kind of you sense

465
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,660
that it's coming from something around

466
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,220
over here something behind the billiards

467
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:10,980
table over there

468
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,780
ok our arcade area yes and you have to

469
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,820
roll a dex check

470
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,140
roll it's fun yeah you might die I'm

471
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,940
getting I'm getting fucked

472
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:25,420
yeah nine ok you're gonna take all right

473
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,340
because I didn't write an intro that's

474
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,220
not why I get just a really bad place or

475
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:37,220
do a voice. You take three damage. Every round that you're in this smoke you will take more

476
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:41,520
damage. Everyone roll initiative while we figure out how to deal with this smoke. It's

477
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:46,320
going to keep expanding. D20 and then add the thing that says initiative in the top

478
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:53,320
middle. I got a six. I got a thirteen. Eight. Where's initiative? Right there, the square

479
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:00,700
next to speed it's right under intelligence I mean 13 for you so you

480
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,620
roll a d20 you take it straight so you'll have a 10 okay and then six for

481
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,860
you Jed eight for me for you so you roll out yeah what'd you get I got 18 oh

482
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:18,620
very good first you'll probably be first Denise got 18 we have an 8 for Denise's

483
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:43,300
18 this is all my children

484
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,460
- I got the eight.

485
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,660
- You got the shabby.

486
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,900
I mean, you got the six shabby.

487
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,100
And what did you get, Vera?

488
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,940
- 10.

489
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,860
- 10, okay, cool.

490
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:56,820
All right, so, the smoke is billowing out.

491
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,820
Denise, what do you wanna do first?

492
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:02,100
- What are my options?

493
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
- So you can move, you can do an action,

494
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,500
you could try to stop the smoke,

495
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,260
you could just try to leave the establishment.

496
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,340
- I'm gonna run right into the smoke.

497
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,420
- You're gonna run right into the smoke.

498
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,300
Okay, go for it.

499
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,580
So, use your movement.

500
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,100
So each of these squares on this is five feet, okay, then you have 30 feet of movement

501
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,200
So six squares is your full movement without using your - action. Why are you running into the smoke?

502
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,440
to investigate

503
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,980
Mm-hmm. Yeah, but the smoke does poison damage cool. So well, you can't do it. I'm gonna

504
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:33,400
From where you are. Yeah, so what I would you can roll roll a

505
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,380
You want as your action you can do like a perception check quickly because it's just like timing wise so just roll that d20 and add

506
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,960
Perception to it. Yeah. Yeah, that's the one

507
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:50,000
Eight plus or anything I think plus one right? Yeah plus one nine

508
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,440
So you can't quite tell what this smoke is

509
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:59,000
You definitely recognize you've definitely like smelt it before but you don't know exactly what it is

510
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,800
And you know, you know what its places but you don't you just don't have enough smelt it before and know that it's poisonous

511
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:09,640
Yeah, but like like not just now like she was she just came over and whiffed it like this is it

512
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,800
but you've smelt it before.

513
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,640
You don't know exactly what it is though.

514
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,000
But that you can do for your turn.

515
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,080
And now Scoob, you're up.

516
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,920
- Okay.

517
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,440
Well I'm all the way over here.

518
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:22,920
And I guess, did I notice that the smoke is coming in?

519
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,760
- Yeah.

520
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,200
- We're in the kitchen eating food.

521
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,040
Do we know it all?

522
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:26,860
- Eating frog.

523
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,700
- Yeah.

524
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,520
Food.

525
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,740
- Just food.

526
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,120
It is food now.

527
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,080
- I would say that you would hear the hissing pop

528
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,080
and probably hear the lasers being shot out

529
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,360
from the disco ball enough that you would be aware of it.

530
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:38,200
There's activity.

531
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,480
- Okay, I mean, yeah, I'll just run out.

532
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,840
- Put yourself here, like you can have yourself be there.

533
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,960
- Okay, and I'll just run out into the open

534
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,040
and just see what's up.

535
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:46,880
- Okay, cool.

536
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,000
- I'm just gonna stand on this table.

537
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,200
- I mean, what you can do, you can definitely

538
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,200
lock the smell of this now and add it to your smell bank.

539
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,680
- Okay, I add it to my smell bank.

540
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,920
- It's your smell bank.

541
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,320
You take a big whiff of this skunky smelling thing.

542
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,840
- Oh, it's skunky smelling.

543
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,360
- You can start to piece that together now.

544
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,200
And now--

545
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,000
- Okay, I'll write skunk smell into my smell bank.

546
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,280
- He's twice, for some reason.

547
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,200
- Vera.

548
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,040
- Yes.

549
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,520
I see what has happened to my friend Jed.

550
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:19,100
My Eskimo brother Jed.

551
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,200
And I want to--

552
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
- Wait, we haven't, we fucked, I don't think we've--

553
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,440
- You're not supposed to reveal that yet.

554
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,280
- I just think that-- - It's not a rule.

555
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,520
- I assume that we're kind of operating--

556
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,720
- You and me are like taking turns--

557
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,720
- But we fuck the same people and then fucking trade it.

558
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,920
But we never at the same time.

559
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,760
- And never together, never with each other.

560
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,600
- 'Cause that'd be gay.

561
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,400
- Yeah, well, yeah, it'd be gay to fuck with a lesbian.

562
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,660
(laughing)

563
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,660
- Yeah, hello, rainy day.

564
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,560
I see what has happened to Jed,

565
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,740
and I want to give him a sully snack.

566
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,580
- Okay, cool.

567
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,700
So what you can do--

568
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,900
- Do they do anything for me?

569
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,040
- Yes, they give you five HP.

570
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,780
So you can eat a sully snack on your turn, too.

571
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,140
- Shove it in my mouth like Narcan?

572
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,020
- Yeah, I assume he's lying

573
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,500
and kind of discombobulated a little bit,

574
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
so I'm gonna try to make him eat it down.

575
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
- Okay, cool.

576
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,160
So you have to, the thing is,

577
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,540
you're pretty far away from him.

578
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,380
- Yeah.

579
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:09,020
So what you can do is you can try to toss it over to him.

580
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,780
- Can I do a run and kind of like--

581
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,620
- Yeah, shot put it.

582
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,900
- Shot felt off the pinball machine onto the ground.

583
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,820
- That makes sense.

584
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:15,660
Yeah, you could do that.

585
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,460
Let's do either athletics.

586
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:18,980
Do athletics or acrobatics.

587
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,900
- Okay, minus one.

588
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,740
- Yeah.

589
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,700
- You're gonna try to hit it into my gullet?

590
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,540
- Yeah. - Okay.

591
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,360
- Yeah, let's do it.

592
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,200
- Yeah, I guess I'm knocked out.

593
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,040
My mouth is--

594
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,060
(dice clatters)

595
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,240
- Yeah, your mouth is-- - 20.

596
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,020
- You got an add 20? - Oh my God.

597
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:29,860
- Wow.

598
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,700
- Joe's really good at D&D.

599
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,740
(laughing)

600
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:34,700
You just, Velma, Chariots of Fire is playing,

601
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,220
you just like, for some reason it's a perfect launch.

602
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,340
You're just like, lying there, like,

603
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,020
and you just taste this delicious,

604
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,100
sully snack in your mouth.

605
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,380
You gain five HP back.

606
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,700
- Woo, do I wake up or not?

607
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,580
Or was I ever, I wasn't--

608
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:48,860
- You weren't knocked out, yeah, no.

609
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,520
Cool, that's great.

610
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,500
Now we're back to Jed.

611
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,740
So Jed, you're the only one who's near the source of this.

612
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,220
- Back to?

613
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,060
- Just 'cause stuff was happening.

614
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:59,180
- I'm near the source. - No, sorry, I didn't mean--

615
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,660
- Do I have, did you ever go?

616
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,020
No, he goes last. That was my bad.

617
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,580
I thought that I got... Oh no, he got an ace.

618
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,780
I said back, but I shouldn't have said back.

619
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,280
Oh.

620
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:05,780
Yeah.

621
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780
So you're nearest to the source of this.

622
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:10,280
It's also by the back door, too.

623
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,280
So you can check to see, as a free action I would say,

624
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,280
you can see where it's leaking out of,

625
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,280
and you know that the back door...

626
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,280
The back door's open, or no?

627
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,780
The back door... Well, roll a perception check.

628
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
Throw it wide.

629
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:26,780
18 plus... So 20.

630
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,280
Okay, dirty 20.

631
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,520
You can tell that not only is it, it's not open,

632
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,680
but you can see that it's like,

633
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:36,760
even when you just open a door and it swings back to close

634
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,440
and a little bit of it is like--

635
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:39,280
- Yeah, okay, it's like that.

636
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,480
- It's like somebody had opened it kinda recently.

637
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,400
- I'm going to open it to see what's up in there.

638
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,240
- Okay, cool.

639
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,560
So you head out to the back and you don't see anybody around.

640
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,520
You do see just a dumpster to your left

641
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,600
and then just parking.

642
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,440
- He's in the dumpster.

643
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,920
- I don't see any greenness.

644
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,640
I don't see any greenness.

645
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,840
- You don't see any greenness.

646
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,840
I don't see the trail from where all the crap was coming from no not not here not like right outside

647
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:09,980
What does the ceiling look like just for my role my turn but but wait, but but it was coming from this door

648
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,560
No, no, I'm saying like you I

649
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,360
What I'm

650
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
Yes, but okay, you know actually I should have you do

651
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,420
Roll roll another perception check because I realize that like you should be able to see something, but I misspoke there

652
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:25,800
I got a fucking 20 last time this time. I get a four

653
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,840
I mean I'll say that like well you've said you forgot to do it, so I think I should get it

654
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,840
I think he just gets it. It's actually kind of true

655
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:41,500
You see a green smoke sort of from underneath the dumpster. I knew it's a dumpster dude. I said okay

656
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,120
So I walk outside and I do continue. Yes. Yes, you do okay, and I've superhuman strike no

657
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,640
You're strong. What did you want to do? I wanted to flip the dumpster?

658
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,000
I don't think you need superhuman strength to flip a dumpster.

659
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
You could certainly try.

660
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Try flipping a dumpster, Patrick.

661
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I could.

662
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
No, you could not.

663
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
I could.

664
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I will stop right now and go.

665
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Let's go.

666
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Pause right now.

667
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
We're gonna go and see.

668
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
Pause for 20.

669
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
He did it.

670
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
Okay.

671
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Holy shit.

672
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Sure, he did it.

673
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I mean, I wasn't sure.

674
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
It's now midnight, but like, you know.

675
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
We had to find a really small dumpster.

676
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
We had to find a really small dumpster.

677
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
I am going to...

678
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Okay.

679
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,440
You can use your action to investigate.

680
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,560
Well, first I'm gonna say.

681
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,200
I know you're under there, green-o.

682
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,880
Say it just like that.

683
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,880
Come on out of there, you bastard!

684
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,280
Get out of there!

685
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Come on!

686
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,040
Get out from under the dumpster, you green bastard!

687
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,240
You don't hear any like, stirring or- Come on before I get angry with you, you green

688
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
nutcase.

689
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Nothing, nothing, it's just- Alright, I'm gonna go back inside.

690
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:54,400
I go back inside. All right yeah and now your turn Shabby. You wanted to know what the

691
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,520
ceiling was like? Yeah. It's like regular, it's like kind of a mauve color for some

692
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,760
reason. So it's not like the 70s? No ceiling tiles. Yeah I was gonna ask that.

693
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,880
There are ceiling tiles in the bathroom. I thought it was being pumped in through the

694
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:14,720
ceiling but now. I came in so I could tell everybody. Yeah but now that he's already

695
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,600
figured that out are you leaving the door open I close the door close the door

696
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:23,120
stops coming in okay okay everybody I figured out the source of the green

697
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,000
smoke there's a stink of some stink guy and he lives under the trash okay and

698
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:40,400
there you go we'll end initiative it might just be trash so we can crash we

699
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:43,640
could end the initiative at this point if like someone opened the window all

700
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,360
the smoke's going out nobody's gonna keep taking damage there is that window that

701
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,960
yes yes yes yeah and so I think I think that somebody could have opened a window

702
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:56,440
you guys you guys can you guys can investigate the dumpster if you want to

703
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:59,560
or you could just I want to investigate but I just want the whole squad with me

704
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:03,320

705
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,480
the strength right spit up people I put up I'll investigate the refrigerator

Oh, God!

Yeah, that's okay.

Freaking normal as hell.

Okay, so me, Vera, and Denise.

723
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,480
We go from the roller rink and go to investigate it.

724
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
And I'll put my arm around her when we walk out.

725
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,480
So what do you guys want to do to investigate?

726
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,480
Do you want to just roll an investigation check?

727
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,480
Well, I kind of split between the two of them.

728
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,480
Because I know Vera has her arm around Denise.

729
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,480
I get between the two of them and put my arm on both of them.

730
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
Oh, yeah.

731
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:11,820
yeah okay ladies so basically we I need we got to pick this big thing up Denise

732
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,680

733
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:20,000

734
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:35,540

735
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:40,700

736
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:45,520
I'm actually gonna get to the fucking bottom all of you guys roll d20 and add your string

Yeah, me and shabby like sneak back outside like we've been with you guys

738
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:57,380
You're trying to lift the

739
00:32:57,380 --> 00:33:00,580
You just turn, you just see we're just all so next to you.

740
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Your hair is fucking out.

741
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
We're so scared.

742
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
My tongue is out of the side of my mouth.

743
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
I'm panting.

744
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
It's like cutting to the angle you had seen before.

745
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
You guys are just there now, panting.

746
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
I don't have, I just have a jacket on.

747
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:19,580
Shabby, your fly's unzipped.

748
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
Yeah, so is the rest of my pants.

749
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,580
And that sandwich you ate must have had a lot of mayonnaise on it.

750
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,840
(laughing)

751
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,460
- Oh man, it's A-O-L-E-O.

752
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,300
- Oh, mayonnaise.

753
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,560
(gurgling)

754
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,400
- Stupid dude licking.

755
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,660
(laughing)

756
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,500
Licks him clean.

757
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,020
- He's, oh my god.

758
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,900
- Just a ding, and he's so clean and shiny.

759
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,900
(laughing)

760
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:48,900
- I got a 16 on my strength, or, no wait, no, I--

761
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,780
- With all five of you there--

762
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,700
- I got a 19.

763
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:51,540
- I got a 17.

764
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,540
with all five of you there it's way easier. As you lift it you don't see

765
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,460
like anything underneath it but you do see a hole cut out and you see like a

766
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,980
little glass like top of like a glass tube sticking out of the hole and you

767
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:08,700
also see like a hole into the establishment from that so imagine

768
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:12,740
dumpster hole on the bottom of it and a little glass tube coming out of that

769
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,340
okay and that kind of sticking into so it's so the side of the dumpster yeah

770
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:21,780
Okay, so let's I'm gonna open the door you see what looks like

771
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:28,460
You don't know how to describe it. It's sort of like a glass tube and it has like a little like another smaller like

772
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:33,780
apparatus on it with some sort of like green material, and it looks lit and

773
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:41,500
Also, and and and it's just like shooting it out. It's like a like a bad bong. It doesn't make any sense

774
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,380
It's makeup

775
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,640
(laughing)

776
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,240
- It could be makeup, Denise.

777
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,840
That's a really good guess and you're really smart.

778
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,680
- You guys can roll.

779
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:52,500
- Thank you.

780
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,880
- One of you can roll a history check

781
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,280
to see if you know what this is.

782
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,880
- Wait, don't just, you should try to see.

783
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,800
- Who's the best intelligent?

784
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,640
- Oh, you're right.

785
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,480
- Definitely Vera does.

786
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,800
- This, well I got a 15, so.

787
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,600
- I got an eight plus three.

788
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,680
- 11?

789
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,800
Okay, so, I mean that's pretty good.

790
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,120
You would know that this is some kind of paraphernalia

791
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:12,240
that has been going around the school for a little bit.

792
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,080
- Okay.

793
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,240
- I don't know.

794
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,580
- Do we all go to the same school?

795
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,240
- I asked why I should not go to another school.

796
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,880
(laughing)

797
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,720
I don't know how.

798
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,040
- Shabby is a guidance counselor.

799
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,280
- Okay, I'd like to ask Shabby,

800
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,480
'cause I think he has something to do

801
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:27,000
with the spread around school.

802
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,260
(laughing)

803
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,160
- You guys have never,

804
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,720
you haven't seen anything like this before.

805
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,840
You don't really recognize what the green stuff is.

806
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,440
- Can I tell if this,

807
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,800
can I tell if the smell is leading anywhere?

808
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,640
- Good call.

809
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,480
- You can--

810
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,560
- It's in my smell bank.

811
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,840
It's in your smell bank.

812
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,880
So you can use a sniff to like try to track it.

813
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,400
- And I only get five sniffs.

814
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,400
- We only get five sniffs total.

815
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,240
- Are we gonna use one of these?

816
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,060
- Ever.

817
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,560
I don't know, what do you guys think?

818
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,400
- I feel like this--

819
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,220
- I feel like we just--

820
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,060
- It's almost done.

821
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:58,320
- I feel like we just metagame it,

822
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,020
we just go straight to the castle.

823
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,800
(laughing)

824
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,200
That the frog mentioned.

825
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,040
- Yeah.

826
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,160
- We don't, we stop investigating this.

827
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,280
We just go straight to the castle.

828
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,240
- You could go straight to the castle.

829
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,120
- But then he's gonna spend another 45 minutes

830
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,400
- Drawn. - No, I've got it drawn.

831
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,180
You got it drawn.

832
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,860
- Let's all run to the castle.

833
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,700
- No, come here.

834
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:23,020
- We all, we all like, we don't say anything.

835
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,860
We just look at that device, all look at each other

836
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:27,460
and then just run to the castle.

837
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,700
- Yeah, you guys run to the castle.

838
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,140
Let's do it.

839
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:33,020
So yeah, you guys, you have a mystery machine.

840
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,180
You run right by it.

841
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,340
You sprint to the castle.

842
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,100
And I'll talk about the castle in a second.

843
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,360
first I have to flip over some tiles.

844
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,920
Everyone take their guy. Or girl.

845
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,500
Or dog. Or dog.

846
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:51,520
Thank you. Or boy dog I think. Yeah but it's just different.

847
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,920
Boy dog. So as you guys are approaching...

848
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,840
Actually everybody flip these over while I read this.

849
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,440
Guys we're heading to the mysterious

850
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,800
castle that you heard about from Sullivan before you

851
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
Killed and ate him.

852
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,700
This looks weird this cigarette castle.

853
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,220
There's all manner of youths outside

854
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,460
protesting cigarettes. How peculiar a little peculiar. Why did I write that word? I can't say.

855
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,460
How peculiar...

856
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,460
How strange.

857
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:30,340
Some of them are dressed in their Halloween finest, of course, but they have eggs and TP ready also.

858
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,920
What gives? At the helm you see Mary Jane, a real goody two-shoes junior at Weird Al High School.

859
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:43,580
What she got against cigarettes? Everyone knows are just about the best. You also see a gatekeeper sitting guard in a guard shack

860
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:48,500
Alongside the iron barred gate trying his best to keep the protests under control

861
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:54,780
While also mostly reading a magazine. I wonder if these teens will let you in

862
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,720
The manor itself or the castle is incredible

863
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:04,940
It's four stories high at the very top rest the cigarette tower even now defunct. It's still always perpetually lit

864
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,860
Circle driveway out front beyond the gate none of that is drawn. That's all

865
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:14,100
Imagination this is the manor itself will get and then this is that the entrance yeah, you guys aren't there

866
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,180
Oh, that's right. Okay, right now. We're gonna do theater of the mind for this part. Oh

867
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,080
Like what we usually do

868
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:27,760
And right the circle driveway out front beyond the gate the center of which holds the famous statues of Sir Nigel cigarette

869
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,780
OBE the guy who invented the cigarette and cigar

870
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:36,700
Bumming the first cigarette ever off of his nephew Chris while they were outside of a funeral home during the wake of Chris's father

871
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,440
The entire place is made of white stone tipped with the custom customary yellow at the base of each stone

872
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,300
So it's kind of looks like a bunch of stones with a little bit of yellow on the bottom

873
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,280
As if the place were made of fat hard cigarettes

874
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,060
The door is a rich brown seemingly the same texture as a cigar it's a huge entrance

875
00:38:55,060 --> 00:39:00,880
But yeah, you guys roll up there and you see there's like all these protests against the cigarettes

876
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,880
Oh, geez, it's just like Vietnam again.

877
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,880
Um, but yeah.

878
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,880
Protests?

879
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,880
I didn't go over there, I just got scared of it.

880
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,880
Because of the protests that were going on.

881
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,880
You guys see a crowd out front.

882
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,880
Looks like it might be hard to push your way through or get in.

883
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,880
You can try to talk to people in the crowd, investigate, you can try to go around.

884
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,880
What do you guys want to do?

885
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,880
My interest has been piqued by this Mary Jane character.

886
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,880
Might as well.

887
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:31,120
- I'd like to walk in tandem with Jed up to her.

888
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,880
And we both speak at the same time.

889
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,560
- So she has a megaphone and she's going,

890
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,400
"What do we want?"

891
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,120
And the crowd says, "No more cigarettes."

892
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:40,200
- And we speak at the same time and we say,

893
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,280
"When do we want it?"

894
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,480
And they say, "Right now!"

895
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,800
- I let them use my megaphone to talk back to her.

896
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,040
(laughing)

897
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,000
- Okay, we both go up to her and we say,

898
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,480
"Hello, slut."

899
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,640
What are we-- what are you losers doing here?

900
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,600
Trying to fuck you.

901
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:05,720
I put my hand on his head and push him away and go,

902
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,120
try to get to know you first.

903
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,080
And then I push my head back in, and then fuck you.

904
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,720
And then I push back and say, and fuck you.

905
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,360
All anyone can hear is just the two megaphones

906
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,560
are too close to each other.

907
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,120
Would you just--

908
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,640
We have it on alarm.

909
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,640
That noise is making me howl and freak out.

910
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,640
I'm going crazy. I'm biting people's legs in the crowd.

911
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,640
He's screaming so I'm going like, "Oh jeez! Oh man!"

912
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,640
Okay, so she doesn't hear any of that. She just hears the siren. Two sirens a little bit off sync.

913
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:44,640
She puts the megaphone away and she says,

914
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,640
"Everybody, take five! Weirdos are here!" And she goes, "What do you two want?"

915
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,640
"Who the hell are you and what are you doing outside of my damn house?" "I wanna take five!"

916
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,440
This is not your house. This is the cigarette castle

917
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,380
God you're dead. You're smart

918
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,180
Just can you guys get out of here unless you're a part of the movement? Yeah, you're right. Let's get out of here

919
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:10,440
I'm actually a part of the movement - and like I'd really be interested in taking more of more of a leadership

920
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,840
You can roll persuasion you have - 10 persuasion against any women. Yes. Yes. Oh, yeah

921
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,840
She's really nervous

922
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,860
She's like so nervous. Okay

923
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:27,620
15. So you have five. She's like, what are you? You just kind of to her, it sounds like

924
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:33,740
you're saying, that's happened before. Yeah. And so what you were saying and then just

925
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:44,740
what is coming out. I try to just get the word movement out. Yeah. Join movement. Yeah,

926
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,740
Yeah, sure. Do you want me to get you a sign-up sheet?

927
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,740
I'd like to join you in some kind of movement.

928
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,740
Yeah, I got it, Jed. And she goes to get a sign-up sheet for you and hands it to you.

929
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:00,740
I mean, you're endearing yourself to her, even if you don't make any sense.

930
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:04,740
When I get it back, I kind of scratch the back of my head and smile.

931
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:08,740
Because that's what I can muster that up.

932
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,740
Yeah, we have different playbooks.

933
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:21,180
like yeah one of us is gonna use the van at the end of the day. Well okay if you join the

934
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:27,060
movement that's great but I still really can't let you in I mean. Into the castle?

935
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:32,140
Is this your house? No it's I mean well. Well then how come you can't just let me

936
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,220
in then? Well we're planning to we're planning the storm at the castle later

937
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:42,300
tonight if you want to join. But if not whatever. Can I take a quick sidebar

938
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:49,320
with Jed? Yeah, you can do that. Jed, I feel like one of us should be talking to her and

939
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:56,580
joining this running in on the castle while the other one tries to sneak in

940
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:02,700
before it happens. So like making a distraction? Yeah, sort of a

941
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:06,520
distraction and one of us kind of gets to stick back with this girl. So you want

942
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:13,320
to talk to her and maybe I go we have a great idea for a distraction well go

So the 18 plus...

00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,080
"I guess I gotta roll a performance."

965
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,580
Yeah!

966
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:12,580
You roll a performance.

00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:14,080
Roll a performance.

968
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,080

975
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:42,560
side are you see what we switch every minute we're doing it for 20 minutes

976
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,560
It's like you can see a cloud

977
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:50,800
Transparent cloud

978
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:58,000

00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:14,160
distracted. Everyone's distracted. Me and Vera. Including MJ. MJ's distracted too. And while MJ's looking the other way I pluck a piece of her hair out.

981
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,160
And we're gonna go into... and I'm gonna put that in my inventory. Yeah, add her hair. We're gonna sneak into one of the windows.

982
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:29,160
It'll be useful maybe. So really quickly, what's the... Sure. Can I find a point of entry here? So what you can do, you have a free like

983
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:36,160
investigation check to look around. I will say going through the front entrance because of the gatekeeper will still be hard to do.

984
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:42,940
This is where perhaps Denise, your feminine wiles could come into play and the gatekeepers penchant for fucking teens I guess also

985
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:45,480
How much time are they buying us?

986
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,120
It's really up to you guys. 20 minutes.

987
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,120
20 minutes.

988
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,120
I'm on all sorts of medication.

989
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,120
I can last a long time.

990
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,120
And I got that dog in me.

991
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,120
And everyone can't stop watching.

992
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:02,120
20 minutes there just transfixed.

993
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,120
It's like the Silencio scene.

994
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:11,720
So I'm it we're gonna bring so I guess we'll bring Denise - yeah, so we're gonna bring you up

Bring him to the gatekeeper and we go someone wants to talk to you to the gatekeeper and we push Denise

997
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:29,840

I remember if that's not enough she will take her clothes off. I don't want to keep trying.

1032
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,440
Somebody's telling me to not acknowledge her.

1033
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:33,940
Alright.

1034
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:34,440
Somewhere.

1035
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:40,240
Okay, I'll look I'll let you in you can just come into the come to the front area just don't go anywhere else.

1036
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:41,600
And so he he opens the gate.

1037
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,600
I'm coming, right now.

1038
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,600
We just want you to come into the front area.

1039
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,600
Right now outside I'm also coming into the front area.

1040
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,600
[Laughter]

1041
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,600
So he just lets you in so you're behind the gate.

1042
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:58,600
You two, you roll an investigation check, Vera.

1043
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:01,440
- Two.

1044
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,280
- That's bad.

1045
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,600
You roll one now.

1046
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,440
- Okay.

1047
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,600
- Oh wait, that's five.

1048
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,600
- Yeah, that's still not better.

1049
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:08,440
- Yeah.

1050
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,600
- I get, you said investigation?

1051
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:12,440
- That's right.

1052
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,600
- That's a 17.

1053
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:14,440
- Okay.

1054
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:15,600
- That's how it's done, lesbian.

1055
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
(dramatic music)

1056
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,600
- I stand down.

1057
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:21,360
(dramatic music)

1058
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,760
(dramatic music)

1059
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,800
- Oh, while all this is happening--

1060
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,640
- Cut back to you guys for a minute.

1061
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:31,280
- Yeah, we're done, and I opened up a pack of cigarettes

1062
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:34,080
to have a cigarette after this,

1063
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:36,720
and I get a golden ticket to the cigarette banter.

1064
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,200
(laughing)

1065
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:40,040
- Does not happen.

1066
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:41,920
Doesn't happen.

1067
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,560
- Blake, I found a golden ticket!

1068
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:46,080
I've got a golden ticket!

1069
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,560
- I'm smoking a bully stick.

1070
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,360
- You're smoking a what stick?

1071
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,800
- One of those dog sticks.

1072
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,640
(laughing)

1073
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:53,480
- Dog owners know.

1074
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:54,300
- They're raw.

1075
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,140
- Dog owners know.

1076
00:49:55,140 --> 00:49:55,980
- Dog owners know.

1077
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:56,800
- Wide bone.

1078
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,680
- Yeah, that's actually, it's a cow's penis or something.

1079
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,760
- Yeah, it's a bull's penis.

1080
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:00,680
- Okay, yeah.

1081
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,200
So you, with that 17, oh damn, yeah.

1082
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:09,200
You see iron, you see like iron, like,

1083
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,480
rungs on the side of the manor, on the back,

1084
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,720
going all the way up to the second floor,

1085
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,440
that look like they're meant to blend in,

1086
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,240
but you can see them pretty clearly.

1087
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,160
So you can use that to get in through a window up there

1088
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,800
where you see these pretty curtains.

1089
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,160
- I bring the girls and we go do that.

1090
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,600
But I go up, I sag my pants a little bit

1091
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,600
so that I show my butt crack to Denise.

1092
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,320
- Okay, cool. - And I like it.

1093
00:50:35,320 --> 00:50:37,080
- Okay, looks good. - That's right.

1094
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:39,200
- So are we going in with them?

1095
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:42,000
- Yeah, we realize that they're leaving.

1096
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,840
- I have a plan for you guys.

1097
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:44,960
- And we just try to walk in.

1098
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,080
- Okay, you say what? - I have a plan for you guys.

1099
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,400
- The guard goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1100
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,960
I can't I already let this little girl in I can't let you are you a little girl now. No, he's

1101
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:56,600
My reception

1102
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:05,880
I mean, I don't know. I don't how do I know that she's your daughter?

1103
00:51:15,240 --> 00:51:16,920
Okay, is she balding too?

1104
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,360
She's also balding!

1105
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:21,000
You can roll deception again with no penalty with your health.

1106
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,500
I...

1107
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,400
She's far away.

1108
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,380
I- I-

1109
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,560
She's just in the front yard.

1110
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,060
Oh.

1111
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:29,240
I stand up on my hind- I stand up on my hind legs,

1112
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,240
and I'm face to face with him,

1113
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:33,240
eyes to eyes, and I say,

1114
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:35,600
"I left my dog to win there!"

1115
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:40,840
*laughter*

1116
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:43,400
Okay, he saves against psychic damage.

1117
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:50,400
That was on saving against psychic damage, but now roll a Deceptor.

1118
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,400
Okay, that's a 10.

1119
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,400
Okay, yeah, he's like, "I don't know if I've ever seen you before."

1120
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,400
Like, I left my dog toy in there too!

1121
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,400
Do you know them?

1122
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:08,400
Yeah, these guys are my best friends.

1123
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,080
- Okay, yeah, with that he's like,

1124
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:11,960
all right, just fine, come here,

1125
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,960
I don't want these protestors to know.

1126
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,360
Just take care of your kid, I guess, or whatever.

1127
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:19,360
- He's like just looking at you, Scooby.

1128
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:21,520
- I'm looking his face, and he's getting

1129
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,480
an interesting taste.

1130
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:26,240
- Roll perception, also.

1131
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,080
- Okay.

1132
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:30,200
That's a 19.

1133
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,660
- Oh, wow, okay.

1134
00:52:31,660 --> 00:52:36,660
As you're looking his face, you get a look at his lapel,

1135
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,040
And you see his name there and it says George Dewey.

1136
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,040
That's just something you say.

1137
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,040
George Dewey?

1138
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,040
Good name.

1139
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:48,040
So, you guys enter in.

1140
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
I say, "Thank you, George Dewey."

1141
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:52,040
[Laughter]

1142
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,040
You guys get in there from the front.

1143
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,040
You guys are going from the back.

1144
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,040
So we're going to split this up a little bit in that case.

1145
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,040
Because you three are going in from the front.

1146
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,040
Or, yeah, and Velma,

1147
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,040
Vera, whoops,

1148
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,040
and Jed are going in from the back.

1149
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:11,880
Whoa, now that's an awesome episode of television. I wonder what's gonna happen next

1150
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:18,000
Whoa, I didn't see you there. Don't sneak up on me like that. It's Halloween
