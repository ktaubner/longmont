1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720
Yeah, yeah, you you put this down. Well, you dropped your phone at the same time as the

2
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:24,640
clap again, bitch. There we go. And another clap for Christmas, y'all. Try sinking that

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,720
slow clap for Christmas as disrespectful man. Slow clap is more respectful and

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,960
fast clap. No, it's not.

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:39,440
Sarcasm. No slow clap dude. No slow slow clap is sarcasm. So clap is no that's

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,480
because you guys are irony poison. No, it's like this like

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:49,160
you know that's well done. Well, yeah, if you say well done, well done and it

8
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,820
well, but that's that's an as our live well die. No, no, no, no, no, no, no,

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:58,860
no, a slow clap. As you do something, you think, oh my God, I fucked up. I

10
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:02,980
love I took the L no, and we hear one guy. You hear one guy near the back

11
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,940
yeah, but it has to rise stands up. If it turns into rupturous applause, then

12
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,980
it is not sarcastic, but if it is the okay, say this, say you know listen,

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,820
we're we're saying that with medians right, so imagine you're up there and

14
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,260
you say clap it up. If you all like movies and one guy and one guy just

15
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:22,700
like this,

16
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,180
you're doing a sarcastic face. I don't know

17
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,580
all you're doing all situations. Obviously it's not sarcastic. When you

18
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,380
say when we say a slow clap for Christmas, it's a respectful like God.

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:39,140
I can't even believe it. I'm a suit and tie. So tell me this business. You

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,100
mentioned the Grinch

21
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:44,300
and would if you said clap it up for Christmas, who in this place likes

22
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,880
Christmas. Do you think the Grinch would the normal clap or a

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,900
little anything would definitely

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:55,000
a slow clap? He would slow clap no, he would first of all, first of all, he

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,900
would not. First of all, nobody be able to tell he was slow clapping because

26
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,180
he'd say clap for Christmas. Everybody in the room was going nuts. Also, you

27
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:04,220
can hear his claps anyway, because the hands are made of her. He wouldn't

28
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,060
clap. Why would he would boo dude? He wouldn't slow clap. What are you

29
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,540
talking about? Depends on which a great at all depends on which part of the

30
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,460
movie you're at man.

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,540
that's true. I guess we liked Christmas. He might slow clap, so I made my point

32
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,140
yeah. I guess

33
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,940
what is that drink you're drinking? It smells

34
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:26,980
it smells of stinking perps perps. I don't know. I pick this is a fuck is

35
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:32,580
perps very super fruit organic energy. There's no GMO, no preservatives, no

36
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,580
glucose. It sounds pretty good. If they want no soy, if they want to give us a

37
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,460
Christmas gift perps perps yeah, I guess I have a picture of legs on. I does it

38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,200
I make you run okay, make you run fast. I guess I don't know check it out. It's

39
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,340
just a new energy thing. I'm trying. Oh, it's vegan. Oh, I see it's Kido

40
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,460
friendly. I seem pipe to fuck up off this perps. I wish I got a kid smells

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:59,300
crazy. I was like I can smell this okay and I'm I'm recovering from illness, so

42
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:03,220
I can't smell anything. I can smell the can. There's a little drop. There's a

43
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:07,220
little drop that's about to hit the thing. It's coming. It's coming out of

44
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,260
the can and getting to my nose. I think I was a taste like shit so bad from the

45
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:13,820
earth.

46
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,120
Perps unites nature and science to promote your life's health. We don't

47
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,280
make excuses. We do not jeopardize our standards. There we go man. See that is

48
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,420
some Christmas shit yeah, and you know what I was at the right to drink one

49
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,360
serving per day.

50
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,200
It has directions on the drink

51
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,620
directions, drink one serving per day, serve cold. Also

52
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:40,680
it says servings per container and then no number. I like that just says

53
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:45,160
servings per container, nothing else. Wow, I got it for myself as a little

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,040
Christmas gift. I'm so this I honestly guys last week we flopped on the first

55
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,760
week of Christmas because I couldn't get it done right because of extenuating

56
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,320
circumstances. So I mean can I just can I just say that a point I need to I

57
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,240
I need to come clean right now. I need to tell you guys that this past week I was

58
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,280
going through hell. I was being tortured. Yeah, I was being slaughtered alive,

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,160
okay, and I was staring the grim reaper in the face every second of my life.

60
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,520
When you looked at I grabbed him by the neck, I ripped his damn head off, oh

61
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:23,560
shit, and I put my fingers up as well. I didn't do that. I didn't do that, but

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,520
your fingers up his bones, but guys, I see it's not sarcastic or if you think

63
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,440
get sarcastic. Maybe you're so rude to me about this about my suffering man. I'm

64
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,680
trying to tell you is that God tried to strike me down before Christmas. He

65
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,720
tried to show me a reality where Christmas could be ruined by the

66
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,280
weakness of the flesh you got by the spoilage of the body, but my spirit rose

67
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,240
up and I literally returned to one hundred thousand percent strength after

68
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,360
recording and we're recording much a back of episodes. We're doing them on a

69
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,720
row, but the one we recorded yesterday, where I put the last was looking out.

70
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,720
I was very sick where I was very sick and my brain was addled yeah. We're we're

71
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,820
twenty four hours after that, maybe a magic and I'm I'm operating at one

72
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,620
hundred and fifty percent. He looks like Christian. You know what friendship has

73
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:14,360
restored me and my soul is thrumming. You know what like shit you sounded like

74
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,840
shit. I couldn't keep it together. You were still a basically and now I have

75
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:22,880
nothing but positivity, even the face of people being strangely weird to me right

76
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,720
you know I'm just clapping don't even you were you were talking about that more

77
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,880
than the club. I say I said that you I said okay before this before this you

78
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,020
looked sounded and acted like a pile of crap, but look at you now you were

79
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,020
visited by the ghost of sickness present. I became the ghost of Christmas

80
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:46,200
wow. I left my body. I got taken on a journey. You got turned into a scrooge

81
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,160
by sickness and then you had a miraculous turnaround. That's a I'd say

82
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,080
less of a scrooge, maybe more of a tiny tim you got turned in a tiny town

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:55,840
turned into

84
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,400
unfortunately, and then you were saved by that's that's one of the morals of a

85
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,460
Christmas Carol is that tiny tim is supposed to be the character you do.

86
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,360
Does tiny tim you're not supposed to ruin ruins Christmas? Yeah, he does

87
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,000
really for him at all. No, of course, not imagine him to get better, but what

88
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,800
if you what if you went over to your your family, you visit your family for

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,680
Christmas, you get you get there when your family was like

90
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,220
yeah great now Christmas isn't about Santa up bitch. I want to open up my

91
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,120
remote control. It's about on that's leg. Only business is now about on

92
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,600
Jeanette's leg. Yeah, yeah, exactly. If you go to your Christmas in America and

93
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
you have one cousin who's an eight year old British boy who's sick all the time

94
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,600
and has tiny legs, do that fuck out of here. Tim flick him over ruining

95
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,640
Christmas fucks me up. Does tiny Tim get cured at the end of that? Maybe no, he

96
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:49,500
he just gets a goose. Yeah, he's what is going to kill him for a goose. He's

97
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,500
still going to die goose or whatever that's a doose. He has some kind of he

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,300
has polio or

99
00:06:55,300 --> 00:07:01,060
just goes to show you the strength of capitalism. That's what it's all about.

100
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,160
That is true as fuck man yeah, and that's what's kind of disgusting to me

101
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,820
about this Christmas season. I don't want more than anybody. It's about

102
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,220
people wanting to be out for other people. Christmas is about toys and it's

103
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,200
about capitalism going to the mall for me. It's more about snow and only and

104
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,560
this is a point I wanted to make. I it's no this morning. I literally am so

105
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,440
excited about Christmas and so ready for this to be the first day of Christmas,

106
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,760
and then I walk outside to go get the decorations to decorate the set and you

107
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,840
guys did a great job. It started snowing. Thank you. It looks incredible.

108
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,080
It looks so festive. It looks amazingly festive and I'm going to put this tree

109
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,160
right in front of Patrick and I put it in front of you. It was in front of you.

110
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,500
you got fucking owned. You see my bow. I tied doesn't look is looks amazing,

111
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,840
really festive and beautiful. The tree isn't too big. This is the perfect spot

112
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,520
for it. Okay, if you want to have it that close to you, I look so festive.

113
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,760
You look amazingly cute. I'm not going to fucking lie. Look at me and Cameron

114
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,220
next to the tree and guys. When I woke up this morning, I stunk you stunk bad

115
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:04,280
stunk worse than I stunk in my entire life. You take a shower yeah. I showered

116
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,720
so it's cured and that's what I'm saying. I've literally been born again. This is

117
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,920
my shower this morning. I was in the shower all I could think about you know

118
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,960
your typical shower thoughts. You think what happens after we die? What happens

119
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,960
after we eat in inside of our body with the digestive system, this type of

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,360
thought scientific thoughts, this shower thought my only thought I could think

121
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,320
hallelujah. That's not a Christmas song, though

122
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:31,600
maybe not for you on earth. It's about yeah. What on heaven on earth?

123
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,320
Huh I'm sorry. I got distracted by Christmas is about Jesus Christ. Yeah,

124
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,160
Christmas is about Hallelujah is not about it's about some kind of

125
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:43,960
manger in Bethlehem. New cord I'm well. First of all, I are you thinking of a

126
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,520
different Hallelujah, because you were singing it just like Leonard Cohen's.

127
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,960
I'm singing that I'm singing it not because I was the shower didn't make me

128
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,480
think of Christmas. It made me be clean and think Hallelujah. I would have been

129
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,520
better if I shower made you think of Christmas.

130
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,440
Why? Because it's festive.

131
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,480
It would have made I think you were paying attention. You're just saying

132
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,820
but I got a strange thing. I got distracted by an ornament. The tree is

133
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,120
gonna come over here so that you can't touch it and be distracted by it anymore.

134
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,140
Got distracted by an ornament. That's okay.

135
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,540
We have so many amazing things planned for Christmas. I feel like that's

136
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,480
obvious. You know us. We have

137
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,440

00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,840

140
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:34,920

145
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:04,960
We stole a sack. I guess it'd be a crime actually, right? We did a crime.

146
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,720
We found it. Okay, we found it, allegedly. We found a sack of letters and I think

147
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
the bag said to the North Pole. The bag said directly to the North Pole

148
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
and it had a label on it. We're not gonna give the address out to the North Pole.

149
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,840
One Santas Lane. Come on, man. You can't dox. That is actually illegal. Yeah, that's

154
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,320
you're going to get us in trouble.

155
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,780
You're going to get us in trouble. Stop it

156
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:55,980
change it every year to try and hide from people. Yeah, they should

157
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,400
Can you imagine living in the Christmas zip code? So we all have letters here,

158
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,020
amazing letters that

159
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:11,720
we're hoping for Santa Claus and we will, I promise you, you know us, we will

160
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,620
eventually get these to the North Pole. Yeah, we'll get them where they're just

161
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,360
where they were kind of a middleman intermediary. We're always looking for

162
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,080
something to do for Christmas. So listen, if you intercept a sack full of

163
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:23,640
letters for Santa, you like to read them out. Yeah, exactly. Do whatever you want.

164
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,660
know it's fine. I mean we're just checking them for poison. How about

165
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:29,720
that? Yeah, because there might be some you know you should maybe some of

166
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,460
these Christmas wishes we could even help fulfill. Yeah, because what are

167
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,100
we but Santa's little helpers? Right, exactly. That's what I was saying. I'm

168
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,140
Santa's toy soldier. He can do with me what he wants. I'm Santa's street

169
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:46,980
soldier. All right, which one who wants to start? Let me see if this is I can

170
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,940
start. Okay.

171
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,860
Oh, this one is in Spanish. Hold on.

172
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:54,860
Wait, I have one too.

173
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,100
Hola, Santa.

174
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,460
Me llamo Jubio.

175
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,580
Para Navidad me gustaría

176
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:03,780
conocer a Kysonat.

177
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,780
Quiero salir con él.

178
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:09,860
And there's a little drawing.

179
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:13,820
That's so cute.

180
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Can you hold that up to the camera to show everybody?

181
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:15,820
Yeah, I'll hold it up to this.

182
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,140
Wow.

183
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,340
Who's that?

184
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:23,380
I guess that is Jubio and Kysonet.

185
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,380
Oh my God!

186
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,740
In front of the Christmas tree.

187
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,300
You guys look insanely happy.

188
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Yeah.

189
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,740
Holy shit, that's a Christmas miracle.

190
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,140
That kind of reminded me of this letter I have, man.

191
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,420
Oh, really?

192
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,380
Yeah, this is from Julio.

193
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,380
Oh!

194
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,380
Oh.

195
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,900
Dear Santa Claus.

196
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:45,940
Quiero que esta Navidad sea la mejor Navidad de todas.

197
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:52,180
Quiero un libro rojo grande, una tarjeta de biblioteca y un juguete sexual.

198
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:59,940
Quiero aprender de deleteriar y atarme los zapatos. Soy gay. Soy

199
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,700
soy estupido.

200
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:08,580
Atentamente, Julio Garcia.

201
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:12,380
Wow. Oh my goodness.

202
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,940
Can you say what you said in this letter and why you sent more than one?

203
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,580
I won a Nintendo switch.

204
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:27,580
I think it says I want a big red book. I want a

205
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:32,380
library card and I want a sexual toy.

206
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:36,780
Yep,

207
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,480
and something about shoes, but who knows

208
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,380
you have one? Yeah, Cameron, let's see yours.

209
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,480
Let me read one. Okay.

210
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,380
This one says,

211
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,680
dear Santa, I want a Funko pop for Christmas from the soy boy.

212
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,080
No,

213
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,080
rip that up right now. Get rid of that shit. Rip that shit. Get rid of that

214
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,180
shit. That one is not a, I know that's a federal crime. I know that's a

215
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,280
federal crime. I'm willing to go to jail for that. Uh-huh. That's going to,

216
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,380
that's, you go to jail. The soy boy? Really? You go to jail and you tell

217
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:19,580
Really, that's your name the soy boy you got a really your name you tell the highest

218
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:25,700
Level gang member that you ripped up the soy boys mail. They're gonna make you second-in-command. They're gonna respect your ass

219
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:33,100
That's immediate respect. You're kind of sick fuck. I'm changes their name to the soy boy. That's so disgusting to me

220
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:41,700
Kill him yeah, dude I have you know what we'll lift our spirits. I have a letter here that I can read okay

221
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,700
And I'm sure, oh look, there's a little, there's a tree and a heart on it.

222
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
That looks so cute already.

223
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Wow.

224
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Dear Santa, hello.

225
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
My name is Amy.

226
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,700
I am a 10 year old girl from Kansas City and I am so excited for Christmas this year.

227
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:02,700
This year has been, well, interesting to say the least.

228
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,700
My mom and dad divorced and my older sister is in the hospital for issues related to body image.

229
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,700
image. She throws up when she eats hamburgers.

230
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:17,180
This year has been so stressful for me and my family, and the only thing that

231
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:23,260
would make it better would be if Jubio from Podcast About List sang a Christmas

232
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:27,660
song. Oh my God. I love Jubio and so do all the other girls in my grade.

233
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,860
I even have a poster of him on my bedroom wall.

234
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,060
He talks to us in its Discord server called Jubio's Angels,

235
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,300
but he never sings to us.

236
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,780
If you could make that happen,

237
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,540
it would be a dream come true.

238
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,100
Thank you, Santa, love, Amy.

239
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,220
Now, Jubio, are you gonna sing a Christmas carol

240
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,520
for little Amy?

241
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,580
- Hello?

242
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,620
- No! - No?

243
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,460
- What?

244
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,700
- You're not gonna let this little girl's wish come true?

245
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:02,020
- Her sister's in the hospital for hamburgers.

246
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,940
- She has a hamburger throw-up disease.

247
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,440
and you won't even sing a Feliz Navidad.

248
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,780
That is messed up man. You can't even sing

249
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,460
O Tannenbaum for her. Sing O Tannenbaum. Come on. Sing O Tannenbaum.

250
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,300
Gotta be the best Christmas carol. We'll sing it with you.

251
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:26,320
O Tannenbaum, O Tannenbaum,

252
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,780
blibli, blibli, blibli Germany.

253
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:38,280
when air is snide. You actually know I know one word. Yeah. Well, it seems to

254
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:42,400
know one line. Jubio is fully grinching out on us today. Jubio is being a

255
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,040
complete green using to sing to one of his little also what's his deal does a

256
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,800
little a Jubio Jubio angels discord server. I want to shut that down man.

257
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,240
Yeah, we've told you that's not okay to do man.

258
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,540
Are you there?

259
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,440
Okay, I have a let's see I got away

260
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,800
this is also from

261
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,880
from a little from a little one. Oh

262
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,120
yeah, how sweet is that? It seems like we've taken a lot. These are a lot of

263
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,640
from kids. Yeah, yeah, it's weird that we didn't get that many adults in our

264
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:21,400
letters. Kind of weird right? Yeah, I feel like mostly kids. It makes sense.

265
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,400
This is from little Ben. Oh, okay.

266
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,200
Hello, Santa.

267
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,120
This year, the only thing I want for Christmas is world peace.

268
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
Aww, little Ben.

269
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,120
Oh my god, that's so cute.

270
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:40,680
War, disease, social disorder.

271
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,480
How could I sit here and wish for big red fire trucks or super powered action figures

272
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,280
when some people are struggling just to afford basic human needs?

273
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,860
What a smart kid.

274
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,640
It would just be selfish.

275
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,120
And that's the problem with this world.

276
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,520
Selfishness.

277
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,560
British corporate CEOs and money hungry politicians hogging all the wealth up

278
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,320
top and leaving the little guy with nothing a little bit all the way at the

279
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,080
bottom. He's probably referring to himself or his family as well. At least

280
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,400
is he related to Big Ben.

281
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,480
He could be a clock

282
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,280
all the way at the bottom. I just wish I could do something about it. You know

283
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,160
what Santa I finally decided what I want for Christmas. I want a voice.

284
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,920
I want a say in what direction the winds of change blow

285
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:31,260
a say in the future that I'm inherited. When I grow up, I'm going to run for

286
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:36,040
President. Wow, and I'll make sure that never again does another immigrant enter

287
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:36,660
this country

288
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:42,140
into this country illegally to impregnate a white woman.

289
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,840
Little bit,

290
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,740
what the hell are you saying? Right now, I'm thirty one, so I should be able to

291
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,760
run for President by twenty twenty eight, and when I'm President, every border of

292
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,660
this country will be protected by nuclear bombs and big red fire trucks

293
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:00,620
to put it into you illegally flying over the border. Go back to your igloo,

294
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,420
you disgusting red snow pig. Holy shit, little Ben, what the little as what a

295
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:10,380
turn little Ben has made. I didn't know you were a grown man going by little

296
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:14,420
Ben. I mean his first name could be little like a little John little John

297
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,740
little Richard. I don't know. Yeah, little Wayne. There's actually there

298
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,100
might be more little more

299
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:25,720
at least in pop culture. That's so true little bins. You seem like a bastard

300
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,720
man. Yeah, but what I don't understand it seemed at first, maybe he was

301
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,500
maybe I guess at the end I was kind of curious whether he was just racist

302
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,040
against people from the North Pole or if he maybe also was having some. I

303
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:40,880
think he's racist against every well. He said another immigrant illegally

304
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,900
entering the country to impregnate a white woman. Yeah, so I thought I don't

305
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,260
think that I was like Santa's done that, but I say it could be an elf. I'll

306
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:54,200
say it that letter gave me the Ick. Do we know where Mrs. Claus is from? Yeah,

307
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:58,700
we Mrs. to Mr. Mastigations. We'd found that out years ago, but I don't

308
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:03,900
remember it. She's got to be from America. She's from someplace, so I don't

309
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,140
know.

310
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:05,580
Okay,

311
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,540
I got another one here.

312
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:17,100
Dear Santa Claus for Christmas, I want to be a bad bitch right now. I'm a mid

313
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:23,360
and I'm barely have a get. I want a BBL so I can twerk. I need to have big butt and

314
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:28,780
boob Riz. I'm practically an MPC right now. Oh no, but I want to level up my

315
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:33,320
body. I want to be a baddie with a bubble body and that is from Taylor

316
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,420
Swift. Oh Taylor T Swizzle. It could honestly that does kind of break my

317
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:41,020
heart. They know that Taylor Swift thinks that about herself when she's one

318
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:45,020
of the most telling women on the world are the baddest bitch in the universe.

319
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:49,400
okay, you already have a bubble body girl. You look like a bubble. You look

320
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,000
like a bubble. You are honestly borderline like fat to me, Taylor Swift.

321
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,880
You look disgusting. You're your get is there it's there it's there it's there.

322
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,940
You don't need to improve that thing. You look this is where your is this is

323
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:05,840
where you think it is and you're hardly an MPC. You're the man of the year.

324
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,820
You're literally you are the man of the year. You're a character. You are a

325
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,500
time man of the year, so don't beat yourself up over that shiz okay, Santa

326
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,840
I can't give you that by the way Taylor Swift and you shouldn't be writing to

327
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,480
Santa either. No, you should be writing to a doctor in Beverly Hills because

328
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,280
that's where you can get that done. Yeah true or you go overseas and you have to

329
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:29,520
sit on the plane backwards. Yeah, I mean usually that happens. I have a letter

330
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:36,880
here. It looks like it's from a little boy. Yes, it is from a little boy and it

331
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,640
says what you can tell just by the handwriting. Yes, I can tell by the

332
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:45,680
handwriting. It looks very juvenile. Yeah, it looks like shit. I can tell some, but nobody

333
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,560
who went to his finished primary school wrote this letter. There's no way. Absolutely no

334
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:59,320
way. It looks terrible. Hello, Santa. My name, Pepper Donaldson. I five year old for Christmas.

335
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,280
I want blood.

336
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,720
I have no blood.

337
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,080
No blood in body.

338
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,520
I live on machine.

339
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,120
Machine Mac blood in my body.

340
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,840
Mommy, daddy cry a lot.

341
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,280
Hospital expensive.

342
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,320
I like Paw Patrol.

343
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,200
Paw Patrol.

344
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,520
Doctor said it should not be live for Christmas.

345
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,720
I want blood and Paw Patrol toy.

346
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,840
And that's from Pepper.

347
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,280
And it looks like someone drew a pepper for him.

348
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,920
Let me look at... Hello Santa, my name is Pepper, 15 years old.

349
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,920
Fifteen?

350
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,920
O.D.E.

351
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,240
It looks like 15.

352
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,440
I think it's I, 5 year old.

353
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Well let's just say it's 15.

354
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Yeah, it probably seems 15.

355
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,440
And he wants blood.

356
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,440
So this guy...

357
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:50,440
He has no blood in his body and he lives off of a machine it looks like.

358
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:55,440
And pauportal, I'm guessing he means...

359
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,280
whose pepper. Let me give you some advice, buddy. If you're writing a

360
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:03,280
Santa and you're asking for a present, do not put in your letter that you're

361
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,840
going to be dead before Christmas. You just fucked up. Santa is not going to be

362
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:10,100
giving you. I got a way should say is I'm going to be a doctor said I'll be

363
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,920
alive for two hundred more Christmas exactly and actually I need to get it

364
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,740
all in advance. Oh yeah, wait, doctor actually said that for me. I have a

365
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,560
medical condition or Christmas is every day.

366
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:23,960
I have hello. I have a mental. I should have I should have gotten that letter.

367
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,780
I have a I have a mental disorder where I think every day

368
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,180
I mean toys every day or I'll get really toys every single day or I think you

369
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:39,460
abandoned me Santa yeah. Well, that's or I guess my brain will break. Can we talk

370
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:43,700
some real shit? Have you all ever gotten coal for real? No yeah, my parents used

371
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,380
to give potatoes because it was cheaper, cheaper than coal London. We could just

372
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:52,880
use the potatoes to make mash potatoes for dinner after wait. Your parents gave

373
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:59,400
potato for Christmas? If it was like you were bad this year, if they wanted to

374
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:03,160
make the joke like oh you were bad you get instead of coal Santa gives out

375
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,120
potatoes because coal is expensive. Your parents convinced you that you were bad?

376
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,960
They would tell me that I was bad sometimes yes. Only on some years?

377
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,920
They would tell me I was bad sometimes yes. They would tell me I was bad some

378
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,920
years on Christmas yes. It feels abusive man. I don't know I feel like it's

379
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,320
it's it's supposed to teach you. I mean maybe it's just an Irish Catholic that

380
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,680
you get potatoes. If you're bad potatoes aren't so bad yeah, I mean I like it's

381
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,560
not like they give you potatoes and they in place of another gift. I think that's

382
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,840
what it was. I think that's what they probably wanted you to think it was.

383
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,000
Well, they never got any of my presence either way. Well, you know Santa doesn't

384
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,440
wrap presents. Yeah, some in the living room. Yeah, how's he going to wrap that's

385
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,960
normal? You can't wrap a treadmill. Yeah, they're not going to wrap a flex and

386
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,240
wrap the potato. Adjustable dumbbells. He's not going to wrap all that shit.

387
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,120
I think they continued doing that. I think they gave my niece and my nephew's

388
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:58,160
potatoes this year, and I think they cried. I would fucking cry. That's fine.

389
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:01,400
It's a funny joke. It's good. I don't think that's funny. You can't do that

390
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,800
shit to a kid. You can't give them a potato. No, you can't. You can give them

391
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,560
a potato. That's fucked up. I draw a hard line. No, fuck that. You're getting

392
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:13,120
toys and only things that will make you smile. A kid doesn't need a potato.

393
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,120
you're not going to teach that

394
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:20,060
when you say no toys on Christmas. No, you give them all the toys and then you

395
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:23,240
give one potato at the beginning or something and it's be like to do what

396
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:27,060
you think pranks are funny. Yes, what the hell is a Christmas? I guess it

397
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:30,800
must be a Christmas prank. It's a Christmas prank. That's not funny man to

398
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:35,240
tell your kid. This is a this is the one reason kids are alive. Yeah, you

399
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:39,180
shouldn't say that you don't say you say you say you tell them it was a prank.

400
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,060
You say, oh, I got you. Oh, I got you. Christmas should be you don't say you

401
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,200
got this because you were bad a bag at that point. That's when it that's

402
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:51,320
wrong. That's what my parents do yeah. They would say you got that because you

403
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:51,880
were bad.

404
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:56,280
I think they were trying to teach me that this is pure abuse. Yeah, you are

405
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,980
purely abused. I must have been completely and I bet you didn't even get

406
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,440
to make French fries out of the potato. No, I bet you had to get baked. I think

407
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,720
that they were right old potatoes yeah well with the black spots all over. I

408
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,160
think they were moldy and it's sprouting yeah. I just think that Christmas

409
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:17,120
should be a candy, a DVD and a lottery ticket. That's I can't wait to get

410
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,260
that's a grown man Christmas. I want to get a lottery tickets every my

411
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,440
every I never got a lot of since I was like ten years old. I got lottery

412
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,180
tickets for I would just get started. I take it on every Christmas, but the

413
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,100
royal. Did you have a rule that if it was over if somebody got over a

414
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,080
thousand dollars, we had to split it with the whole family? Yes, I always

415
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,440
thought that was you said you never got lottery tickets. Why are you

416
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,980
I mean lottery tickets in general, when other

417
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:43,780
family or the July.

418
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,580
I can see that I don't do I've never heard of that one ever. Well, you're to

419
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,180
be fair. You're the only other person I've ever met who got lottery tickets

420
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:54,080
growing up at Christmas. No, there's I've met other people who do that too.

421
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,180
I'm sure you have what I said is you're the only person,

422
00:26:56,180 --> 00:27:01,280
but you've never met anybody's even mentioned doing on her fourth of July,

423
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,680
never even once. It's all right. I've never even considered that it could be

424
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,240
It's just a thing that your dad does because he just bought a bunch of beer.

425
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
So he's like, "All right, fuck it.

426
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,560
I'll get lotto tickets too.

427
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
We'll see what happens."

428
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
That's what Christmas is.

429
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,480
Your dad buys a bunch of beer for Christmas too.

430
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
No.

431
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,560
I had to hide beer from my uncles.

432
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,280
We did mimosas at Christmas.

433
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:21,760
Yeah, that's what my aunt does.

434
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,760
That's fun, man.

435
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,400
I usually do coffee cake and coffee.

436
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,600
So you're more uppers.

437
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,720
My family's more downers.

438
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,720
I like that.

439
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,720
All right.

440
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
What's your next letter?

441
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
Let me see.

442
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,720
Let me see. Let's see. That was a really short one.

443
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
Okay.

444
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:47,720
Dear Santa, me and my co-workers Walter and Ahmed would really like a girl puppet

445
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
this year. Love, Peanut.

446
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,720
I wonder who that's from.

447
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,720
There's no last name.

448
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,720
It sounds like it's from Peanut.

449
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,720
There's no last name at all. It just says, "Love, Peanut."

450
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Huh.

451
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Huh, that's an interesting one.

452
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
It's interesting. It is interesting.

453
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,180
I like this guy's got to be an adult because it was straight to the point.

454
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:03,420
No,

455
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:08,960
doesn't work. Oh, I live on a machine. Yeah, shut the fuck up man. All right,

456
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,840
straight to the point.

457
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,740
Here's one

458
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:19,080
dear Santa Claus. Here's a list of things I want for Christmas and straight

459
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:19,740
to the point again.

460
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,480
One a Santa hat and outfit. That's cute. He wants to be like his hero. Yeah,

461
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,860
2. Some strands of your hair, both head and beard.

462
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,860
What?

463
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
Well, to make more-

464
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
3. A cloning machine.

465
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:38,860
4. A house key to your palace in North Pole City.

466
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
5. Your federal ID.

467
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,860
6. One minute audio sample of your voice with minimal background noise.

468
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,860
7. Itemized list of your daily diet.

469
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:55,860
And 8. Tooth Toons style fleshlight that plays music when you fuck it.

470
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,120
(laughing)

471
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,340
- That doesn't seem like it has anything to do with it.

472
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,180
- Yeah.

473
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,660
- It seemed like it was kind of on a through line.

474
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,500
- It looks like a Mrs. Claus fleshlight.

475
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,700
- Oh, that's nasty, bro.

476
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,540
Why would you even say that?

477
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,700
- You say flush light?

478
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,200
- I said fleshlight.

479
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,220
- I think you said flush light.

480
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,860
- I said Mrs. Claus fleshlight.

481
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,060
- Some kind of toilet fleshlight.

482
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,460
- I don't know that that even exists, though, does it?

483
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,140
- Do they have a Mrs. Claus fleshlight?

484
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:17,980
- No.

485
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:19,540
- I'm just talking about a musical two tunes fleshlight.

486
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:22,380
- I mean, I guess there's songs that I would like to fuck.

487
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,660
- If it's the same as the two tunes songs.

488
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,160
S and M by Rihanna. I would fuck that song. It's the same as the tooth tune

489
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,020
songs. It's got to be like

490
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:39,660
from your son's room. It is like a fate like really low quality speaker.

491
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,080
You hear the song and it just yeah, but you hear it going like

492
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:46,280
rock like

493
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:52,060
and then you walk in and he's fucking like when you hold your phone up with

494
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,600
speakers and go like oh yeah and he's fucking the back of the do around the

495
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:58,580
world. It could be like a giant. It could be like it could look like a giant

496
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,820
cow's tongue. If there's a kiss one and you

497
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:02,820
you know,

498
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,220
I've always thought those things could probably be flesh lights. Yeah. Cow's

499
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,420
tongues are huge man. That's true. Not that that's

500
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:14,380
requisite for you. So that's true. That's true. A cow tongue is huge. They

501
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:14,900
are huge.

502
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,220
That's true.

503
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,900
All right, I'm going to read this next letter. This next letter has a picture

504
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:24,700
it. Why you seem so scared of showing it to me? Hello, my name is Ryan. I'm looking

505
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,100
at the popular podcast beers. We drink here is a picture of me for Christmas. I

506
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:29,860
want a beer.

507
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:37,140
Wow, you know what Rex you really look like you look amazing. Like famous

508
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:41,180
comedian and hold it from the top political activists. Brett Gelman. I'm

509
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,140
going to be honest with you. Rex.

510
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Jesus Christ, is this what he looks like?

511
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
You know what the title of that article was?

512
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
Let me pull it up real quick.

513
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
Can I see the picture?

514
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,300
Sorry I'm obsessive.

515
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,300
The title of the article where I found that photo was...

516
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
Oh shit, I screenshotted it for sure.

517
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
Ice cream shotted it?

518
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
I screenshotted it.

519
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
This is a People Magazine headline

520
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
where that photo is from.

521
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Stranger Things, Brett Gelman praises his

522
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
really impressive young co-stars.

523
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
(Laughter)

524
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,540
(laughter)

525
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,380
- Wow.

526
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:18,220
- Oh man.

527
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,500
- What an amazing, dude, imagine how amazing

528
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,900
it would be for him to be your mentor.

529
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,340
- Oh my god, imagine, imagine Jaddy coming up to you.

530
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,260
- Yes, dude.

531
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,140
- Oh my god.

532
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,260
- He says, you wanna go break into the nerd melt

533
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,780
and we can smell the stage?

534
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,620
- Yeah.

535
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:34,440
- Yes.

536
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,280
- That would be awesome.

537
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,980
- Oh my god, Jonah Ray once performed here, man.

538
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,820
(sniffing)

539
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:39,980
- Kumail!

540
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,260
- Oh my god, Kumail and Jonah Ray performed here.

541
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:48,380
I mean you guys are talking about this and all you know, but you guys do realize that

542
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,380
we lost him who he supports Israel.

543
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:55,420
Brett Gelman, Brett Gelman supports Israel.

544
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,940
Why would he support Israel?

545
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,460
He does no dog in that fight.

546
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:04,420
We lost him to the right to the to the right, the fascistic right, the fascistic right.

547
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
We lost him.

548
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:12,580
I bloody is he and I'm sitting here like I'm sitting I'm over here like how am I ever going

549
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,720
to enjoy a piece of media with Brett Gellman in it ever again. How am I going to watch

550
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,940
Stranger Things with no one? I'm going to get no joy out of seeing Brett Gellman on

551
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:26,940
TV anymore. I'm not going to be able to smile and laugh. Dude, how am I going to get through

552
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:32,540
that one part and the other guys now? That's going to be hard as fuck. How am I going to

553
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:36,700
get through his Mickey Mouse blackface performance? This is going to be really tough for me. I

554
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,340
just really hope that he, at this point in his career, he stays the fuck away from Tim

555
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:47,860
Heidecker. Please don't do it to Tim man. Get away from him. If you were thinking of politically

556
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:52,900
corrupting Tim Heidecker. Get the fuck away from office hours right now. If I ever see

557
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:57,820
you on office hours, I will not fucking hesitate. I swear to God. I will not fucking hesitate.

558
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,420
I'm going to do a flip at you. Straight up. Jackie Chan style. I'm going to spin on you.

559
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:07,540
I'll spin on you man. Spin on you literally. What are you guys asking Santa for Christmas

560
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:11,340
this is you. We should wait on that. That's a that's all that's a whole new

561
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:15,060
episode. That's a whole not or at least I don't know. Well, I guess I'm asking him

562
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:19,020
for nothing because I don't need anything because I'm so blessed. Yeah, me

563
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,300
too. I think I'm completely blessed. Both of you, you don't want like money.

564
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,660
Like I'm asking for money. Okay, money. Yeah, I'll do money. You can't okay, so

565
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,580
you can't copy first. I'll get one of the rules. I want the money that Caleb. I

566
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,180
want whatever Caleb is going to get.

567
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,980
Should I just read this next letter?

568
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
Yeah.

569
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
It looks pretty quick.

570
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:38,980
It looks pretty short.

571
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,640
"Dear Santa, for Christmas I want gold.

572
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
Gold member."

573
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
Okay.

574
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,640
That's all it says.

575
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,380
And it's interesting.

576
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,380
It kind of went...

577
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,860
Oh, it's written in gold font.

578
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:55,420
It really looks like silver, more silver to me.

579
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
But...

580
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
No, if you look in the light...

581
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
Yeah, if you want to call that gold.

582
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,460
Yeah, if you look in the light, well, that's where the colored pencil sits.

583
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
That's cute.

584
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,460
Oh, go ahead.

585
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
Me?

586
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,460
Yeah.

587
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:07,460
Oh, you have three letters in there.

588
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,460
That's really just two.

589
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,460
Oh.

590
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Wow, this one's all typed up.

591
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,460
Looking crazy.

592
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,460
"Dear Mr. Claus, Rhee, Notice of IRS Audit.

593
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,460
We hope this letter finds you well.

594
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,460
The Internal Revenue Service has identified you as a potential beneficiary of the IRS

595

We are grateful for your assistance.

607
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:31,980
Re, notice of IRS audit. We hope this letter finds you well. The Internal Revenue Service

608
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:36,540
has identified your unique TIN, commonly known as your SSN, in connection with the annual

609
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,380
tax return filing. The letter serves as an official notice of our intent to conduct an

610
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:44,420
audit of your tax return for the tax year 2023 under the provisions of the Internal

611
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,940
Revenue Code. The IRS has noted certain discrepancies in the reported income and deductions on your

612
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:52,700
tax return, and we believe the thorough examination is necessary to ensure compliance with the

613
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:59,100
tax laws of the United States, specific areas of concern include classification of gifts.

614
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,420
I could see that happening.

615
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
Oh yeah.

616
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:05,160
Please provide detailed documentation supporting the classification of gifts as non-taxable

617
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,420
including a list of recipients, the nature of the gifts and their fair market value,

618
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,580
eligibility for charitable deductions and business expenses.

619
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:16,700
Please submit requested documentation within 30 days of receiving this notice.

620
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:21,300
I probably need to forward this one.

621
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:24,300
Sincerely Bearish Gretzky, IRS Auditor.

622
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:29,100
That's a crazy name.

623
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,460
Bearish Gretzky, IRS Auditor, Internal Revenue Service.

624
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,700
We appreciate your prompting.

625
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,700
Bearish Gretzky?

626
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:35,700
Bearish Gretzky.

627
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,060
That's an odd name.

628
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,300
It is an odd name.

629
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,900
I wouldn't think that, I mean I guess Santa's in some kind of trouble at the IRS, but he's

630
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,700
not a citizen of the US.

631
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
No.

632
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:50,020
Maybe he has a home here in Boca Raton.

633
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,520
Is Boca Raton in the U.S.?

634
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Yes.

635
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Where is that?

636
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Florida.

637
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Really?

638
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Where do you think he vacations?

639
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
But it's named Boca.

640
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
Or it's Boca.

641
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
Boca Deez Nuts.

642
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Oh, shit.

643
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
Oh, snap.

644
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,100
It's a Christmas miracle, y'all.

645
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,460
We destroyed Cameron on his own track.

646
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:08,460
No, no, no.

647
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,820
This isn't my track.

648
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:12,020
You have the tracks in front of you, bro.

649
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,180
And barely in front of me.

650
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:14,420
They're right in front of you right now.

651
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,960
No, this is our track man. No, this is Santa's track. All right, read your damn

652
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,640
letter, bro. Yeah, shut the fuck up and read. Shut up and read that letter.

653
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,480
Wait, guys, should I read my letter? Yeah, yeah, that's what we're telling

654
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,460
you. That's Patrick, my impression of Patrick. Oh, damn. Oh, shit. That is

655
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,460
fire. All right, I might have been destroyed. Here's my impression of

656
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:36,520
Patrick. Look at my, I have the stupidest Santa hat of anybody. You bought it for

657
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,580
me. I picked it myself and bought it for myself. You threw it at me and said,

658
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:45,480
here it goes dear Santa Claus. I want a puppy for Christmas, but not just any

659
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:49,440
puppy. I want a puppy that is the size of a quarter. It's so small that it just

660
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,400
floats around the room and I have to catch it in a cup. If I want to pet it, I

661
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,000
have to feed it tiny amounts of food. I assumed when I asked for a puppy last

662
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,800
year, you would know have known I wanted a small coin sized one, but you brought

663
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,360
me a normal sized one. This time bring me a tiny puppy. Make sure the puppy is

664
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,340
really, really small. It's better for it to be small. That's from micro

665
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:18,160
seems like he was a little upset about it. The last he was a little up.

666
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,960
I forgot about micro.

667
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:28,000
I hope he's doing okay. I hope my girls okay. I hope my girl didn't get stuck in

668
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,400
the vacuum or something God, my girl. No, I can you imagine how what a

669
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,400
nightmare that must be for him. They have a normal sized, but I mean not a

670
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:38,640
puppies one thing because it gets there and it's it's a probably a big for

671
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,660
yeah, but then it gets even bigger. Yeah, yeah, yeah, probably when you get a

672
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,900
bull mastiff or something. Imagine how long it takes him to feed the dog.

673
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,840
Imagine a dog. It's like mining one piece of kibble at a time out of the

674
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,880
that dog is going to just think he's a he's a flea. Exactly. He's probably

675
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:56,960
going to kick him around in the dog's poop. Not that I would want to say not

676
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,880
that I like that or want to see a picture. No, I would not want to see

677
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:04,560
micro covered in poop. I had to take a turd out of Phil's asshole last night.

678
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,740
I had to do that to myself before yeah.

679
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,820
Did you eat a tennis ball

680
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,300
and I got stuck

681
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,400
halfway in

682
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:15,420
it doesn't happen to bill

683
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:19,780
yet a tennis ball and I and dude it sucks whenever he eats a toy like that

684
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,720
I just know I'm going to have to finger my dog

685
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,220
like twenty four hours. I'm going to be on the street and I'm going to have my

686
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:31,780
finger with a bag. Obviously, yeah, in my dog's asshole, pulling this out of his

687
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,920
yes, I can't digest tennis yeah stuff yeah. I don't think most of the

688
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,900
he's a red blooded American

689
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:47,800
that might work. He might be able to eat a football, but a tennis ball. He's not

690
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,200
a poodle. No way, no how

691
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,780
this next letter here. This one is actually this is a typed out one

692
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:05,160
type shit. Santa, I don't know what to do and I am hoping for a miracle. I am 32 years old

693
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:11,420
and I lost everything. In 2020 I put $43,000 into the GameStop short squeeze plus the rest

694
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:16,020
of my savings into Dogecoin due to some bad advice from a subreddit, my only friend who

695
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,600
I no longer associated with. My stupidity cost me everything. I lost it all and I haven't

696
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,420
been able to bounce back since. I lost my boyfriend, my apartment, everything. I had

697
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:31,620
to move back in with my parents. They hate my guts. Every day I feel them glaring at me,

698
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:36,860
looking at the failure of a son they have created. A waste of precious life. I started working

699
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:42,780
at, ironically, a GameStop two towns over. I hate it. I hate driving there. Every single

700
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,940
day I think about how stupid I am. Some days when I'm driving to work, I imagine veering

701
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:52,800
into the oncoming lane, hoping a semi hits me. I hope the windshield shatters and the

702
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,400
glass explodes into my face. I hope that the impact does not kill me. I hope that I have

703
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,500
to endure the pain until I eventually succumb to my injuries. I know that I will never do

704
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,580
it as I am a coward.

705
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:12,360
That's it?

706
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,120
For Christmas this year I want a realistic action figure of Cameron Fetter with realistic

707
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:19,760
hair that I can brush and I can undress him and play with him and have him go on adventures

708
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,760
with my Spider-Man from William Huxtable.

709
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,280
Oh, hey, that's actually kind of flattering that he wants. Yeah, and I mean to put me

710
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:36,760
in the same league as Spider-Man, brush your hair and wait and I got a hang on a Spider-Man.

711
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:44,080
Okay, he thinks I'm Spider-Man's friend. You would if you look that up as a W, you would

712
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,400
you'd have a brush included with your action figure.

713
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Yeah. Yo, you definitely would.

714
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,400
Nah, dude, I'd have two AK-47s.

715
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,900
Ooh.

716
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,400
And a brush.

717
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
That'd be dope.

718
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,400
Yeah, maybe a brush, the AK-47.

719
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,400
A toy that comes with two AK-47s and a bazooka and a...

720
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,400
(laughter)

721
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,400
That'd be cool as fuck, dude.

722
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
What kind of toy would you be, Pat?

723
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,400
I would probably...

724
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,400
I feel like you'd be one of the stretchy ones.

725
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,400
No, no, no, no.

726
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,400
You'd be one of the ones that you could throw on the ceiling of the classroom

727
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,140
I think I rescue hero that's on sale. Yeah, one of those you wouldn't be a

728
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,600
rescue hero. I think I would be a rescue here. You have no you're the least brave

729
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,900
person I've ever met. You're a complete coward. There's

730
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,160
see he flinched. No, I didn't. Yeah, I flinched it. Yeah, he went. Are you are

731
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,920
you really trying to say that you're the I'm the one that gets scared of noises?

732
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,460
He's

733
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:37,920
you just opened up a can of worms. You don't want to open open up a can of

734
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,260
fucking

735
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:44,460
you both are your guys are just both scaring me stop. I'm sorry I got I just

736
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,740
got scared, but it's not fair because I'm getting scared every time by each of

737
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,060
you guys. I'm getting double the scares. That's true. That's not fair and it's

738
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,960
not all right, not even part of this. Let's remedy. Let's hear another. You

739
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,100
wouldn't be a rescue hero, though you would be a bouncy ball.

740
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,580
I would not be a bouncy.

741
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:03,740
No, I would not be a bouncy ball with a star on it.

742
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:09,720
would not be the Pixar Bouncy Ball. You'll be a dog toy with a star on

743
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,860
your belly. I would maybe be a dog toy. I could see that

744
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:17,480
people would complain. They would buy your toy. They'd be like I thought it

745
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:20,020
was fully articulated, but the hands are stuck to the

746
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:23,900
my kid hates this

747
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:30,420
my kid hates this toy. Why are the arms stuck on the

748
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:38,100
I hate this time. My kid sees this door on the shelf. He starts crying. It's

749
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:42,800
screaming. I had a toy like that and then I did have a way like that. My on

750
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,880
my aunt got me this toy. I forget what it was called. I know what it looks

751
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,100
like. It's like a little boy that has like a big bugger coming out of it and

752
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,520
you like squeeze down on its head and just says like annoying shit and one

753
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,120
time it like was like the most annoying toy and it just like had like a big like

754
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,640
droopy booger and I remember waking up in the middle of the night and seeing

755
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:05,060
it's just silhouette and I was like six or seven, but seeing it silhouette

756
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:09,400
scared the shit out of me and I made my mom throw, I like cried and then made

757
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,900
my mom take it out of the bedroom and throw it away 'cause it was so scary.

758
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,820
Reminds me of garbage pill 'cause I hated those things. I was never scared

759
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:21,180
of a toy. That's, and I'm sorry to say this, that's a younger sibling thing.

760
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:26,220
Yeah. Well, I'm a middle child. I'm a middle boy. I was not scared of any

761
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,660
toy either. I'm not the youngest though. Younger, I said. What kind of toy do

762
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,160
you have that scares you. How can you be scared of a toy? How can you be scared

763
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:37,860
of a bugger? You were scared of a bugger? You were a bugger, motherfucker. I was

764
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,380
afraid of the silhouette of it. It looked like a little guy staring at me.

765
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:43,380
It is a little guy. It was, it actually was. And he was probably pointed in

766
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:46,480
your direction. What do you mean the silhouette? You had him backlit all the

767
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,420
time against a wall? Well, it was like a window. No, see, I know what he's

768
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:53,040
talking about, 'cause I saw the silhouette of my toys when I was going

769
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,920
to sleep, but they would just excite me. Yeah. I just talked to them. You would

770
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,940
think that they were moving at night, right? Yeah, I would think they were

771
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,820
moving around. Well, okay, all the all the cool ones that I like all the ones

772
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:06,100
that I like, you would want them to move around. Yeah, but the scary ones like a

773
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:10,100
little boy with a bugger in my head. I think in my head I hated that toy so

774
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,140
much that I looked for a reason to get rid of it. Yeah, but that thing I'm

775
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,540
scared. Yeah, I just told my mom that it scares me and I don't want it anymore,

776
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,660
even though it was just like, oh, I don't want to play with the bugger. I was

777
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:23,980
scared of the egg stealer from Dragon Tales. I had to hide the egg dealer,

778
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:28,140
egg stealer, oh, stealer, egg stealer, because imagine how hard those dragons

779
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:33,020
Nebulizer eggs man you're scared of the nebulizer. I mean that is a scare. It sounds like an alien

780
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,260
Yeah, I was I was scared of my nebulizer then nebulizer

781
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:41,900
Scary name I only have one more letter, but I'm gonna read mine. I can give you one of mine

782
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:45,780
Fuck it man. I have tween

783
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:56,980
Fucking great what little bin again man. Oh he double texted Santa. I don't want to hear from this guy. I forgot to

784
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:02,960
I forgot to wish for this in the last letter, but for Christmas I want every single homo to go to jail.

785
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:09,360
First they ruined my favorite movie Rocky Horror Picture Show. Then they ruined my favorite singer Janelle Monáe.

786
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:16,020
Now they're trying to ruin my favorite game series Grand Theft Auto by making it take place in Florida, which to me seems gay.

787
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:22,900
Why can't these fruity gay guys just have their own gay ass country where everyone there is gay? Oh wait, they do.

788
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,540
you do, it's called Mexico. Little Ben, candidate for President of the United

789
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:31,300
States, twenty twenty eight Constitution Party. Ben, stop emailing, stop mailing

790
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:31,860
Santa, man.

791
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:36,020
There's that. Ben, there's no place for this shit. Take a look at that, 'cause

792
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,340
that's all you're gonna get. Take a look at that. This is what you get for

793
00:45:38,340 --> 00:45:41,500
Christmas. And also, take a lap, man. Okay, wait, show 'em that again. Show 'em

794
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,700
that again, Pat. Show 'em the middle finger again. So not only is this a

795
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:48,180
gesture of rudeness, this is also the number of votes you're gonna get in the

796
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,100
election. And it's a thumbs down. 'Cause I'm voting for you, buddy.

797
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:53,340
(laughing)

798
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:58,100
- It's funny that the president always does the thing

799
00:45:58,100 --> 00:45:59,540
where they go and vote for themselves.

800
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,900
- I was about to ask, do they do that?

801
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:01,740
- Yeah. - Makes sense.

802
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:03,780
- There's always every election year,

803
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,100
there's some news coverage of like,

804
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,820
oh, there goes Biden, he's voting for himself.

805
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,460
- Wow. - He put in the wrong guy though.

806
00:46:09,460 --> 00:46:11,980
- Yeah, yeah. (laughing)

807
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:14,340
You can read that one too. - Okay.

808
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,920
Well, I get to double read, I'm such a reader today.

809
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:17,760
- Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.

810
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:18,580
- You are such a reader, man. - That's the wrong one.

811
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,420
That's the wrong one.

812
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,420
Dude, I'm such a fucking reader man.

813
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:23,420
You're so reader-ed.

814
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:25,420
So readerly and writerly.

815
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:30,420
You just read it.

816
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:32,420
What? You're holding us up?

817
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,420
You get the chance to double read, you're holding us up?

818
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,420
Yeah.

819
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:40,220
Dear Sanda,

820
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:42,220
Me, Caleb Pitts,

821
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,220
Me want corn,

822
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,220
Me want to be new corn kid.

823
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:52,660
Dear Sand, I didn't write this man

824
00:46:52,660 --> 00:47:03,060
dear sand me Caleb pits me a picture of corn. It is it's not doesn't say corn me

825
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,700
want to be new corn kid

826
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:11,220
and it looks like for some reason it was it was written and then written over

827
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,260
with another color of colored pencil

828
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:17,980
for it might have been to it might have been too light of a color or maybe it

829
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:18,800
was two kids.

830
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:22,840
Who the fuck is saying the same letter on the same piece of paper? I don't

831
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,440
know, maybe that's just a spelling mistake. I mean, this is it's from

832
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:26,460
Caleb bits.

833
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:28,180
I didn't write this.

834
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,380
Me want to be new corn kid.

835
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,940
I don't want to be the new corn kid man. That kid's life is ruined.

836
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:41,060
He's not going to get into college viral man. This is the letter you gave

837
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:41,940
me to read man.

838
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,720
Would you have preferred I give you this one?

839
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,720
- I would have preferred anything but that.

840
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,560
- I'll read it.

841
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:49,380
I'll read this one.

842
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,220
- Dear Santa.

843
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,280
I know how to spell Santa.

844
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,120
That's the first clue I know.

845
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,360
- Would you rather I give you this one?

846
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,200
- Yeah, man.

847
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:58,580
- Dear Santa, I'm called Jack and I've been very naughty.

848
00:47:58,580 --> 00:48:00,900
Very, very naughty.

849
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,480
I curse, I fight, and I drink.

850
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:04,320
- Oh no.

851
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,080
- Earlier this week, I was in jail.

852
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:06,920
- God, Jack.

853
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,140
- But using my rapier wit and help from my cellmate,

854
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,240
I managed to escape.

855
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:16,240
I've been on the run, sailing the seven seas for days in search of the black pearl.

856
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,740
For Christmas, I want treasure.

857
00:48:17,740 --> 00:48:22,740
(laughter)

858
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:23,740
Savvy?

859
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:28,240
(laughter)

860
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,240
Yeah, I would have liked that one more.

861
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:38,740
(laughter)

862
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,240
I think that's from Captain Jack Sparrow.

863
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:42,240
I think you might be right.

864
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:48,320
Oh my God, search of the black pride. I didn't know he was still around.

865
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,040
Yeah, I guess he is. I don't know.

866
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,600
Oh crap.

867
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:59,640
Dear Santa Claus, my parents said I can't have a little brother for

868
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:03,920
Christmas. Oh, that's sad. Don't read this one. It's sad.

869
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:10,720
So I want one of your elves. Oh, I could rough house with him and force

870
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:15,420
him to lick my armpits. I promise I would love him like a brother and I would not

871
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:20,920
sexually molest him as I'm old enough now to know better. You must be able to

872
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,680
spare just one elf for a kid like me. I could tell him my secrets and he

873
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,480
wouldn't tell anybody because he only speaks elfish. Me and him would go

874
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,920
apple picking and it wouldn't be as much of a commitment for my parents as a

875
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:36,480
younger brother would be because elves only live to fifteen years old. Love you

876
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,820
Santa from Timmy. Oh, that's okay. No, you don't want to live with an elf.

877
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:44,740
Yeah, first of all, no, he wants an L. I mean, if you will say it, see what kid

878
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:48,800
wishes for something. Also, did he say he's he's old enough now to know that he

879
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,600
shouldn't sexually molest? How old is he? Does it say?

880
00:49:51,600 --> 00:50:00,280
Doesn't say, doesn't say at all. What old is what age is too young then to know?

881
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,440
Well, I mean, he he can write. So, you know, he's probably at least at least

882
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,800
fifteen at least thirty got to be something like that. Yeah, that's

883
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,700
around that age where you start writing this. I wouldn't want to live with an

884
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:13,620
elf, though I think I feel like they might eat a lot of food like a

885
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:16,440
surprising amount of food. Yeah, well, that's that was a fucking movie.

886
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,040
Yeah, they eat a lot of candy. I just fucking realize there's a movie about

887
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,160
an elf being your brother. Well, that's about yeah. Well, that's about the

888
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:28,040
being an older brother that acts like a younger brother. No, it's maybe the

889
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:31,560
whole the whole the whole reason that the family's out of whack in that movie

890
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:36,260
the elf is because divorce, a brother is younger, the human brother's younger

891
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,060
than the elf brother, but the elf brother acts like he's younger than the

892
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,500
human brother. So the young so it's all it's a dissonance that's throwing

893
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:45,300
everything out of whack in the universe in this movie. If they just switched it,

894
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,460
if the elf was actually younger than the brother and he acted like it, then it

895
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:52,780
would be a normal family and they would be able to say you can eat candy like

896
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,660
that. I thought I'm younger. I thought the whole movie was about an elf that

897
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:00,980
comes from the North Pole to New York City. No, it's about family dynamics.

898
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,980
It's about leaving your kid at the orphanage.

899
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:05,980
It's elevated.

900
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,980
I thought it was about spying on women in the shower.

901
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,980
That's a good chunk of it.

902
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,980
That's a good scene.

903
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,980
That is a good scene of it. I like that scene.

904
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:14,980
I really can't stay.

905
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,980
Alright, so I got this. This is my final letter it looks like.

906
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:19,980
And it looks like this is dated 2017.

907
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:20,980
It's old?

908
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:23,980
Yeah, there's an old. This one just didn't make it to Santa back in the day.

909
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:24,980
That's kind of sad.

910
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:25,980
That is sad.

911
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:31,300
sad dear Santa for Christmas. I would like sanity restored in America and mango Mussolini

912
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,420
impeached from Stephen Colbert.

913
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:41,500
Wait, he got what he wanted. Yeah, I guess he did. I guess he got everything you want

914
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:46,780
and he was restored and Santa didn't even read your letter and it are going to say we're

915
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,820
going to get it. We'll still get it to him. We'll have him sign and send you sign and

916
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:54,620
send you a headshot. I mean, honestly, though, knowing Stephen Colbert, he probably sent this

917
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:58,760
his letter and then also like texted him called and people call him probably

918
00:51:58,760 --> 00:51:59,600
like really

919
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:05,340
it through. Why is he never been a guest on the late show? I think he has yeah. I

920
00:52:05,340 --> 00:52:08,840
think he has been on there. Can you pull up a clip? Does do celebrities have to

921
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,480
even write the letters? Why can't they just go through their agents and

922
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:14,920
managers to get to Santa Claus? Yeah, I guess that's how they do it.

923
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,720
Maybe they get a wagons. Maybe Santa doesn't have representation, so he's

924
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,340
just like I'm not going to talk to an agent or like a manager, kind of like

925
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,800
Don't worry where he's just got a phone in his house. Yeah, I guess movie.

926
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,000
Are you thinking of Ghostbusters?

927
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,000
That's what I was thinking.

928
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:30,600
(Laughter)

929
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:32,000
Yeah, he lives in a firehouse.

930
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:32,600
(Laughter)

931
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,200
Yeah.

932
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,300
And he's got a lady that screams, "We've got one!"

933
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,700
And that means he's got a new role.

934
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,600
Yeah.

935
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:38,200
Yeah.

936
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,200
That would be kind of cool.

937
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,800
(Laughter)

938
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,200
A fire pole.

939
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,900
Cameron handed me one to read.

940
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,400
Oh, that's nice of him.

941
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,600
It was nice. That's a little gift for me.

942
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,600
Yeah, because you kind of ran out.

943
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,600
I'm sorry for the handwriting of whoever wrote this.

944
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:57,160
I immediately thought it said roll instead of coal. Well, I'm so what we'll

945
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:01,720
just read it and then we'll know dear spoiler, dear Santa Claus. I want coal.

946
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,600
I've been a bad, bad

947
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,560
laid kid.

948
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:13,640
This kid really has the worst handwriting ever. I slap my mom.

949
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:19,960
I held down my dad and touched his butt. Jesus Christ. What the hell is wrong?

950
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:24,160
I painted my brother's toothbrush brown doesn't sound as bad as the other.

951
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:29,920
I don't know why that'd be the third one. I married my teacher. That's bad.

952
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:35,520
I conducted my whole class to not sorry. I converted my whole class to non

953
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:41,800
binary Santa and I'm only in fourth grade. What what I'm like one of those

954
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:45,000
kids that go that would go everywhere

955
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,160
wait hold on I'm like one of those kids who who goes everywhere in a spider

956
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,520
man costume, but I dress like Hitler.

957
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:59,760
I didn't set a birthday present. I didn't get a birthday present for my

958
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,000
neighbor, so give me call. I genuinely want coal

959
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,600
signed chip chocolate

960
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:15,520
sounds like the craziest kid of all time. It's insane. It's good. On top of

961
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,640
I can't write a fucking word to save his life.

962
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:20,460
No, I thought he said chip chocolate part where he dresses

963
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,020
like Hitler took me a minute 'cause it's really it says

964
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:27,860
Spider-Man cost year, but I drift like Mittler.

965
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:31,620
My handwriting is normal.

966
00:54:31,620 --> 00:54:32,500
It's not that bad.

967
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,700
It's really bad man.

968
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:34,460
It's readable.

969
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:37,940
I see really that coal.

970
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,540
I seriously want coal.

971
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:41,220
Look at that.

972
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:45,140
Yeah, it's not that crazy that

973
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:48,680
I thought my handwriting was bad. I made a very show it to the camera.

974
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:53,000
So everyone else, where's the second s in that man? Sometimes I don't write

975
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,720
letters, but that's not a big deal. I made a very conscious effort to I

976
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,120
painstakingly. I think it took me an hour to write everything because I

977
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:02,960
wanted to make sure that everything was legible in case we were passing the

978
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:06,540
letters around. That's common courtesy. Well, I figured that we I figured we

979
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,680
were just going to read our own

980
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:12,360
and I also read our own that we picked from the pile. Yeah. What else would I

981
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:15,740
mean? Well you just said yours took an hour to write, to be fair.

982
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:19,220
No, I didn't.

983
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,780
Wait, what was that voice?

984
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:25,500
Alright, I have one last one to read. That must be Santa's Elf.

985
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,180
Santa's Elf is around? Yeah, it must be.

986
00:55:28,180 --> 00:55:30,260
Okay, I'm gonna read this one now.

987
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:37,220
"Dear Santa Claus, my heart aches for you.

988
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:41,780
The night we shared together sticks in my memory still.

989
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:48,780
A night of tangled hotel sheets, breathless gasps, frantic rubbing and wet wallpaper.

990
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:55,780
Ew. Like it gets bubbles behind it? I guess. When I woke up next to you, I felt my heart,

991
00:55:55,780 --> 00:56:00,740
my burst from the love pulsing through it. I need to see you again. I can't function

992
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:06,620
without you. At my job, I drift off to sleep and dream of you and your body. You're all

993
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:11,220
all that I want all that I need. I can't live another day without you, your

994
00:56:11,220 --> 00:56:13,260
faithful companion, Julio.

995
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:19,020
Oh my God, P.S. On the back of this letter, I've drawn you something to

996
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:19,900
remember me by

997
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:26,100
looks to be

998
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:32,140
hairy middle finger. Yeah, something I don't know what it is, but I guess who

999
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:32,780
we drew it.

1000
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:39,080
Is that true? Did this happen? You had a steamy night with Santa Claus last year?

1001
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:41,940
Do you use angels?

1002
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:49,380
That's Santa Claus is one of your angels. Did you meet him over discord?

1003
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:55,540
I could see. I mean this is how's this any different from I saw mommy case in

1004
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,080
Santa Claus? Yeah, that's pretty much the same exact ball game ballpark. Yeah,

1005
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:03,300
which is that is have we ever gotten clarification on that song? Whether or

1006
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:08,300
not this was about dad dressed up as Santa or she's just would be a much

1007
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:12,660
more boring song. If it was called, I saw mommy kissing daddy, that wouldn't be as

1008
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:15,740
interesting. I hear that that would be a song you could play any day of the year.

1009
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,860
They should make a version.

1010
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,260
I saw

1011
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:24,140
they just change the words and not be about Christmas or that you can do on

1012
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:26,940
every single holiday. So you can do yeah, well, you can do any day kissing

1013
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:30,340
the Easter Bunny, but if you change it to like I saw mommy kissing daddy, I saw

1014
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:31,660
mommy kissing Martin Luther King

1015
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:39,460
I saw mommy kissing Martin Luther King, Jr. That'd be a great to be a full

1016
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,660
album of remix. Exactly. I saw mommy kissing. I mean what other people do we

1017
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:49,220
have a blink and Christopher Columbo is a tree in Feb. You I saw mommy kissing

1018
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:56,460
in Arbor. Yeah, I saw mommy kissing. I saw mommy kissing best still day. I saw

1019
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,260
mommy, I saw mommy kissing a ghost or a goblin or a skeleton or any number of

1020
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:03,080
things. Yeah, that would work for everything. Okay, so now that we

1021
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,000
finish the letters, I do want to talk about our Christmas lists. Okay,

1022
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:06,980
let's talk about it. I do,

1023
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,060
because

1024
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,980
the fact that there's this many letters already headed to the North Pole kind

1025
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:16,120
of has me a little scared. Yeah. 'Cause I haven't written mine yet. Well,

1026
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:19,040
me neither. Yeah, I mean, this many letters that are definitely heading to

1027
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:22,640
the North Pole and are not gonna get thrown away. Thrown away. Okay, who

1028
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,080
are we throwing away? I'm definitely gonna throw away Little Ben's stuff.

1029
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:29,960
I'm throwing away everything. Yeah, me too. Really? Even the blood kit? I

1030
00:58:29,960 --> 00:58:32,660
I need a chance, bro. Can I tell you guys what I want for Christmas? I

1031
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:36,060
thought about it a little more and I can tell you if I if I'm gonna go

1032
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,360
home and I'm gonna write a letter to Santa Claus and I can I can tell

1033
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,560
you exactly what I'm gonna write and I'm gonna say I'm gonna start with

1034
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:46,080
well first of all my address on yes, but then I'll say dear Santa Claus

1035
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:49,680
this year for Christmas. I need a W

1036
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:56,020
from Cameron. It's been L's all year. It's been L's for me. I need a

1037
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:58,040
It's been L after L and I need a W for Christmas.

1038
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,040
I need a W this year, Santa.

1039
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,040
I need a W fucking badly.

1040
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,040
I really badly need a W this Christmas.

1041
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,040
So bad.

1042
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:10,040
I'm probably going to ask for a Draco.

1043
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,040
Yeah.

1044
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:14,040
Dear Santa Claus,

1045
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:16,040
I'd like a Draco but don't send it to New York

1046
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,040
because I'll get in trouble.

1047
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:20,040
Send it to Tennessee and I'll go pick it up.

1048
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,040
Or Philly.

1049
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,040
You could send it to Philly.

1050
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:29,340
go in Philly probably that place crazy as fuck. It was slut week there last week.

1051
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,540
Whoa, it was slut week in Philly. We missed it again. Yeah, we missed

1052
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:37,000
again. How did that happen? I thought we all marked it on our calendars, so we

1053
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,900
wouldn't I had it written. It's not a notification. Not no. Oh, my God, the

1054
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:44,800
calendar is gone. That's why the third week of or it's a fourth week of

1055
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:46,000
November. It's not like

1056
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,000
it's not the same time every year. Yeah, well, I thought

1057
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,240
Oh yeah, so I guess our calendar sometimes November has five or six

1058
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:54,640
weeks and

1059
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:58,680
sometimes I've ever six weeks in it. Yeah, sometimes yeah really ending on

1060
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:02,720
the year leap year. So we missed it. Yeah, because last year it started on

1061
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,600
the twenty ninth

1062
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:08,160
November started on the twenty. No, the slot week started on the twenty nine

1063
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:11,240
because that's technically it was the fourth or the fifth week of November.

1064
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:15,840
What if you what if sometimes months only had two days? Wow, I get confused

1065
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:19,120
on which months have how many days I thought November lasted two more days

1066
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:23,000
That's an amazing idea. Isn't that a great idea? And then it would be an

1067
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,040
opportunity to have more joint birthday parties because it'll be like, okay, if

1068
01:00:26,040 --> 01:00:29,080
there's only two days in November this year, you either everyone who has their

1069
01:00:29,080 --> 01:00:31,920
birthday in the first half of November, you get your birthdays on November 1st

1070
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,760
this year. Yeah, the second half, you November 2nd, you can have a bunch more

1071
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,120
joint birthday parties. Sometimes you want to have a joint birthday party with

1072
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:40,760
your friend, but their birthday is just a little a little far away. Our

1073
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:45,280
birthdays are the same month, but they're just a little too far, just a

1074
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:49,240
little too far away. Tell me and Joe are too. Yeah. Yeah. So if it was just two

1075
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:52,880
days, one year, that'd be great, right? Yeah. You know what I want for Christmas,

1076
01:00:52,880 --> 01:00:57,840

1083
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,160

01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:54,300
I'm not going to do it today. Bye everybody bye bye.

1122
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:01,140
I want to have a tunnel in my house to go somewhere.

1123
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,140
I wish.

1124
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:06,540
I want a tunnel from my room to the bathroom so I don't have to walk through the living

1125
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:07,540
room and uh...

1126
01:04:07,540 --> 01:04:08,540
That's called the hallway.

1127
01:04:08,540 --> 01:04:14,060
No, but I want it to lead directly there.

1128
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:18,500
I want to have a house where I can press a button at the door and it switches to whatever

1129
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:19,500
room.

1130
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:20,500
Like, you know what I mean?

1131
01:04:20,500 --> 01:04:21,500
You want to...

1132
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:22,500
Oh!

1133
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:23,500
It goes like...

1134
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:24,500
It goes like...

1135
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Yeah.

1136
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,500
And it sort of switches the order of the rooms.

1137
01:04:26,500 --> 01:04:27,500
Like in...

1138
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:28,500
Like in Monsters, Inc.

1139
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,420
It builds a new room. I think that's the game. I haven't played it either but I saw it.

1140
01:04:32,420 --> 01:04:35,860
I wish that I had a big hamster water bottle next to my bed.

1141
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:38,820
I wish I had a big hamster. Big hamster.

1142
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:42,500
And a catheter connected to my penis. I wish I had a hamster that was the size of

1143
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,500
a German Shepherd. Yeah.

1144
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,740
I saw, did you see? I kept in a cage in my room, I never let it

1145
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:49,740
out. Imagine it stiffly dies.

1146
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:55,740
Just like shaking the bars. I throw a blanket over it whenever I'm home

1147
01:04:55,740 --> 01:05:02,740
of

1148
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:06,860
i'd drop mealworms and the report

1149
01:05:06,860 --> 01:05:08,520
uh... i'm like

1150
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:10,560
yeah i can't get rid of it like

1151
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:15,800
it was my uncle's patty dot so i have to take care of it

1152
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:17,220
disgusting hamster ball

1153
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:19,160
it was a good humanized

1154
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:22,700
accord with the speakeasy but that's

1155
01:05:22,700 --> 01:05:24,900
I have to get rid of my bed and get a twin bed.

1156
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:27,500
I think you'd like that.

1157
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:30,300
It would be nice to be beholden to a demon.

1158
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:31,780
Yeah, I think so too.

1159
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:34,540
Yeah, I think it would be nice to have, uh...

1160
01:05:34,540 --> 01:05:40,140
That's the experience of, of, of, at least fifty percent of dog owners, I would say.

1161
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,540
That's my life. I'm beholden to a demon.

1162
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,200
(Bowser roaring)
