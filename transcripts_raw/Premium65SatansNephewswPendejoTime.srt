00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
3, 2, 1, record.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,800
You're not supposed to say it at the same time.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,800
We all have to say it.

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Why don't we all say it?

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
It doesn't make any sense to do that.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
That's why Cam is the boss.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,800
Oh, so you just said I'm the boss?

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,800
I'm the boss.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
You just admitted it?

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,800
I'll admit it, dude.

15
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,380
the-

16
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,580
Yeah Thomas is not so you don't give up immediately Jake

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,500
That's why it's me. No. Here's the thing

18
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,140
It's me

19
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:53,100
He pays for the buzzsprout so that's why the boss but if

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,100
So he has the eight bucks a month or whatever. Yeah. Yeah

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:04,380
Jake doesn't know this, but he pays half of the bus route, which we have worked out

22
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:09,740
Financially he but he's like I guess I got a covert again. No, I'm splitting in half

23
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:21,020
Every time you try and give me like an extra, you know, $24 or whatever and I'm like you don't have to pay the full thing

24
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,540
Yeah, that's doesn't sound like a boss to me. Yeah. Yeah, sounds like an assistant

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,600
Yeah, yeah, it's it's a co-op. It's a working cooperative here and they have time we

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:39,800
We're gonna make a $10 patreon we're gonna start making jams together. Oh, yeah, beautiful

27
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:46,380
Artisanal jams, they don't Oh jams like that like jams like like food and jelly's not no

28
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,380
We're not gonna do a hip-hop def jam

29
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,180
I've been trying to get these guys to do to do music with me

30
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,060
The problem is Pat is way more deaf than us.

31
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:59,600
Patrick, I've told you so many times, "Hey Patrick, send me a funny little bass line."

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
You never do it.

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Never.

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,800
I don't have the equipment to record yet.

35
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,780
I would say there's upwards of four hours of you playing the bass on the podcast.

36
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,580
It's true.

37
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,020
Just while we're talking about something else.

38
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,540
Should I just put my microphone up to my amp?

39
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
I don't know.

40
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,140
Why don't you figure it out?

41
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,580
I don't know anything about this.

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,140
I want to just have you get the microphone.

43
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,020
They're complaining about that we never do music stuff with you and then I say, "Oh,

44
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,540
do you want to do music stuff?" and you say, "I don't know what an amp is."

45
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,540
No.

46
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,540
And I don't have any wires.

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:31,540
I know.

48
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,540
Do you think Elvis had a microphone?

49
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,540
No.

50
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,540
Not at all.

51
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
He didn't.

52
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,540
He shouted.

53
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
He just screamed.

54
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,540
He cupped his hands.

55
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,540
He was really loud.

56
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
He was screaming into the radio.

57
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:44,220
He had an old-timey megaphone, not like the ones that have the electric--

58
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,460
Just the big brass horn?

59
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,460
Yeah.

60
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:55,060
He would just go like, "You ain't nothing but a holler!"

61
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,060
That's what Elvis did.

62
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,060
That's what he was so famous for.

63
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,500
That podcasting in 1898 was just like six guys in a room, each had their own big brass horn.

64
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:07,300
And he's going, "Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:10,780
ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,780
ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,

67
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh,

68
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,980
nobody able to talk because they've smoked too much.

69
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Yeah, I want to return to the other and just like the most powerful like tobacco.

70
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,980
It's you high.

71
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:26,280
Yeah, smoking out of a pipe return to tradition before they knew how to like record audio

72
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,280
too.

73
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,280
So they were trying to like trap the audio and it's like a ghost of your soul.

74
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,420
Like if we hold if we hold this gemstone under the sunlight for 10 hours, it'll start to

75
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,120
absorb the soul of our audio.

76
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,820
So we'll be able to distribute that pretty well.

77
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,320
If we like just speak while we're exhaling smoke

78
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,220
and we cup the smoke, maybe then.

79
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,260
Let's eat a bunch of lead dust

80
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,060
so that it gives our voices gravity

81
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,500
and then we can hold our voices and give it to people.

82
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,020
If you were in World War I

83
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,300
and you wanted to yell at your wife,

84
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,980
you'd scream on a boat in the middle of the fucking ocean

85
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,140
and then mail it to her, and about seven months later,

86
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,240
she would open it and call her the C word.

87
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,340
Damn, that's some Harry Potter shit

88
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,780
were doing it yeah I'm 145 years old now you don't even have to talk to her true

89
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:23,740
you can just put on your your valve index and just lose your wife putting on

90
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:28,020
an oculus rift and just playing a VR game where everything is exactly the same in

91
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:35,820
my life except for the fact I don't have a wife yeah my wife is Riley Reed in VR

92
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:40,380
porn. I'm like, "Babe, can you give me a blowjob for like 11 minutes and 27 seconds?"

93
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,980
She's made out of like four polygons, like worse than Nintendo 64 graphics.

94
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:52,380
Yeah, so I'm combining Oculus Rift, wife is Riley Reid, and I have exactly 40 more dollars

95
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:58,620
than I do in real life. Yeah, just buying Lucy's. Just buying

96
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:02,860
illegal tobacco products. Just spending an extra 45 minutes at the

97
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,860
bar every night.

98
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:04,860
Yeah, yeah.

99
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:09,100
Getting to stay up an hour past my bedtime.

100
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,660
Yeah, you're asleep in real life, but I'm still awake.

101
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,420
In the VR too, they just have like a fuckin' another VR headset that you can use to do

102
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,420
this plan.

103
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:26,140
You get another two hours.

104
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:31,140
Yeah, your VR reality is just, you got a new skin for the headset itself.

105
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,140
It's like a gold decal.

106
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,140
At this point you're $16,000 deep in this VR setup for two extra hours of bed time.

107
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:45,140
You're not able to rent an apartment or own a home ever because you have $45,000 worth of different VR skins.

108
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:51,140
Buying a second VR headset and putting it on to my wife while she's asleep so she wakes up and thinks she's in prison.

109
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:00,140
just give me just like making her like the shittiest food ever

110
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,140
hey tough shit bitch you're in prison

111
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,140
she's in the war zone gulag

112
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,140
I'm making her fight Riley Reid

113
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:11,140
for your handy marriage

114
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,140
whoever wins redeploys in the apartment

115
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:18,140
yeah redeploys in your actual bed in real life

116
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,140
yeah good luck

117
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,140
I gave Riley Reid a fucking 50 cal sniper

118
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:25,740
Cal Sniper and you have a toothpick, bitch.

119
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,000
(laughing)

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,260
Oh my God, good luck.

121
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,580
Didn't she make a rap song where she said the N word?

122
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,940
- Yeah, yeah, she said run that shit back, friend.

123
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,380
That was the line.

124
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,220
- Wow.

125
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:40,660
- I think she said the N word a ton in that act.

126
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,780
- Yeah, yeah, I think she just started like,

127
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,660
like it was one of those things where she couldn't rhyme

128
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,420
the word with anything else.

129
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,260
So she just kept--

130
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,080
- The thing is--

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:49,920
- Let's look up the, I'll look up the lyrics.

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,540
- I did that also.

133
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,540
Hey Patrick, can you sing it for us acapella?

134
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,540
Yeah, yeah, I got you, I got you, don't worry.

135
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,540
You can't cancel a porn star because they already have the worst job in the world.

136
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Right.

137
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,540
Like you can't go down from porn star.

138
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Really worse than being a teacher.

139
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,540
Way worse. Teachers have it so cushy and good. Teachers are pussies.

140
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,540
We've been over this a thousand times.

141
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,540
Yeah.

142
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,540
It says triple stack bitch think we got a hundred packs.

143
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Imagine trying to get like a porn star cancel for saying the n-word

144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:23,380
we're in like walking into like the the porn producers office and he's just like

145
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:27,700
an like a fantasy ogre with one

146
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:35,540
just dripping swamp slime. He's got a big glowing club and he's like

147
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:41,300
he has like a woman's leg sticking out of his mouth he's in the middle of eating her as you

148
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:47,540
walk in. He's like "oh I had no idea that she was saying slurs in a rap song"

149
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:55,540
entertainment kid. My name's Luke Tarr. Welcome to Vixen, how may I help you?

150
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:01,820
Yeah that's why the kink mansion looks like that. It's where he lives, it's like

151
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:07,320
where he keeps all his midnight snacks. Like entire ham hocks and like 45,000 pounds of

152
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:15,420
brisket. But yes I think she's she's probably in the clear. I think the

153
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,620
The biggest thing she has to worry about is turning 35.

154
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,620
I don't know that it's necessarily saying the right word.

155
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,980
She's said it seven times.

156
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,820
I think at that point...

157
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,820
Is she 35?

158
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,820
I don't know.

159
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:32,060
I just mean if it's coming up, that's a tough milestone for a porn star.

160
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,620
The other one being 13.

161
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:40,820
That's got to be the worst age to get started in the industry.

162
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,820
Yeah.

163
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
No, they'll eat you up, dude.

164
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,500
Most of them are done by then.

165
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,860
- I was at work approaching Riley Reed in seventh grade

166
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,060
and he's like, "You gotta be tough

167
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,740
"to work in this industry."

168
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,780
(laughing)

169
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,140
- Yeah, dude, it's all, I mean,

170
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,100
the industry's about rejection, you know.

171
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,780
There's a lot of 13-year-olds moving to Hollywood

172
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,100
trying to make it in porn.

173
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,100
- I do-- - Washing dishes

174
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,820
in the back of restaurants.

175
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,700
- Scrubbing out used condoms and reusing them on set.

176
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,100
(laughing)

177
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:08,940
- No. - No.

178
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,200
(laughing)

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,900
- Oh my God. - For Christ's sake.

180
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,740
- Come on, you guys.

181
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:20,060
kids were talking about what the fuck is wrong with you no cancel

182
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:24,940
uh but yeah we're here with pendejo time how you guys doing

183
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:34,380
yeah that's a cold open we're here with our our uh our favorite new podcasters jake and thomas

184
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:42,540
just such amazing setups you guys have yeah yeah thomas has thomas has like a seemingly a

185
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,860
race car chair. Yeah, is that a GTX racer? Or is that like the Walmart one?

186
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:53,100
The thing is I got it at like an office store but I they wouldn't help me get it

187
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:59,300
off the top shelf so I had to drop it like 15 feet down and it kind of it's

188
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,780
kind of warps. You just kicked it off the shelf? I just slid it off

189
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,860
the shelf and hit the ground. But I had to like climb up there because it

190
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:14,860
wouldn't help me. What's the worst that you would get it? Office Max. Office Max Extreme?

191
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:21,980
I went up to the front desk and I said, or like where the cashier was. Did somebody like

192
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:30,980
belay you up to the top shelf? I was like, I was gonna get the red gaming chair back there.

193
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,020
Do you want me to just, you know, I didn't know if there's someone who brings it up to

194
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,260
front and she was like nope and I was like all right cool I'll climb up there.

195
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:44,860
Absolutely not like this is OSHA violation day.

196
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,700
No well there was a blue one on the ground floor but the blue one

197
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:52,220
I didn't want I wanted the red one.

198
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:57,180
Did you use a ladder to climb up there or like?

199
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:03,740
I say that like it was like a cliff. I was I had to climb up like not that

200
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:12,220
far I don't know it was probably 12 to 15 feet. That's pretty far. I would say anything above

201
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:17,260
three feet is high in office mats. That's like a small cliff. That's like the smallest cliff you can have.

202
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:22,860
So you free climbed your way up to a gaming chair because you really like the color of it?

203
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:28,620
And then you kicked it off. I like the red color of it. It was like a NASCAR chair that I'm sitting.

204
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:43,540
the

205
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:50,540
the

206
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:57,540
the

207
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:05,480
the

208
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:11,920
Yes, it's true. So I'm guessing that you are on the floor then.

209
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,720
No, I'm on a futon.

210
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,120
That is a tall chair friend.

211
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,720
Yeah. It's a bar stool. Yeah.

212
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, that makes sense.

213
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,040
I'm in the, I'm in the, uh, my girlfriend's dad's music room.

214
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,000
It's wall to ceiling, uh, Eddie from iron maiden.

215
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Damn, that's a beast.

216
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,680
Yeah. Yeah. And, uh, so this is how like I have to record it.

217
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,280
Cause the futons may be like half a foot off the ground and I'm not,

218
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,920
I guess two feet five inches tall.

219
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,360
Maybe you got to shrink.

220
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,600
Maybe that's ideal.

221
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,320
Podcaster height, like a jockey.

222
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,680
Yeah.

223
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,040
They all have to be five, four.

224
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,520
Yeah.

225
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,640
That's you guys all five for two is LA five, nine.

226
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:56,760
Yeah, that's a nice setup you have there.

227
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,160
Did you throw that chair off a cliff at some point?

228
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:04,960
No, I think it belongs downstairs in the dining room, but it's up here right now.

229
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,800
For how about you bring it back?

230
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,960
yeah

231
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,560
i got the fucking back to your seat

232
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,640
not

233
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,320
it might go for a little bit

234
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,600
right now

235
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,220
having second thoughts about having you on the show the shows open day no time

236
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,520
it's not called nice

237
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,200
the time it's not called it's not called thief time either so i don't know what

238
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,320
to expect a lot of no one can do anything

239
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,840
the about the gun

240
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,500
well it's the end either do i

241
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,120
positive not our signature

242
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,720
probably should just google it before we yeah yeah it's i think it's an ancient

243
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:48,960
incan word for yeah huge penis cool guy i'm the cool guy i don't really know

244
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,440
what it means i think it means like like okay best friend because the guy at the

245
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,040
bodega yells it when i ask for extra mayo after he hands me my sandwich

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,680
okay handsome guy with lots of money well thank you friend

247
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:11,760
Now how about that mayo chop? Chopped. Chopped mayo? Chopped mayo, yeah. I get that from Ak.

248
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:19,520
Yeah. I love Ak. Oh man, Ak. Ak is the man, dude. I love my Ak at my bodega. My Ak is my,

249
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:25,200
he might be my best friend in the world, dude. Yeah, I am so scared of him all the time. He has

250
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:33,120
piercing red eyes. What's the... Spiraling ram's horns. Can you fill me in on this guy? What is

251
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,920
his job occupation at the bodega? What does he do?

252
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,200
Ok is the guy is just what you call the guy who makes your sandwiches.

253
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Oh, okay. Yeah, I think it means like it means like brother or something.

254
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:48,400
It's probably racist. It's based on Dr. Octopus because Spider-Man is New York.

255
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:52,280
Mm-hmm. Oh, nice. Call those guys Daryls down here.

256
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,880
Daryls? Daryls. We don't have...

257
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,320
So like obviously, obviously, I've been to New York, alright?

258
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,620
so i know what it would be is uh... but i don't uh...

259
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,020
oh yeah

260
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:08,660
but we don't have a good taxes you just have like uh...

261
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:12,000
obviously you have like the corn dog rollers in the tiki doors but every now

262
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,880
and then you'll have like a half-assed tacos and it's like where the mop bucket

263
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,180
is also

264
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,480
yeah i guess just

265
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
this is this is back there and you're like this is really delicious but i i'm

266
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,440
assuming that there's also like vomit

267
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,280
and they're telling you that that's like the uh... hot dog rollers at the uh...

268
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:32,240
What was it the 7-eleven near our college like people just saw rats in there all the time?

269
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,160
That was the best I'd get hot dogs from there every day there was a

270
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:43,520
so when the comedy club in Austin that recently closed down RIP cap city comedy club

271
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:47,560
I was doing the funniest person in Austin competition there one year and

272
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,240
This guy's up on stage and he's just bombing and it's just like quiet crickets

273
00:15:53,480 --> 00:16:00,680
Nothing and I guess he thought he was gonna save his set by pointing out the fact that for the last 10 minutes or so

274
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:04,580
There was a fucking rat in the rafters and this place serves food

275
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,120
so

276
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:13,880
Like I see the manager back there that got owner to the guy and who he was kind of a hard-ass and the guys like

277
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:18,920
Man, hope you all guys didn't get chicken tenders because there's a big fucking rat out there

278
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,500
And I just want I know we're not no no one's watching this on video

279
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,120
But I see the manager's face just go white as a fucking sheet

280
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,160
And people do like laugh, but it's like almost like a oh, you know right

281
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:40,700
Cuz and like he gets offstage and he comes back to where the comics are sitting and I'm like no one wants to say it

282
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,000
But that guy never did that club again, but he came

283
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,040
Back and he was like man that was tough at the beginning, but I feel like I really brought it together

284
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:54,880
other team. And we were all like, yeah, man, you probably are Comedy Central's, they're

285
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:03,200
parked outside now. Are you that rat guy? You noticed a rat? We want you to do a show

286
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:07,120
on Comedy Central where you do that exact bit over and over again. It's every single

287
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:14,120
week. Listen, man, we're giving you a show. It's called Rat Hunters. We're going to take

288
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,280
you out to the woods and we're not going to bring a camera or a microphone. We're going

289
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,280
drive away we're gonna come back and you tell us if you saw a rat over the weekend.

290
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,280
You had a bag full of rats at the end of the weekend and we count them on TV.

291
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,280
For every rat you get, you're gonna get a thousand dollars.

292
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,280
This is gonna be the biggest show on Spike TV.

293
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,280
Spike TV's last ditch effort to

294
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,280
stay alive. Before they changed it to the Paramount

295
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,280
Network. Before Spike TV

296
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
was acquired by the criterion channel.

297
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,280
(laughing)

298
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,280
I always thought it was fun, like when I was a kid,

299
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,280
it was very much like 13 or 14 year old,

300
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
Deadliest Warrior,

301
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
the whole channel was like,

302
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,280
are you horny and do you want to watch stuff blow up?

303
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
You have absolutely come to the right place.

304
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,280
- Yeah. - Oh, dude, it rocked.

305
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
Dude, the thousand ways to die

306
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
then fucking Manser's block.

307
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,280
- Yeah. - That was tight.

308
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
- That was a good line-up. - Deadliest Warrior

309
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
was like, obviously it's fucking entertainment,

310
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,000
entertainment, but even as a kid I was like, when would a

311
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,560
pirate ever encounter the IRA?

312
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:24,880
You have a guy who is mostly a myth.

313
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,000
There were guys who were--

314
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:33,160
but you have Blackbeard versus the guys that killed Osama bin

315
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,600
Laden, like Seal Team 6.

316
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,680
It's like, well, the pirate, he's going to be drunk.

317
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,320
And so he's got a high pain tolerance.

318
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,520
And he's got a big sword he stole off of an Arab merchant.

319
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:47,080
and then you have to have grew as uh... machine guns and they know you can see

320
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:51,520
so that we're on this a thousand times in a simulation and yeah that while i we

321
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,940
didn't expect this you'll team six wins a thousand times

322
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,120
do the rifle

323
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,780
it was always funny when they had like fucking uh...

324
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,360
it's just like

325
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,360
different races like it would be a like a like maury versus like shall in month

326
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,660
Yeah, it's like a guy from Philadelphia versus a guy from Chicago.

327
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:16,360
We could watch any of those online at any time it feels.

328
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,760
Maybe not Chalin Monk versus Maori guy.

329
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,660
Yeah, but we can set it up.

330
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:24,060
The funniest thing I remember from there was the Mafia episode.

331
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,960
They would bring in like doctors and like trauma specialists and

332
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,060
then they would be like like the Mafia guy was like, yeah, so one

333
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,860
of our weapons is a bat and the doctor would be like, yeah, the

334
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:38,140
bats can do serious damage and there's a big Italian guy,

335
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,300
like powerlifter looking dude.

336
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,380
And he's like, if I swing this at you,

337
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:42,740
it's going to crack your ribs.

338
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,740
Intuitive, right?

339
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,580
Obvious.

340
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,400
And the doctor's like,

341
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,540
but he's just there to provide, I guess, authority.

342
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,040
And he's like, that was a hard swing.

343
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,420
Let's take a look at this pig's ribs.

344
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,060
And they're all fucking mangled.

345
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,620
(laughing)

346
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,700
- They got the pigs and they got like the jelly guys,

347
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,820
that like the clear jelly guy that bleeds on the inside.

348
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,660
- Yeah.

349
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,740
- This is what would happen

350
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,660
if you shot a guy made out of jelly.

351
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,220
(laughing)

352
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:10,020
Samurai versus Jellyman. One of the biggest mysteries in modern warfare is what a 50 cal

353
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,260
bullet does at point blank range. So we're going to need to bring in 25 doctors and a

354
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:21,260
bunch of ER trauma doctors as well to ascertain what kind of damage can be done by a 50 cal.

355
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:28,420
I miss like the last 3 or 4 years that Spike TV was on. They switched to like, it was all

356
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:33,620
Deadliest Warrior until like 5 p.m. and then it was these like creepy dating

357
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:38,140
shows where they would be like how to rape with Vince Champ and it would be

358
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:42,280
like yeah like an hour and a half of like some guy talking about the game and

359
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,180
shit. Oh yeah then every Sunday all they all they played was fucking Bar Rescue

360
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:52,220
because it was like their most valuable property. I think it those dating shows

361
00:20:52,220 --> 00:21:08,220
It was like all of the worst parts about like 1999 Pickup Artist guys and then like UFC 2010 Affliction guys and then blended into one just like the ultimate villain.

362
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:13,220
The ultimate sports bar villain. The guy you have to encounter on the way to your car.

363
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,220
The final boss of Buffalo Wild West.

364
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,220
You have a marble of light, if you don't I'm going to knock you the fuck out of here.

365
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,220
Yeah.

366
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,780
Dude, may Spike TV rest easy, dude.

367
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,140
Dude, that'd be a great Deadliest Warriors.

368
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:33,620
The guy who thinks you're looking at his girl versus the guy you won't give a cigarette to.

369
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,820
See who gets that.

370
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:41,940
Their measurements are on the blue corner, 5'5", 387 pounds, and in the red corner you're

371
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:47,300
gonna have one of those 6'1" but also 110 soaking wet guys.

372
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:54,300
The guy who thinks you're looking at his girl versus his girl.

373
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:59,300
This girl is like, yeah, 5'4", 400 pages.

374
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:03,100
He's got a fucking Tweety Bird, like, muumuu on and he's like,

375
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,540
"This is my beautiful wife and you're looking at her like that?"

376
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,760
And they do, like,

377
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:13,220
the loadouts and it's like, "In her purse, she has pepper spray, a gun,

378
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,100
twix bar kit kat melted

379
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:19,940
happy pin expired birth control

380
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,740
yeah just the last week of birth control just the sugar pills the sugar pills yeah yeah yeah

381
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:29,700
they've got like that blue lint on them that you get in your jeans pocket

382
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,460
yeah it's a denim purse

383
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:39,740
i like the idea that it's not a denim purse but it still has that on it somehow

384
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,980
it's denim inside

385
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:46,660
Yeah, denim lined purse. It's leather, it's pleather on the outside, denim on the inside.

386
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,980
Yeah, just the least durable thing of all time.

387
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:53,460
It's a purse designed to be stolen.

388
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,380
Yeah, designed to have shit spilled in.

389
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,700
It's one of those things when you walk into 7-Eleven and it's got like,

390
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,380
like a now defunct sports team coffee mug from '88 on sale,

391
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,500
like next to CBD and kratom and like Chinese sawdust as nootropics.

392
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:19,360
I do like that they're bringing back the gas stations now like they sell CBD and I do remember

393
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,760
the fake weed era when you could go to like the stripes and you could buy something called

394
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,620
like joker's dust.

395
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:26,620
Oh yeah.

396
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:29,500
And smoke it and you'd go to hell for like three days.

397
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,820
Yeah and it claimed that it was like a sponge.

398
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,820
Yeah.

399
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,140
Yeah they could only legally sell it.

400
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,500
This is legally a TV.

401
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Under no circumstances.

402
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,820
I'm not saying you should or can, but if you light it on fire and breathe near it, you'll

403
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,860
get schizophrenia for like 17 hours.

404
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,900
This will unlock a dark soul in your mind.

405
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Do not smoke.

406
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:04,540
The coolest shit to me is the fucking workout shit that's called "I am a psycho murderer."

407
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,540
yeah that shit rocks dude

408
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:12,380
oh dude the best pill i've ever seen at a 7-eleven was uh these things called swag pills

409
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:16,540
that are called they're they're swag swag is an acronym for sex with a grudge

410
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,540
yeah i've seen those too

411
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:23,020
yeah it's like having sex with an enemy

412
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,860
isn't there a drawing patrick there's a rendering of like a girl with like

413
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,660
a stick figure girl and like her ass is in pain or something

414
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Yeah, yeah, it's uh, it's...

415
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:36,160
I'm looking at it right now, it's Swag 6 with a grudge.

416
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,560
It's two pills, one of them's like a tiny black, like, ball bearing,

417
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,360
and the other one's just like a white pill.

418
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,160
It says "One to hurt it, two to kill it."

419
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,960
And it's two stick figures, and one of them has smoke,

420
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,360
and then the other one just has fire on the pussy.

421
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,260
On the stick figure.

422
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,760
Wow, dude.

423
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,760
Oh my god.

424
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,160
I- I can't admit, like, the fucking, the marketing team for Swag Pill--

425
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
Oh, it says no headache, so that's good.

426
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
(laughter)

427
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
I'm glad I can't get a headache from this thing.

428
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,160
It does involve some sort of pain and then death shortly thereafter.

429
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
(laughter)

430
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
But I need to have a clear mind.

431
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:15,160
I'm so excited to try out this new knife penis ointment that I just got.

432
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,160
(laughter)

433
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Have you guys ever tried dick pills? For real? Like, gas station ones?

434
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
No. I never have.

435
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
I have a perfectly 60% penis, so...

436
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:24,160
(laughter)

437
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,160
You gotta get on that shit, man. They got one called, like, Rhino Power.

438
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,000
I see the rhino pills. I got offered one recently, but I decided not to take it.

439
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
They're pretty good as like pre-workout.

440
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,500
Yeah.

441
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
You do? Just working out with a fucking huge stick?

442
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
You just take one of those, you run like nine miles.

443
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,000
Well, the-

444
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,500
Good work.

445
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:51,000
The reason those probably say no headache is like you do, so basically what the gas station ones do is they get your blood pressure to like, I don't know, John Madden levels. All right?

446
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:51,500
Yeah.

447
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:56,000
Just your liver turns into cheese.

448
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,500
Yeah.

449
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:59,460
but it's not the same as a little hot blood pumping to your body that it

450
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,340
naturally just goes to the two between your legs

451
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,540
and uh... it makes it gives you a pre hypertension headache like a strike a

452
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,300
headache you get before you stroke the fuck out and like

453
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:10,380
you lose the ability to walk normally

454
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,740
so if it says no headache on i'm pretty sure that they've done lots of science

455
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,500
to get this is the uh... this is the ingredients for swag bills are

456

just the swag pills

484
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,860
the first result is

485
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,980
public notification swag contains hidden drug ingredient and it says do not take

486
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,740
it

487
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,680
the second one which is from two years or three years later says public

notification swag to contains

489
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,320

the fourth result is swag pill directions pediatrics in los angeles

00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,320
So it's just Viagra but with a funny name. Yeah it's just Viagra with like other

498
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:36,100
stuff in it. But it also does say consumers should stop using this product

499
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,960
immediately and throw it away. Well that was that was why I didn't take that

500
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,900
rhino pill that I saw was because on the back it said what said last up to five

501
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:52,000
hours and then on the back it said do not take more than one every two weeks

502
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,600
that can't be good nothing that you can only do once every two weeks is good

503
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,520
the best thing that I've seen though I've talked about this on the pod before

504
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:09,320
but was in a gas station was called add all XR yeah oh yeah yeah - a LL which is

505
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,460
That's just so, that's brave dude.

506
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,700
- I got an ad for something on Facebook called Dadderall.

507
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,640
It was like a, it was literally just,

508
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,900
I don't know why I got an ad for it

509
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,080
because I'm not an older guy.

510
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:23,940
But it was called Dadderall, spelled normally,

511
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,380
and it was like white powder in a little,

512
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,240
it just looked like something you'd cut Coke with.

513
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,080
I don't know.

514
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:30,900
(laughs)

515
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,620
And it was like, the description was like,

516
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,120
having trouble focusing on your wife

517
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,320
and like your family and shit.

518
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,880
And I was like, dude, if you're having those kind of problems,

519
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,640
You do not need to be taking like half-assed nootropics from--

520
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,320
you need to go to therapy or something.

521
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,600
Like this caffeine ginseng Chinese daughter mixture is not going to make you love your wife again.

522
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,880
You don't know that. You don't know that it won't work.

523
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,640
Try teaching your son a talent. Maybe you'll care about him more.

524
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,880
Yeah, yeah.

525
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,440
Teach your kid guitar or something.

526
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,280
Exactly, then you can listen to him play.

527
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,120
Patrick, you're learning guitar, right?

528
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,080
Yeah, I'm kind of learning. I'm doing all right.

529
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,360
He's playing on it.

530
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,720
Nice.

531
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,420
you're in the tent in the dark

532
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,860
uh... no i have not written any signs are not there and still learn scales

533
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:16,700
now you know i i don't know what the you know you know that basically just

534
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,760
you're gonna wanna dislike uh...

535
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,560
when my power chords and just like

536
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,560
start yelling

537
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,200
nobody at all day

538
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,760
i think our courts pretty guy you know it is it's a my my fingers i get it get

539
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,940
better it

540
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,260
holding the notes down

541
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,600
yeah no say that's why i i always whenever i try to learn guitar i'd like

542
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,040
small fingers so it's so hard to play the bar chords and I just give up.

543
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:43,240
My fingers are fucking huge. My hand's like big.

544
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,180
I got stubby fingers compared to my height.

545
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:52,080
I have huge hands with pleasure hooks on the end.

546
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,320
It's impossible to play any sort of string instrument.

547
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,600
I have a full rib cage inside each of my fingers.

548
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:07,600
I have webbed feet like a duck, I don't know why that's relevant but...

549
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,120
Oh shit. I do not play any instrument. I played, I tried, I pretended to play the banjo.

550
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,160
Yeah for like one minute and then uh... I was like this is too hard.

551
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,400
Yeah, your banjo... I'm gonna play

552
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,900
video games. That thing's broken too. You broke it.

553
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:25,320
I didn't break it. You broke it. I did not break that. You did drop it.

554
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,040
Patrick's not gonna do it. No, no, it was broken from the day I met you. You broke the

555
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,520
the nut on it. You broke the nut on the fifth string.

556
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:35,040
Patrick met Caleb and he's like, "I'm gonna make a note in my head that this guy's banjo

557
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
is broken."

558
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,720
Because he's gonna blame it on a podcast.

559
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:42,800
I can break it as many times as possible between now and when I bring it up in a few years.

560
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,600
And then be like, "Well it was broken when I fucking saw it."

561
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,440
He saw one string was messed up and he just snipped all the other ones.

562
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:55,020
I don't know, maybe I'll get back into it. The thing is a banjo is like, it's in a tricky

563
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,540
spot as an instrument because it's like not immediately cool and I think if you

564
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:04,380
try to make it cool you're like the worst guy ever. With the banjo? Yeah.

565
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:11,620
You had a window of time like... Maybe 2013 I could have played. Yeah, Mumford and Sons, Loomis, Stomp Clap bullshit.

566
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,740
You could just get like the six string banjo though like the one where it's

567
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:18,300
just like... A guitar? Yeah the one where it's just a guitar for guys who just

568
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:22,700
don't know how to play the banjo. What if I just get a speaker and I just listen to

569
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,460
music. You should get, Caleb, you should get turntables. That's what you should do.

570
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:34,460
Yo! You should go to the Times Square. In New York, there is definitely like a shit ton

571
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,020
of returned turntables in New York City. I used to play a saxophone when I was a

572
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:43,300
kid. I played the saxophone. Yeah, and I would, my dad lived downtown. I played it

573
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:51,380
in like band in school. Downtown Caleb Pitts. Dude, I was fucking, I was Zatarand out downtown Wilmington, bro.

574
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:58,980
I was like, I sat on the corner of my dad's block with my saxophone case open and I just

575
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:04,860
played Hot Cross Buns for like two hours for tourists to throw change in.

576
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm very surprised that you weren't like, yeah, people either weren't, they thought

577
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:15,200
you were like a sickly, you know, failed Make-A-Wish kid type deal or they just didn't throw rocks

578
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,220
at you at mock speeds.

579
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:21,060
I lived in a very, you know, they were nice southern blokes, you know?

580
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,460
People with big hats and white suits.

581
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,580
Like Thomas and me?

582
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,780
Yeah, exactly, like you guys.

583
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:32,260
That's why I like you guys. You remind me of Colonel Sanders a lot.

584
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,580
I used to play the violin.

585
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,500
That is a huge curveball. Continue.

586
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,740
Yeah, keep going with that. No, it was when I was little. I was in like an orchestra and stuff.

587
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,160
It wasn't like,

588
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,640
It wasn't like fiddle though, it was like classical

589
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:52,340
Violin, which damn yeah, I used to be an opera singer

590
00:33:52,340 --> 00:34:02,640
That was a pretty spot on thomas impression every second it's not even that's not even how I talk

591
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:11,680
They talk like that the key to thomas impression is just pretend you're trying to not wake your dad up every single time

592
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,100
Yeah, even though it's 4 30 p.m.

593
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:17,100
It's still like this.

594
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:23,400
Yeah, it's like 19 Miller Miller light cans in front of him in a

595
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,800
full one in his hand still cold and he's been asleep.

596
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,600
Yeah, I used to play violin dad Thomas's dad just barging into

597
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,800
the room slamming the door open.

598
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,000
Do you tell him you played violin?

599
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:40,800
Yeah, I always phrase it like like I'm going to get beaten or

600
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,400
something. I'm just trying to be nice. No, and then I'm trying to play guitar right

601
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:51,120
now but the way I'm learning is I'll practice for like an hour every like

602
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:57,520
three weeks so it really sticks with you if you do that. I think I know three

603
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:09,520
chords. I know a few. I got, it really helps like, I know, fuck off. You don't know any. Sing one right now Pat.

604
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
That was a note.

605
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
That was a note.

606
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
That was a note, dumbass.

607
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
And you don't even know which one.

608
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
It's gonna double.

609
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
That was a G.

610
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
That was like the clown school.

611
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
That was a G.

612
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
I was singing a G.

613
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
I'm sorry.

614
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Hold on, wait a minute.

615
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,280
I'm just going in on his ass.

616
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,280
What note is it?

617
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
G.

618
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,280
Tell him what note it is, pussy.

619
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
You don't sing the letter.

620
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,280
G.

621
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,280
That doesn't make any fucking sense, dude.

622
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
No, it makes sense.

623
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,280
No.

624
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
You're capitalist.

625
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Like dollars.

626
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
You ain't no musician.

627
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
You a fool.

628
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
What was it?

629
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,280
What was it?

630
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,620
What was it what we're doing for everybody got on the Amy Teresa

631
00:35:42,620 --> 00:35:51,360
Red Bull with the straw in it did

632
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,800
iconic look

633
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,800
I'm really glad to be here with some of the best nephews. I got this right here. God's green. That's pretty cool

634
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,660
I've been repairing it. Hey, you know, she had you to it. He smash it on stage. Yeah my dad

635
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
- Your dad is Eric Clapton.

636
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,200
- Dad's Eric Clapton because I fell out my window.

637
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
- That's why he's like that.

638
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,200
- Yeah.

639
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,200
- That's why I talk like this.

640
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,200
- A lot of people don't know, Clapton actually pushed two suns out the window.

641
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
And Pat's the survivor.

642
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
- One of them landed in a ship container filled with marshmallows.

643
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
- The wrong one died.

644
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
- And ate his way out.

645
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:34,200
- And broke his fall.

646
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:39,200
I just got one in the mail I posted about it today.

647
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Oh yeah, a guitar?

648
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,200
Yeah, new Telecaster. It's pretty nice.

649
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,200
Yeah, that's the, uh, it's like one of the hollow ones, right?

650
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Semi-hollow.

651
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
A guitar Thomas?

652
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Yeah, semi-hollow.

653
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
The guy from Jimmy World designed it or whatever.

654
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
Ah.

655
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Or whatever.

656
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Yeah.

657
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Yeah, I don't even know that fact. I'm just saying it.

658
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Yeah, that's...

659
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
I don't care so much.

660
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,200
Yeah, I'm probably the coolest guy on Pandaylo Time.

661
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,640
of time if Thomas is the boss I'm the cool guy.

662
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,480
Dude, that's a good dynamic to have.

663
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,480
Thomas is kind of...

664
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
You think everything's about being cool?

665
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,200
Everything's about making money, dude.

666
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,760
That's all I do.

667
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,760
That's why he's the boss, dude.

668
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:15,760
He's got money on the mind.

669
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
You're the money man.

670
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,920
You're Mr. Business and I'm Mr. Party.

671
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,040
I can make 80 bucks any day I want.

672
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,040
How would you do that?

673
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
You could just go to work.

674
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,040
That's strong.

675
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:31,040
Dude, honestly, I can't argue with you there at all.

676
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,040
See, I would have never thought about that.

677
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,680
I'm trying to think of like an Instagram fake it till you make it, like doing poses in front

678
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,400
of a rented BMW guy and he's like, "You want the secret to 80 bucks a day?

679
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,400
Easy.

680
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
You're going to want to clock in at your job."

681
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:50,360
You want to kind of go home and you're going to want to do that for 40 hours a week, that's

682
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,320
probably like $2,200 a month.

683
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,320
Jake's trying to sell-

684
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,360
I make 300 bucks a year just on tax refunds because I work so much.

685
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,520
(laughs)

686
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,840
- Jake's trying to sell weight loss wraps to his mom,

687
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,640
and Thomas is just fucking digging a hole.

688
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,120
- We both get together outside of the podcast,

689
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
he's like, "What kind of revenue streams are you running?"

690
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,880
And I'm like, "I'm trying to sell tummy tea to my own mom."

691
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,920
And then, "What are you doing, you still digging holes?"

692
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,880
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty much what we got going on for us.

693
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:23,880
Now, and the Patreon, and you know, the podcast career.

694
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,760
- But the Patreon--

695
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,600
- It's a good thing I'm stealing all the money.

696
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,080
- Sponsors the tummy tea.

697
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:33,580
Thomas spends all the money on bigger shovels to dig bigger holes.

698
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
He's digging holes to bury his earnings.

699
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,980
He doesn't want his dad to go.

700
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,980
I think it's like burying gold.

701
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,580
I don't like doing anything to protect the cash.

702
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:44,780
I think it's like burying gold.

703
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,380
So I just put like individual hundred dollar bills in like six foot holes.

704
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,180
And never, never, they just disintegrate.

705
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:58,180
that's really smart man that's smart money tactics yeah

706
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:03,180
people don't know this but Pablo Escobar used to bury 20 bucks at a time

707
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:06,180
every field

708
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,180
the savings account dude

709
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,180
yeah

710
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,180
that's why he was a genius

711
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,180
I don't know my savings account I'm

712
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,180
I think I'm just gonna let them close it

713
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,540
close it. I think it's overdrafted like $20 because they charge you a fee at Bank of America.

714
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,220
At some point, I'm just never going to lose the $20 to put money in that.

715
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:33,300
No. I'll tell people, especially when I was in college, I'd be like, "Hey man, I'm broke

716
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,180
this week." They'd be like, "Oh, okay. We're going out. Do you want to come get food?"

717
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,620
I don't know what broke means to you. Some people who are good with money, broke means

718
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,460
like I have a thousand dollars in the bank. Yeah. And to me it means I am

719
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,540
overdrafted in my checking account by like four hundred and fifty dollars.

720
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,220
I used to have Cameron buy me McDonald's like three times a week because we just

721
00:39:54,220 --> 00:40:01,020
worked together and I would be like, "Hey Cam, I'm hungry. You buy me a french fry?"

722
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:07,260
Yeah. Yeah. It's pretty awesome. Good times, dude. Yeah. Wow. I miss those

723
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:11,260
Just constant piercing headaches and sodium headaches.

724
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:18,380
Drinking the worst coffee in the world out of K-cups that were somehow shipped from the

725
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:22,780
other side of the world and went sour somehow before you get them.

726
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:26,740
I only drank coffee at work because I didn't want to buy coffee at home.

727
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:33,760
Before I left for work on some days, I'd put four K-cups in a row and then fill up a big

728
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,940
container of coffee and then just drink it at home.

729
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:42,980
of my old roommates with blueberry flavored wait blueberry coffee it's

730
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:48,140
fucked up dude is it bad it's really gross good what smells like berries it

731
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:53,580
smells horrible it was like I used to drink four cups of a day worst thing in

732
00:40:53,580 --> 00:41:00,020
the fucking world it's free dude I can it was all is my only option did the a

733
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,820
guy I lived with we did he would leave for where he is a delivery driver and he

734
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,700
he would leave for work and he would take boiling coffee out of the pot and he would pour it

735
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,580
into an Ozarka water bottle and you would see the plastic melting.

736
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:17,340
That guy just has like a BPA deposit in his brain.

737
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,580
That's what I'm saying.

738
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:23,420
And so apparently, so one day I'm in the kitchen, I'm about to leave for work, I guess I just

739
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,500
never noticed it and he kind of has this like, he's from like near Austin but he has this

740
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,420
like rollerblader from SoCal type voice he does.

741
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,420
It's how he talks.

742
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:38,660
He's like, "Yeah, man, I've been pouring boiling hot water and coffee and stuff into water bottles

743
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,660
like my whole life."

744
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:43,020
That's how he started talking like that.

745
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:47,060
The roommates, we were like, "What do you mean your whole life?

746
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,380
Is this a college thing and you're exaggerating?"

747
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,900
He's like, "No, no, no.

748
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,300
Before high school, it's just sometimes you just don't have time.

749
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,660
You're late, so you don't get a coffee cup, like a real one, so you just pour it in an

750
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,060
empty water bottle."

751
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:02,020
I would hold the water bottle up to the light and you could see little bits of melted plastic

752
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,020
floating in coffee.

753
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:08,860
It's kind of dripping out of the bottom too because it's starting to partially melt the

754
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,860
whole bottle.

755
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,380
I was like, "Dude, you're drinking...

756
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:16,060
Cancer's not contagious, but you're...

757
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:19,960
This is like being like, "I don't want to go get AIDS," and then just drinking from the

758
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,340
Ganges for six weeks straight.

759
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
I like that move.

760
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:28,500
He's doing the dolphin diet.

761
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:32,500
get enough like plastic in your stomach that you're not hungry for anything else.

762
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,500
Yeah.

763
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:39,820
He also, he was the same guy who, we bought electric flyswatters because we had a bad

764
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,500
fly problem because we were gross like college idiots.

765
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:48,380
We just rotted food everywhere, cups everywhere, it just spilled shit, floor's sticky.

766
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:54,380
And so we got an electric flyswatter, two of them, and I hear him, he's in the shower,

767
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:56,380
I hear, "Zzzz, uh."

768
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,380
(laughing)

769
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,380
"Zzzz."

770
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,380
And these are the, not the shitty ones you buy at Walmart.

771
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:04,380
These are like the shop that, I don't know how much voltage they were putting out.

772
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,380
But I was like, "Hey Sam, I have a question for you, real important.

773
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,380
Are you in the shower with an electric flash water?"

774
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,380
(laughing)

775
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,380
He's like, "Yeah, yeah, there's a lot of them in here.

776
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:16,380
I think they're attracted to the drain 'cause of the water."

777
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:19,380
And I was like, "I don't think you're wrong in that assessment,

778
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,380
but I do think you're, as a gross miscalculation,

779
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:27,440
I don't know if it's 50 volts, probably not even that much, but I don't want you to find

780
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:32,100
out what happens when water hits that thing.

781
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,500
Those things are fucking crazy too.

782
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,900
It's just like a whole like...

783
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900
It's a taser paddle.

784
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,580
Yeah, exactly.

785
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:42,860
It's just like electricity going through like a fence in your hand.

786
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:43,860
So cool.

787
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:46,860
My granddad has one of those, you know those shotguns that shoot salt?

788
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,860
Oh yeah.

789
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,500
I had one of those too.

790
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
For flies?

791
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,700
Yeah, you kill flies with them. They're pretty fucking awesome.

792
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,700
Yeah, the green one.

793
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,700
It's like a little one, right?

794
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,700
Yeah, it's a tiny little, it just shoots like a salt blast.

795
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:01,700
Your granddad's shooting a fucking 12-gauge buckshot.

796
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,700
Every time he sees a fly.

797
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
Cuckoo!

798
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:07,700
In the North Carolina summer.

799
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:11,700
Yeah, yeah. You go to visit him at his house and just pop markers, holes everywhere.

800
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,900
I remember he just like shot me one time when I was like, he shot me with that when I was like

801
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:21,340
like mowing his lawn with my shirt off or something when I was a kid and then I

802
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:26,540
went home and I had this like giant splotch of red on my lawn. My mom was like what the

803
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:35,700
fuck happened? I was like, "Ah, Granddad shot me with salt again." It happens. I was out there doing slave labor and Grandpa was firing a buckshot at me.

804
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,340
Yeah, he's paying me a dime to do two hours of lawn work and he also shot me with salt.

805
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:45,340
Pretty awesome dude. I guess I wasn't mowing hard enough.

806
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:49,340
I can't wait to be the grandpa that's like

807
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:53,340
42 Miller High Life's Deep.

808
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:57,340
Saturday 2pm my grandson's out there mowing the lawn and I'm like, "Huh,

809
00:44:57,340 --> 00:45:01,340
is this the salt gun for the fly or is this the Remington 870?"

810
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,340
I can't see from this angle.

811
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,340
Lately I've been getting it right because the police ain't showing up.

812
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,340
Both right next to my lazy boy.

813
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,340
Yeah.

814
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,340
One on each side.

815
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
Still doesn't help.

816
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:17,340
Still doesn't help.

817
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,340
I have lost 90% of my vision, so mostly God's hand is just guiding me.

818
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,340
Yeah, dude, I'm ready to be old as shit.

819
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:28,340
Yeah.

820
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:33,340
Just fucking, just, when are you guys just gonna give up on like, trying not to get insanely fat?

821
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:34,340
What age?

822
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,340
Uh, 26.

823
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,340
Yeah.

824
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:42,260
I get insanely fat every two years and then I lose it in like a four month span.

825
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:47,260
But I think what I'm most excited about is getting like no return fat.

826
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:51,380
Not like oh diet, exercise, but I'm talking like a solid 350, 400.

827
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:55,580
Yeah, like the people who like, like the older people who lose a bunch of weight from like

828
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:58,820
walking somehow and then they're still fat as shit.

829
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:04,460
Yeah, because it's just like, yeah, it's just skin and like gravity and just terror.

830
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:10,780
I don't know, like, I want to, this is going to sound bad, I just want to be able to, if

831
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:15,820
I am feeling in the mood, to be the age where being racist like isn't, no one cares.

832
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,820
True, yeah.

833
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:23,180
It's like maybe 70, 74, like around, a little after retirement, let's be honest, but where

834
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,140
you can just say the most outlandish shit in a Walmart and like maybe somebody steps

835
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:31,540
to you but more than likely everyone's like, yeah that guy probably has poop in his pants.

836
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,540
*laughter*

837
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,040
Yeah.

838
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:39,040
Like, you're just hearing a racist comment and just turning around and just seeing the Mancubus from Doom.

839
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,040
*laughter*

840
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,040
Like, alright, I'll leave this one alone.

841
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:45,540
*laughter*

842
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:48,540
It's- it's- it's definitely- you have to be a certain type of old.

843
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,540
You really- it has to be- you have to be, like, demon old.

844
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,540
Like, big, like-

845
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,540
Demonically old?

846
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:55,540
Like a hundred and ninety.

847
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:58,540
Like, you have to look like a fucking- like, the drawing from, like-

848
00:46:58,540 --> 00:47:05,340
You have to look like a drawing that they do in a horror role-playing game for the art.

849
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:09,340
You know what I mean? When they're like, "Oh, this is the demon that represents hunger."

850
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:09,840
Yeah.

851
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:11,140
That's what you have to look like.

852
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,140
You're the guy on the back of the Megadeth album who's just like, "That's me."

853
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:21,540
I have an aunt like that who is... I can't believe I've never talked about this before.

854
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,540
Her first name is actually Satan.

855
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:29,260
I swear to God, her name is S-A-I-T-A-N.

856
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,780
Is it supposed to mean something else?

857
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,340
It's some Italian word but she pronounces it Satan.

858
00:47:36,340 --> 00:47:40,020
It's Satan. She's my aunt Satan.

859
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:45,740
And she's just exactly, she's just evil dude. I want you to know you just doxxed your own aunt

860
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,740
because there's probably two women in the whole building.

861
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,980
(laughter)

862
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:54,060
- She's gonna get whipped.

863
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,280
Patrick's gonna be sitting here suspicious files.

864
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:58,260
- There's two people and one of them is the devil.

865
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:59,260
- Yeah, yeah.

866
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:00,580
- She's fine.

867
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:02,120
- You just described, yeah, it's like,

868
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,460
can you guys stop doxing my aunt?

869
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,220
It is kind of my fault because she's the only

870
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,960
Italian woman named Satan on planet Earth

871
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,140
that's ever existed.

872
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,380
- The fans trying to find pictures of your Aunt Satan

873
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:15,140
and accidentally like finding the devil's Facebook

874
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:24,340
for eternity. Would you add him as a friend? No, I would not add the devil. No way. Fuck

875
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:31,060
no, that's bad news. I would poke him. Just to see his profile for you. Yeah, to see what

876
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,780
happens. I just know he wouldn't poke you back, dude. He'd be one of those. Imagine

877
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,260
the terror of logging on one day onto your Facebook and getting a notification, Satan

878
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,660
has poked you. Satan has poked you. Or all of your friends that you've been building

879
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:48,300
since you've had it in middle school or gone on your own, you have one friend requesting

880
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,300
it's from Satan.

881
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:50,300
Yeah.

882
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:53,860
Satan has poked you and you are now locked out of your Oculus Quest forever.

883
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:56,860
You've lost all of your goats in photo.

884
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:59,380
Satan tagged you in a photo.

885
00:48:59,380 --> 00:49:02,380
You open the photo, it's just hell.

886
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,380
It's just welcome home.

887
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,380
Caleb's aunt is there.

888
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,380
Oh my god.

889
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:13,580
I can't believe I have an aunt named Satan.

890
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,580
Yeah, I don't know why you're talking about that.

891
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:19,580
The only thing that would make that funnier if Patrick was like, "You just reminded me of an uncle named God."

892
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:20,580
Yeah.

893
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:21,580
Yeah, that's my uncle.

894
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,580
We will not be putting them together, dude.

895
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
They're a natural enemy.

896
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,580
Yeah.

897
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:28,580
Yeah, they wouldn't like each other one bit.

898
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:32,580
What did you say to me, Thomas? It was to all of us in a different group chat.

899
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:35,580
You said, "We're the nephews of the uncles you couldn't burn."

900
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,580
Yeah.

901
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:37,580
[laughter]

902
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,580
That's nice.

903
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,580
I thought about that this morning, as I couldn't fall asleep, and I was like, "Yeah."

904
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:52,480
yeah they tried to burn my uncle he's a volunteer firefighter that's why you

905
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:59,260
follow you you know you volunteer as a fireman so that they can test out new

906
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:03,980
fire equipment on you yeah we're gonna we're gonna give this this guy this

907
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:09,540
uncle we're gonna give him the gasoline hose we're gonna see if it works they

908
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:14,380
They have a gasoline hose for the houses they want to burn down.

909
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,420
This has been giving us some trouble, it keeps getting on fire.

910
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:18,420
So we're just going to burn it down.

911
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:22,060
That would be the ultimate prank, kind of like the shotgun thing where you're like,

912
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:25,820
you're just kind of a wild and crazy fireman and you're like, alright, I'm going to replace

913
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:30,420
the water in this tank with pure diesel.

914
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,420
Just one time, dude.

915
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,820
Can I just help the fire one time?

916
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:34,820
It's the perfect crime.

917
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:35,820
Why do I always have to fight this shit?

918
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:39,820
Statistically aren't like a lot of arson cases done by firemen.

919
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,820
That's true.

920
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:43,820
You know what, I don't care if that's true to me.

921
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,820
Yeah, none of them are done by me.

922
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:47,820
[Laughter]

923
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,820
I think I heard that on a show.

924
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,820
Statistically zero are done by Thomas.

925
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,820
Statistically zero percent of fires are started by me.

926
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,820
You ever see firemen and Thomas in the same room?

927
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:59,820
[Laughter]

928
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:03,820
I guess it would make sense, because they need work, you know.

929
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:08,940
if there's no fires. Yeah. I think there's some that you know they get a kick out of it.

930
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:15,180
Right. Yeah. There's some fire and they think, "Oh this is really my cup of tea." Right. Like you go

931
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,620
into like your first big fire and you're just like, "Man, this is actually not that bad. I can live

932
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:24,660
here." I'm imagining like a, they think he's like a pyromaniac but he explains it and he's like, "I

933
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:33,100
just, I get cold." You know. You've set fire to like 16 buildings across town. Yeah, I know.

934
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,760
I didn't know how to turn the thermostat on.

935
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,780
Of course, heat doesn't work, so I have to stop at places.

936
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:45,240
This happened, by the way, like two or three, I was probably 23 or 24, but a friend of mine

937
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,040
is a firefighter in a small survey Houston.

938
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,520
I was like, "Hey, do you guys have like the big pole and they're like chilly all day?"

939
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,520
And he was like, "What?"

940
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,400
He goes, "The fuck is you?"

941
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,960
I was like, "Yeah, man, so fireman, like before you get in the big truck," like I'm talking

942
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,040
him like I'm an eight-year-old boy who thinks he's the coolest guy I've ever met.

943
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:06,160
But he's an old friend of mine.

944
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,480
I was like, "You guys have the pole, right?"

945
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,120
He's like, "Yeah, but we don't use it.

946
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,320
It's like the pole that was there in 19..."

947
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
We don't use it.

948
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
We take the stairs.

949
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:16,040
I was like, "Yeah, but y'all eat the chili, right?"

950
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,040
He's like, "We don't...

951
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,040
What?"

952
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,040
I was like, "Yeah, you don't..."

953
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,040
You guys got a Dalmatian, right?

954
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Y'all got horns, right?

955
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:22,040
Y'all got horns under them hats.

956
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,040
That's why you wear them, right?

957
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,040
You guys know lowly worm, right?

958
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:25,040
That was a good one.

959
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,040
I'm going to go back to the next one.

960
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:28,040
You guys know lowly worm right?

961
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:33,840
I was like yeah you guys sit around in the truck after work and you eat really spicy

962
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:38,280
chili together and he's like dude I hate to let you down but it's like a job where you

963
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,680
go there you clock in you say like hey what's up and you put some fires out but there's

964
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,800
no chili and we don't light up and down the fire poles all day.

965
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:52,000
I do imagine firefighters just doing like Charlie Chaplin shit under the way of the fire.

966
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,600
I know it's a very important job and it's a very dangerous job,

967
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,200
but because as a kid I watched so many cartoons,

968
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:03,200
I feel like they're followed by a cloud of dust with fish scales,

969
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,800
like cartoon trash.

970
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
[LAUGHTER]

971
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,800
Like the smoke makes its way to the station,

972
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,200
kind of like the pie gag in Looney Tunes.

973
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,600
The thing is, it's one of those jobs that we're losing to automation,

974
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:18,800
but instead of robots, it's prisoners.

975
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,800
So I don't know why you would ever go into that field.

976
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,680
As long as we're still locking up kids for selling,

977
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:29,480
accidentally selling weed, then I think we're fine with firefighters.

978
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,840
I think it's funny that like, they still, even after like,

979
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:36,200
how much of a PR nightmare the prisoners fighting fires is,

980
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:39,240
there's always at least one outlet who I guess didn't get the memo and they're like,

981
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:45,880
"Wanting to make a difference, these former, these prisoners spend 17 hours a day for $1.50

982
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,800
putting out fires that are killing them at 25% increments.

983
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,000
A quarter of them will die as they walk into the woods.

984
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,000
Yeah.

985
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,920
These brave souls lick the fire off the walls of children's hospitals.

986
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:00,920
[Laughter]

987
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:06,840
Even if they were violent criminals, it wouldn't be okay.

988
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,600
But a lot of them are caught up in the private prison fiasco.

989
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:13,440
So they're like, "Yeah, I sold some weed in 1988.

990
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,560
I've been in jail for about 33 years.

991
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:20,720
I'm 58 years old and I'm super excited to go die in a California fire.

992
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,320
I want to die in a woods fire.

993
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,320
That's my thing.

994
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,240
So HuffPost can tell me that my death is everything.

995
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:31,960
I ate five pounds of asbestos and I'm going to walk into Chrissy Teigen's house and just

996
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:34,960
extinguish the fire just by standing in there.

997
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:38,600
Did she still...

998
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:44,600
It's just Kamala Harris just sacrificing prisoners to the great fire in Bakersfield, California.

999
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:49,500
it is a big speed pieces slate just putting some poor kid

1000
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:51,600
a big rebel rousing speech late

1001

00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,700

1017
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:37,180

1018
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,860

But what's up?

1037
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,680
You yourself have second degree burns over 98% of your body

1038
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,680
in your life

1039
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:36,680
*laughter*

1040
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,680
Just screaming, just because you're touching your chin

1041
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,680
and sloughing off.

1042
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,680
I heard she used to party with Chad Muska!

1043
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:49,680
Eating the burnt chihuahua like a turkey leg of the steak and everything.

1044
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:54,680
This is the most evil fireman of all time.

1045
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,680
Alright, I'm trying my best.

1046
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:59,680
Yeah, that's why he likes it, dude. He wants to murder the fire.

1047
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,680
That's how they motivate him.

1048
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,680
Just fucking, just try and murder the fire.

1049
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,920
(laughter)

1050
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,740
- Yeah, you used to do all those murders on people.

1051
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:12,140
Just pretend the fire was a person.

1052
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,480
- Pretend the fire hose is a Glock 40

1053
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,940
and the fire is your dad.

1054
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:18,080
(laughter)

1055
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,640
- That's what you did, right Richard?

1056
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:22,040
(laughter)

1057
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,560
- Oh, God.

1058
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,360
- They should make him do different jobs.

1059
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:26,200
- Yeah.

1060
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,840
- Yeah, they should make him work at CVS.

1061
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:28,680
- They should.

1062
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:31,800
- I want my mailman to be like a convicted murderer.

1063
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,160
- I think mine probably is.

1064
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,600
He's like a mailman with a dangly earring and I'm like you should not be holding anything

1065
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:39,600
I own ever.

1066
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:45,320
I want the guy who pours the icing on my Cinnabon to be a fucking cereal rabid.

1067
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,480
That's how you get that extra icing.

1068
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,080
Yeah, there we go.

1069
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:55,480
I want a massage from a guy who's wearing a Hannibal Lecter mask.

1070
00:57:55,480 --> 00:58:00,400
I think you could go on Craigslist or something.

1071
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,640
(laughter)

1072
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,480
- Easy, you can make that happen.

1073
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,140
- That guy's up there for sure.

1074
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:05,980
- You can make that happen.

1075
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:06,800
- Yeah.

1076
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:07,640
- Yeah.

1077
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,120
- Probably 450 bucks, I don't know.

1078
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:12,120
- The magician that you hire for your kid's

1079
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,320
fifth birthday party is like the leader

1080
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:16,280
of the Aryan Brotherhood.

1081
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:18,160
He's on a work release program.

1082
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,280
- Well, he works for cigarettes, so.

1083
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:21,680
- I'm gonna set this cross on fire!

1084
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,940
(laughter)

1085
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:29,000
- Holy magic!

it was that way

1103
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,160
the biggest

1104
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:09,160
prison is

1105
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:12,000
uh... being outside of it you know

1106
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,360
you know

1107
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,920

1108
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,120
yes

1109
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,600
he's telling me

1110
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:22,720
that the best thing about

1111
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:26,160
is i know exactly what guy you're talking about who

1112
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,440
you're sitting in a shitty lawn chair on like a chipped glass table at a house

1113
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,040
party like three in the morning

1114
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,440
and the guy's like hitting you with truth knowledge

1115
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,520
he's the only other guy awake at the party

1116
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,860
he's like yeah you know sometimes when you're outside of it

1117
00:59:38,860 --> 00:59:40,720
that's kinda like when you're

1118
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:44,160
on the inside of it you know and you have to say yeah i get it or he'll knock you

1119
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,960
unconsciously

1120
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:50,840
you know the self the mind can be a prison at times

1121
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:54,160
flicking ash in your eye

1122
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,120
he's thinking of like a way you can leave in fifteen minutes he's like

1123
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:00,600
you know you got to wings of the government

1124
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,320
not right

1125
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:04,920
that's doing shit

1126
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,800
one bird

1127
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,440
all he needs to stones brother

1128
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:14,160
and that's what you know what it is there any six times

1129
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,080
near the guy uh... so i i i had a through a house show a bunch of bands

1130
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:18,840
like

1131
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:22,240
sector itself but much base played in the afterwards i got a couple times

1132
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,160
So my band played, a bunch of like, like punk bands, hardcore bands played, and then after

1133
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,200
we would have a house party, and I would just like play music on my phone or whatever, like,

1134
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,600
or somebody would DJ, like Spotify DJ.

1135
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:37,800
Anyway, like, you know, fucking Return of the Mac stops playing or whatever, whatever

1136
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
the fuck's on.

1137
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:46,200
And I just hear this tone, it's like a "Ooooooooh" and everyone also, you hear the noise of like,

1138
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:50,840
like 50 or 60 angry partygoers, and I walk back inside and I'm like, "What the fuck?"

1139
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:55,640
There's a guy next to the fucking speaker and he's got his head right up to it and he's like this is a

1140
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:58,740
48,000 gigahertz tone it's supposed to like

1141
01:00:58,740 --> 01:01:14,600
Just drug everyone at the park

1142
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,560
Take their wallets well, they're all

1143
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,220
Yeah, and I'm trying to like I'm like hey man no

1144
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,840
You can't and he's like dude

1145
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:30,320
Just leave it off cuz like it really like you're supposed to peek on like three and I'm just afraid it was gonna work Jake

1146
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:36,320
Afraid of what you'd see what the fucking the elves would tell you yeah, yeah, I was afraid

1147
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,480
Yeah, I was afraid that he would like put me out of business

1148
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:42,000
selling drugs

1149
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:44,000
You can't be playing

1150
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,640
DMT beats

1151
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:50,460
It's also weird to go from like an emo house show to like just a tone like

1152
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:59,360
You just have like like a really like heavy screamo band followed by like a beatdown power violence band and then you just have

1153
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,000
like a hundred

1154
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,760
Yeah that rocks

1155
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,880
also, he was like

1156
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:11,680
He was being really defensive with the aux cord. He was like

1157
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:15,120
This is my house. Yeah

1158
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:23,120
I didn't want to use "dude, it's my house" card, but I was like, "dude, I live here and I'm just calling at the end to the Binaural Beats party hour."

1159
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,120
He's like, "I don't understand you."

1160
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:35,120
Did he just have the aux cord on his hand or something? Is that who he was making the sound? Or was he playing it on something?

1161
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:36,120
He just got it on his tongue.

1162
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,120
Yeah.

1163
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,120
Like, "Wah-wah."

1164
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,120
He had it hooked up to his phone, I guess.

1165
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:44,120
Was this his music that he made?

1166
01:02:44,120 --> 01:02:49,320
made? No, it was like, I, I, so I, you, it's funny that you asked that question. I got a

1167
01:02:49,320 --> 01:02:53,920
chance to glimpse at the screen and it was literally one of those like, uh, 14,000 megahertz

1168
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:58,320
or whatever, 488 hertz for nine hours, YouTube videos with one of the fractal brain guys.

1169
01:02:58,320 --> 01:03:05,000
It's one of those tones that keep your dog inside. Yeah. 10 hour, 10 hour sine wave brain

1170
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:08,120

1171
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:10,120

1172
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:12,660
anyway as they can see

1173
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:16,760

1174
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,760
