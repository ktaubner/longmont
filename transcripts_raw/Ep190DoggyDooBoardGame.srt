1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
come back and make a mess and we see a but

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,040
you're a scrap monster

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:15,040
uh...

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
okay we should be the only part of it it's so i mean it started this is

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,840
counting that this is this is counting down

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:25,240
discounting up counting did up this is counting every terrorist attack at the

7
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,560
end of your house and you're right now every single second yeah

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,960
yes or the middle of a serious terrorist moment here in new york city where some

9
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,320
very short terrorist is giz giz giz is

10
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,700
you know today i was five

11
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,480
little terrorist wealth

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,400
for a wealth of a race the twelfth of april and pretty early in the morning so

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,940
what we're and they have a copy of so what we're thinking is that maybe we

14
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:53,240
record this and it really we schedule it and then probably we all offers die

15
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:57,120
yet by this man's hand so this could be our last is our time to kind of

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,680
I'm supposed to see the Sonic movie tonight.

17
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,680
Really?

18
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:01,680
Sonic 2.

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,680
Yeah.

20
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,680
And, um, I don't know.

21
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,080
How is Jim Carrey supposed to be fucking Eggman, dude?

22
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,080
Eggman is supposed to be fat.

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,080
He's round.

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,080
He's supposed to be fat.

25
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,080
He's supposed to be egg.

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,080
Not just fat, but round.

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,080
Yeah.

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,080
Well, not even just round, almost egg-shaped.

29
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,080
Almost egg-shaped.

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,080
The similarities between...

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,080
Ovoid.

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,080
Mm-hmm.

33
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,840
The similarities between Jim Carrey and Eggman, those are the only differences.

34
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,160
All of their crimes are similar.

35
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,160
I bet that they'll have...

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,560
I bet he'll be fed in Eggman origins mm-hmm and he loses the weight at the end

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:36,020
We need a full-length Bowser movie. Yeah, just about Bowser, but like what is Bowser's?

38
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,340
Like what's that is just like born of what's that movie?

39
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,340
He steals women. What's that movie downfall?

40
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,600
What movie? Like a downfall style movie about Bowser. What's downfall?

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,400
They should make a movie called fall down about my grandma. Downfall's the Hitler movie.

42
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,720
Oh yeah with the with the funny with the go with the seed.

43
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,640
where they put the Runescape text over it.

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,640
Yeah.

45
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:01,280
Yeah, they need a movie like that but with Bowser.

46
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
Bowser deserves to win.

47
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
I agree.

48
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
He deserves to win once in his life.

49
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,880
Yo, Peach, let Bowser hit one time for the one time.

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,320
He did, dude.

51
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,200
Bowser Jr. is Peach's kid.

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,200
That no, he, bro.

53
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,200
And Lenny and what are the other kids?

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,200
No, dude.

55
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,200
No.

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,920
Peach is not popping out fucking dinos at her snatch.

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
She laid an egg.

58
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,840
he laid an egg. You're thinking Birdo who has an egg mouth. No, Birdo is trans. I'm thinking of

59
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,880
Peach laying an egg. You're not. You're thinking of a bird. No. Oh. I think Bowser shot an egg

60
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:39,960
into Peach's thing. Bowser wouldn't shoot an egg, he would shoot a sperm. He would shoot tons of

61
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,400
millions of millions of, bro, he would shoot millions of sperms and one of them would defeat

62
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:49,080
the rest of the sperms. I've seen pictures online. Look up Bowser and Peach. Bowser never,

63
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,840
peach never let him hit us on this website about rules bro he's too busy

64
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,120
doing different locks and designing levels for Mario yeah defeat he has to

65
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
make you some like he has to hire all the enemies I will say yes - yes to

66
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,040
audition them all he has to go he wants a sex with her speaking of he just wants

67
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,580
a mom for his kids there should be one in one Mario level is just one one really

68
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:15,020

69
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:16,020
I never played Paper Mario.

70
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,020
She should suck his cock.

71
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
Yeah.

72
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Yeah.

73
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
On purpose.

74
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,740
It's funny, it's like, it's not that they're all the same creature, they all just happen

75
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,540
to look the same and there's one that's really hot.

76
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,500
Yeah, a really, really hot one.

77
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,620
Who's like mad cool too.

78
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,340
Patrick is imagining this.

79
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,900
He's got his eyes closed, he's imagining a handsome Koopa.

80
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:36,900
Yeah.

81
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,900
I'm so sleepy.

82
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,900
Why are you so sleepy?

83
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,180
I don't know.

84
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,420
so much crap going on in the damn world. Is it maybe the terrorism is so boring

85
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,540
to you? Yeah, millions of people dying terrorism is boring as hell. I kind of

86
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:58,680
don't care anymore man. Yeah, yeah already yeah, it's been two hours. I'm

87
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,400
like been like twenty minutes. I'm right. I found out two hours fifteen

88
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,860
minutes. It wasn't hasn't even been to it. I have it at thirty, but the news

89
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:09,200
came out was like like ten minutes ago, happened at a thirty actually came out

90
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,100
one minute ago. Okay, well I'm already bored with it. Can we move on to

91
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,560
something cool yeah. Can somebody drop a big bomb out of the do you every time a

92
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,680
plane flies over to you? Do you ever think like this is it yeah? The big bomb

93
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,920
is going to hit me pretty often well, because if you look up and you see that

94
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,240
mouth that bullet bill mouth yeah, you know you're so over dude yeah yeah

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,200
that's so far. What if you looked up and you saw he saw the war zone guys in the

96
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,680
plane

97
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,080
hundred and twenty people jumping out of the plane. You see guys using a

98
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,320
flapjacks as parachutes like Fortnite. Oh Jesus Christ yeah today's the day.

99
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,560
I can't mistake that helmet anywhere that is definitely

100
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:00,280
Marshmello jumping out of that plane. It's cel-shaded Rick Sanchez. Oh and look who's behind him.

101
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:05,240
Oh yeah that's Bruno Mars. Yeah awesome. It'd be funny if that was if that we

102
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,720
New York City came under attack and was just a hundred guys that jumped out of a plane

103
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,140
They all just got killed immediately because just a hundred guys. Yeah, but yeah, well if they're warzone guys

104
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,440
They're gonna instantly kill us dude the wise

105
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,280
Yeah, the time to kill on a on a human versus a warzone guy like I'm I'm one I mean obviously yeah

106
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,080
But there are a lot of police here and they would do their duty

107
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,440
Yeah, the police are the strongest in you they would shoot them if you asked me

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,760
They'd probably be eating doughnuts and fucking chewing gum. No, right

109
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:39,240
Yeah, there's anything about a police officer if they see anybody flying down on a hang glider. They're killing them instantly. Yeah, they should yeah

110
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,400
Yeah, I mean I 100% believe they would I think of a police officer a New York police officer is walking down the street and

111
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,240
Looked up and saw and saw Ariana Grande drifting down on a magical umbrella. They would shoot her. Yeah

112
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,720
No, you see like a like a cop sees a guy made out of pancakes. He's he's open to fire

113
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:00,600
I want our I want the giant Ariana Grande from the concert to attack New York City

114
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,420
and I could maybe get squished by her giant foot.

115
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,260
- That would be sick.

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,080
- Wouldn't that be awesome?

117
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,400
- Or Travis Scott, not Travis Scott,

118
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,240
just Ariana Grande.

119
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,080
- No, just Ariana Grande.

120
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,040
Maybe she could like,

121
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,080
she could like suck us up her butthole.

122
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:12,920
- Yeah.

123
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
- Remember when they announced,

124
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
remember when they announced,

125
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,580
remember when Palpatine had that announcement in Fortnite?

126
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,740
- No.

127
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,640
- There was like a,

128
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,560
there's like a thing in the Rise of Skywalker,

129
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
or whatever the fuck it's called,

130
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,960
like the opening--

131
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,120
- Whatever the fuck that movie

132
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,040
of my favorite franchises ever is called.

133
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,400
- I always forget if it's like the Rise of Skywalker

134
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,280
or like the something else or I don't know.

135
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,440
- It's the Rise of Skywalker.

136
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,280
- Okay.

137
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,800
- You only said, you said the right thing

138
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
two different times. - Or whatever the fuck.

139
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
(laughing)

140
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,400
- There's like the opening credit crawl.

141
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,240
- Yeah.

142
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,320
- It's just like Palpatine has announced like his return.

143
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,480
That was like a Fortnite exclusive event.

144
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,320
- Really?

145
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,120
- So like part of, canonically, like in the Star Wars lore,

146
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,640
like Palpatine announced he was coming back to the fortnight.

147
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,560
That's sick. Do you know, did you remember that,

148
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,360
that fortnight event where they, it was, they did like it for a Martin Luther

149
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,440
King, Martin Luther King. Yeah. And they, there was everyone, no,

150
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,280
everyone, a bunch of people started using, there's a,

151
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,440
they have a cat woman in the game and the cat woman has an emote.

152
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,520
That's cat woman's whip.

153
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,320
A bunch of people started doing cat woman's whip and they had to turn off all

154
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,240
emotes yeah which is like what there must you should have hired somebody to look

155
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:35,760
through every single emote in the game yeah come on yeah even doing the

156
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,320
oversight loss well any of the about yeah I should have just had them turned

157
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:43,760
off yeah I don't think it's please like disrespectful to do the floss while MLK

158
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:48,400
talks that's very disrespectful respectful do you only okay what other

159
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:54,240
times you do do you do the floss when a song is very cool hmm right and when when

160
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
it when someone's spitting. Yeah, exactly. I mean, well, okay, doing the dance with the

161
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,640
L on your forehead, you can't do that. Yeah, that stands for love all races. That's Luther.

162
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,040
Martin Luther King. You can't do it. See, we fixed it. And the dab. Well, that's cool.

163
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,360
Okay, I think we solved everything. And the whipping. Destroy all bad things. Well, that's

164
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,080
Catwoman's whip. It's different. Yeah, so see, you're freaking out about nothing. I

165
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:23,120
think that cops should be legally allowed to eat people to stop them from doing crimes.

166
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,960
I agree you should be a cop should be able to take a bite. No gun. If you're under arrest

167
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,580
a cop should be able to eat your flesh. I think cops should have no guns but they should have

168
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:39,580
full. Forks and knives. Yeah. They can eat any part of you if you're resisting arrest.

169
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:45,480
Yeah. For any reason. Stop resisting! Yeah. They should be able to hold you down and just

170
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:52,480
take a big bite. Stop resisting. If I was doing some kind of I don't know terrorism or shoplifting.

171
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,400
Let's think about this for a second.

172
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Five foot five.

173
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Five foot five.

174
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,400
Okay.

175
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:01,360
Said he was, well he said he was black.

176
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,920
Could have been, I mean could have been mistaken.

177
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,480
Black Irish maybe.

178
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,480
Yep.

179
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,440
And I think they said that his name was, I think that...

180
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
I said his initials.

181
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,120
He had his initials on his clothes.

182
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,360
And I think there were eyewitness reports that said that he said he was quote unquote

183
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,800
so tired at the time of the attack.

184
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,480
I think he went, "Ugh, I'm tired," and then threw a gas bomb and killed 13 people.

185
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,400
Well, the train comes faster if you do a gas bomb.

186
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
That's true.

187
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
It's night, you put nitrous in there.

188
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah, you have to move everyone out of there.

189
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,280
Yeah, that's true, yeah.

190
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,960
I bet the trains are fucked today, man.

191
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Oh, boy.

192
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,560
Dude, it's going to ruin my Sonic 2 experience.

193
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,440
Do you remember whenever they, in Boston a couple times somebody would just jump in front

194
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,560
of the train and then just everybody would just be, there's not a single dead person

195
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,640

211
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,440
down in my little notebook so I can show up to their funeral night after everyone's tearful

240
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:47,080
another I meant he made me late what's the way they kill you to him - is that

241
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:51,560
the ultimate like one man damage that one person can cause by killing them so I

242
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I mean if unless what if you did like you had all your friends and family and

243
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:59,440
everybody come to your one-man show and then the final act of the one-man show

244
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,880
is you like kill yourself but then you gotta see bad theater and a suicide but

245
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,240
they won't be war I think for work the the ultimate route day ruining suicides

246
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,040
are unlocked when you are a politician or a president power if you're the

247
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,720
president you can basically yeah yeah you know be fun is kill yourself you're

248
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,440
standing over the nuclear button yeah and then you kill yourself and it's just

249
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,040
your head just hits it.

250
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,880

Yeah, Mr. Burns-His-Penis-On-A-Foreman-Grill.

Yeah.

282
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,720
That's the only way he can get hard.

283
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,880
Homer, because he should be at Homer instead of working with these dangerous chemicals

284
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:26,880
and radioactivity.

285
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,800
And Bart, he should be Bart-He should be Bart-A-Wearing some books for doing homework.

286
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
To do some homework with.

287
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,120
Bart, yeah, fart, stinky kid.

288
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,000
Yep, Lisa, she should be leasing a new car instead of being a child.

289
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
She's so intelligent.

290
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,160
And Maggie, she should be bagging my groceries.

291
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,560
Yeah, which actually if you watch the intro the show she ends up being in a bag. It's an Easter egg

292
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:52,300
For her future. It's an Easter. Her character was originally named baggy. Yeah

293
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:59,280
Easter egg that they left Marge. She should be she should be marging my penis up into a bunch of meat

294
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:03,120
Marging it up in a hole

295
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,400
She should be turning what she'd be using margarine are all the margineer Marge. She should be marginalized

296
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,720
She should be barging into the room where I'm doing my thing

297
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,240
Yeah, hey Marge when the ants come marching up your leg and into your dress

298
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,000
And I want to watch that Marge a bunch of ants all over your body

299
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, there's those guys who have like the holding in pee fetishes

300
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,280
Yeah

301
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:33,720
Yeah, one time there was this there's this book in free period in middle school. We had this teacher who would like just

302
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,960
in there just stand in the front of the classroom like oh I wish I'd be so hot

303
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,440
dude oh no she would read this book that was about like all these crazy ways that

304
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,000
people had died yeah and one of them was a guy in like the 16th century held in

305
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,920
his piece so long that he just croaked damn yeah croaked he couldn't just die

306
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:58,760
yeah he didn't die for like 30 or 40 more years but he did go ah that's

307
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,720
pretty cool yeah I bet the pee came out of his mouth

308
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,720
else

309
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,640
I think pretty much everything becomes P. Like it saturates every part of your body.

310
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,640
I think all body fluids are P.

311
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,640
Yeah, I think P is like the base.

312
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,640
Because like everything has water in it to be wet.

313
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,640
And P is water.

314
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,640
Yeah, cum is white P.

315
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,640
97% P.

316
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,640
It's P with sperms in it.

317
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,640
I mean, let's be scientific.

318
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Yeah, it's P with the sperms in it.

319
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,640
Yeah, which makes it white.

320
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,640
But it's not just white P. I mean, that's a bit simplistic.

321
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,640
Yo, let me get the P with the sperms in it.

322
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Sure, sure.

323
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Oh, you want the P with the sperms?

324
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:50,200
and the result is OMG it's a kid first you put the sperms on the grill then you

325
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,000
put the pee on the grill I love that guy yeah I mean so you see him we should go

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,720
to his bodega we maybe he needs us today maybe we need to go be the OC

327
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,880
protection force it's true yeah we need to ghost we need to be protecting the

328
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,880
subways.

329
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,880
Yeah.

330
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
I'm going to stand in front of all the subway entrances.

331
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:10,880
We need to be, what are they called?

332
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
The Angels?

333

336
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Red Berets?

337
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,680
I don't think we need to be in the Red Berets.

338
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,280
I think we could be in our own thing.

339
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,280
Yeah.

340
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
The Cool Berets.

341
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Well, if we-

342
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Well, Berets are kind of lame.

343
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,280
Berets are kind of like, artsy.

344
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
Yeah.

345
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,280
Well, let's-

346
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
I mean, what about the Cool Hats?

347
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Or like the-

348
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
Okay.

349
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
What about the-

350
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Top Hat Brigade.

351
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,280
Yeah, the Bowler Hat Brigade.

352
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
The White Angels.

353
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,440
Because there's, I mean, there's the blue angels there in the sky.

354
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Yeah.

355
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,240
What about the white angels I feel like would be in the snow.

356
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,280
Well, we need to also, we need it, I mean, we don't want to be angels because we want

357
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
to scare the bad guys.

358
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,280
The brown angels.

359
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
We can do the brown angels.

360
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,280
What about the like...

361
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,280
The earth, the ground.

362
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,280
Yeah, we could be in Brownsville.

363
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,280
The evil devils.

364
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,880
We can be in, yeah, because what's scarier to a bad guy than punishment for his crime?

365
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
The devil.

366
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,880
Retribution.

367
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,880
Yeah.

368
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:03,880

- I don't like it.

401
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,600

00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,440
- I mean, and think about it.

403
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,840
When you go over the turnstile,

404
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,340
What touches the turnstile? Either your butt or your wiener.

405
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,540
Yeah, and then I'm over there and I'm-

406
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,940
And then respectable guys like me-

407
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,440
And then my mouth is on it.

408
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,240
Who push the turnstile with both my hands and then lick my hands to get better grip-

409
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:31,740
Also-

410
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,740
When I'm trying to push the turnstile-

411
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:35,740
Listen, I've put on a few pounds. Sometimes I get stuck in the turnstile.

412
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:39,240
I gotta lube myself up with my spit by licking every fucking inch of the thing-

413
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:39,740
Yeah.

414
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,440
To get out of there.

415
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,240
And what's on there? A criminal's fleas.

416
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,440
Great. Now it's a criminal-

417
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,940

00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,640
Poop crumbs out a criminal's rectum.

00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,940
You know who'd be really disappointed?

423
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:54,940
Lady Liberty.

424
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,940
No, that's the thing.

425
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,980
Your rectum won't touch the turnstile if you're not pressing up against it, putting your weight

426
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,580
on it as you vault over it like some kind of evil Olympian.

427
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:04,100
Remember that guy that died hopping the turnstile?

428
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,900
Like his foot got clipped and then he just like fell.

429
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,940

Yep, you go in the Darwin Awards.

433
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,660
This guy was so low IQ he thought he could jump over a turnstile.

434
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,300
I want to start the Prick Head Awards.

middle school, and I read some of it, and there definitely were a bunch in

443
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,300
there. They're like this eighteen year old kid like had tried to have sex by

444
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,740
the side of the road, and he got run over by a car. What an idiot, it's just

00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,980
a thousand ways to die. Yeah, they should call it a thousand ways to die and

446
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,380
keep the Darwin Awards for animals that evolved into something cool. The good

447
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,340
of the the dinosaurs and the chickens. It's like a razor, a razor shark. Mm-hmm. The one

448
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,980
good thing about it is that it's not like just ways people dies. They also counted

449
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,860
if you accidentally cut off your wiener. There are a bunch of good accidentally

450
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:38,500
cutting off wiener stories. So it's either you stop yourself from reproducing. It's either death. This man cheated on his wife and his crazy wife Lorena.

451
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:46,140
What is that? We're getting an alert. Avoid the area of third ave to fifth ave from

20th to 4th to 40th Street in Brooklyn. Emergency personnel are on scene of an

453
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:57,000

Yep

462
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,040
Metal I got a prick head award to give out

463
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,560
Where is this fucking piece of dog crap the dumbest guy that died today?

464
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:50,160
Darwin Awards for everybody who was on their phone when they got shot in the head

465
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,460
They're probably probably some people wearing freaking air pods. I didn't even hear it. Do you wait? Oh my god

466
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:59,280
I just smiled thinking that maybe a hipster died today. Oh

467
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,800
My god, do you think it was probably drinking a cup of coffee?

468
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,080
Then he got his head blown off with a shotgun

469
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,880
gun. Yeah, his head probably got shot, didn't fly off because it was held on by his damn

470
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,440
scarf. Oh wow. Yeah. His head's held on for infinity because of the damn scarf. Yeah,

471
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,880
infinity scarf, yeah. Probably his glasses frames were so thick it repelled the bullet

472
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:25,880
that headed towards his eye like Superman and he survived to annoy another man. Yep,

473
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,480
I'll live to annoy another day. Yep. To complain another day about my avocado toast not having

00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,200
enough probably like five layers of flannel and it's like Kevlar yeah it's

475
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,040

00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,920
latte and a glass bottle yeah what what's the law like Kevlar

477
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:52,400
yeah yeah his name's Lars he's probably drink his bulletproof coffee yeah yeah

478
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,840
that's right I think hipsters would drink bulletproof coffee I think that's

479
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,720
a good American brand run by Patriot not a brand yeah it is no you're thinking

480
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,420

- Yeah.

484
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,800
Bulletproof is just you put butter in it instead of cream.

485
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,960
- That makes it bulletproof to do that?

486
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,000
- Supposedly.

487
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080

569
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,580
- Who, you said someone sent it?

00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,120

00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,620

572
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,460
- Thank you Max.

573
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,280
- Thank you Max.

574
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,120
- Thank you Max.

575
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,120
- The top 10 worst toys of all time.

576
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:58,960
- Oh no.

577
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,780
- On top10s.com.

578
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,080
I don't wanna read this.

579
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,280
- Yeah, let's just skip it.

580
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,720
This sounds like it's probably some bullshit.

581
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,620
- Sounds biased.

582
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,460
- Yeah.

583
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,420
- Yeah, what do you call the killer back?

584
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,420
Yeah, hold on.

585
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,420
See what he's up to.

586
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,420
Yeah, wait, hold on.

587
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:12,420
You know, one of the worst toys ever is the killer phone.

588
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:13,420
Scout!

589
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
Let's count on the phone!

590
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:15,420
Officer, we have his name.

591
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,420
It's Scout.

592
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
His name is Scout, he is a dog, he hangs out with a frog.

593
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,420
I have information that could lead to the killer's arrest.

594
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
He's a dog named Scout and he's trapped in this phone.

595
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
Yes, he hangs out with a leapfrog.

596
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
He loves counting hats and butterflies.

597
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,420
And he says, "Counting hats and butterflies."

598
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
And he says, "Counting hats and butterflies."

599
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,420
And he says, "Counting hats and butterflies."

600
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,420
And he says, "Counting hats and butterflies."

601
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,420
And he says, "Counting hats and butterflies."

602
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:31,420
He's a dog named Scout and he's trapped in this phone.

603
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
Yes, he hangs out with a leap frog.

604
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,420
He loves counting hats and butterflies.

605
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
And he says goodbye.

606
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:42,420
He's very polite.

607
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
Alright, I'm off the phone with Scout.

608
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,420
Alright, well Scout, that's good information.

609
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,420
When that comes out, they'll have already caught him by the time this comes out.

610
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,420
Yeah, by the time this comes out, they'll know we knew first.

611
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:55,320
know we knew for all know that it was scout. They all know that they they

612
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,620
raided his house. They found they found over five hats over six butterflies.

613
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:06,320
It's time to Apple's 1059 a.m. On Tuesday, April 12th, 2022. So, you

614
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,620
know, it's like a like off the streets is weak table.

615
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:16,320
Five ads, six butterflies, two apples, nine caterpillars.

616
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,560
(laughter)

617
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:25,640
- So stupid.

618
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,200
And one big gift.

619
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,860
- I love a big gift.

620
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,700
- Okay.

621
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,520
- One gun.

622
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,360
- All right.

623
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,500
- And a bazooka.

624
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,340
- Yeah.

625
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,280
- Number one worst toy of all time is doggy do board game.

626
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
- I'm gonna have to agree,

627
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,560
'cause I've never even heard of this game.

628
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,640
- My sibling is FaceTiming me.

629
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,480
Hold up.

630
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
decline.

631
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
One second.

632
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,400
Okay, doggy doo board game.

633
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,160
What would even be the point of a doggy doo board game?

634
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,600
Yeah, that doesn't sound fun.

635
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,280
What kind of, does a dog just poop out a bone?

636
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:08,360
Dogs poop out, well dog poop is like closest to, I heard, like cat poop.

637
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,680
You heard, you tasted, you mean.

638
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,600
I heard it tastes almost identical to dog turds.

639
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,960
when I hear and poop are similar yeah in some I never thought of that is similar.

640
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,640
I didn't say they're the same. No, you're that's what a lot of people will.

641
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:25,920
There's definitely a lot of a lot of parallels between turns and poop yeah

642
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:31,040
yeah, what do you perpendicular the Venn diagram is a lot different. The true is

643
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,640
but the Venn diagram of turds poop and do

644
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,680
where do you think like how much overlap is there? Do you think so? Let's be

645
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,000
Scooby would be just do only

646
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
There's no Scooby turds.

647
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Oh you haven't.

648
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Oh he, okay.

649
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,200
We won't talk about that today.

650
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
We have a four quadrant Venn diagram.

651
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Okay.

652
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,200
Do we want to draw this out?

653
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,200
Yeah.

654
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Melvin. Melvin do.

655
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
You're adding things into the circles already.

656
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,200
What did we say?

657
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,200
It's turds, poop,

658
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,200
do and crap and snacks.

659
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Snacks.

660
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,960
Snacks. Snacks. So over and then overlap. So wait how do you do a four

661
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,120
Venn diagram? Well you got to figure out what's in it first and then you draw the

662
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,440
overlaps. So we're doing. That's not how you draw a Venn diagram. Do you know what a Venn

663
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,280
diagram is? Yeah but we don't know how much overlap is between the different

664
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:33,120
circles. This is more of like a compass. A Venn diagram. To do a four one you'd have to go

665
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,120
around. No, this is what we're doing.

666
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:46,360
See, look at that. Okay, so between do and snacks, you have

667
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:46,960
Scooby.

668
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,000
Okay, but this can't be this isn't this doesn't work as a Venn

669
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,600
diagram because these two, the two ones opposite each other,

670
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:57,000
they don't what if these two share something that these two

671
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,400
don't have, you can't put it in there. They don't have for a

672
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,600
four side event diagram. It doesn't work like that. They

673
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,860
I don't have anything to comment.

674
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,700
- It's too small, too.

675
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,960
How am I gonna write anything in this one?

676
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,800
- There's more, I think.

677
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,000
- I was just showing, that was a proof of concept.

678
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,040
- I think we do a three one.

679
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,600
I don't think we have snacks in there.

680
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,580
I don't think snacks really enter into it.

681
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:14,000
I think you just wanted to add snacks 'cause you're hungry.

682
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,120
- No, but we could put like chips and stuff in there.

683
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,800
- All right, so you know, here's how it works.

684
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,640
Let me see.

685
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,200
So, proof of concept here.

686
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,720
So it's more like this.

687
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,240
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

688
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,480
That's a three, no, no, no, no.

689
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Yeah, actually let's put, we'll click and then there's one big one.

690
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,480
And this Venn diagram is everything.

691
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
Let me show you something.

692
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,480
You haven't even let me draw a single Venn diagram yet.

693
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
Don't use that on here.

694
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:46,480
Don't use that on here.

695
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
I'm taking it away.

696
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,480
You guys lost the privilege.

697
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,480
What?

698
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,480
But I want to diagram some shit.

699
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,480
Me and Caleb will use this one.

700
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
You don't get anything.

701
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Here's what I'm envisioning.

702
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
We have our own.

703
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,480
Yep.

704
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Oh, I'm having so much fun making our Venn diagram over here.

705
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
It's not a Venn diagram.

706
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:18,800
I

707
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,800
This is the four way Venn diagram.

708
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Okay, here's what, here's how I think the Venn diagram should look.

709
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Okay, so you start off, there's four, there's four, okay there's four right here, right?

710
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:43,800
Look guys, and then each of these can share with each other like this, and then maybe we have one that's like this, and then like that.

711
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,800
And then this way there's a different intersection between all of them.

712
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,640
between all of them.

713
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,480
- Hold on, all right.

714
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,160
- That's a bunch of gobbledy goo.

715
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,120
- There's one four way.

716
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,360
- Is this what science is about these days?

717
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,780
- So maybe we start with like a big.

718
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,620
- Big circle?

719
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,440
- Big circle.

720
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,040
So this is like the one where everything is most similar to.

721
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:00,880
- Okay, cool.

722
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,720
- Right?

723
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,720
And then just two here.

724
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,120
- Two little ones at the bottom.

725
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,880
- And then one that kind of like fills.

726
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,760
- A longer one.

727
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:11,600
- Yeah, and then.

728
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,520
- Yeah, okay.

729
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,720
- All right, I'm liking this.

730
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,960
- Then these two here.

731
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,400
this is this is just stuff that's similar to this one.

732
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:23,640
Mm-hmm. And that's how they connect. And then there's also there's a connection

733
00:34:23,640 --> 00:34:28,920
here and that's the Squidward diagram. Oh that does look like Squidward. It does look a

734
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:34,440
lot like Squidward. I think we'll put turds up here. Uh-huh. And we can leave the other

735
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,080
ones open. Yeah. All right. Yeah. That looks pretty good then. It looks just like

736
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,960
Squidward where he has turds in his brain. Yeah. I think we figured it out.

737
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:46,640
Doggy Do Board Game. It's a Squidward style game. Yeah. What obsession do people have

738
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:50,440
with dogs doing their business? There are way too many movies, books, games,

739
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,000
and toys about dog poop and pee. Seriously, Doggy Do? What movie is about dog poop?

740
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,180
I can't think about a dog poop movie or book. Yeah. Seriously, Doggy Do? You

741
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:04,960
have to collect dog crap? What kind of game is that? Why would anyone want to

742
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,880
collect dog crap in the first place? Plus, the get a life and rub the whale thing

743
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,400
were kind of funny. I'm out. This game is crap. Is this a real game?

744
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
This is Mark Cuban. Mark Cuban said that.

745
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
This is one of those...

746
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,600
Sharks... I have a board game that will revolutionize the way that kids think about poop.

747
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,880
This is one of those games that is recommended for two-year-old boys.

748
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,280
It makes disgusting noises when the poop is about to come out and yes, the poop can be red.

749
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
And then once it's dropped the poop, it eats it again.

750
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Okay. I need to see this.

751
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,640
This is probably teaching kids that if you want a pet puppy, you're going to be the one that cleans its...

752
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,640
dot dot dot... droppings.

753
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,060
- I need to see the doggie do board game.

754
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,380
- Where does droppings factor in?

755
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,540
- I don't know.

756
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:45,880
Is there droppings in this?

757
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,080
I thought it was a do game.

758
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,180
- It said clean its droppings.

759
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,600
- I gotta look at doggie do board game.

760
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,440
See if this is right.

761
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,460
- 'Cause if I drop my goldfish snacks on the floor,

762
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,640
that's droppings too.

763
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,600
- Yeah, true. - That's not poo.

764
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,720
That's snack, that's the overlap of snacks and--

765
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,960
- Oh God, it's a real God damn game.

766
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,520
- Oh no, what's wrong with this generation?

767
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,360
- What's wrong with this generation?

768
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,720
- You're saying that like you're upset.

769
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,560
- Yeah, I am upset.

770
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,400
- Let me see it.

771
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,280
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.

772
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
Oh, nasty, that dog is brown.

773
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,280
Why is there a bee running away from his green noxious fart?

774
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Wait, they have doggie do corgi. They have one for different dogs.

775
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:22,280
Oh, God almighty, this is disgusting.

776
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:26,280
What the fuck? And look at this. This one's called "Don't Step In It."

777
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,280
This guy's about to step in a piece of shit.

778
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,280
What kind of fucking board games?

779
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:37,280
I mean, yeah, we went from legitimate business monopoly to shit like this.

780
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,800
Joe Brandon in office all of a sudden we got dog shit board games. Yeah, it's like okay

781
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,760
teach the kid to play with dog poo all day. And then look they got soggy doggy.

782
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,320
That's just not right. Like they got balls on it. He's gonna smell like fucking crap.

783
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,960
That's the tagline? Yeah. He smells like wet crap.

784
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,200
Number two worst toy of all time is baby wee wee. Yeah that's not a toy.

785
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,600
I'm gonna I'm gonna look this one up - okay, let me use Patrick song hmm you

786
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,320
might want to lose a blue a purple link

787
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:22,720
this is so inappropriate yet it's for four-year-olds first they have boy parts

788
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:29,440
and girl parts you have to pull their pants down and see them what whoa you

789
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:33,880
you pull down the baby's shorts and you just see his fucking penis and he pees

790
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,040
all over the place. Baby wee wee what are you doing man? How do you get the pee

791
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:42,960
into the baby? You get a... like you're like that must suck being a parent

792
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,600
having to like load pee into a baby like that. I wish I was built like this. Oh my

793
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:55,000
god. That is so scary. Oh my god. Listen to this comment. I was at a

794
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,140
this summer day care don't ask

795
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:00,500
and the door to our classroom is

796
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,540
locked. So we had to wait in the

797
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,540
preschool room. My younger sister

798
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,880
saw a box full of dolls and

799
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,180
started rummaging through it.

800
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,180
There were about six baby wee wee

801
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,080
dolls naked. She screamed and I

802
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,480
came to see what was going on. I

803
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,940
was so disgusted that I hid the

804
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,740
behind a shelf and get this. I'm

805
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,300
a girl and four of those stupid

806
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:19,080
dolls were boys. Wow yeah

807
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,400
interesting, but no one cares

808
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,480
which gender you are

809
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,920
through. Yeah, that's facts. Oh my God, dude. This is the weirdest day ever. I just got

810
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,120
a text. Phil, my dog, all his teeth are falling out. He's like losing all his baby teeth at

811
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:38,760
the same time. Wow. This is an awesome day. One doll is similar to this junk. Is this

812
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,360
a day? Something's wrong today. I'm half asleep. It's April Fool's Day. Dude, baby, apparently

813
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,680
there's a doll that has a fucking baby cock on it. Well, listen, I didn't get to finish

814
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,880
- Sorry. - One doll is similar to this

815
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,000
junk and it has a moving wee wee.

816
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,840
- No.

817
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,160
- I'm thinking about it right now

818
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,360
and I feel sick just thinking about it.

819
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,120
- Sue that company, actually seriously gross.

820
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,360
Who wants a plastic penis spraying wee?

821
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,200
(laughing)

822
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,660
I think the inventor needs to go to a mental asylum.

823
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:12,160
- Who puts a penis on a doll?

824
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,000
- Are you kidding me?

825
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,560
- Someone says, I'm sure some little girls

826
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,040
played with this dirty.

827
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,440
- Aw, come on. - What the hell?

828
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,880
very in a pro pro

829
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,040
yes, it got banned. It joined lawn darts, cabbage patch kids

830
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:27,440
and other band toys cabbage patch kids or what I have. I have

831
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,740
huge news for you guys. I don't know if you notice this. I

832
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,840
completely missed this. It happened last year in November

833
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:36,440
2021 a big toys news. I don't know if you guys are familiar

834
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,740
with the toy Hall of Fame, but

835
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:43,040
alongside American girl and alongside American girl dolls

836
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:47,440
sand was just inducted into the toy Hall of Fame and sand. Yeah,

837
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,360
Wow. Fed the beach? Just sand. Holy shit. That's huge. Look if you search Toy Hall of Fame sand.

838
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:01,120
Like? What would you already search before? Well yeah I mean I see here the Toy Hall. At the

839
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:07,120
Strong Museum. What's the Strong Museum? Into the Toy Hall of Fame. It's where the, it's where the.

840
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:10,800
I mean that's, we've been, listen, sand's been around a long time. Listen to this, listen to

841
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,800
this quote from the museum curator. I mean they found sand in the moon. "Sand has a global reach

842
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,720
that most toy manufacturers would envy. It's been a vehicle for play since

843
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,400
prehistory and anyone who has spent the day at the beach can understand

844
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,080
the allure of this toy. See that's the thing though, if it's like sand is

861
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:45,880
Dyson corn popper. That kid's having the time of his life. Look at this male model using it.

862
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:56,880
This guy calling any person, any person who's in like a toy commercial or something like that.

863
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:00,880
He's like, "I'm seeing all these freaking male models." Great, great. Look he's sucking his cheeks in.

866
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,240

a baby and had an attack there's somebody throwing the the riddler is on

868
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:37,220
the subway. No, just the idea of calling any person a male model. Like the fuckin, like

869
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:41,940
you ever see those like stock photos of like the fat guys eating wings? Like, "Oh look

870
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:47,180
at these fucking, I hate society's expectations. I have to compete with all these fucking male

871
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:52,020
models." "Look at these beauty standards. I'm supposed to look like this." "They want

872
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,020
people look like this. It's like the stock photo.

873
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,020
Yeah, Transylvanian vampire.

874
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,020
[Laughter]

875
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,020
Guy in a wheelchair at work.

876
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:02,020
Vampire in a grocery store.

877
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,020
Great, they want me to be in a wheelchair.

878
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:08,020
Oh, great, yeah. I'm sick of these fucking male models, dude.

879
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:13,020
Well, that's the thing about, yeah, now that we have, you know, models of all sizes and stuff,

880
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,020
I'm just going to be confused about what I should look like.

881
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:16,020
Exactly.

882
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,020
Yeah.

883
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,140
It used to be you know what you're supposed to look like and you're

884
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:25,980
supposed to look like you do heroin and wear black leather. Am I supposed to be fat?

885
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:29,900
Am I supposed to even have legs? Should I be chopping my legs off?

886
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:37,620
Oh it's like a guy in like husky jeans and he's holding like a

887
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,700
beer stein. It's just like oh great. Another fucking male model I have to look

888
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:53,780
like real-life Homer. Number three is Shopkins. I don't know. Shopkins I know.

889
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:58,740
I'm sure you do. The top comment here is an axe to grind about about

890
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,420
Shopkins. Shopkins look like little it's like the little food that has eyes and

891
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:06,680
stuff. Okay. What? So here's this comment. What now? Here's this comment here.

892
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:10,900
They are very different to Moshi Monsters figures and I will explain it to

893
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:16,660
to you. 1. Moshi Monsters characters only has like 5 food characters. 2. Moshi Monsters

894
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:21,620
characters are mostly animals with clothing or references to famous singers, etc. Broccoli

895
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:27,580
Spears, Britney Spear. 6. Shopkins are all food, all of them, not just 5, and they can

896
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:32,320
go on top of your pencils or pens. Moshi Monsters don't do that, and clearly a child must be

897
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:37,220
stupid if it happens to choke on one. These aren't bad toys. Problem solved.

898
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:41,380
- See, a Shopkin, you get the food it's supposed to be,

899
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:46,760
and then the little character next to it.

900
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:48,820
- So this is an eraser?

901
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:49,660
- I think.

902
00:44:49,660 --> 00:44:50,500
- That's what it says here.

903
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,720
I like throwing it, I like that they spend

904
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,480
the whole comment being like,

905
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,600
"Shopkins are not a ripoff of Moshi Monsters,"

906
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,500
and then they just sneak in.

907
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,320
"If a child chokes on a toy, it's stupid."

908
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,740
(laughing)

909
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:03,140
- See, they've got a kid's cuisine with eyes right there.

910
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:04,600
- Whoa.

911
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,100
- Okay, that's actually kind of awesome.

912
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,100
Shopkins are kind of tight.

913
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,820
Shopkins seem like a tight toy, yeah.

914
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:09,820
Might actually be cool.

915
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,380
We might need to get some Shopkins.

916
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,060
See, I'm more into just having the tiny food.

917
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:17,220
I'd rather have big food.

918
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:19,300
I like the characters.

919
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:24,940
I want proportionate, like big food as if the food we have right now is the small food.

920
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,620
You know what I mean?

921
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,620
Maybe like a room size.

922
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,620
That could be pretty big, yeah.

923
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,500
Can you imagine sitting down and eating one giant cornflake for dinner?

924
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,500
Oh my gosh.

925
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,500
Wouldn't that be so good?

926
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:35,580
Look, they got big Shopkins.

927
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:39,240
Pringle, well that's not a full-size Pringles can but it looks enough like one.

928
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,220
Also the ready-whipped, it doesn't even have the food in it dude I don't give a

929
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:48,540
fuck about the packaging. You know? You're style over substance. You

930
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:53,660
don't even want the food. No, I'd rather have the little version like a

931
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,980
tiny Dr. Pepper can. I bet you're one of these fuckers who watches a lady make a

932
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:16,800
a

933
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,900
over. He does does reviews of skateboard trucks. I've been watching those before

934
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:27,180
bed. Really? And it's so soothing. He's Canadian. He's like the turning of this

935
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,700
truck is actually pretty pretty similar to a... That sounds like the least

936
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:36,120
soothing voice I've ever heard. What about your perfect life means that you need to be soothed

937
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:41,140
before you go to bed? I can't sleep. That's why I'm tired. You can't sleep so you look

938
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,260
at your phone in bed? Yeah. Yeah. You still watch a... You have to read. You have to

939
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,260
expand your intellect. That's how you fall asleep.

940
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,260
Dude, throwing on, throwing on,

941
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,260
binging with Babish Chef's Cubanos

942
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:54,260
before bed. It's gonna keep you up all night. You're gonna be

943
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,260
thinking about the food. You're gonna be sitting there licking your lips.

944
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,260
I have a beautiful dream about eating their

945
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,260
Chef Cubano. You can barely fucking fall asleep because your lips are so wet.

946
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:02,260
I'm eating Jon Favreau's Cubano

947
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:04,260
and I'm married to

948
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,260
Sofia Bergara. Her name is, no.

949
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,260
You're not.

950
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,260
I'm the one who likes Chef.

951
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,260
I'm the Chef. You're not the guy who likes

952
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,260
Chef. How many fucking times, no,

953
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:16,020
Well you're not, you're the guy who kinda likes Chef.

954
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,020
No.

955
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,020
How many times have you seen Chef?

956
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:19,380
Probably like 15 times.

957
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:20,380
Lie.

958
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,380
That is a lie.

959
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,380
You're just lying.

960
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,380
No I'm not.

961
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,380
You're lying.

962
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:25,380
I've seen Chef 15 times.

963
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,380
That is such a fucking lie.

964
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,380
Nope.

965
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:28,380
That is bold of you.

966
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,380
Mm-mm.

967
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,380
You disgust me.

968
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:31,900
I've seen Chef 15 times.

969
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:35,620
You don't even have, you don't even understand what it's like to have divorced parents.

970
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,620
No but I- You watch that movie and you go, "Oh it's about

971
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:39,620
sandwiches, fuck you."

972
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,220
Yeah, it's about sandwiches.

973
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,220
No!

974
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:43,220
It's not!

975
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,220
It's about Cubano's-

976
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:51,420
about pasta a jolo, jolololo. It's for boys like me who have a fat dad and a hot Latino mom and

977
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:56,500
we and that's like the struggle of our lives. No the struggle is he that he

978
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:02,660
needs to go back to his roots and make sandwiches. No it's like no country for old

979
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:09,340
men it's not about chef it's about the son. It's a well the son plays TF2 and I

980
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:13,860
remember that. Guess what I played when I was a kid? Kick the ball. I played kick the ball.

981
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:19,780
Yeah. Is that different from kickball? Yeah. Yeah. Kick the ball is... You're by yourself.

982
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:25,900
You know why I was by myself? Dad was out on the food truck serving hot dogs and

983
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:29,180
hamburgers. He doesn't serve hot dogs and hamburgers on the food truck. He serves

1003
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:29,200
this

1004
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:49,000
a

1005
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:57,460
put an MTV in it yeah yep MTV video killed the radio star yeah and now they

1006
00:50:57,460 --> 00:51:02,360
don't even play music videos now it's all video on that's all a Rob Dyrdek's

1007
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:08,280
fucking ridiculous pussy the fact that they don't play music videos yeah Rob

1008
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:12,160
Dyrdek's fantasy factory I wish that I worked in a fantasy factory and we watch

1009
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,600
music videos but it's not Oh Rob it big and big and black what's the show called

1010
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:22,720
Robin big yeah what if I wanted to watch Rob well they had music on there oh true

1011
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,320
he had Bobby light Bobby light would sing here's a here's a sub list under Furby

1012
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:31,320
boom okay this is um these toys are annoying in many ways I'll give you ten

1013
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:36,320
reasons what is a Furby boom I think it's a type of Furby that one hooks one

1014
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:41,440
they never shut up - they're too gassy three they don't have an on/off switch so

1015
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:45,160
they wake up at any sudden movement and they turn off at any time for they say

1016
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:50,200
blah blah, which is rude. Five, they make all kinds of annoying sounds. Six, they

1017
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,800
have different personalities that are annoying. Seven, they speak some Furby

1018
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:58,280
language. Eight, newer versions have gone downhill. Nine, they do whatever they

1019
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:02,200
want. Ten, it takes long to change the personality depending on what it is. I

1020
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:05,720
can probably come up with more, but this is all I got right now. Do you remember

1021
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:10,280
speaking of, it wasn't a Furby, but they were like those like toys and they were

1022
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:17,540
like speakers. It's like a toy speaker you could play music on but it like it had

1023
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:23,000
like a face and like a little speaker for a mouth. You ever know anyone who had

1024
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:27,520
those the thing the video now that were just play like the shittiest version of

1025
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:33,160
a Nickelodeon show? Yeah, and then video now somehow like licensed something through Gameboy like

1026
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,040
Nintendo and then they had the video now cartridges and you could watch like a

1027
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:44,060
a Pokemon episode in like 180p on your Nintendo Gameboy which was like the worst

1028
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,140
thing ever cuz like the Gameboy screen you'd had to like sit under the Sun

1029
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:55,240
that's sick yeah I watched a photo finish the Pokemon episode Joe Fosso's

1030
00:52:55,240 --> 00:53:01,080
oh yeah Jodo Joto that region that region went hard yeah dude what region

1031
00:53:01,080 --> 00:53:07,560
are you from? Shino. Nice. That's what Cameron's from. He's from Shino. I'm from the ghetto.

1032
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:13,800
I'm from the ghetto region. Here's a comment on Furby Boom. This thing turns evil and starts

1033
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:17,880
chanting voodoo. Once you turn it on it won't stop babbling for like three hours. The only

1034
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,320
way to put it to sleep automatically is to pull its tail for ten seconds, but it wakes

1035
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:25,280
up so easily with any sudden movement. My sister's Furby went to sleep and never woke

1036
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:35,840
up Barbie yeah we get it yeah what is in bathing suits on it so there was they

1037
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:43,680
were called the zizzle what was an imaginary friend he had oh they were

1038
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,560
called a sizzle they were called the zizzle imaginary aliens oh I remember

1039
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:53,280
those remember that shit yeah remember those the little robot dogs they do a

1040
00:53:53,280 --> 00:54:00,400
back flip. The iDog. And you go, "Go dog, yeah! Go dog, yeah!" Mm-hmm. The iDog and then the...

1041
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:05,160
And that damn purple ketchup. Yeah. Low-key it tasted different, like grapes.

1042
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:10,280
Tastes like Shrek swamp. Mm-hmm. Tastes like Shrek swamp. Tastes like Shrek swamp.

1043
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:15,580
That's right, tastes like Shrek swamp! Number five is Barbie. I hate Barbie so

1044
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:19,200
much and I hate Mattel. I want to ban Barbie and burn them in a big bonfire.

1045
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,840
Barbie is a bad example for young children, teaching them to not eat and

1046
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,840
and care about their looks 24/7.

1047
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,840
It teaches, I guess Barbie doesn't eat.

1048
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:27,760
It's a really good point.

1049
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,400
- Yeah. - Barbie's always in the kitchen.

1050
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,240
- To have a perfect figure. - Doesn't eat.

1051
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,720
- Not for her. - For Ken, doesn't eat.

1052
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,480
- Barbie's so unrealistic. - It's a good message

1053
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,480
for boys. - And so stupid,

1054
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,160
yet so darn popular, why?

1055
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,320
Mattel makes a walkin' potty pup.

1056
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,400
What is with this world and stupid doggy doo-doo toys?

1057
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,960
The reason above is perfect.

1058
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:46,960
They also make Barbie with private girl parts

1059
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,880
and you're supposed to undress them and dress them up again.

1060
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:51,000
Where even could I find something like this?

1061
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:55,100
Who wants to stumble upon a naked Barbie doll? These dolls and lots of other dolls are so

1062
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:59,220
inappropriate and they should be banned. Barbie can go right down and shoot and so can Mattel.

1063
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:03,580
Barbie is a hoe. Let's be real, Barbie's a hoe-ish ass bitch.

1064
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:08,820
You know? Barbie's a hoe and they sweat. Ken deserves better. Ken deserves better than Barbie.

1065
00:55:08,820 --> 00:55:13,940
Did you see, there was supposed to be a Barbie movie starring Amy Schumer?

1066
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:17,180
Really? Yeah. Well she looks just like her.

1067
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:23,940
She yeah, she's the most gorgeous woman of all time. Yep, but they she dropped out for creative differences. I

1068
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,180
Think there is a huge glaring creative difference. Yeah, she was to you

1069
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:34,140
I did I'd know I didn't say this. I just read this on my phone

1070
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:37,180
Yeah, apparently when she was in the movie it was called Carby. I

1071
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:46,360
Didn't that wasn't that doesn't come from me that's from that's from a bar beer the Barbie report news.com

1072
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:50,360
I just got a notification. Okay, so.

1073
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:55,360
Amy Schumer reportedly leaving the set of Barbie after creative differences.

1074
00:55:55,360 --> 00:56:02,360
Schumer claims, "I wanted to have four wheels but flesh and roll around like I was a car."

1075
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:09,360
This comes only days after she was traumatized by the slap at the Oscars

1076
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:15,360
where she said, "I need one million hamburgers to quell my rage."

1077
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:20,640
page. She said I give me a win. She said give me a win. Dixie grocery bag full of

1078
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,080
groceries to the VIP

1079
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:29,520
yeah. I heard she well. I yeah, I heard this again. Yeah, I heard I heard that

1080
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,160
she walked into the audition by accident, 'cause she thought it was

1081
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:32,880
barbecue

1082
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:40,240
and that's from the top. I did that that's come straight from the

1083
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:46,520
director Quentin Tarantino. That's from Sources. He's directing the Barbie movie.

1084
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:53,520
Oh man. Okay we got a. She is fat. Oh. What are you talking about? She's so

1085
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:58,520
beautiful. Number six, Pee and Poo plush toys. Pee and Poo? My cousins have a

1086
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:03,520
plush pee toy. No joke. I didn't know they made Pee and Poo plush toys. I

1087
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,520
thought that like. When I take a pee that shit is plush. They had that show

1088
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:11,520
Pee and Poo. They had that show. They had that show Pee and Poo. Pee and Jordan

1089
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:17,280
when they had their show. That was a really good show. Yeah. Pee again and poop.

Pee again and poop. Pee again. Yep. Pee again and poop. Pee again and poop. Yep.

1091
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:32,080
Yeah. Number seven breastfeeding baby doll. I like the breastfeeding. The

1092
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:36,200
first half, you get you happy in the first half. Yeah. But in the second half

1093
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:41,000
it actually has the word baby in it. Yeah. Disgusting. Yeah. It's like okay. Are you

1094
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,600
- As a kid, are you supposed to put this fucking baby

1095
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,840
on your nipple?

1096
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,280
- Here's how it goes, it's like--

1097
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,460
- What the hell's wrong with these goddamn--

1098
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,020
- Breast, breast, okay.

1099
00:57:50,020 --> 00:57:50,860
- Does it come with a breast?

1100
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:51,900
- Feeding.

1101
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:52,740
- All right.

1102
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:53,560
- Yep, I'm with you.

1103
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,260
- Baby, huh?

1104
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,720
Doll, no!

1105
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:58,100
- No thank you, that's a girl thing.

1106
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:58,940
- That's basically, yeah.

1107
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:01,000
- Yeah, baby and doll, okay, breast and feeding,

1108
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,000
those are two boyfriend things.

1109
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,680
Baby and doll, two girl things.

1110
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,080
- Yeah. - Don't like it.

1111
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:09,080
- I was born at, I was born five.

1112
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,480
- You were born five?

1113
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:17,200
I was in the baby. You skipped baby? Yeah. What the? That's not true. It's true. Yeah,

1114
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:22,160
I came out of my mom five. I was full head of hair. I was in there. I mean, I was in

1115
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:28,200
there for five. Five years full? Yeah. Full term? I was in, they were giving me cakes

1116
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,880
in there. What? Birthday, I had birthdays. You blow candles out of your mom's snatch?

1117
00:58:33,880 --> 00:58:37,800
Yeah, okay, our belly button don't be nasty.

1118
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:40,040
(laughing)

1119
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,240
Sorry, that's my bad.

1120
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:44,480
Yeah, I went back in at six, I came out nine.

1121
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:46,160
I think we should get a sizzle for the office.

1122
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,680
I'm thinking about going back in,

1123
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,980
cooking a little longer.

1124
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:52,520
Come back in for six and come out for nine.

1125
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,640
I'm preparing for a role, I'm jumping back in there.

1126
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:56,080
Yeah, I just need, I only need one year out

1127
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,920
'cause I need to do some things.

1128
00:58:57,920 --> 00:58:59,340
I need a sabbatical.

1129
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:02,520
Yeah, oh my God, it's too warm in there.

1130
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:07,060
to try my dad next. I'm going to crack a window. We should install a window on our moms and

1131
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:14,460
jump back in them. No. I think I like my life out here. No, but remember inside though? Inside

1132
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:19,260
was fire. I got pretty much bullied all the time when I was in the inside. Y'all remember

1133
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:24,580
that song that I always play? I love that song. And then every once in a while you'd

1134
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:28,820
have like, you'd hear your dad say, "I'm going to kill you when you get out of here." Yeah,

1135
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:30,820
That'd be awesome. Yeah.

1136
00:59:30,820 --> 00:59:31,540
Yeah. So cool.

1137
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:36,820
I actually like outside, because when I was in there, basically, the world was a vampire.

1138
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,540
When I was in there, everything was mad red. It was fucking sick.

1139
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,040
Yeah.

1140
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:42,700
Everything was just red and just pulsating all the time, you know?

1141
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,200
Yeah.

1142
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
And I'm just in there doing backflips and shit.

1143
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:45,700
Yeah.

1144
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,700
My parents would be like, "Will you move out, please?"

1145
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:48,880
I just kept trying to...

1146
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:52,620
My mom was eating, like, the food that I had to eat in there was disgusting.

1147
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:54,880
My mom was eating fucking...

1148
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:58,140
She would get a chicken parm sub with mayo and pickles.

1149
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:02,780
plus it had that string you can just tango. I was I was feasting on the

1161
01:00:57,260 --> 01:01:01,300

1162
01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:05,260
cigarette out of her hand and then back in, put it in her other hand. So here's

1163
01:01:05,260 --> 01:01:10,140
two cigarettes in each hand. Number eight is aqua dots. Top comment is, "Watch out

1164
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:13,660
parents, the next tiny ball you might buy for your children could include date rape."

1165
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,420
And the comment after that, which is a nice follow-up to that, "So this toy

1166
01:01:17,420 --> 01:01:22,220
includes date rape." Keep that in mind. It just says that. "Aqua dots should have been for ages

1167
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,500
eight and up instead of four and up. I mean I agree based on that first comment.

1168
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,340
I don't know anything about the thing. Yeah number nine is Kinder Surprise.

Dangerous. Oh the eggs? Yeah. I want those. They're good but you can't have Kinder eggs.

They're illegal. Number ten is I didn't know this was a toy. Hitler doll. And the only

1171
