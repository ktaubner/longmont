1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I wanna play.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
*snoring*

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Why's this shit so quiet for my bitch ass?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
*burp*

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
*music*

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
*music*

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
*music*

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
*music*

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What's up all my chuggers?

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
*burp*

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
*burp*

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
*music*

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
*music*

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Beer's we drank, motherfucker, with Jubio, Caleb, and Rex.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Beer.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Here.

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
My.

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Beer.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Here it goes.

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
You're fingering it?

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh!

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,080
A fail open!

23
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,760
We have our first ever fail open on the show, guys.

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,920
You can't fail the first open of the year.

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
That's a bad omen.

26
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,920
It's really bad.

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,560
This is so bad, dude.

28
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,560
Look at that.

29
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,080
Can you see that? Oh my god, that's completely failed. Completely failed. Can I open it? Oh,

30
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:09,720
I've opened it with my finger. I thought that the the can said beer on it. Well, I guess I'll go

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:16,520
first then, man. This is another episode where my wife has picked a beer out for me and I'm

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:23,400
gonna say it, she kind of knocked it out of the park in terms of interesting and uniquality. This

33
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,880
is a regular beer.

34
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:33,240
So this is a funny type of beer that has a fully white label.

35
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:39,040
It says regular beer in some very normal font.

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,280
I don't know what you call this, some sans serif font.

37
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:46,960
And it says a beer that tastes like beer, all lowercase.

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,760
And then a period.

39
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm going to give this a lick.

40
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,920
That sounds perfect to me.

41
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,760
And honestly, that is a wonderful beer, you guys.

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,040
That is pretty good.

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,600
It had I mean, it looks like a card that is against humanity,

44
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,940
but it tastes like a beer that is for Caleb.

45
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:09,600
I'm going to give this a seven point eight out of ten guys.

46
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,440
And let me close my door so you don't hear the madman echoing through my house.

47
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,280
I wouldn't want to give you guys a taste of real entertainment

48
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,580
and realize that podcasts are really not that good. What?

49
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
What?

50
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:27,860
7'8" and in terms of a basketball player, I'm going to say this is OG Ananobi, recently

51
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,860
traded to the Knicks.

52
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,780
Went from my favorite team to my second favorite team.

53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:34,780
He I believe is 6'9" or 6'8".

54
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:39,580
I feel like the NBA is so in right now.

55
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,580
It's trending.

56
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,060
The NBA is trending in a major way, guys.

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:47,820
Okay, let me see what you have to offer.

58
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,700
What does that say to you?

59
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,540
- That says to me a dos Equis.

60
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,820
That is a dos Equis.

61
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,100
- This is fully a dos Equis Sprite beer.

62
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,640
- I love a dos Equis Lager Especial.

63
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,360
- That is lovely.

64
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,300
- I'm a bigger fan.

65
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,940
I love the dos Equis.

66
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,340
I really love the dos Equis Amber.

67
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,880
In a big glass that has the same amount of,

68
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,220
it's like a bulletproof glass that they serve it in

69
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,780
at Mexican restaurants.

70
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,880
and they put about five limes in it,

71
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,720
that to me is a perfect beer.

72
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,560
That's a 10.

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,400
- That sounds like a beautiful summer snack

74
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,880
for an awesome winter day that I'm experiencing.

75
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,840
- So true.

76
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,740
I'm sorry that it's 68 degrees

77
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,760
in the frozen tundras of Mexico.

78
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,600
- I don't know what that means.

79
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,440
Is this like a special one?

80
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,280
This is really good.

81
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,240
I really like this.

82
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,080
I could really imagine--

83
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,480
- That's just a normal Dos Neques.

84
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,360
- You just saying that putting limes and salt in it

85
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,600
really put me in that.

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,640
I never really ever have that craving,

87
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,560
but this is like the first time I've ever had it

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,400
in my entire life.

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,360
- Go ahead, put some Limone in that.

90
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
- I don't wanna do that.

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,680
I don't wanna go downstairs and do all that shit.

92
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,840
- But I know you have some.

93
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,680
Don't lie to me, bitch.

94
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,520
- I do actually have some.

95
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,280
- Of course you do.

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,640
- Yeah, this is great.

97
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,880
This is actually also a seven out of 10 for me.

98
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,400
- Why is it 7.8?

99
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,600
- This is 7.8 and the exact thing

100
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,000
the tech NBA player that Caleb said.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,840
- Okay, stealer vibes.

102
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,680
- That's what I'm thinking.

103
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,240
- Moving on to somebody who won't steal my shit, Rex.

104
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,480
I am so, for the first time I'm jealous of you guys

105
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,640
'cause I don't have a beer today.

106
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,880
Instead, I will be drinking a mixed drink,

107
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,640
which I will now make.

108
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,480
- Reveal.

109
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,360
Oh, a live demonstration, Bill Nye.

110
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,620
(laughing)

111
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,600
This is amazing.

112
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,680
- Wait, no, go all the way down, go all the way down.

113
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,520
Go all the way down.

114
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:39,340
- This is ingenuity.

115
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,960
- I wanna see the table.

116
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,640
- And I'm sure that this is gonna be many ingredients.

117
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,560
(laughing)

118
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,400
Okay.

119
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,080
- The food is on the table.

120
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,800
- Okay, so just guessing off this,

121
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,240
it's gonna be water, Mezcal, and Diet Coke.

122
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
- You wish.

123
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
- And maybe one vape.

124
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,920
- I have the botanist gin.

125
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,400
- Okay, I like that gin.

126
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,620
- So we get some of this,

127
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,840
and I think I'm gonna do like, maybe like, let's see.

128
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,000
One, two, three, four, five.

129
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
- Oh my God.

130
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Oh my god, man. You are gonna be gone.

131
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:27,060
And then for my mix, I have Stuart's Fountain Classics Key Lime.

132
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,560
Oh, this sounds pretty good to me.

133
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,560
And you're gonna fill that sucker all the way up. And no ice, by the way.

134
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,560
There is six little ice cubes in there.

135
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,560
Oh my god, I didn't see them at all.

136
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,560
The bubble glass is really fucking with me.

137
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,060
The bubble glass is confusing.

138
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
Well, these are what I had.

139
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:50,060
Alright, so now the taste.

140
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,060
Just give it a little swirl. Use, uh...

141
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:57,060
Yeah, the spoon I was in the ice cream with a couple years...

142
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,060
A couple days ago.

143
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,060
The last year, yeah. You know.

144
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,060
For the year prior.

145
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,060
Okay. And now, the taste.

146
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,060
And the rating.

147
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
Oh my god.

148
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,060
Amazing.

149
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,060
That's so good.

150
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,060
That's so good.

151
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Whoa!

152
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,420
That sounds really good.

153
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,020
That's a nice floral gin.

154
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,460
And I don't know what that soda is but it seems like a boutique soda right up my alley.

155
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,540
I want to jump in front of this.

156
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,060
Before this is too high, too much space.

157
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,820
Before you rate this, I think you have to name it.

158
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,060
I mean this is just what a gimlet is.

159
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,980
It's a gimlet that I'm too lazy to make.

160
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,100
This is the soda gimlet.

161
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,040
But a gimlet is served in a coupe.

162
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,540
And this is in a bubble glass.

163
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,260
So tell me what this is called.

164
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
You have to name it.

165
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,260
It's something new.

166
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,260
The Gremlin.

167
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,260
The Gremlin!

168
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,260
I love that.

169
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,300
Yeah, the Gremlin.

170
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:04,140
Because this is a true low effort, kind of disgusting version of a gimlet.

171
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,140
Well cheers my friend.

172
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,140
Give me a rating.

173
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,140
*snort*

174
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,140
*laughter*

175
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,140
*sigh*

176
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,140
Well, I made it a little strong.

177
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,140
I saw! I saw that with my eyes.

178
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,140
Uh, so...

179
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
Wow.

180
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:23,140
It's very tasty. This key lime soda is really good.

181
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,140
I'm gonna say this is like a solid 8 out of 10.

182
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,140
Wow! I'd have to get myself one of these.

183
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:32,140
I'm no longer jealous of your beer, Julio.

184
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,140
I wasn't jealous of your beer, really, but I did...

185
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
Cue bitch!

186
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,140
You love those seconds?

187
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Regular beer?

188
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,140
Yeah.

189
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:46,380
Well, guys, we are back after the holiday hiatus.

190
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,380
I'm going to say it, man.

191
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,940
My life has been an absolute train wreck without this show.

192
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,260
Nothing has gone right.

193
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:57,540
I feel myself drifting ever further away from both of you and our friendships.

194
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:03,660
I don't like this feeling of not doing this show, and I am relieved to be back in the

195
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
saddle.

196
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,660
I had a good time.

197
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Well, fuck you, man.

198
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,660
Yeah, man. Me and Rex have been struggling.

199
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,660
What is your fucking problem?

200
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:15,660
Yeah, we're trying to say that we miss each other and you're immediately saying that it was actually better than...

201
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,660
I didn't say it was better than ever.

202
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,660
I did miss talking to you guys.

203
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,660
Wait, do you have a problem with us?

204
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,660
No.

205
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,660
I kind of sensed that off of you, this kind of weird combative energy from you recently.

206
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,660
No, I...

207
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,660
Do you think you're too good to podcast with us?

208
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,660
That's how I feel at all.

209
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,660
Guys, it's the new year.

210
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,660
It's the new year.

211
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,660
Instant deflection.

212
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,660
Tell me how your new year's was, guys.

213
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,660
Because mine was not all that exciting.

214
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,660
I tried to leave the party before it was midnight.

215
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Which I learned is some kind of faux pas.

216
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,660
On New Year's Eve, you're supposed to stay until midnight.

217
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
I don't think so.

218
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
Tell me your thoughts.

219
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
I think it's fine.

220
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:58,660
I was not invited to the party you were at.

221
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,660
You were not invited?

222
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,660
invited to the party you were at.

223
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,140
- You literally were.

224
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,060
You quite literally were.

225
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,900
(laughing)

226
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,720
- Wait a minute.

227
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,940
You were just saying that you missed our friendship.

228
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,500
- Should we invite everybody who's over there?

229
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,700
I said, yeah.

230
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,860
Invite everybody who's over at Cozy.

231
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,580
- First of all. - And he texted Noah.

232
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,580
- Right, first of all, he texted Noah,

233
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,340
which that's not an invite to me.

234
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,540
That's an invite to Noah. - Okay, wait, hang on.

235
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,620
I gotta make you

236
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,460
pump the brakes. - We didn't know

237
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,300
that you were there. - Wait, wait, wait.

238
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,140
- We didn't know you were there.

239
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,380
- You guys have to pump the brakes

240
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:28,140
and go all the way back

241
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,740
and tell the full context of what this is,

242
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,300
- What's going on?

243
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:35,020
- Me, Cam, Patrick, and our lovely girlfriends

244
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,500
and wives and fiancés,

245
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,740
went to Jack Bensinger of Joy Tactics Podcast

246
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,420
and I Love Comedy Video Magazine.

247
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,660
- Celebrity party. - And the Bear,

248
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,220
a famous celebrity.

249
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,220
We went to his celebrity party,

250
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,700
celebrities crawling around.

251
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,700
And Noah asked if people wanted to go to Cozy Corner,

252
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,660
which is a bar that we go to a lot.

253
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,760
And I had said, I wanted to go to that,

254
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,660
but I had said yes to this like weeks and weeks ago.

255
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,840
So I went to this and I thought,

256
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,700
we'll stay for a little bit and then we'll leave.

257
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,980
We get there, everybody wants to continue being there

258
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,500
when I wanna go to Cozy Corner.

259
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,740
'Cause I wanted to go to Cozy Corner,

260
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:16,740
it's right near my house, I wanted to have one drink

261
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,300
and then maybe stay till midnight and then go home.

262
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,660
And Amron asked, should we invite everybody?

263
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:26,200
And I'm like, you know what, fuck it, sure.

264
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,700
Let's stay here for a little bit and have a hundred dollar Uber back.

265
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,820
And so we invited, he invited through Noah,

266
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,260
everybody that was at the bar and get this guys,

267
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,820
zero people came. So who was actually abandoned? Who was actually abandoned?

268
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,740
Okay. I think that Noah,

269
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,660
I think he's probably like the worst conduit conduit to invite people to a

270
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,780
thing. Number one.

271
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:56,100
But I think at this point the three of you should have known that and should not

272
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,640
have gone through in order to invite everyone?

273
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,920
- I had jungle juice, man.

274
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,160
I was not legally responsible

275
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,760
for any single decision that I made, okay?

276
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
I felt proud that we even thought about anybody

277
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,320
who was not in that room.

278
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,760
And Rex, if it makes you, if it puts you at ease,

279
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,880
the party was not that fun, man.

280
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,760
The only fun part was that they had,

281
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,000
that Jack had a, and sorry, Jack,

282
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,280
it was, you know, no New Year's party

283
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,520
is gonna be that fun to me.

284
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:29,340
there was a bottle of smelling salts that we all took turns

285
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,200
breathing in really really hard

286
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,220
that was the fun part of the party

287
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,600
that's awesome man

288
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,360
and i would like to say one thing about that which is that we were doing the

289
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,760
smelling salts and all smelling it and going

290
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,640
shit like so bad like having crazy bad reactions

291
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,920
stanky leg

292
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,200
running around the room

293
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,400
and then thomas from pendejo time comes over

294
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,320
and we're like thomas you gotta do the smelling salts

295
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,460
and everybody's holding the maybe six inches away from their face

296
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,900
thomas takes them

297
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,360
the bottle

298
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,340
puts his entire knows in it

299
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:09,140
big with zero reaction pulses knows out there's smelling salts on his nose

300
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:11,300
and he said

301
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,160
that was not that good

302
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,640
and that was his only three-pack i deeply inhaling the smelling cells it

303
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,960
was insane dude

304
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,960
That sounds awesome, man.

305
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,360
It made me think he had something really wrong with him.

306
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,920
I think he's a full demon and that's why he's now cancelled and we cannot discuss him any

307
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,080
longer.

308
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,440
He is completely cancelled right now.

309
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,440
Why is he cancelled?

310
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
He didn't see?

311
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,920
Did he hurt somebody?

312
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,920
He hurt someone, yeah.

313
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:45,440
He made a joke and that, in 2024, might as well be illegal.

314
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,400
That is so fucking true.

315
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,280
Thomas, I don't know what you said, whatever you said, I vindicate you right now, whatever

316
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,800
you said, whatever you did, no man should be cancelled on this earth in this year.

317
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:04,800
He said, he said, if you get molested by Stephen Hawking, that's on you.

318
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,120
Okay, so in this...

319
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,560
Maybe you want to retract what I said, that's a horrible thing.

320
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,080
Thomas you should be ashamed of yourself. You should never work again in any place

321
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,560
But that is funny people got mad at that. Oh, yeah

322
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:28,880
People are he's been screenshotting all the replies that he's been getting all the negative. Yeah, most people telling him to kill himself

323
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:36,500
Not to be like really annoying about this, but why are they releasing the the names like a like the smash DLC in waves?

324
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:41,400
Blackout like that Stephen Hawking come on. Yeah, you can't

325
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:48,400
it

326
00:13:48,400 --> 00:14:11,320
like

327
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,120
Pokemon just guessing every single week.

328
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,520
(laughing)

329
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,760
- Do you guys think that if that were still going on,

330
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,720
there would be any podcasters on there?

331
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,840
- On Jeffrey Epstein's island?

332
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,680
- Yep.

333
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,480
- For certain, man.

334
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,440
- Lex Fridman.

335
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,480
- Lex Fridman would be on there, no doubt.

336
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,040
He seemed, but not because he is the level man.

337
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,880
It's because he--

338
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,960
- What's your process?

339
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,600
(laughing)

340
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,800
- Yeah, drawing crayons.

341
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,640
That's really amazing.

342
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,740
How did you come up with putting a smiley face on the sun?

343
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:47,120
I've never thought to do something like that.

344
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,360
It's really impressive.

345
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I think that he ends up in places where he shouldn't belong.

346
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:55,400
Like he doesn't necessarily have the merit

347
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,680
to be in a lot of the rooms that he's in.

348
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,120
So I think that is purely why he would be there.

349
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,360
He's like, he's a fucking grad student at MIT

350
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,620
and he's interviewing whoever, you know?

351
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,960
The first thing that comes to mind is Eliezer Yudkowsky.

352
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,960
not really that impressive

353
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,420
that was the blast interview i saw with them

354
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,840
he's like

355
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,480
yeah he he is not smart enough to be the podcast

356
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
died that he pretends to be

357
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,500
yeah cuz he thinks like he'll be talking to

358
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,840
somebody who's like truly evil or something

359
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,540
yeah and i like

360
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:35,240
have you considered that maybe love is the answer

361
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,940
like but now

362
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,140
Yeah, talking about love.

363
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,340
He'll talk.

364
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,340
He'll get into arguments with George Hotz.

365
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,840
He's like this, like he's the guy you hacked like the PS3

366
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,240
like jailbroke the PS3 like a very talented like programmer

367
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,340
and he will get so annoyed at him because he's just too stupid

368
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,440
to keep up with him.

369
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,440
It's very funny.

370
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,340
This is really mild.

371
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:02,440
What is interviewing gamers?

372
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,140
I should have no idea who he did.

373
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:04,840
He interviewed.

374
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,640
What's his name?

375
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,740
The guy made doom.

376
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,740
Yeah.

377
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,540
He interviews anybody that he thinks is like a groundbreaking technology guy.

378
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,340
He interviewed the OpenAI dude.

379
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,580
And the thing is, I have seen a lot of his interviews, and it's purely because a lot

380
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:26,380
of the people he interviews are not people who normally do long-form interview things.

381
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,140
And then you watch the interview and you say, "Oh, that's why.

382
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,140
They're boring people who make technology."

383
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
They're dorks.

384
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,660
Yeah, they're dorks.

385
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:40,720
And they get so sidetracked on like random shit and they have no personality at all.

386
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,420
And it's just he interviews people who are like obsessed with their work.

387
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,700
Mainly, I would say.

388
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:51,100
People who are really technical have this problem where they actually enjoy what they

389
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,320
do and they do it as a hobby as well.

390
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,300
And that makes you so insanely boring to be around.

391
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,580
And they've done it since they were 10 years old.

392
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,580
Right.

393
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:04,340
Just a guy who's obsessed with math worksheets.

394
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,700
Do you guys think you could be a good interviewee?

395
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,780
- A good interviewee?

396
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,620
No.

397
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,260
- No, I remember I used to say yes

398
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,220
to like every podcast I was asked to do.

399
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,580
So I did a couple of podcasts,

400
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,220
maybe had like 10 listeners.

401
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,060
- Forget about this.

402
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
- Back in the day.

403
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,980
- Yeah, you did do that.

404
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:25,620
- Yeah, when we met, you used to be the famous yes man.

405
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:28,700
- I thought it was rude to say no to stuff.

406
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,580
And then I would do these podcasts

407
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,320
and I would think that it would be something

408
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,600
where we would be sitting around doing whatever,

409
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,480
just talking.

410
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,600
And then they would always ask me,

411
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,440
they'd be like, how'd you get your start in comedy?

412
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,160
And I was like 22 years old.

413
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,000
Like I did not.

414
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:45,820
(laughing)

415
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,960
- Yeah, look at your Louis C.K. and not.

416
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,600
- Yeah, I had just started basically.

417
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,600
And I would just tell really boring stories

418
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,440
and then get off and be like,

419
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
fuck, I'm saying no to the next one.

420
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,680
And then I'd get a text from somebody.

421
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,680
So you wanna come do my podcast about fast food?

422
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,280
I said, yeah, sure.

423
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,120
- That sounds awesome.

424
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:07,360
- Okay, well, Pognesmelt fast food is awesome.

425
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,580
- Well, I wish that's what I got asked to do,

426
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,340
but it was actually much worse things.

427
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,660
- Of course.

428
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,500
- Yeah, we would have you hanging out.

429
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,540
- You could probably have infinite episodes

430
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,660
just debating McDonald's versus Wendy's.

431
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,820
- Popeye versus-- - I mean, yeah,

432
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,200
let's do it right now.

433
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,740
- I mean, you couldn't, for sure.

434
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:30,240
- I had a big blow-up argument with Chad and Brian and Noah

435
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:38,920
because they said that Zaxby's was the best fast food chicken you can get.

436
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,920
And I heavily disagreed.

437
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Chick-fil-A.

438
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,920
Chick-fil-A?

439
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
Popeyes?

440
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Yeah, Popeyes.

441
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,240
I mean, Zaxby's might be in the bottom.

442
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,240
I'm not saying it's the bottom, but it's certainly in the bottoms 50%.

443
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:57,480
Someone said, "Zaxby's is the GOAT," and immediately someone else said, "Zaxby's sucks so much."

444
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
That means that it's right in the middle.

445
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,680
Yeah, I think it's pretty mid.

446
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,880
I would honestly put it right there with the offerings from Whataburger.

447
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,760
Okay, I've not had, oh wait, I've had a chicken sandwich from Whataburger actually, and it

448
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,400
was pretty good, but it didn't blow my mind.

449
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,240
We went to, no, we went to a bad Whataburger anyways.

450
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:15,640
But yeah, it was not great.

451
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:21,960
I think Whataburger can be, like, very, I don't know, it's like, it's a really, really mixed

452
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,160
experience depending on which one you go to, I feel.

453
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,000
The supreme fast food that I've had in the last five years that blew my mind was Culver's.

454
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Have you ever had Culver's?

455
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,800
Culver's is a top tier fast food.

456
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:38,960
The cheese curds, they bring your food out to your table.

457
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,360
It is an amazing experience front to back.

458
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,520
Everything about Culver's is great.

459
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,760
A Butter Burger, that just sounds so damn good.

460
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,160
Yeah, the Butter Burger, the cheese curds, and the frozen custard.

461
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,160
Frozen custard is wonderful.

462
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,160
That sounds amazing.

463
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,160
I would love to go there.

464
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,160
True Midwest chain.

465
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,160
Yup.

466
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,160
There's nothing more Wisconsin.

467
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,160
Ok, so here's my new, my brand new found Whataburger thing.

468
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:10,560
As a person who lives near Texas and sometimes goes to Texas, I've spoken great with Great

469
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Live Whataburger in the past.

470
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:16,880
Last time I went, I went to Whataburger with my girlfriend and she got just like a normal

471
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,400
burger and I got like, I forgot what I got, I think I got like a chicken sandwich.

472
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,000
And I liked mine and she didn't like hers.

473
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
And then I showed a famous Texan, Brian, like, "Oh, we got a Whataburger and look what she

474
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
got."

475
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,500
And she said that she didn't like it.

476
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,480
And he just goes like the most and say like, "No!

477
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
What the fuck are you doing?

478
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
You're not supposed to order that!"

479
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,800
They black out, man.

480
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,360
You're supposed to order the...

481
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,880
You're supposed to fix...

482
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,920
To solve the puzzle of the disgusting huge menu.

483
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,280
And you're like, "I want this with that many patties and like with whatever bread."

484
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,660
I was like, you know what I see why people don't fuck with whatever I get that's always been my problem with in and out

485
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,480
Right in and out you go there and you get a hamburger

486
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,540
They have four things on the menu and then you tell somebody yeah to hang hamburger from in and out

487
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:10,060
It was pretty good and they say oh you should have gotten it dragon style

488
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:15,120
yeah, and I go I don't want to be with the the the

489
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:22,780
Disgusting fear that I would feel walking up to a cashier and trying to order off of a secret menu

490
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:28,080
That is too powerful from - that will keep me from doing any of that

491
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah, because the idea that I would say I'd be like, yeah, I want it. I want it

492
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:38,360
And they'd say what I'm talking about man. Are you fucking? Okay. Do we need to call 911?

493
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:46,860
I don't know if you can see there's four things on the menu. Do you see crazy animal style anywhere on that?

494
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:53,880
I don't think so. That would that would that loses me. This is why McDonald's is the goat fast food because it's like Legos

495
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,180
It's the same fucking every use to be

496
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,400
And let me tell you something I'm gonna stand up for this, okay McDonald's

497
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
You're on notice man

498
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,360
Tell you why Ronald

499
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,920
if I go to a McDonald's and I get a

500
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,920
cheeseburger that shit should be

501
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,720
99 cents not

502
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,240
379 right that

503
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,320
absurd that is fucking

504
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,600
absurd man

505
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,960
Which was a cheeseburger said the the kids meal which one is the cheeseburger our friend from Mexico just asked

506
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
He just asked that with his real mouth

507
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,160
The one the dollar menu to the one two three menu is a discu now

508
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:50,560
There's nothing on the menu. That's a dollar the fries start at three dollars

509
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:57,040
Yeah, the fries you have to use the they force you to use the app. Otherwise, they rip you off

510
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:00,320
Exactly. I honestly think

511
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,280
It's because they hate homeless people

512
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,880
It has to be

513
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,860
It's the only explanation they were tired of homeless people coming in getting a dollar drink a dollar delicious

514
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,920
Hi-c to refresh their homeless metals and bodies

515
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,020
Going into the bathroom and doing drugs

516
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:25,820
Comedian who would come and do my open mic in Boston and he used to do the same joke every single week about how

517
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,980
Disgusting it was that at McDonald's they started charging for sauces

518
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:39,240
Okay, yeah, and this joke used to bomb every week because everybody's like who gives a fuck what they church 39 cents for a sauce

519
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,540
but now

520
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,980
Antoine that was his name

521
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,120
You have been vindicated if I could go back in time

522
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:53,260
I would standing Oh every single fucking time you told that joke because you saw the turn coming

523
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:58,440
He did you saw what was happening to McDonald's and that is the mark of a great

524
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,880
I wouldn't even say comedian philosopher. This is a George Carlin level of

525
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:07,120
foresight that he had I

526
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:12,680
Truly the change that has come to fast food

527
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:18,520
Has been horrible it makes it just completely not worth it to get

528
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,240
99% of the city was absolutely it was three bucks for the the cheeseburger

529
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:26,280
Uh-huh. So yes

530
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,680
Yeah, inflation has really hit us as well because I'm looking at it on on my app. Of course. I always have it ready

531
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:37,400
and burger a shot the 39 right there which which is

532
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,580
We're not even safe ourselves from inflation

533
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:49,360
Oh my god over over a dollar is disgusting over $2 for what used to be a dollar menu item

534
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:55,500
Boils my fucking blood. Yeah boils my blood I'm gonna say

535
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,540
- Hey, a fast food restaurant that you may disagree with,

536
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,560
Portillo's.

537
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,300
- That's in Chicago, yes?

538
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,260
- Yes.

539
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,980
- Yeah, I like Portillo's.

540
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,580
- Yeah, a beef and cheddar croissant used to be like $4,

541
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,700
and now it's eight.

542
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,700
- The doubling, how can you justify,

543
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,140
I understand, what's it, inflation is up

544
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:20,360
in the last five years, even if it's 30%,

545
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:23,260
raise your prices 30%, it's not 30%,

546
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:26,360
but raise your prices 30% doubling.

547
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,780
Are you kidding me?

548
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,780
- That's what I'm saying.

549
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,260
This shit is ridiculous.

550
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,080
- What is the point?

551
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,360
Why would I ever go to McDonald's

552
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,940
when I can get tacos down the street

553
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,620
that have been $4 for 15 years?

554
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,460
- Yeah.

555
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,300
- Why can I get,

556
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,140
why would I go to McDonald's

557
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,180
when I can get those for the same price

558
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,180
or cheaper at this point?

559
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,460
- I think the true test right now,

560
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,300
and I don't know this off the top of my head,

561
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,700
Is a Jack in the Box taco still two for a dollar?

562
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,060
I would be very surprised.

563
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,580
Actually, Jack in the Box might be the only one with integrity.

564
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:03,220
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

565
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,700
I feel like those somehow are still two for a dollar.

566
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,940
That's because their menu is so giant that they might not even know they have some items

567
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,620
so they wouldn't adjust them.

568
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,140
It's also completely like worm, beet, and oatmeal.

569
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:20,260
Well that's what every time we go to California, my dad's from California, and every time that

570
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,980
we went to California to visit his family.

571
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,740
We would, the first thing he would do when he got off the plane is we would drive to

572
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,900
the nearest Jack in the Box and he would eat Jack in the Box tacos and he would have a

573
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:35,940
full male orgasm in front of all of his children.

574
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:42,540
Like that was to him, it was like he waited all year to eat a Jack in the Box taco.

575
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,580
He thought that it was incredible.

576
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:50,580
They are really good when you drink, because they are so greasy.

577
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,300
Yeah, that's true.

578
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,160
And this is incredible.

579
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,660
They are somehow still two for a dollar.

580
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,660
Wow.

581
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,660
Wow.

582
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
Wow.

583
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:00,660
Get a look in the box.

584
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,660
I salute you.

585
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,660
You are, that is a true American fast food chain.

586
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,960
That is not given into this communist bullshit.

587
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:14,380
There should be something that is so disgusting that it costs 50 cents.

588
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,440
I agree. I fucking agree.

589
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,860
Every fast food restaurant should have the Disguster meal and it's 50 cents an item.

590
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:26,140
I remember having an idea for a restaurant when I was a kid. I don't think this would

591
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:32,900
work very well. But I wanted to open a restaurant that was literally just like the most dis-

592
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:37,860
not disgusting, I mean I guess disgusting, you wouldn't market it as this, but the cheapest

593
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:43,660
possible food that was like chili made with like canned vegetables and like all that kind

594
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:50,420
of stuff, but it's fully transparent and you're like, "Yeah, this is not the best food ever,

595
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,980
but it's very cheap."

596
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,540
And I used to think that's not going to work because you have these fast food places, but

597
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,140
now I kind of think that might work.

598
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,820
If you can undercut the fast food places by just doing very low quality food that is very,

599
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:06,700
very cheap, I think that you could make money off that.

600
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,700
I agree.

601
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:12,780
I think that idea is great, but it falls apart whenever you have so much success that you

602
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:16,660
you start trying to branch out and go to different places.

603
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,540
And then it's just run by a corporate office

604
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,500
and it's the same thing where you gotta get

605
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,060
all those damn profits. - That's the key.

606
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,900
That's the key.

607
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,420
That might, the old Macca's brothers,

608
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:29,160
they caved in and started franchising.

609
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,340
Me, never, never, never.

610
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,840
- You're gonna have a single Disguster restaurant?

611
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,180
- If you have one restaurant, two restaurants at max,

612
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:42,860
You can make millions if it pops off in a crazy way.

613
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,580
- Okay, so now this is my question.

614
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,420
- And that's all I need.

615
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,500
I'm a natural born millionaire, not a billionaire.

616
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,340
I'm not built for that.

617
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,600
- Where in the country would you put your disguster?

618
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,460
Which is what it's called.

619
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,140
- Probably right near my house.

620
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:01,100
It would be easy to get to work.

621
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,300
Any other questions?

622
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,460
- The disgusting restaurant in Brooklyn?

623
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,700
disgusting it's not disgusting. Okay what is it called? The idea it's called

624
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:19,520
Caleb's Shack. It's called Caleb's Shack and the food is not the food is not great and

625
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,380
it's kind of also a mix of just different foods I know how to make it

626
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:31,740
would be like fried eggs potato pancakes gochujang chicken thighs it would not be

627
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:38,460
a cohesive menu whatsoever I don't think. Yeah. And then we'd introduce the cocktail

628
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:43,060
program we'd have the gremlet there we would have let's see what else can I make

629
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:47,420
we would have a gremlet and a grogni and a margarita made with the cheapest

630
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:53,660
triple sec possible and that would be the entire cocktail. So I have a thing

631
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:59,980
about this too I think if you made a bar that only had the cheapest drinks okay

632
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:07,260
like no elaborate fancy cocktails so just a place that you could really dive in

633
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:15,180
and get your yeah this is my hometown has a bar called the opera room which used

634
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:18,420
to be here's another here's here's an example of inflation done done right

635
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:27,740
okay they used to have 75 cent PBR drafts a 10 ounce pour of PBR was 75 cents okay

636
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:34,140
Now, they've raised the price. It's 85 cents for a draft pour of PBR.

637
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,140
Wow.

638
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,140
That is inflation done right.

639
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,140
Yeah.

640
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,140
Because it was already so insanely cheap.

641
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:48,140
And they don't have any high-end, they have like only well, I think they only have tequila and whiskey.

642
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,140
Those are like the only liquors they have.

643
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,140
That's so good.

644
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,140
Just like plastic bottle tequila and whiskey.

645
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:58,100
But I think that that is I think they probably are some of the richest people

646
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,180
in the planet at this point because of how many people go to that bar.

647
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:09,140
Yeah, well any I don't want to say any but I think I most it's a it's a really it's

648
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:14,220
a meme down here that you'll go you go your entire life you'll you'll go to

649
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:18,620
university you'll get your your degree I'll get some shit job in an office you

650
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,140
know you just make no money but the guy who dropped out in high school and just

651
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:24,220
started a little taco truck.

652
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,500
It's like he owns a fucking, he owns a house,

653
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,060
he owns a truck.

654
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,900
So I think--

655
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:31,720
- Yep, see, in the US we have--

656
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,560
- He owns a house.

657
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,580
(laughing)

658
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:35,100
- That he's a taco seller.

659
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,960
- He's the richest guy in the world, basically.

660
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,740
- In the US we have trades,

661
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,780
and trades for you guys are you open a taco truck.

662
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,060
(laughing)

663
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,900
- Yeah.

664
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,740
- 'Cause for us, it's like the richest people I know

665
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,100
are like welders.

666
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,940
- Yeah.

667
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,260
- Like that's where you make a lot of money,

668
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,260
The richest people you know are podcasters. Let's be real.

669
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:01,740
No, no, no, I know somebody who does roofing who makes probably more than any podcast right

670
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:02,740
now.

671
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
Makes more than Adam?

672
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,740
Yes, yeah.

673
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,740
Wow.

674
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
Easily, actually, yeah.

675
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
Damn.

676
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:19,100
Yeah, if you're like a, if you like own your own business like that, those guys, your employees

677
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,500
being paid so much for, he started off as just like a normal roofer and five years in

678
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,000
and he was making like 200 and something thousand dollars a year.

679
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,600
And then if you open up your own business, you're making so much money

680
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,300
because you have to pay these people to.

681
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
It's crazy.

682
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
That's so nice.

683
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,000
That's amazing.

684
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,900
I should have been doing something like that.

685
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,400
We should start our own business in the slot.

686
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,000
A slot business.

687
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,700
Well, that's true as fuck.

688
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:48,000
I do think that is the way that we become billionaires is see.

689
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,900
This is a hard thing for me.

690
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,400
Okay, because there's a clear path here

691
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,960
for everybody else.

692
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,960
Rex, obviously you're programming.

693
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:01,760
Jubio, obviously you are the mascot of the company, right?

694
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,800
- Right.

695
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,960
- We make a 2D version of you

696
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,760
and it's called Jubio's Jamboree,

697
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,640
could be like the name of the slot or something.

698
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,520
Where do I fit in in all this?

699
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:16,040
I don't have any kind of programming skills.

700
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,240
I'm not from another country.

701
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,080
- I think you are the CEO.

702
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,160
- Imagine. - No, I can't do that.

703
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,240
- I think like Sugar Rush, right?

704
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,680
Imagine Sugar Rush.

705
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:27,160
We're talking about slots, right?

706
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,520
- Yeah. - Yeah.

707
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:35,200
Famous bald guys, heads, top down.

708
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,360
Like different sweets.

709
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:41,640
And then like one guy, and then like you

710
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,080
with the eye heart eating shit,

711
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:46,440
it instead says free spins.

712
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,480
- Oh my God.

713
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,720
- That is amazing.

714
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,840
- That's actually really genius.

715
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,840
By the way, open up the second beer the wife brought home.

716
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:57,000
This is a Sour Me America, it says.

717
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:01,300
And this is a Bomb Pop Sour Ale, a Rocket Pop Sour Ale.

718
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,680
- That sounds actually incredible.

719
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,640
- This is my second beer. - It's actually,

720
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:10,160
this might be the best sour beer I've ever had

721
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,080
in terms of balancing like the sweetness

722
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:17,320
and the like kind of the over,

723
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,200
the richness that a lot of sour beers have

724
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,920
with the beeriness.

725
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,760
This is a perfect blend.

726
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,680
I'm gonna give this an eight.

727
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,520
- Wow.

728
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,040
- What's yours at?

729
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,760
- Oh, mine, this is just the Nutshebwena again.

730
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,120
It's the Christmas beer that I didn't finish.

731
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,360
- It was so long ago.

732
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:38,560
- Well, I bought a six pack and I drank one of them

733
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,160
and the other ones were drank by other people.

734
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,760
- Imagine having a six pack that lasted you

735
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,680
from before Christmas until almost a week

736
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,600
into the new year.

737
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,760
- I don't drink beer. - That is crazy.

738
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,600
- I don't drink beer by myself at home.

739
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,900
- That is crazy.

740
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:55,900
Then you're not living, man. Sorry to tell you.

741
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I haven't drank a beer since a year ago.

742
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,900
Yep. Yep. So, tell me your slot idea, Rex, besides the bald one.

743
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:11,900
So, I think, like, it would be cool...

744
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,900
So, here's the thing about slots, right? I don't know if we've talked about this.

745
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:24,740
-Much like magicians, every slot company has like a gimmick that they like copyright and

746
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:25,740
then license.

747
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,740
-Yeah.

748
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,740
-So...

749
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,740
-Big time gaming, MegaWiz.

750
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:32,100
They've probably made millions on the MegaWiz.

751
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,660
-Yes.

752
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,860
Absolutely.

753
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:43,620
And I think like we could do something that's kind of like the X-Split on like No Limit

754
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:52,500
city but it's like a diagonal split on the screen. Oh, an actual X. Yes, and we could

755
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:59,820
do like a knife or sword themed slot because again. This is you playing into your favorite

756
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,020
things okay. Yeah it is. This is not going to work for me. It's a labor of love. But

757
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:11,960
it could have beer, swords, guns. And then Lex Fridman is interviewing you. Exactly. About

758
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:16,960
your new sword-themed slot that has now taken over the world.

759
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,960
Yeah, I mean I think if you made...

760
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,960
Like, the thing about a slot too, it should be so fun that you don't realize you're losing money.

761
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,960
That's true. That's why I always thought if you could make some way that it's like

762
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,960
basically a full rip-off of a game that people already like.

763
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,960
Fortnite, Minecraft, that kind of thing.

764
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,960
But you're losing money while you play.

765
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,560
That would be the most genius slot of all time.

766
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,760
Although, now that I say it, Fortnite is exactly that.

767
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah.

768
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,060
[Chuckles]

769
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
I guess that is...

770
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,760
That is the Fortnite model.

771
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,760
That is the Fortnite model.

772
00:36:52,760 --> 00:37:03,060
Imagine a Minecraft slot where you have like nine chests in front of you and you open them.

773
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:06,060
Wow.

774
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:06,900
- Wait, that is interesting,

775
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,900
like a first person shooter type slot.

776
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,700
- Yeah. - You can actually move

777
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,700
around a bit. - Almost like a,

778
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,540
like a first person scratch off.

779
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,420
- I like scratch offs.

780
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:20,500
I usually, I didn't go home for Christmas this year,

781
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,980
but normally when I go,

782
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,700
my dad gets me a bundle of scratch offs.

783
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:27,300
And I forgot my dad existed,

784
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,580
and I only told him I wasn't coming home

785
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,980
two days before Christmas.

786
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,060
So I'm sure that I have these scratch offs

787
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:33,660
sitting for me at the house.

788
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,300
So that is money that's on the table.

789
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,960
So it is possible that you guys are talking to a thousandaire

790
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,720
and you don't even have any idea, and I don't either.

791
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,620
- I really hope for your sake that it's true.

792
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,020
- Me too, that would be amazing.

793
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,380
That would be amazing if I could become a thousandaire.

794
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:55,660
- I would feel so foolish if I found out

795
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,740
that you had all that money

796
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,180
and I was tucking smack on you all these years.

797
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,700
- I know, yeah.

798
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,620
All these years and then you come running

799
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,300
you say, "Come on, man, buy me a gumball, buddy."

800
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,220
Now that I'm a thousandaire,

801
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:12,900
I could probably buy you 50 gumballs and not even notice,

802
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,700
but I'm not going to because of how much shiz you talked.

803
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,700
- Man, I'm sorry.

804
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,460
- You are a shiz talker.

805
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,020
Are you a thousandaire in Mexico, Julio?

806
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,160
'Cause that's like $40, right?

807
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,320
- It's like 50 bucks.

808
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,540
So yeah.

809
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,260
- That's kind of awesome. - That is crazy.

810
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,460
Do you guys have any, is there one thing in Mexico

811
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,260
that is so much, so much cheap, hmm.

812
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:41,900
Is there one thing in Mexico

813
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,400
that is so much cheaper in Mexico

814
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,460
that the price is almost identical

815
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,820
to what it would be in the US

816
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:50,220
even though you're paying,

817
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:53,160
even though the exchange rate is 20X or whatever?

818
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:57,620
- This is a really,

819
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,980
you phrase this really confusingly to me.

820
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,860
- Is there something that in the United States

821
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:06,380
would be $20 and in Mexico would be 20 pesos?

822
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,220
- Right.

823
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,420
Rent.

824
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,540
Basically. - Okay.

825
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:16,380
That might be the best possible option.

826
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,180
- Yeah, that is really nice.

827
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:22,420
- So you can pay like 2,000 pesos a month for rent?

828
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:28,380
- I used to pay 6,000 pesos in my apartment,

829
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,100
which I think is less than 300 bucks.

830
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,280
- God damn.

831
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,860
- And now we pay total 870 bucks per month

832
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,100
and we split that, me and my girlfriend.

833
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:44,100
- I need to move to Mexico, I really do.

834
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,500
I think it would be amazing.

835
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:50,660
I just would need to learn at least two languages.

836
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,860
'Cause it would be kind of embarrassing

837
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:54,780
if I only knew English and Spanish.

838
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,620
- What do you mean?

839
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,020
- I would need to, I would feel,

840
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:00,500
I don't want to be bilingual, I want to be a polyglot.

841
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,820
I want to know all sorts of languages.

842
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,180
I think that is completely a silly situation.

843
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,340
I have a thing to say about polyglots.

844
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,500
Go ahead, talk to that.

845
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,060
People who know two languages for, like, you know,

846
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,980
usefulness of it and everything, that makes sense.

847
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,100
I have met some really stupid people

848
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,540
that speak a lot of languages.

849
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,740
I'm convinced it is not--

850
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,460
Really?

851
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,820
--like an impressive--

852
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:34,320
I kind of think of the number of languages that you speak, and I think a lot of people do, as a bit of a marker of intelligence.

853
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,320
I think it's less like intelligence and more like pattern recognition.

854
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,820
Yeah.

855
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,820
Just like memorizing stuff, basically.

856
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:52,820
Yeah. It's like, and, like, I met someone who speaks like five languages, and he's not stupid by any means, but I was like,

857
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:57,820
"Oh, this is like, you would not expect that out of this guy."

858
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:01,420
And I was like, "Maybe actually it's not that hard

859
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,180
and you just need to just put a little bit of effort into it

860
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,980
and you could probably do it."

861
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,780
- Yeah, I think it's just mostly practice

862
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,100
and like putting the time in.

863
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,340
- Yeah.

864
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,700
- Yeah, but that's also a type of something.

865
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,980
- Yeah, but it's like a roofer could learn Spanish.

866
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,740
- Well, again, roofers are millionaires.

867
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:21,860
I already talked about this.

868
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,700
- That is true.

869
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,340
- And any millionaire could do pretty much anything they want

870
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,140
'cause they can hire a tutor.

871
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,980
- Not true.

872
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,360
I can't. - Bruce Buck.

873
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,580
- Well, you're not a roofer.

874
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,060
- That is true.

875
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,980
- You wish you was.

876
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,740
- I wish I was, dude.

877
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,240
- No, you don't.

878
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,140
- Yeah, I do.

879
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,780
- You love being a little gremlin

880
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,960
in your hallway house.

881
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,660
- Anti-Semitic vibes.

882
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,380
- Well, I live in New York, man.

883
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:56,280
I'm sorry that my house isn't a spacious Mexican villa near a mountain.

884
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,640
We pay so much because we don't have to live in fucking Mexico, man.

885
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,640
Yeah.

886
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,220
I live here, a Chuncheon restaurant.

887
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,220
Whoa.

888
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,220
That's right.

889
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:06,220
Yep.

890
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,220
And it's not very good.

891
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,220
And guess what, man?

892
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,420
A jazz bar just opened near me.

893
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,420
So I bet you're fucking jealous.

894
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Have you been to it?

895
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,420
Yes, and it was amazing.

896
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Really?

897
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,420
Is it the Ornithology Club?

898
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,100
No, it's called Dada.

899
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,100
Oh.

900
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,940
- Wow.

901
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,780
- Da, da guys.

902
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,260
And it says on the front, live music,

903
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:28,900
Arts Club Cocktail Bar.

904
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:31,740
- Yeah, Farts Club when you're in it.

905
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:34,060
- Well, that's what I would say if I walked in,

906
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:35,900
but I only went in one time and I hadn't seen,

907
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,380
they hadn't put up the decals yet that said Arts Club,

908
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,940
'cause I definitely would have seen them with that.

909
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,540
And it's one of these restaurants

910
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:44,080
where everyone who works there is French,

911
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:47,300
which is very off-putting.

912
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:49,620
- Okay.

913
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,580
- Very, very off-putting.

914
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,220
I don't like giving my order.

915
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,160
I order at the bar 'cause it's a little bit

916
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,540
of a shorter interaction.

917
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,820
- So what was it like?

918
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,660
What was in there?

919
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,260
- It was, honestly, I went and the food was really good

920
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:05,300
and the drinks were great,

921
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,940
but then they started playing fucking jazz

922
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:11,980
and I was like, oh, I think I hate music.

923
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,300
I think I hate live music.

924
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,500
- Here's the thing about jazz.

925
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:21,620
At the very, very top end, jazz is cool.

926
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,620
From the 1950s.

927
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,620
Yes.

928
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:35,140
If you are into jazz now, if you are a jazz player now, you suck.

929
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:38,500
I'll make it even a little bit more...

930
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,140
I don't think that white people should be playing jazz.

931
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,100
I've only ever seen jazz by white people.

932
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:49,120
And I really don't think, I think it's not what they should be doing.

933
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:57,080
I think that jazz, the fact that jazz clubs have the same racial makeup as a tennis tournament

934
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:01,600
when it in fact should be the same as the NBA, that's a serious problem.

935
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,600
Yeah.

936
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,600
Okay.

937
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:08,540
I really don't think that it should be white, white people are not good at this shit man.

938
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,540
Don't do it.

939
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,720
They just don't have the rhythm man.

940
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,360
Don't pick up that big fucking bass.

941
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Stick to this one.

942
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,920
The upright, if you're a white guy,

943
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,040
this is not natural for you.

944
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,040
- Yeah. - Or this, this thing.

945
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,960
You should be, this is natural.

946
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,920
You should be doing slapping.

947
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,160
You should be doing primus.

948
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,280
You should not be doing upright,

949
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,680
doing all that kind of shit.

950
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:31,440
- I don't think I know anything about this.

951
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,260
- That is not for you, man.

952
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,960
You don't know anything about it?

953
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,800
- No.

954
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,920
- Well, let me educate you, man,

955
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,280
'cause I'm basically an expert now that I've went to Dada.

956
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,640
Basically what happens is you get a fat guy

957
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:51,500
Right skinny guy and a girl. Yep, and the girl plays the drums as some sort of weird gender swap

958
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:56,480
Oh, look how funny it is a girl's playing drums. Though. I assume that's what it is. It's a nice way

959
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,440
It's so crazy

960
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:04,600
and so they try to put the girl on the drums to distract you from the fact that they don't know what they're playing and

961
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:11,140
You basically watch three three people practice music four and a half hours. Yeah, that's the thing

962
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:19,620
it's not good. I mean I hate I don't like improv for the same exact reason. Yeah.

963
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,700
Which is even if you have pretty funny people doing improv it would be so much

964
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:30,620
funnier if they had written down what they were gonna do and thought of it

965
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:39,060
and they premeditated this. Right. It is so silly how people think improv is good

966
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:43,920
because it's improvised. They judge it on a different metric.

967
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:44,920
Yup.

968
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:50,700
And it shouldn't be that way for improv comedy. It shouldn't be that way for improv music.

969
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,700
I agree, man.

970
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:54,440
You should be busting out some crazy shit.

971
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:58,580
And Rex, by the way, also thinks any time they have somebody with Down syndrome on a

972
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:02,300
high school football team and they score a touchdown, he thinks that shouldn't count.

973
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,060
Well, I mean, I'll be honest.

974
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,820
He's like, "Well, they let him do it."

975
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:09,140
they did let him do it.

976
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:10,140
I think that's the one exception.

977
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:15,760
What, you're gonna write that down in the fucking, in the annals of high school football history

978
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,900
that some retarded guy got to run unimpeded for 60 yards and they had to coach him how

979
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,460
to keep running down the field?

980
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:27,140
You don't know if he, he may have earned it man, you don't fucking know.

981
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:32,060
Yeah he earned it by being down syndrome, being born the way that he was.

982
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,660
He didn't earn it by running hard, putting on his pads and-

983
00:46:35,660 --> 00:46:40,260
Okay guys, I should have known what I was doing, I should have known, I should have stopped

984
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:43,260
him, this was my fault, I'm gonna take full responsibility for that.

985
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,900
This is the gremlin speaking bro.

986
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,900
He lost control.

987
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:50,300
This is a full gremlin, this is a full gremlin moment.

988
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:55,580
Okay, I have nothing to do with that, I fully disavow him and Thomas, these are the two

989
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,060
most disgusting people I've ever met in my entire life.

990
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:04,420
goodbyes I would never never ever imagine saying but for the also if you're

991
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:09,460
thinking talking down on Rex right now for being a disgusting ableist just know

992
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:12,660
that he did have something called a gremlin it's always been called that

993
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:19,120
yeah and it's about seven shots of gin and some soda and also he's in under

994
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:23,780
incredible stress right now for what these people are going through that's

995
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:30,820
true. My Palestinian brothers are being murdered by Israelis. That's true. And also Jeffrey Epstein's

996
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:36,740
name is being dragged through the mud. Being sullied! Being sullied! A family friend of yours

997
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:42,180
from way back in the day. Making people look down further on the Jewish people for their

998
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:47,460
predilections towards young women. It is horrible what is happening to my people. That is so true.

999
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,180
And by the way, you don't play into that stereotype at all.

1000
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,780
I just want to say that off the cuff.

1001
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:58,260
I got into an argument with my aunt once when the Jeffrey Epstein stuff first happened.

1002
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:01,860
She's like, I just can't imagine what people are going to be saying about the Jews.

1003
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,220
Yep, that's the right thing to be focused on.

1004
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,660
I was like, that is 100% what the issue is.

1005
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,020
I was like, you are insane.

1006
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:13,140
You are an insane person.

1007
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,140
That is awesome, man.

1008
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:23,220
I just watched a video, a Brett Gelman interview that popped up on something where he was talking

1009
00:48:23,220 --> 00:48:31,060
about how he went to Israel and he was like, "This is my real home.

1010
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:33,180
This is my real fucking home."

1011
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:37,340
I've obviously never been to Israel, but I don't understand how people...

1012
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,780
Not that obvious.

1013
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,780
Okay.

1014
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,780
Anyway.

1015
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:47,620
I've never been to Israel, but I don't understand how people go there and like or like

1016
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,480
fucking hell, yeah

1017
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:56,560
Well, I mean, oh, you don't understand dude. Have you seen this bungee Bob episode where Squidward goes to the Squidward village?

1018
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,560
*laughter*

1019
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,560
I cannot say anything

1020
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:02,560
*laughter*

1021
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,560
*laughter*

1022
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,560
Oh my god dude

1023
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,560
Alright

1024
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:10,560
The show is also disavowing

1025
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,560
Caleb for his beliefs

1026
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:14,560
and his thoughts on the

1027
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,560
*laughter*

1028
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:18,560
I'm not saying anything about

1029
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,560
what ScooterBrit looks like, you made it about that

1030
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,560
I'm saying

1031
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:24,560
how cool would it be

1032
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:31,560
there was a whole neighborhood of guys that were exactly like you that's awesome no he

1033
00:49:31,560 --> 00:49:40,160
hated it he hated it so much come on well he hated it after a little bit but when he

1034
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:48,680
first got there he was like this is awesome there's no sponge bobs and you want the sponge

1035
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,680
There's too many fucking Spongebobs and Patricks in my neighborhood!

1036
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,680
[Laughter]

1037
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,680
Oh...

1038
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:04,680
Or maybe there used to be Spongebobs there, and you throw them into a different area.

1039
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,680
So on and so forth.

1040
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,680
[Laughter]

1041
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,680
Well, that is a little too...

1042
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:33,080
to

1043
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:35,560
I think that's a pretty fair analogy.

1044
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,400
- It is.

1045
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,760
- I think that's fair, man.

1046
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,080
- I don't know what to say, but you did

1047
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:44,080
a good word to talk about the story.

1048
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,160
- See, but I'm so, I almost said anti-Semitic.

1049
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:49,400
(laughing)

1050
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,200
I'm so--

1051
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:52,400
- Anti-anti-Semitic.

1052
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:54,120
- I'm so anti-anti-Semitic.

1053
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:58,160
I'm so, don't even think about that kind of thing.

1054
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:59,000
- Right.

1055
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,620
- That didn't even hurt me.

1056
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,120
and i apologize for that

1057
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:08,340
now my agency will be dropping the very very soon

1058
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,180
and that is ok there well within the right to do that

1059
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:13,940
uh...

1060
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,020
uh...

1061
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,620
you're gonna get scooter brahms so hard

1062
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:19,420
yeah

1063
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,520
but you you know you know what i mean i feel like if you go to israel you're

1064
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,260
like

1065
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,580
of this is cool everybody else has the same everybody here is the same penis

1066
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,220
like that's a good feeling i think

1067
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:33,220
I guess that's true. I can see that. And I know they like basically hire...

1068
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:36,220
You never even think of doing the birthright thing?

1069
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:42,220
No, I was over... So obviously like you get raised Jewish, you go to Sunday school and shit.

1070
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:47,220
They, from the very beginning, they're like Israel is the best place on earth.

1071
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:54,220
It's basically heaven. And then you turn like 13, become a man and Jewish,

1072
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:58,780
Jewish and then you realize that they're just saying that to get money from you.

1073
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:04,940
Oh I see. How does Birthright work? Do you like sign up on like Delta? Like yep.

1074
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:12,180
It's a free trip as far as I know right? You do it through your school or...

1075
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:17,340
Yeah you do it through your Jewish community. Because like the thing about

1076
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:23,300
it is I honestly I can't think of anyone I know that like went on Birthright.

1077
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,940
Really? Yeah. It's not crazy. I feel like I know a couple people who went on birthright.

1078
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:34,300
I know one person. And I didn't know about Jewish stuff until a couple years ago.

1079
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:41,700
Yeah, I just, you know, it's one of those things where, especially when I was

1080
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:47,620
turning like 10 years ago when I was turning like 18, Israel was already like

1081
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:53,140
war zone, you know? So every Jewish mother was like, "No, you can't go to Israel

1082
00:52:53,140 --> 00:53:01,620
they're gonna bomb you. Oh I see. But yeah it is I don't know they try and get you

1083
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:06,780
to love Israel from the very beginning. It's like here's the book and here's

1084
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:12,860
Israel give them your change. But you resisted because of your amazing

1085
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:20,500
steadfast morality. No I was anti-semitic. Oh that'll do it too I suppose. Yeah the

1086
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:24,780
The idea of a country of Jews sounds horrible to me.

1087
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,380
You were late episode Squidward.

1088
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,740
Sorry to bring it back to that.

1089
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:33,980
You were a Squidward that was not so much wanting to hang out with other Squidwards

1090
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:36,540
because it was a bit of a reflection of yourself.

1091
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:37,540
Yeah.

1092
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,900
I was like, these people are so dour.

1093
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:45,780
My thing about Jews is you think Jews are awesome like Seinfeld and Larry David.

1094
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:47,220
And you're like, wow.

1095
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:51,500
every Jewish person was like that how could they possibly hate us and then you

1096
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:57,580
beat just a regular Jewish person and you're like oh I get it now again

1097
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:04,380
nothing to say about this yeah absolutely nothing to add. You need to be arms crossed kind of shaking your head disapproving of the whole thing.

1098
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:09,700
I mean I am I literally am I heard you say even go into dissing Jewish

1099
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:15,300
people and not the country and this is a big no-no for me. Yeah I wish everyone

1100
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,680
Every single Jew was like Seinfeld and did everything he did

1101
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:25,500
See, I don't even think that I think every Jew is perfect exactly as they are. Yeah, Woody Allen Seinfeld

1102
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:32,500
Oh, I mean, come on. You're putting me you're putting me in a corner over here man. You're trying to trick me. Okay, Dershowitz

1103
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:38,980
Alan Dershowitz, I'm not he's funny. That's all I know that video was so funny that as soon as his name came out

1104
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,940
He was like maybe I did it but what about the other ones?

1105
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:48,860
Well his his thing was he was like, oh, wasn't he the one who was like a lot of these people are so focused on these

1106
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:53,860
Epstein flight logs and not on the fact that Hamas is cutting off children's heads

1107
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:59,440
Yeah, which is a pretty beast way to go about that. Yeah, you have to think

1108
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:05,060
What would he have been doing a couple years ago before this war broke out? Well, what he what would have been his excuse then?

1109
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,260
Probably that McDonald's raised the prices probably something like that

1110
00:55:09,260 --> 00:55:16,140
I would love to get Alan Dershowitz's thoughts on inflation and fast food.

1111
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:17,340
He would come on beers we drank.

1112
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,900
I think I have his phone number.

1113
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:24,580
Somebody I know got his phone number and got drunk at a party and gave it out to a bunch

1114
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:25,980
of people.

1115
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:30,460
I think Patrick tried to play the 8-ball pool with him on the iMessage.

1116
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:31,460
Did he reply?

1117
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,660
No, I don't think he responded.

1118
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:40,500
Somebody I know texted him and said something, some kind of funny message, and he just said,

1119
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:41,500
"Who is this?"

1120
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:44,660
Yeah, maybe it's not a big texter.

1121
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:46,500
Maybe just try FaceTiming him.

1122
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:49,740
Yeah, he doesn't really know about texting, I'm sure.

1123
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:55,380
I remember Rudy Giuliani's number leaked on Twitter among certain types of people, and

1124
00:55:55,380 --> 00:56:01,020
it was, again, what people would do is they would text him or ask him to play pool.

1125
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:04,020
I feel like getting a famous person's phone number...

1126
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:07,140
Yeah, it's really limited in what you can do without like

1127
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,100
prank calling them I

1128
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:14,700
Don't really have anybody very famous in my phone that I would have any interest in

1129
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:18,020
Well, I wish I did if you had Obama's phone number

1130
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:23,140
If I had Batman's phone numbers, I was a homeless phone number. Oh Obama's phone number

1131
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:27,820
From where I'm sitting. Yeah, probably the same exact thing. I

1132
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:35,160
Just thank him same as I would with Batman but Batman's my number. Thank you so much man. Yeah

1133
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:40,040
Well, you wouldn't think mad bad, thank you so much for being Kenyan

1134
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:46,680
Thank you so much. Dot dot dot five days later for being Kenyan because he didn't respond

1135
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:53,660
Right. He goes like what the fuck for smoking cigarettes fucking guy

1136
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:57,760
WTF question mark. Yeah, probably what he would hit me with. I

1137
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:05,480
Will rewatch the video of him drinking the Flint water the other day and that is the funniest video that I

1138
00:57:05,480 --> 00:57:11,760
That guy had so much goodwill as the president from so many people like remaining

1139
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,680
Yeah, and that we're like it really really ruined it to do that stunt like give me a glass

1140
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:23,560
Come on, give me he didn't have to do that at all. Yeah, he could have said this is horrible

1141
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:27,200
he went to fl- I don't know if you know about this story, Flint, Michigan had

1142
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,600
lead in their water, high amounts of lead

1143
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:33,960
it led to all these birth defects and- I remember that

1144
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:38,080
yeah so then Obama went to Flint and instead of being like

1145
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:42,800
what a terrible situation, this was a complete failure of

1146
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:47,080
this government, instead he was like you know what man

1147
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:51,520
I'm thirsty, give me a glass of water and he drank a glass of tap water

1148
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,760
and basically took the tiniest little sip

1149
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,040
I've ever seen in my entire life

1150
00:57:56,040 --> 00:58:00,220
and probably spit it out as well on national television.

1151
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:01,060
- That's awesome.

1152
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:01,880
- They were probably like,

1153
00:58:01,880 --> 00:58:04,580
you can only take the world's smallest sip.

1154
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,440
- Yeah, well, again, even if you drink the whole glass,

1155
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,700
the problem isn't that you drank one glass

1156
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:11,400
of Flint, Michigan water.

1157
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,080
The problem is when you've been drinking it

1158
00:58:13,080 --> 00:58:14,960
since you were two years old.

1159
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,480
- And your parents have been drinking it.

1160
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,560
- Yeah, exactly.

1161
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,880
- Yeah, and showering in it.

1162
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,400
It's like, so, do you remember that video

1163
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:26,820
that like Indian guy who's like this river is completely clean and like he

1164
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:34,640
like drank a glass of the water and had to go to the hospital me and hometown

1165
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:42,920
has a we have a bad water thing there was a Teflon company that dumped some

1166
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:46,840
by-product into the water supply for like 20 years and they found out about it

1167
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:52,080
like 2015 and uh, no, you know, me and Noah were completely normal.

1168
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:53,040
Yeah.

1169
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:53,440
Right.

1170
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,440
We had all our hair and all that kind of thing.

1171
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,240
My two most normal friends.

1172
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:02,520
I go towards you, Noah, Noah's brother.

1173
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,320
Yeah.

1174
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:08,320
No kind of brain damage that makes you annoying throughout that entire group.

1175
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:11,480
You know, it really is a miracle.

1176
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,080
It's just nice that we got, you know, attacked like that and had zero side effects.

1177
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,020
Yeah.

1178
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:20,440
Well, LA too, very funny is, uh,

1179
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,960
like the port of LA, like the bay and shit.

1180
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,960
They used to take like nuclear waste and like, they were supposed to drop it like

1181
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:32,200
50 miles outside of the coast.

1182
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:37,880
Just like, like Homer style, taking a barrel of nuclear waste on like a barge.

1183
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,880
And then the Homer style was just like, ah, fuck it.

1184
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:44,720
And just like kicking it off the boat after like five minutes.

1185
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:45,680
That's badass.

1186
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:52,400
Like we fucking took it all the way. So does LA have nuclear water now? They were like, well, it's the ocean. It's fine

1187
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,500
It's not true as fuck. Isn't that the water that you were living right in front of basically?

1188
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:03,400
Yes, it was. That was awesome. It was really it was really fun. This is in Rex and

1189
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,200
Like oh my god, the beach is right there. That looks so beautiful

1190
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,000
But then the port it's like right next to the beach. So no one is ever in the water

1191
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:15,760
That means asking you in the water. That is a nasty beach there

1192
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,540
Uh, there is a video that went around of a guy fucking the beach

1193
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:24,300
He like dug a hole in the ground and was was humping it and I was like I recognize that Beach

1194
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,420
That's right in front of my house

1195
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:30,880
It's probably a good beach then I

1196
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:33,120
Mean, yeah, it's gonna be really good guys having sex

1197
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:36,940
I've never seen anybody have sex with one of these nice beaches in Miami or anything

1198
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,160
Kirk's in Cape Coast, nobody's having sex with the beach.

1199
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:41,960
Right, they're having sex on the beach.

1200
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:42,460
Exactly.

1201
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:45,320
So this has got to be the best beach ever if people have to fuck it.

1202
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,320
Right.

1203
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,320
They have to do it.

1204
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,320
They have to.

1205
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:49,320
They have to.

1206
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,320
Yeah.

1207
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,320
It should be...

1208
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:56,560
Imagine like a metal detector guy on the beach and he just pulls...

1209
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:59,040
Just starts digging and it's a pocket pussy.

1210
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,040
He's just like, "Yes!"

1211
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,040
[laughter]

1212
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:03,040
Wonderful idea.

1213
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:06,040
I don't think we've been breached yet.

1214
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,920
I don't think we've even breached the slot idea.

1215
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,440
I think it was just like knives.

1216
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:14,040
Okay, we need to chill on it more and think about it more.

1217
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:20,640
Guys, this has been a truly catastrophically good episode of "Beers We Drink."

1218
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:22,640
I'm your host, Caleb Pitts.

1219
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,340
Thank you so--although, no, I'm not actually.

1220
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,340
This episode, Jubio is the host.

1221
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:27,340
I just decided.

1222
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,640
I'm actually not the host.

1223
01:01:28,640 --> 01:01:29,640
I'm a guest.

1224
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,640
Thank you so much for listening.

1225
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:33,640
I've never been on the show.

1226
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,640
And goodbye.

1227
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,640
Peace.

1228
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,640
It's over guys.

1229
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:38,640
Goodbye.
