11
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,040
Have you heard?

12
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,880

00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,360
- It's Thought Week in Philadelphia.

14
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,840
- Is it actually?

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:23,320
We need to do something about this.

16
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,920
- It's Thought Week in Philadelphia.

17
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,320
- It's Thought Week in Philadelphia.

18
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,640
There's thotties gonna be walking all around.

19
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,060
not only are they going to be

20
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,000
fine and some of the baddest bodies on the east coast are joining up in

21
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,880
philadelphia for a pussy i mean i don't i a pussy party and all the brothers and

22
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,220
sisters are invited

23
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,920
why you saying brothers like that

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,720
we mean

25
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,000
that's my accent

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,840
guys i i i hate to say it i hate to say it or this this fast on the other side

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,800
i think it's not good to be a thought

28
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,200
wall

29
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,580
i guess morally wrong

30
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,580
Holy!

31
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,860
Alright, you gotta calm down.

32
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,140
I'm sorry, I didn't want to bring it up.

33
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:59,140
I think it's awesome.

34
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,780
I didn't want to bring it up, but you forced my hand.

35
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,780
I think actually, counterpoint.

36
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,220
That's an opinion I've been sitting on for a long time.

37
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:07,500
I think that it's awesome to be a thought and a ho.

38
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,900
That makes sense coming from someone who's failed morally.

39
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,900
Yep.

40
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,900
Really.

41
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,460
You are compromised in a morally and Christian way.

42
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,740
You're immuno-compromised, but for morals.

43
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
And for...

44
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
Yeah.

45
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
We'll talk about that another time.

46
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,140
Literally, sin can so easily permeate your body.

47
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,140
How?

48
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:29,100
just there's nothing blocking you're like a porch light like a sin is a moth

49
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,420
yeah, like a porch light yeah. You have like a porous body like the

50
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,220
porous body of yeah, you have like pores that same can go into yeah and it

51
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,260
just I don't I don't see how I don't you have like you have like know what

52
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:46,540
about my lifestyle could you know some people some people they just have acne

53
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,980
and that's just it. They just have it forever and that's that and that's it

54
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:51,640
they get the fucked up face scars and stuff.

55
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,140
That's you for sin.

56
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,860
It's funny that does just ruin your life.

57
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,780
If you have really bad acne as a kid, you just, no, but you would never see anybody who's

58
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,780
really successful.

59
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,780
I am so grateful.

60
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,420
Who has all, who has fucked up acne scars.

61
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,420
It's crazy, yeah.

62
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:07,200
Except for TrainwrecksTV, the famous gambler.

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,200
He has bad acne scars.

64
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,340
I don't know that I'd consider him that successful.

65
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,340
He's a bit like a millionaire.

66
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:13,340
And the grand scheme of things.

67
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:18,620
TrainwrecksTV is the most successful guy, the most successful gambler, but I think the

68
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:23,180
the most successful person with acne is probably Dr. Pimple Popper.

69
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,740
I think, I mean I like TrainwrecksTV, I like what he does.

70
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,500
She has acne patients.

71
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,660
He's almost definitely a servant of the devil.

72
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,660
Oh yeah, 100%.

73
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,660
Do you have Trainwrecks?

74
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,940
No, wait, no, he's a knight for God.

75
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,940
Who is?

76
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,940
I don't think so.

77
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,940
TrainwrecksTV?

78
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,540
He's the guy who teaches children how to gamble on Twitch?

79
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,540
Yeah, okay.

80
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,540
Yeah.

81
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,540
I think he actually might be put...

82
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,860
I got distracted, hold on, I got to get my thoughts back on track.

83
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,620
You guys are making me think too much about...

84
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,620
Thoughts, yeah.

85
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:52,160
How much fun it's gonna be tonight when I do all this sinning.

86
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,760
Are you gonna go to Thought Week?

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,760
You're gonna sin tonight?

88
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,440
You're going all the way to Philly for Thought Week just to sin?

89
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,440
I'm going to condemn them.

90
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,840
I'm going to do debauchery.

91
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,200
Did you guys ever have a, like in college, like a street preacher guy come?

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,200
No.

93
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,200
No, yelled at them.

94
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,200
We went to the same college.

95
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,280
You and me both went to different colleges too.

96
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,280
That's true.

97
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,280
And I had a street preacher.

98
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,840
But I guess you didn't have a street preacher.

99
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,940
We didn't have a street preacher. We're a public university, so he could just

100
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,040
cut you anybody can just come on the campus. Yeah, so he would just come on the

101
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:28,920
campus and he'd like he'd like busk by talking about how thotties and gay

102
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,320
gays are going straight to hell. There wasn't a street preacher, but there was.

103
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,960
People just like breakdance in front of him. There was a guy. At our like the dorms

104
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,580
that I stayed in there was a veteran with PTSD in the apartments across the

105
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,600
Street and this kid shined a laser pointer into his apartment and he came

106
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:52,880
over to our apartment building with a gun. Whoa that's sick. Well so what happened

107
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:56,280
was is like he was like somebody shining like a red light into my house and like

108
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,240
scaring me and my daughters and his daughters were with him and he was

109
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,360
wearing like basketball shorts and he had the pistol in his pocket and Cameron

110
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
just dropped the recorder. Let this go on record.

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,040
Yeah Cameron just dropped the recorder. He's the clumsy one who makes the most mistakes.

112
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,600
Yes, that's right. I was the first one who dropped something today. There wasn't someone who dropped something just minutes before me

113
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,280
Nope, you know something earlier. I didn't even say anything

114
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:28,300
Speaking of dropping something the guy he wasn't even connecting the bottle these thoughts in Philadelphia we dropping dropping it

115
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,360
Yeah, you also you told the story before at least I did. Yeah, damn it

116
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:38,440
Yeah, I told this story before went on vacation with my cousins one time. I was maybe 13 14 that story our

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,960
I know this one all the way through like condo apartment thing that we were

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,120
staying in it was in front of another guy's and he it was like on a hill so he

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,160
could see the roof of ours and we would jump up on the roof and he would yell at

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,040
us and then we started putting stuff up on the roof and we wanted to and then we

121
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,700
found a dead seal on the on the beach and we tried to drag it up to put it on

122
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,120
the roof and we're gonna put it in a chair and put a cigar in its mouth and

123
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,280
and but the seal as we pulled it away, it did it like split in half. It was

124
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:11,700
completely

125
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:18,460
is awful. It is like that it was a great. We thought we were like that'd be so

126
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,120
funny, then we started bringing it. We're like all like is it

127
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,720
it was intact enough that you dragged it and then when this when you tried to

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,040
get it up on the roof, that's when it split in half. Yeah,

129
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,760
did all down the side. If we had been there a week earlier or not a week,

130
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,520
three days earlier when the seal freshly died yeah we would have been the seal

131
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:42,520
you know the funniest thing I'd ever done yeah absolutely

132
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,880
it's still pretty one of the funniest deal with a cigar in his mouth sitting

133
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,000
in a beach chair funny and went after a guy gets mad at you the day after yeah

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
it's gonna rot yeah I don't give a fuck that's funny until the next day when you

135
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,760
wake up and all you're smelling is this old fucking guy try to prove it prove

136
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:02,840
that three 14 year olds brought a dead seal onto the roof yeah where'd they get

137
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,560
the cigar from my dad we got it from our dad mm-hmm yeah we have there was a

138
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,720
there's like this guy we like when we were like seven this guy came up to our

139
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,320
house we're like kids like play we were in our living room playing but we had

140
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,520
the windows open and I guess we were being too loud and he walked up the hill

141
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,720
and started like he looked into our screen door and started yelling at us

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,960
okay and he said he was gonna call the police on us and then like a couple

143
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,280
months later he died. Whoa that is sick dude. Yeah you guys are probably killed

144
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,920
him with loudness. Honestly you're loud playing. I did have that thought like

145
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,960
well he shouldn't have yelled at me. We had a I lived in a car apartment a

146

I've been seeing ghosts.

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,320
I do have a pre-roll that I got from this party.

171
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
That's so awesome.

172
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:07,760
It came in a tube and I looked at the amount of THC in the thing.

173
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't tell me it's a thousand.

174
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,080
It was like a one gram joint with 28% THC.

175
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,240
That's pretty low.

176
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,320
Yeah, 28% is low.

177
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,160
That scares the fuck out of me.

178
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,800
What are you talking about?

179
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,080
They should make joints that are 1% THC.

180
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,080
They make those.

181
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,080
What?

182
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Yeah.

183
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,080
They make CBD.

184
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,080
.005.

185
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,920
I thought about buying some, Gus, when we were in LA, Gus gave me a CBD cigarette.

186
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Yeah.

187
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
And I was like, "Oh, this is good.

188
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,440
I can like smoke something that isn't a cigarette when I'm drunk."

189
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,360
But then I like had it and it just makes the entire balcony smell like mango.

190
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,280
So it's like clear that you're not smoking a cigarette, you know?

191
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,440
Yeah, it has to be.

192
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,720
It needs to just be a cigarette.

193
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Yeah, pretty much.

194
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,960
also still bad to smoke anything I think yeah I think it is you're just not

195
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:59,160
supposed to breathe stuff in that's not there. Is that fucked up? That's the funniest fucking argument though like

196
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,040
people who smoke weed like their whole lives and then they're just trying to

197
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:06,060
tell you like no it doesn't cause cancer. I had somebody once tell me that the

198
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:11,000
carcinogens that smoking weed puts in your body actually so it does put some

199
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,240
in your body they said into your lungs but then because weed is so like healing

200
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,880
it actually removes more when you exhale. Yeah it goes in and then it pulls it out.

201
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:25,920
to the carcinogen. It's like a plumbing snake. It's fucking genius. People's dopers are so

202
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,440
stupid. They're scum. It's so funny. I love just seeing whenever somebody says that like

203
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,400
oh like... Dopers and thoughts. ...weed is harmful or something. Everyone's like, like

204
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,440
everyone who smokes... It's just a plant. Yeah, everyone who smokes so much weed that

205
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:46,600
they are literally mentally challenged. Yeah. Seeing them like get mad and like and is so

206
00:09:46,600 --> 00:10:06,400
so

207
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:12,520
fucking do true yeah I'm smoking put what the hell yeah wait pause you're smoking

208
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,360
put yeah that's fucking disgusting that's all I meant pot oh all right well

209
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,720
yeah your stoner time smoking weep yep not you're sad yep no like but if you're

210
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,960
if you're gonna sell we have some tricky situations if you're gonna smoke weed

211
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:33,080
don't try and tell me that it's like fuck my thing that's not a typo I fucked my

212
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:38,440

213
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:47,840
That's my bad yeah. I fucked my step. Yeah, I fucked my blue.

214
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:53,800
Blue just yeah, that was supposed to say dad. Oh, my fingers the guy's so high

215
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,720
that he thinks that he fucks it up. You were following that you were following

216
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,600
- No.

217
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
- I forgot you cut your hair.

218
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,280
- He's the doper.

219
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,100
- Yeah.

220
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
- He's the doper.

221
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,780
- Let me look at your hair.

222
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,600
- That could be the movie where it's the thing

223
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,440
and one of them's high as hell, the doper.

224
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,280
- Short hair.

225
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,100
- You look like a senator.

226
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:09,940
- His hair is short.

227
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,780
- I shaved my own head.

228
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,600
- Yep.

229
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,440
- Well, you didn't shave it.

230
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
You cut it.

231
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,100
- I cut it, yeah.

232
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,240
- You look like you could be a villager.

233
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,080
- Dude, I had like the,

234
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,160
I had like, I had like a little like,

235
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,680
short mullet for like a split second.

236
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,520
- A split second?

237
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,340
- That would be cool.

238
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,840
- Like I shaved the sides down and the top.

239
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:32,480
and the top. And then I like I looked at it and I was just like I I really can't

240
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,280
do that. You don't have the guts to do funny stuff with your head. I do. Yeah. I

241
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,300
do and I did. I had the shittiest mullet for the whole of 2021. You mean the year

242
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:48,440
when you didn't go outside at all? Come on. Yeah. Do something

243
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,880
funny with your head while you still have hair. All right I will grow this out

244
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,720
- Yes.

245
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
- And then now that I own clippers,

246
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,960
I can do whatever I want.

247
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,800
- I think next time I--

248
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,640
- Finally you can do whatever you want.

249
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,980
- Next time I cut my hair,

250
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,840
I might do a rat tail for a little bit.

251
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,680
That'd be pretty funny.

252
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,420
- You know, dude, I can give you,

253
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,240
I can go home and get my clippers right now

254
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,080
and I can give you a fun haircut.

255
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,200
- I mean, looking at your head, no.

256
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,860
I will not let you near my hair.

257
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:10,700
- Why?

258
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,520
(laughing)

259
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:13,360
- It's not happening.

260
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,280
- Let me cut your hair.

261
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,640
- I don't wanna look medieval.

262
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
- I used to cut my friend's hair in high school.

263
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,560
- Yeah?

264
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,080
I used to cut, dude, I cut my own hair most of my life.

265
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,960
Yeah, I can freaking tell.

266
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Yeah.

267
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,120
I will say with this haircut you got to drop these glasses.

268
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,800
These glasses are in the trash now, unless you wear a hat.

269
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Yeah.

270
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Yeah, it makes you look old.

271
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
Yeah, okay.

272
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,840
I'm looking mean for no reason.

273
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,920
It's not, we have to band together.

274
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,920
Why?

275
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,400
He's just cut his hair, why are we being dickheads?

276
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,520
Yeah, we can't be mean, it's, listen, it's fucking, it's thought week in Philadelphia.

277
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm sorry to any for thought week. I'm the world the world is a go drowning in a

278
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,880
mire of sin. I'm gonna kill the Liberty Bell of my nut. I have there's ackney

279
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,000
everywhere. Acne? Millions of teenagers are dying from acne. Oh acne. We need to

280
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,320
forge a better world. Did you guys ever have bad acne growing up? I never

281
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,320
have had acne. I didn't have acne until I was an adult and yeah all I get is just

282
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:17,240
the little. I just get one huge pimple every month. Yeah. A fucking giant one. I never got

283
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,680
one. I got like one zit on my like nose one time. Like one like big white pus ball. You

284
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,800
ever get the ones inside your nose? Oh the ones in your ears. Oh that sucks too. Actually

285
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,520
I did. You guys remember I had that big ass ear pimple? No why would I remember that?

286
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,720
I don't remember that. You guys know we were at a diner and then I was like my ears been

287
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,080
hurting and one of you looked at it and just like screeched.

288
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:44,680
Then it was Cameron. Yeah. I probably didn't screech. Because I was like

289
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:48,520
skating with ear pods in and the sweat was building up and it formed like a big

290
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:53,520
sebaceous like I think it was a cyst. I used to be obsessed with cysts in high school.

291
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:59,060
We tried to give my friend's dad a cyst. Why? Because we were like well we

292
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,600
want to pop it we were obsessed with the cyst popping videos and he

293
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,200
was like he said that he gets them every once in a while and we were like please

294
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,040
easily just like wear dirty shirts. I would like to try to get assist for us,

295
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,600
so we can pop it. I would like someone to do some kind of procedure on my feet.

296
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,840
Okay, what do you mean?

297
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:23,000
Open ended any kind of procedure. Ideally one that feels good. Well, that's

298
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,600
we should go get the, I should get a foot, the fish, the fish or when they

299
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,740
fish the one it's kind of scares me, but if it was like an expert doing the one

300
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,500
where they like they razor blade your feet, you know, when someone has really

301
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,520
fucked up feet. Oh yeah, oh yeah, I don't think my feet are fucked up that they

302
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:42,020
can do that to me, but maybe someone would find a feeder. I want the bot

303
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,600
flies removed from my the back of my neck. You have bought flies in the back

304
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,060
of your nose. Those those ones scare me. Kai told me that

305
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:56,180
one of his professors in college was growing a bot fly in his skin like flesh

306
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:59,420
like on purpose, like he was like an insect enthusiast. He's like so any

307
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:03,100
show the guys like check it out guys and he had like a festering disgusting

308
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,480
cool dude oh yeah when you see the video that's like stray dog has 5,000 I

309
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,760
want that just kill the fucking dog speaking of Philadelphia and killing

310
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:15,040
dogs you guys see that video the two Rottweilers attacking the baby and the

311
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,400
two men of action who just start shooting at the dogs no so that is

312
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,720
pretty sick dude these guys are just instantly they do the wheelbarrow trick

313
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,840
no they just shoot the dog I don't know about feet away the dog is right next to

314
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,080
the baby which is in the dog's mouth and the guy there's two guys just start

315
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:36,880
shooting it. I told you guys the wheelbarrow trick right? Have I told you the wheelbarrow?

316
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,120
You pick up the dog by the hind legs and just split it in half. That's what you're supposed to do.

317
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:47,760
Dude I almost had to do that. I don't even think it's a real thing. It's just like,

318
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,280
I think it was a 4chan post or something or someone said that and it stuck in my head.

319
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:55,840
I'm gonna stop doing that anytime. It's so funny. Anytime a dog gets at all aggressive with Phil,

320
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,320
I just rip it. And that's what you're supposed to do to a pit bull.

321
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:05,400
just rip it in half every time I almost had to do it today to a dog named chopper

322
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:10,160
chopper I mean he's asking for a dog was that this is it it's just a mystery dog

323
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,680
with like a really small head and the owner is like so weird and the the he

324
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,920
probably shouldn't say that he's a normal guy he's he's just got a dog

325
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:25,280
named chopper but he when he showed up the first day the thing is don't you

326
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,680
shouldn't bring dogs you shouldn't bring like weird violent dogs to a dog park

327
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:35,540
Yeah, bring them to the ocean or something or yeah, yeah, but he showed he shows a goose farb and he starts picking feed

328
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:39,840
So it's yelling at Phil trying to kill Phil and grab his ball the owner was yelling at him

329
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:45,020

330
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:52,440
Chopper comes up to me and I'm trying to kind of like soothe the the situation kind of diffuse it a little bit and the

331
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,620
Owner's like oh, yeah, if chopper comes up to you just don't touch his head the owner said that well

332
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,460

00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,700
He was mr. Bean like he was mr. B. He kind of yeah he kind of is a mr. Bean.

335
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:13,260
Okay, meet some weird dog owners owning a dog you know opens a whole new kind of

336
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,900
social area. You know what the you know what the weird the the weirdest thing of

337
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,420
the is if you're walking somebody else's dog in a place that they usually like at

338
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:30,740
park or something and then all the other dog owners know the dog right like so i

339
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:34,740
would walk my mom's dog and all the people who like my mom would talk to

340
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:38,440
every day would come up to me and be like ask who i was and stuff and that's

341
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,100
the weird it because like and you have to they're they're all such weird people

342
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:47,140
yeah today they're like investigating yeah i see people who see i can't tell

343
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,180
if they've seen you probably get that if like you know yeah like your wife is

344
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,220
walking exactly that someone comes up and it's like yeah so like this morning i

345
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,520
was walking down the street and this lady this like German lady dog in full.

346
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,940
That's one of the weirdest social situations. I think it's someone who

347
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,100
knows your dog, but you don't know them yeah yeah she was like this old lady.

348
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,860
She was like I would like to say hello and I was like what I dress she was

349
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,920
talking about Phil. Well, she needs to be with a voice like that. She needs to

350
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,020
be invited and I was like okay. I was like okay. Well, she probably has seen

351
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,980
Phil before in the neighborhood and Phil probably likes her and then Phil gets

352
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,560
close and he never does this feels like

353
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:28,880
and she she was like okay, that's how he says hello goo goo goo goo.

354
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I was it and I was like what the fuck like what does this lady the dog hates

355
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,200
this lady she must have done something really fucked up when he said I last

356
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,760
minute in her soul. Yeah, some people the problem the problem. I think is that

357
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,200
some people they don't have the they have a switch broken in their head that

358
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,080
regulates where you when you talk to a dog you say weird things you do baby

359
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,180
voice and you act strangely. When you talk to a person, you can't do that.

360
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,180
No, that's off.

361
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:59,060
But some people, the switch in their head, it doesn't modulate right or whatever.

362
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,740
So they'll be talking to the dog and then they'll turn to you and then they'll say

363
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,420
something that you shouldn't say to a person.

364
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,420
They're still in dog mode.

365
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,660
They're still in dog mode. Yeah, they don't have an expert recalibration like me. I would

366
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,460
never say a dog thing to a person.

367
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,180
Oh, look at the little dog.

368
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,980
It's serious, we hot out.

369
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,020
People do that. It's crazy. People just don't switch in time.

370
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:25,540
Yeah, and I also, you know, having a-- just seeing other dogs, like people really have

371
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:29,940
different kind of reactions where some people will jump on your dog and then some people

372
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,340
are really scared of dogs.

373
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,340
Yeah.

374
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,340
Even little dogs.

375
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Yeah.

376
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,620
We had to leave a bodega a couple weeks ago because the woman in there was so scared of

377
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,020
Phil and he's like 25 pounds.

378
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Yeah, he's not big.

379
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,020
So awesome, dude.

380
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,300
He also bites.

381
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,300
He's vicious.

382
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,300
He did that to your arm.

383
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Yeah.

384
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,300
Yep.

385
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Yeah.

386
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:53,340
people get really really scared of dogs people are so weird about dogs

387
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,020
especially cats

388
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:59,260
cats get so scared of dogs yeah what's that about cats are so normal though i

389
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:03,740
fucking hate cats if a cat if a cat isn't afraid of my dog i want my dog to

390
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:08,060
kill it yeah my dog is i have a bad dog that needs to reinforce the natural order dogs should be

391
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,540
dogs should also one thing that's really making me reconsider phil is that he

392
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:16,380
actually likes my mailman that's yeah that's not right i mean there's a

393
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,140
that there's a natural order.

394
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:21,060
There's a natural order, there's a natural relationship

395
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,900
between dogs and cats.

396
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,220
- And mailmen. - That needs to be,

397
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,020
yeah, and mailmen, that needs to be upheld.

398
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,380
And it's, and you know, topsy-turvy dog owners

399
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,820
and cat owners nowadays try to train.

400
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,980
- These days. - You can't do that.

401
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,480
- You're saying there's no-- - You can't do it.

402
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,380
- They're saying there's no difference between dogs and cats.

403
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,220
- That's like turning the,

404
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,300
it's like turning the Ghostbusters female.

405
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,580
- A cat can be a dog.

406
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,740
- Yeah. - Yep.

407
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,740
- It's like they're making these new movies now.

408
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,080
Also they're saying now that you--

409
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,240
- They made a movie called Cats vs. Dogs.

410
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,840
- They made a character called Catdog.

411
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,280
- I went to the vet and I told them,

412
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,380
I told them I didn't want to neuter Phil

413
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,620
and they said, "Actually you have to neuter Phil these days

414
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,340
"but you can't get a dog spayed."

415
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,180
- Wow. - Yep.

416
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,000
- Wow.

417
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,100
- I heard that. - Isn't that horrible?

418
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,860
They want to chop all the guys nuts off

419
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,520
but keep all the girls nuts.

420
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,180
- That's terrible. - What the fuck is going on

421
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,700
in this loony topsy-turvy world?

422
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,580
- Why do you have to get animals spayed and neutered?

423
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:21,540
Well because I think the dream is that your dog fucks other dogs all the time.

424
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,820
But you don't want him to get pregnant.

425
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,140
I don't understand that.

426
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Why wouldn't you want more dogs, man?

427
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,140
That's the thing.

428
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,140
I want to see Phil's...

429
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,500
Bob Barker was like telling people to get their pets spayed and neutered at the end

430
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,300
of every Price is Right.

431
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
It's like, why are you doing that?

432
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,300
Because they escape and they fuck and they make thousands of dogs.

433
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,580
and then we have to kill all the dogs,

434
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,740
you get the stupid commercials, the SPCA and shit.

435
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:51,420
You know, we kill so many dogs every day.

436
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,260
- Yeah.

437
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,080
- America.

438
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,220
- There's probably one million dead dogs in a pile.

439
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,820
- They don't, no, they get incinerated.

440
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,320
- Yeah, well how do you think they incinerate them?

441
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,180
They put them in a pile to burn them.

442
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,260
They don't burn them one at a time.

443
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,100
- They burn them one at a time.

444
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:04,920
- They don't have a little--

445
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,760
- Like Obi-Wan Kenobi.

446
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,920
- They don't have a little subway oven type thing

447
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,800
where they put a dog in and a green bar goes,

448
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,360
do they do and you open it up and there's a perfect dog and then they're

449
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,960
at the dog don't have tracker online and it will say that they're there.

450
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,360
What's it called they're checking it for quality

451
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,720
the dog's corpse. Yeah, yeah, checking to make sure I've been eating a lot of

452
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:31,640
dominoes and Arby's recently Dominoes. I've been ordering dominoes or Arby's at

453
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,560
least one dominoes is a pretty good dominoes is a good is Arby's. You're

454
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:49,000
is

455
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Uber Eats close.

456
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:55,000
We're talking about Arby's, you know, those prices are so low.

457
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Uber Eats aren't so bad.

458
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
How does Arby's keep the prices down?

459
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
I don't fucking know.

460
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I guess the meat is very thinly sliced.

461
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Well, yeah, they're trying to slice it thinner these days.

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
I started getting double meat on my sandwiches.

463
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Yeah.

464
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
I had some Taco Bell the other day.

465
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
That's a damn bad fast food, I've decided.

466
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I don't like it anymore.

467
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
What's wrong with you?

468
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
I realize the only thing I like about Taco Bell is the nacho cheese.

469
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
That's the only good thing I like.

470
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
They are falling off so hard.

471
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
You don't like a gordita?

472
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
No, still, I love a gordita.

473
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I love the gordita.

474
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
It's not authentic.

475
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's fallen off in the past couple years.

476
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That's all you need to get.

477
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,640
Taco Bell has been going downhill since 2019.

478
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,600
I've been eating too much authentic Mexican food.

479
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
Everything goes, yeah, but that's a different type of food.

480
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I've been eating too much authentic Mexican food.

481
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Abuelas.

482
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Abuelas.

483
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,440
Abuelas, I mean come too many abuelas and tias.

484
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,240
Come too many abuelas culo.

485
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,520
Yep.

486
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
You guys are stupid.

487
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,520
No, you're not.

488
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
What?

489
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
Yeah, I'm not.

490
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Oh yeah.

491
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,520
Fuck you.

492
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
You're not stupid.

493
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Yeah.

494
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,520
Idiot.

495
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Yeah.

496
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
If you only try joining this team.

497
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
You guys knew what you were saying right now.

498
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
I don't know what I'm saying.

499
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,520
You're having too much fun today.

500
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,560
Yo quiero comer abuela culo.

501
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:14,560
I think the only fast food I get now is either Taco Bell or McDonald's.

502
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,280
McDonald's is fucking ass now too.

503
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,280
They stopped doing McDonald's.

504
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,880
I haven't gotten McDonald's in so long.

505
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,080
The only, well that's the thing, the only things that I would get, well actually Chick-fil-A

506
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
too.

507
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
I love Chick-fil-A.

508
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
Chick-fil-A I love it.

509
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
And Popeyes too.

510
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,040
But I haven't gotten much fast food at all recently, but those are the places that I

511
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,040
would go.

512
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,080
And all those things, I would only get one thing there.

513
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,320
I would like McDonald's, I'll get a McChicken.

514
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,800
I would not get anything else.

515
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,680
I would get a gordita, a taco bell,

516
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,160
and then maybe something else.

517
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,000
Yeah, it has, it's too expensive.

518
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,040
- I don't want the McChicken.

519
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,320
You know what I want when I go to,

520
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,280
I want a double hamburger cheeseburger.

521
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,200
- The double cheeseburger is still good.

522
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,040
- Yep.

523
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,660
- What's the fucking, Burger King has never been on.

524
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,500
- Lie, lie.

525
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,240
- Burger King is pretty bad.

526
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,080
I don't really like Burger King.

527
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,520
- Whopper's the best fast food hamburger.

528
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,340
- It's never been on, but if you go in there

529
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,280
with the mindset, this is not gonna be good,

530
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,120
It's amazing.

531
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,940
- You're fucking stupid.

532
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,780
The chicken, amazing.

533
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:16,880
- The first two chickens I had were so good.

534
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,440
When it first came out, they were so good,

535
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,920
and now they're horrible.

536
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,760
- Yep.

537
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,640
- No, no, Burger King has like,

538
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,400
it's literally like,

539
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,400
you can go to Burger King in February,

540
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,440
and that is not the same as Burger King in April.

541
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,280
- Yeah, no.

542
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,240
- That's how restaurants are too,

543
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,040
'cause it's real, okay?

544
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:32,880
- Yeah, exactly.

545
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
- It's actually flame broiled burgers.

546
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,320
- You can smell Burger King like from,

547
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,080
if you live next to a Burger King,

548
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,360
prepare for your all your clothes to smell like Burger King for the rest of

549
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,760
your life. Do you know what else that what other fast food I had

550
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,840
recently I hadn't had in ages in LA was Subway. Subway. I had Subway I had

551
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,200
Subway for the first time in like three years. That was really the first time

552
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,840
yeah in like three or four years. Subway has been taking some hits as of late but I enjoy

553
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:03,320
myself a Subway sandwich. I'm a Quiznos boy. I like a six-incher. Quiznos is shit.

554
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:08,000
Firehouse subs is shit. Write that down he likes a six-incher. A six-incher Subway

555
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,920
sandwich okay yeah with extra mayonnaise shooting out of it onto my face no I'm

556
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,600
playing though yeah I just like the same way he likes two little tomatoes at the

557
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,080
bottom of the sandwich okay so basically what I like is a hoagie roll that has a

558
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,960
mayonnaise bottle in it that squirts on my face two little tomatoes and a bunch

559
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,520
of shredded lettuce on top to look like pubes that's what I like is that what you

560
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:33,160
want me to say yep you know what I really wish they had here that I think

561
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,320
even though I only had it twice has probably become one of my favorites is

562
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,960
cookout yeah. Cookout is the best. Cookout is go to. I've been saying this for years. If

563
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,040
cookout opened in New York City location and it was open 24 hours it would be the

564
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,040
biggest, it would be the biggest most busiest fast-food place in America.

565
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:53,880
Probably. You know what I had. I think my my S tier I think well yeah I probably

566
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,780
changed I guess I don't go to McDonald's at all anymore so I'd probably drop

567
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,640
McDonald's down. I still really like Taco Bell even though I do agree it's gotten

568
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,800
worse. It's gotten so bad. But also I never had Taco Bell until I was in college so

569
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
It's also true. So you don't have the experience.

570
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,440
I don't have the rose tinted glass that me and Pat have.

571
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:17,160
But I think my S-tier is probably cookout, Popeyes, Chick-fil-A, and Taco Bell.

572
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,080
There's no going wrong with the chicken restaurants.

573
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,800
Any chicken restaurant I will put in the S-tier.

574
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,160
Cane's is still like, you know.

575
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:25,160
I only had Cane's one time in my life.

576
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,520
Cane's is falling off a little bit.

577
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,440
I'll put the Zaxby's in this S-tier.

578
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,640
Never had Zaxby's, Chick-fil-A, and the Popeyes.

579
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,240
What's the fucking chain that's like...

580
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Oh, oh, oh, Carl's Jr.

581
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,040
That's just, that's Harveys.

582
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,040
Was that the one where we got the breakfast sandwich?

583
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:44,040
Can we go through, what places did we go on tour?

584
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Which fast foods did we go?

585
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
We went to Jack in the Box.

586
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,040
That was what expanded my...

587
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Carl's Jr. breakfast I liked.

588
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:54,040
I got the burger.

589
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,040
I thought that was one of the best fast food breakfast sandwiches.

590
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,040
I should have gotten that because the Jack in the Box, or the Carl's Jr. burger.

591
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,160
I just got the number one. I got the number one. It's like 9 in the morning. Yeah

592
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:12,800
Yeah, but you know I you can't eat a breakfast burger. Yes, you can that's some stupid. That's yeah, that's bullshit

593
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,880
That is some fucking nah. That's fine. Okay. It's the first

594
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,380
Microbial time at the time of the time didn't breakfast burger time didn't matter the time matter

595
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:28,060
I was doing the test I was doing the ultimate test the ultimate test is eating a burger if it's a fucking burger place

596
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:34,680
Yes, it's not it's a fast-food restaurant. It's a fast-food restaurant that primarily sells burgers. You got to judge everything

597
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,120
I like my breakfast burrito. Yeah, the breakfast sandwich was quite good

598
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,400
We went to Jack in the Box. Maybe I had what do we get a check in the book?

599
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:48,100
What's that? I got a breakfast sandwich on a sourdough. I got the breakfast burrito or maybe that was no

600
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,840
That was what I like that was that was that was the really good one

601
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:55,300
We got the Carl's jr. Was on the way to San Francisco is that and we got that for breakfast. Yeah

602
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:59,840
What did I get there? I don't know. I got a steak burrito, a steak breakfast burrito, and it was mighty fine.

603
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:06,960
Wait, where did we get that? That was Jaggerbox. Los Angeles. Los Angeles. On the way out. On the way out. Nope, not in Long Beach.

604
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
It was in North Hollywood.

605
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,220
Like the movie. Yep. I don't, I think, I don't remember what I got at all. I'll have to go again.

606
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:20,760
There's a movie North Hollywood directed by Mikey Alfred and Miranda Cosgrove is 30 years old playing a high schooler in it.

607
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,080
There's a movie I watched both both Godfathers Miranda Cosgrove is someone that could play a high schooler forever. That's fine

608
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,120
No, she looks until she started. It doesn't matter. No. She's one of those people that doesn't matter what she looks like

609
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,000
It's okay that she can play high school or forever

610
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:38,840
You know there's certain people you have to just give passes to that's like you can you can get a child for your whole

611
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:45,220
Way too hard. She cuts. I watched that movie. She cusses. She cusses like a damn sailor

612
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:50,380
I shut that movie off. I shut that bitch up. I shut that movie Miranda Cosgrove cuss

613
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,420

617
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:13,500
a math movie you hate Romeo and Juliet I hate Romeo plus Juliet I hate all of

618
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:17,780
Baz Luhrmann's movies why did he make he made that Mulan Roush he made that great

619

you guys gonna see I mean two huge movies out this weekend call Elvis and

622
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,200
the black phone I know I don't know if you guys have heard about this Elvis by

623
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,100
Boz Lerman yeah call me when he makes a Yilvas movie yeah yeah I don't know if

624
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,140
you guys have heard it all about this but apparently in the black phone Ethan

625
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:50,500
Hawke turns in a career-defining terrifying performance as a sinister new

626
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,860
horror icon the grabber the grabber the grabber yes grab Ethan Hawke as the

627
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:59,500
terrifying grabber did you in the new movie the black phone apparently he

628
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,860
plays the grabber and get this the grabber he's a magician who kidnaps

629
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:07,520
children he puts him in a basement guess what's in the basement the grab a black

630
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:14,020
phone no yeah the phone or does it have some kind of why are they calling him

631
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:19,500
the grabber when he's got a phone. Ethan Hawking is the phoner. Does it have the dark application

632
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:24,300
on it? What's wrong with the black phone? Apparently when you pick up the black phone

633
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,020
you are able to talk to the spirits of the children that the grabber has kidnapped. Why

634
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,300
the fuck would they want to do that? Now what I don't understand is why the grabber keeps

635
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,340
the kid in a room where he can talk with the other kids and play. You're going to give

636
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,260
him advice. Exactly. The grabber, why don't you put him in a room with a different phone?

637
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,780
like an AI trying to learn. I got a scene that they could okay scary movie six

638
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,300
comes out they do my phone right mm-hmm kid picks up the phone on the other end

639
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:57,340
the Jared Fogle guy from Verizon says can you hear me now that's actually pretty

640
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,060
good hmm yeah can you and then and then the grabber says can you grab me or can

641
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:08,140
I grab you now? I heard that actually one of his terrifying lines in the movie

642
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,340
sorry, can I grab you now? Can I grab you now, but he is

643
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,180
great, a fine and let me tell you based on his mask, you might

644
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,680
want to call this guy either the smiler or the frowner because

645
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,420
the grabber has different masks that he switches out based on

646
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:23,720
his emotions. Oh man, I just got an awful text from my grandpa.

647
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,620
What happened? He texted me a joke that he wrote. Let's hear

648
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,460
it. He said the black phone. Did you get it from cricket

649
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,060
wireless?

650
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:34,260
Your grandpa said he just texted me that he just had. I didn't

651
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,760
say that, but he did text me that

652
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,040
That's what he said to me.

653
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:39,880
- Oh my God.

654
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,720
- Can you believe it?

655
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,540
(laughing)

656
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,580
Did you guys know there's a delivery app called Gitter?

657
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,420
- Yeah.

658
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,240
- I just saw it.

659
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,080
- I've been seeing those Gitter guys around.

660
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,020
- It made me laugh.

661
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,100
I was like, he's a Gitter.

662
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:48,940
- Yeah.

663
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,760
- He gets stuff.

664
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,600
- I've been seeing those guys around.

665
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,440
- That's funny.

666
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,940
- I need someone to get something.

667
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,780
I'll call a Gitter.

668
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,620
- Dude, you know what they do?

669
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,180
It's actually, it's fucked up.

670
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,500
'Cause I saw the Gitter,

671
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,900
it was in Manhattan,

672
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:03,860
and what they do is they have little offices, right?

673
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,500
And they have, it's basically like

674
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,420
they rent out a grocery store and you order shit

675
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,660
and it goes straight from the thing.

676
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:15,540
Like I saw like a getter guy leaving on his bike.

677
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,380
- I saw a getter.

678
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,220
- I saw a getter.

679
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,640
- I saw a getter.

680
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,200
- I saw a getter leaving the getter office

681
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,860
and inside of it was just like one guy behind a counter

682
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,660
and it's all like, the wall was lined with like reeses

683
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,760
and like skittles and shit.

684
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:31,200
Like they have like their own grocery store.

685
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,780
- That is horrifying.

686
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:33,880
- That's so, like.

687
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,800
wall of Reese's and Skittles it's so it's so weird that no one has thought of that

688
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,960
before like why not just like a man cut out the middleman and just like have you

689
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,280
know that oh well I heard grocery store in New York City does grocery delivery

690
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,640
well I'm not I don't do that because I don't want to pay a slave I literally

691
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,640
love you doing that because I don't want to make somebody go to the grocery store

692
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,320
for me that is the absolute best part of that yeah going to the grocery store

693
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:08,320
or whatever is the no paying someone to go to the grocery store you know literally

694
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,320
the best thing the best invention no I don't want to go to the grocery store

695
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,160
ever I know the grocery store sucks fucking ass what's wrong with you eat

696
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:19,080
grocery delivery from the from the the grocery store there's a they're not

697
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,480
you don't get to pick your own like fruit out or anything though I tell them

698
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,800
get the best one they don't do that I'd really try there's a better one there's

699
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:32,640
a better one literally it is worth it for the power I hold over someone yeah

700
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:37,880
And when they text me and they say, I love you find this item, we use the

701
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,000
best part of it. No yeah, exactly. Can you look harder? Can you actually it's

702
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,400
probably behind love? Oh my God, I love when they say I can't find this item. I

703
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,760
sit and and they ask if there's a replacement saying, can you send a

704
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,880
picture? Yep, you said it. Oh my God, zooming in on the picture. This is not a

705
00:34:53,880 --> 00:35:00,600
great photo. Caleb Pitts has removed the tip for this order. I did that one time.

706
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:05,180
Well no, hold on, because you're saying the power, the ultimate power is going to the grocery store and picking your own food.

707
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:09,680
Cucked, cucked, cucked, cucked, cucked, cucked, crunch, crunch, crunch, crunch.

708
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,680
Yeah, you are cucked. One time I did grocery delivery.

709
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,680
Actually, the ultimate power is going to the grocery store and selecting your own healthy options.

710
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,680
You are actually such a fucking cuck.

711
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,680
You are gay.

712
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,680
I don't care, the grocery store is awesome. Going to the store is awesome.

713
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,680
The grocery store sucks.

714
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Going to the store is awesome.

715
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,680
What the fuck are you talking, you like errands now?

716
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,040
I love errands.

717
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,560
Something is wrong with you, man.

718
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Something's changed.

719
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,560
You know what it is?

720
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,560
I've been riding bikes everywhere.

721
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,560
What?

722
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,560
How is that?

723
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,440
So you want to haul 50 bags of groceries on your bike home?

724
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,080
No, just enough for the week.

725
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,080
That's 50 for the carriage.

726
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,080
I would be okay with a grocery store if I had a car.

727
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,080
And the bag yet poking out the top.

728
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,920
Okay, all right.

729
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,520
So this is starting to make sense.

730
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Yeah.

731
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:55,960
Yeah, you have a little mental image that you like to try to live up to.

732
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,200
You want to look like a--

733
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,640
You want to be a little Euro guy.

734
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,960
Yeah, you'll be riding your bike around the city getting getting a bag of groceries

735
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah, if you want to you want to pick an apple out and you want to use your you want to put some breath on it?

736
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,780
And then rub it on your shoe if I could eat a protein bag. Oh my god

737
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,280
You you you you you pulling up in front of your apartment and and just smoothly

738
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:20,560
Dismounting your bike and walking inside and saying honey. I'm home to your 13 year old girlfriend. Yeah. Oh my god

739
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,920
Oh, it'll be French. It'll be a friend

740
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,480
- That's exactly what you described.

741
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,840
- Uh-uh, that's not what I described at all.

742
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,240
- That's exactly what you described.

743
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,120
- You know what, it's people in this country are lazy now

744
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,600
and no one likes going to the grocery store.

745
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,440
- Yeah, you're right.

746
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,280
Americans are lazy.

747
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,600
The fucking French on the other hand.

748
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,440
- I'm not talking about the French.

749
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,800
- Hardest workers in the world.

750
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,640
They take six months off every year.

751
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,480
- Oh my God, yeah.

752
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,800
If there's something I like about Europe

753
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,040
is that they get down to business.

754
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,560
- Yep, and how hard they work.

755
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:45,440
They have such a work ethic in Europe.

756
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,760
- They like to sweat.

757
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,600
- Yep, that's right.

758
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,920
- I mean, they do like to sweat, actually.

759
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,760
- There's no such thing locally.

760
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,160
You know, that's right. I mean they do like to sweat.

761
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,360
There's no such thing.

762
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,360
They do not do anything about that.

763
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,360
French people love to sweat.

764
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,060
Yeah.

765
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,560
Oh my god.

766
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,060
They love to get in the dirt.

767
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,760
They love, you know, they love dirt under their fingernails.

768
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,760
It's really a cultural difference.

769
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,760
They just like working, you know what I mean?

770
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,560
You've seen that video of Serge Gainsborough and all those little kids are singing to him and they're like dressed up like him?

771
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,360
Gainsborough?

772
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,160
Who's the...

773
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,360
It's like all these like French kids singing to this guy who is weeping.

774
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:23,240
weeping because they all dress up like him and they're all pretending to smoke

775
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:29,460
and drink and he's like he's full on weeping. Yeah, I think in France you can

776
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:34,740
smoke and drink at age five. Yes, okay, he mixed up William s burrows and

777
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:38,840
search Gainsbourg. Yeah, yeah, I don't give a fuck. That's right. I just

778
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,840
wondered yeah, but you're talking about oh the one time I did well yeah, he

779
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:48,140
looks sweaty as hell in that video, but anyway, the one time I did grocery

780
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,720
was when I had COVID in December,

781
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,620
and I had like a bunch of gin in my fridge,

782
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,840
and I was like, "Oh, I should get some tonic water

783
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,000
"or something."

784
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,700
And the guy was like, he called me and was like,

785
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,600
"They don't have that.

786
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:05,560
"Do you want just plain tonic water?

787
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,360
"They have flavored and they have plain."

788
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,060
And I was like, "Oh, just get me the plain one."

789
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:12,960
And he showed up with like three big bottles of like--

790
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,320
- More like three gallon chunks of water.

791
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,680
- I fucking, dude.

792
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:24,080
How do I like I can't report that and say this is the wrong you would report it.

793
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,980
You would never know.

794
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,080
I love that's the best but one of the best parts of instacart is when they

795
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,280
mess up your order and you get to eat something that you would never eat.

796
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,780
I have to like they like one time we like we ordered on sound fun.

797
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,280
Do not okay.

798
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:39,880
No, it's no we one time on on on on like on when we were getting grocery

799
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:40,780

We were trying to get two sweet potatoes, right?

801
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,080
and we got and the guy brought us two giant bags of sweet potatoes and we got

807
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,960
That's what I'm talking about. She's like sweaty and she was like she's like

00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,040
couch you can fuck the cantaloupe you just bought me I don't know but don't

820
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,440
you dare try and fuck my sweet lady. What's the point of house sitting? House sitting is so...

821
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:18,080
You don't have any dogs. It's an excuse to pay somebody who's a fuck up. Oh. Yeah. Yeah.

822
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,280
It's like when you have like a... Your cousin's out of rehab. Exactly. Yeah. Or like a family

823
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,720
member. You need to water my plants. When you're 26 and you're living at home and your uncle's

824
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,080
like, "Actually, we're going out of town. I guess we need someone to watch our house."

825
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:35,280
That's so smart. Your cousin's out of rehab and then you put him in a house alone with a cabinet

826
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,600
full of opiates from your dental surgery for six days. That's really, really smart.

827
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,800
Yeah. No, it's when you have a neighbor who thinks that you're going to fail in life and

828
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,880
you need $100 this week. Yeah. I guess I did some house sitting when I was a kid.

829
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,040
Yeah, that's what it is. I would love to house sit right now.

830
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,040
I think house sitting also- I'm tired of my apartment.

831
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:59,680
If someone's really rich and they have a villa or something, then it's a favor you can do someone.

832
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:04,640
We got to go on tour again soon. I'm so tired of my apartment. We had a shower problem.

833
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,840
but we're going somewhere. Oh yeah, we are. We're going to Seattle and well,

834
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:11,480
yeah, we're going to Seattle and Portland, but that's not soon enough.

835
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,240
That's soon enough. That's pretty soon. That's very, I am,

836
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,680
I am leaving for a couple of days. What are you guys going to do for my birthday

837
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,840
for your birthday? We should go buddy. I'm going to light off some fireworks.

838
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,440
For real. Yeah. Is there anywhere to watch fireworks around here? Yeah. Yeah.

839
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,200
And you're literally my old.

840
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:32,800
We got a window four days before 4th of July and four days after.

841
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,360
and they're just nonstop fireworks. It sucks.

842
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,300
The worst part of living in New York is the fireworks.

843
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,280
- Dude, literally, it wasn't even 4th of July,

844
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,960
last April when I first moved here,

845
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,260
the people in the building next door to mine

846
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,100
would just light off fireworks every other night.

847
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:47,920
- That was the government destabilizing us for the riots.

848
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,540
- It's so smart that fireworks sound

849
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,920
exactly like gunshots.

850
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,760
- Yeah.

851
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,840
- It's awesome. It's great.

852
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:55,200
- Yeah. Well, the difference is--

853
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,280
- They don't sound exactly like gunshots.

854
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,480
- Yeah, the difference is usually,

855
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,880
if it's a firework, they shoot off and suddenly

856
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,120
you hear someone go yeah. If it's a gunshot, you hear someone shoot it and

857
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,180
they go, "Ha ha ha, I shot you."

858
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:11,380
What if they... No, you can be so happy after you kill somebody,

859
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,080
they go, "Yeah." It's a different type, but it's usually... Okay, firework is

860
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,440
when you hear, "Yay," and then gunshot is also, "Yay," but then at the

861
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,880
same time, quieter, you hear, "Oh." True.

862
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,380
Yeah, like dying in Counter Strike. Yeah, exactly. "We'll get 'em next time."

863
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:29,360
That's awesome in video games. Mission failed. We'll get 'em next time,

864
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:36,520
hear that gunshot soap mctavish is running around the streets of New York

865
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:41,080
City he actually sublets my apartment soap mctavish I would love to someone for

866
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,320
someone to sublet my maybe it's just soap and then general mctavish you're

867
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:49,440
gonna soak my shower got clogged we had to call the guy super so it got clogged

868
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:53,440
with soap I clogged I was using too much soap that's you know I've taken too many

869
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,480
bath bombs and how did wait did you shave your head in the bathroom no I didn't I

870
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,240
I shaved it in my room on top of a trash bag.

871
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,640
Someone was fucking the drain.

872
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:02,640
Yep.

873
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,200
I think my Instacart guy was fucking my drain.

874
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
Someone was fucking the drain.

875
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,200
Your penis fell off into the drain.

876
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,320
I have maybe, I have one of the worst upstairs neighbors ever.

877
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,320
Really?

878
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Yeah, the heavy from TF2.

879
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,320
That's fucking annoying.

880
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
He's so fucking annoying.

881
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,320
Yeah.

882
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,320
He's shooting his mini gun at 3am.

883
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Put me Spencer here.

884
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,320
Put me Spencer here.

885
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,320
Oh my god.

886
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
It's like, can you learn to walk lightly?

887
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
That's right.

888
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
I hear every time he walks, it's his footsteps.

889
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
What happens if he's walking?

890
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
He's walking.

891
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
He's walking.

892
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
He's walking.

893
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,320
He's walking.

894
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
He's walking.

895
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,320
I'm walking upstairs.

896
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Yeah, I know.

897
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
I'm walking upstairs.

898
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:35,320
And when he's fucking the spy dressed as a woman.

899
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,320
Oh my god.

900
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,320
I'm walking upstairs to tell him to keep it down

901
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,320
and in the hallway I hear this

902
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,320
*mimics the sound of a man eating a sandwich*

903
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:47,320
He literally can't make a sandwich without saying sandwich.

904
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,320
Yeah, so fucking annoying dude.

905
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:51,320
Yeah.

906
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:53,320
He is horrible.

907
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
And then he comes downstairs and tries to capture my apartment.

908
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:58,520
apartment. You stand in my apartment for 30 seconds. You

909
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,920
stand for 30 minutes. It's not your f*****g apartment. Yeah,

910
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:03,320
you can't capture it. Yeah, he's trying to wall hack. He's

911
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,080
trying to like he's trying to go through my wall to capture

912
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:13,960
my house. Yeah. He is so I do. I missed it. I had two posters

913
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,360
in my room. The problem with it now is that it's like all it's

914
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,080
all bots and stuff. Yeah. You can't play without a bot. It's

915
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,880
been like ruining it. Here's the idea man. Just just release

916
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:27,040
again yeah easy bro that literally yeah yeah that game did rock they probably

917
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,580
have to add some dude we should we should start a private server after this we

918
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:34,660
should just all play the f2 in here I'm I used to do that with my friends so much

919
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:38,260
in middle school in high school just private TF2 servers dude it's so much

That's the funniest thing to look up. And now all those people are like pretty successful

927
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,200
because that's like obviously. You know that clip in the middle of that that Cod video

what I said recently is not so right.

941
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,920
- Said a lot of things, a lot of bad things on the podcast.

942
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,000
- I'd like to apologize for what I did

943
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,040
at Thought Week in Philadelphia.

944
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,880
- I said a lot of things.

945
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,480
- I send, I send, they say the women are recovering though.

946
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,560
The thoughts, I killed the thoughts.

947
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:32,600
- I killed all the thoughts.

948
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
- I killed some thoughts.

949
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,900
What the hell was that?

950
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,860
- Something's in my throat.

951
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,200
- Can't even talk about thoughts around this guy.

952
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,160
- Yeah, he's making me feel sick.

953
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:44,240
- Oh my God, I don't want to think about thoughts.

954
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:52,240
man. God, I mean, that that harlot over there obfuscating the law of God.

955
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Yep, she's obscene. She's obfuscating the law of God. Yeah, I think so. Yeah,

956
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:04,540
man, I do. I do so well at thought week as a male thought.

957
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:09,340
You'd be a male thought. If you ever decide to be a male thought, I will

958
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:13,840
kill you. Really? I will chop your head off. You already, he's kind of, do you

959
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:18,160
think how what percentage male thought do you think he's at right now? Yeah. I mean

960
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,220
he's kind of locked up right now. I feel like he's got it he's like I mean with

961
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:26,900
his arm like that it's true yeah up from a six to a seven percent percent seven

962
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:32,320
percent. Seven percent. That's safe. Second it hits 51 percent. You done.

963
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:37,960
Toxic gas. Disowning you. Disowning you, your body and your life with toxic gas.

964
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:41,760
But you're pretty low. That's low. I'm glad I'm glad it's a low reader. If your

965
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:50,060
daughter was a thought would you kill her no no I would I would I would send her to

966
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:55,960
like an obedience camp yeah I would do some Rapunzel type shit yeah yeah yeah

967
00:47:55,960 --> 00:48:01,400
dude it must be so like that's why we need we need Charles Manson still around

968
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,480
to keep the thoughts under control yeah like at least so just a complete like

969
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,520
gratifying to a light it's essentially yeah I mean it's fine guys a family type

970
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,160
I think that's like a traveling circus, but for thoughts like a

971
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,160
traveling circus is so every weird kid can run away and their parents enough to

972
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:20,120
deal with them anymore. So the thoughts can run away. The thoughts can run away.

973
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,840
It's weird to be one. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, and they can you know yeah they can

974
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:29,800
travel. It must be so gratifying to be you know in a cult. It's probably the

975
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,680
best thing in the world. If you're like you know one of the favorites. I think people play pretty

976
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:39,760
loose with the term cult. Yeah. Yeah, I heard um. Well Jared Leto has one. I heard

977
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:47,820
that guy fucking Adam from the Norm Macdonald show he talked about some like him he grew

978
00:48:47,820 --> 00:48:52,400
up in like a cult and it was like it was like a boarding school and they just yeah they

979
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,360
they spit on you that's I mean I mean the thing I think that pretty much every every

980
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:02,360
group of people is a cult I disagree well no I think you gotta have sex for it to be

981
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:06,920
a cult Jared Leto is doing that Jared Leto did that you can't be coded you can't have

982
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:11,360
a cult of your celebrity though. No Jared Leto has a cult. People just want to fuck you. He

983
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,800
has a cult where he makes them sign NDAs. That's just the, that's, the second you sign

984
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:21,120
an NDA it's not a cult anymore. It has a legal framework. I guess it's true. What is his

985
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:27,160
cult? What is he doing? He's like bringing people to the, I don't know, like Joshua Tree

986
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:31,200
or some shit and he's having them wear white robes with him. It's a vacation. I, dude,

987
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,220
I fucking hate when I go to McDonald's and the cult is there. They're all wearing the

988
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:39,260
same shirt yeah behind the register not see that this is 1984 and you've been

989
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:43,020
brainwashed yeah you guys at least wear different shirts you're all working the

990
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:51,420
same job yeah exactly it's a costing man Jared Leto not a guy I would be sad if

991
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:56,780
he if he what are you afraid to say you'd be you'd be happy if Jared Leto

992
00:49:56,780 --> 00:50:02,580
died you even I'm afraid of qualified it so many times I know yeah not a guy that

993
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,980
I would be not happy or you if dot dot say if he died yeah you almost said you

994
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:13,220
almost said passed away which is the softest possible way to say it - I would

995
00:50:13,220 --> 00:50:18,020
not be sad if he passed away the fuck kind of it's just a fucking guy you just

996
00:50:18,020 --> 00:50:21,900
say you want him dead I don't want him dead sounds like you do you what I want

997
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,900
me you want him to live you don't want him to ever die you want him to be a

998
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:32,100
you want to live forever call Jared pedo Jared pedo pedophile I think he's a pad

999
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,180
I think he's Jared peddling these fucking dog shit movies to me in the cinema

1000
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:41,820
every week yep he sucks so bad he's I'm I've I hate him so much he really sucks

1001
00:50:41,820 --> 00:50:47,140
I like there there's no there's never been a good I mean he's been in but yeah

1002
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:51,660
besides just being like an evil guy he just he's just so annoying yeah he just

1003
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:58,380
sucks so bad. He literally like, like him and fucking Ezra Miller are on the same

1004
00:50:58,380 --> 00:51:04,260
tier of like psychopath but like he's just better at like making people sign

1005
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:07,420
NDAs because he's like 50. I think they're on the same tier of people that

1006
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:11,940
I don't give a fuck about hearing a single word about. Yeah. Who cares dude?

1007
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:18,140
I'm more concerned with having somebody to hate. Just that's what your parents are for.

1008
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:23,340
you know you know who's very pro thought week Jared Leto good he sounds like a

1009
00:51:23,340 --> 00:51:31,580
beast yeah what I mean supporting thought week makes it makes me makes me happy

1010
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:35,020
because it shows the evil is banding together we can extinguish

1011
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,260
them all yeah exactly one well-placed one one boot heel mm-hmm grind them into

1012
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:47,980
the ground oh my god oh my god grinding a thought into the ground with my boot

1013
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,240
(laughing)

1014
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,440
- Nah, thoughts don't deserve that.

1015
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,060
- No, that's too far.

1016
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:55,800
- Death is too far for the thoughts.

1017
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,600
They only deserve eternal damnation.

1018
00:51:57,600 --> 00:51:58,440
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1019
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,280
- Yeah.

1020
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,100
- Well, they've already got that.

1021
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:00,940
- Yeah.

1022
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:01,780
- I would like to see-- - 'Cause hell,

1023
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,600
they're already in hell. - I would like to see--

1024
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,440
- They're in Philly. - Listen.

1025
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,480
- That's right.

1026
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,240
- Thoughts, they're sinning, they're horrible.

1027
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,840
I hate them, but I would like to see them cured.

1028
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:10,680
- Yep.

1029
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:12,820
- I'd like to-- - I can't stand here

1030
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,560
and preach death, okay?

1031
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:17,280
Obviously, the doctrine of the thought

1032
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:20,520
going to lead for death and suffering for millions if it's allowed to wreak havoc

1033
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:25,520
over the face of the earth but I listen I I pray that they all find

1034
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,920
salvation beyond this world and in the next yep because they are not gonna make

1035
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:35,480
it to 25 because I'm gonna be killing hey I'm but if we're talking body count

1036
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:39,960
they're probably make it a 2500 honestly so violent today I think something pissed

1037
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,120
us off that week yeah you you're just less violent than normal they were on

1038
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:48,220
the same level as we always are you you're not even saying that you want to

1039
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:52,100
kill Jared Leto yeah yeah something's going on something is what are you what

1045
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:23,460
stuff that's been happening. What's been depressing you? I don't have a bike. I

1046
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:28,020
almost brought you one today and I'd for I it was my car was too far away and

1047
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,520
then I have to drive back to my apartment to pick up my laundry. I my

1048
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:36,340
laundry is piling up. That's awful. That's you. I got back into Pokemon. I'm

1049
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:38,780
fucking hating this shape. My head is terrible.

1050
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,260
This is really horrible.

1051
00:53:41,260 --> 00:53:42,860
And have you eaten any candy recently?

1052
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:49,460
I wasn't eating meat for a couple days and then I think before this I accidentally, I

1053
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:54,820
asked the guy at the bodega for falafel over rice and he just gave me lamb over rice.

1054
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:55,820
And you just ate it?

1055
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:56,820
I just ate it.

1056
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,820
I've been trying to eat more meat.

1057
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,820
Yeah, me too.

1058
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:01,220
I've been trying to eat my meat intake.

1059
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:02,220
My meat intake.

1060
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:03,220
It's a bison.

1061
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,220
It's so shit.

1062
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,220
Yeah, it's horrible.

1063
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:06,220
It's fucking terrible.

1064
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:07,780
I think you need meat.

1065
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:11,460
I think it's horrible, but I do think that you need to have...

1066
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,460
Unfortunately, yeah.

1067
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,300
Eat red meat all the time.

1068
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:15,300
I do.

1069
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:16,300
I think you need it.

1070
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:20,220
I think that those guys who eat just meat are almost completely right.

1071
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:25,660
The guys who just eat meat and a mango every day, I bet they're going to live forever.

1072
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:26,660
I think you...

1073
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:27,660
Cholesterol is made up.

1074
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:29,740
I think you need meat.

1075
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:30,740
Yeah.

1076
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,740
I think you need to eat it.

1077
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,740
Think about it.

1078
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:33,740
Why would they...

1079
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:37,380
I can't eat fruits anyway, so if I'm picking out a snack, it has to be some kind of beef

1080
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:43,460
beef jerky. I'm allergic to every fruit. That's why I have depression and anxiety.

1081
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:45,480
You're eating too much.

1082
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,500
I can't even.

1083
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,520
You're eating too many GMOs.

1084
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,040
True, that's probably what it is.

1085
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,460
You know that thing where Alex Jones says that the pesticides are making the

1086
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,480
frogs gay?

1087
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:55,500
Yeah.

1088
00:54:55,500 --> 00:54:56,500
You know that's actually real?

1089
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,500
It's true, yeah.

1090
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,500
It's so crazy.

1091
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,000
Well, it turns them female or something.

1092
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:03,020
Yeah, something like that. It just like messes with their penises.

1093
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,540
It changes their hormones.

1094
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,060
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

1095
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,760
they're it's all fucked they're not turning gay they're turning I think most

1096
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:17,440
of most of what it's pretty gay actually yeah most of what Alex Jones says is

1097
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:20,360
pretty much true yeah he just gets a little too crazy

1098
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,440
something he's a little he goes a little over the top yeah but he's mostly just

1099
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,760
talking I don't know if you guys have watched it a lot of is just him talking

1100
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,720
about TV and movies and he's pretty right yeah he'll just say kind of stuff

1101
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:33,720
about the office it is that is Jim and Pam they should be together and Pam they

1102
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,720
They belong together.

1103
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,720
They belong together.

1104
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:36,720
It's true love.

1105
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,240
He's the actual comedic relief, not Michael.

1106
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,920
I'm sure a lot of people have the same...

1107
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,880
Michael's just kind of an idiot.

1108
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:43,880
I don't know.

1109
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,720
I don't know anyone else seeing this.

1110
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,560
Michael Scott is just kind of stupid.

1111
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:49,640
He's just kind of an idiot.

1112
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:53,160
I don't want to say it, but if I worked at that office, I would quit.

1113
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:57,400
I'd put in my two weeks within two weeks.

1114
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,360
I would not stay working there.

1115
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,360
Dwight Schrute, let me tell you.

1116
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,440
It's a non-professional environment.

1117
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:02,800
The warehouse, that seems kind of fun.

1118
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:06,680
the player outside the play basketball down their church versus kids

1119
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,420

00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,700
you know what else i've had a bit i just gotta say this quite true

1121
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,020
great man

1122
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:15,360

1123
00:56:15,360 --> 00:56:19,080
is a good man to a tree to get that basically what what fucking what system

1124
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:21,400
show called truth awesome

1125
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,620
on the show called uh... in for a little wars yeah i feel like a lot of people

1126
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:31,120

1127
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:34,520
They're going on adventures folks, people love it.

1128
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,720
He's going over the garden wall.

1129
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,160
He's going over.

1130
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:41,920
And you know Mordecai, Mordecai and Rigby.

1131
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,720
Mordecai can't, he can't seem to find true love.

1132
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,320
Rigby, he's a feminine.

1133
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,720
This Rigby character, he's a bad, he's a poor role model.

1134
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:51,000
He's a feminine.

1135
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,520
He's a weak little boy.

1136
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:54,840

to change the name of the TARDIS they say you can't call the TARDIS anymore

1147
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:44,220
you can't call it the TARDIS I don't know why dude did you hit him on Rogan

1149
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:52,220
he's like a basketball player who takes too many threes he'll like be saying

1150
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,700
some stuff and Rogan will be like oh yeah cool yeah and it'll be like fucking like

1151
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:03,180
the frog thing or anything like that or like Sandy Hook was done by Godzilla and

1156
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,160
charge yeah yeah and then he just well that's that's yeah. I feel like that's

1157
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:26,940
the initial experience every video you see of him is when he's charged up and

1158
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,580
he's on but then the thing is most of his show. I would say like 90% of his

1159
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:33,900
show is him getting ready to charge up to that point. There's probably a

1160
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,620
short four minutes. He's like I got yeah, I got to take a sip of water. Yeah,

1161
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:41,900
he'll blow it, blow out a candle. You know what you know it's one of his his

1162
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,700
best. I don't know if you guys have seen these. You just look it up his his

00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:48,260

1164
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:53,140

00:58:53,140 --> 00:58:55,140
I'm Bill Gates!

1166
00:58:55,140 --> 00:58:57,140
Is that a good impression? No.

1168
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:01,140
Yeah, it's spot on, exactly.

1169
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:06,460
Folks, if you open up command prompt, you open up command prompt, you type in a couple things, and you can watch the

1170
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:12,460
entirety of Star Wars in command prompt. They're saying don't delete system 32. You got to do it.

1171
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:17,460
Why can't you delete system 32? It'll speed up your computer. Watch Alex Jones impersonate

1172
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:21,820
Bernie Sanders and Bill Gates. You can download more RAM. They don't want you to
