1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
you're listening to Israel's number one podcast

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:12,800
you're a crap monster

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,600
and may the fourth be with you

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,860
may the fourth

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,960
that's a powerful duster dude

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,240
may the fourth

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,560
microphone

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,560
That thing is- It's gonna be great for anyone who listens for the first time.

9
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:34,160
That thing is- That- That's just- Yeah, it's just the first time people are gonna be annoyed by that.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,560
Nobody else would be- Yeah, everybody else is used to you being a fucking dumbass.

11
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,860
Uhhh- Dumbass.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,060
Urr- Urr- Urr- Urr- Urr- Dumbass.

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,560
Hi, my name is- What?

14
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:51,060
Oh my god, dude. Real dumbass. Real ass dumbass.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,560
Yup.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,260
Uh, how you feeling, Pat? How's your- How's your leg?

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,500
My leg, uh, not great.

18
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,500
SpongeBob reference.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
Yeah, can you do the SpongeBob voice?

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,500
My leg!

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,580
Are you looking at... did you get that high on the computer duster?

22
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:12,100
No, Joe texted me and said, "Can the microwave bandit please clean it out?"

23
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,380
Are you the microwave bandit, dude?

24
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,040
I don't know if that's me.

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,020
Two months in and you already have a nickname at the apartment?

26
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,700
I was gonna say it's gotta be you, but I think about the people you're living with, I don't

27
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,700
think.

28
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,700
Right.

29
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,700
I think that's a 25-25-25-25 situation.

30
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Yeah, those are the microwave brothers.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:38,700
Well, I think it's 30- I think it's 33 each right now because Joe is claiming there's a microwave bandit.

32
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,700
Okay, but wouldn't that be the best move?

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,700
Whoever fucking smelt it dealt it, dude. Easiest trick in the book.

34
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,700
Let's call him right- let's call him right now.

35
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
That's what OJ did. Remember that?

36
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:49,700
What?

37
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,700
He killed his wife and then he's like, "Somebody killed my wife."

38
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,900
He killed his wife and he said "Whoever smelt it, dealt it."

39
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:56,900
Yeah.

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,900
Yeah, yeah.

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,900
Whoever, whoever.

42
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,900
The cop found her.

43
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:06,300
The cop just found her body and the waiter's body fucking beheaded.

44
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:09,300
And they were like, "Oh, dude, this is not looking good for you, OJ."

45
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
He's like, "Ah ha ha.

46
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Whoever smelt it, dealt it."

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,300
And they're like, "Ah."

48
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
And that's why he's free.

49
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
That's actually why he's free.

50
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,300
Yeah.

51
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,300
Robert Kardashian

52
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:30,180
Defenses they tried the glove didn't work. Yeah. Yeah, I guess whoever smelt it dealt it in the

53
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,880
Christ yeah, you hear the jury go

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:45,580
Anyway has that defense ever worked in a court of law if somebody listens to this in their lawyer and they know of a case

55
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:50,220
Not just a lawyer a lawyer slash historian. Yeah the lawyer person

56
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,540
A lawyer historian, can you tell us if the whoever smelt it dealt it defense worked?

57
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,900
You know I could probably give you an answer on that right now.

58
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,020
I think probably not.

59
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
I think no.

60
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,260
Okay, I didn't realize you were a lawyer historian.

61
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,260
I don't think so.

62
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,580
This is, to use a law term, this is conjecture.

63
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,700
Here's the thing, whoever did the rhyme did the crime.

64
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:20,700
(laughter)

65
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:25,700
It's just kind of, when you think about it, kind of a, kind of a, it's kind of paradoxical.

66
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:29,700
Your Honor, whoever is the judge did the stuff.

67
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,700
(laughter)

68
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,700
Take him away.

69
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,700
(laughter)

70
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,700
Whoever did the kill fits the bill.

71
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,700
(laughter)

72
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,700
Oh, okay.

73
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,700
Introducing a new one.

74
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,700
My defense rests.

75
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,700
Your honor, your honor, whoever is in the jury did something scurry.

76
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,700
(laughter)

77
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,700
(laughter)

78
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,700
(laughter)

79
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
(whispering)

80
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,700
(laughter)

81
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,700
(laughter)

82
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,700
(laughter)

83
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,700
Oh, who else is in that damn courtroom?

84
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:21,420
is in that damn courtroom whoever surely ain't it this guy did not act fly

85
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:34,140
whoever shall pay this bailiff you're up you're gonna have to pay for this book

86
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:44,140
should have picked a different job. If your name is Michael... Michael Guilty, you are

87
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:56,180
guilty. Your Honor, if you... Your Honor, I believe the lawyer gets to go sit in the

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:05:16,100
foyer now that you've seen all the pieces can we take a recess paid so much they

89
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,340
should have to speak and run absolutely dude what about like a lawyer cipher you

90
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:27,680
know it's just it's just a battle rap between the defense and the and the

91
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:37,320
offense yeah it's a good idea oh your honor it seems the witness is the one

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,160
who did this see that one that one's too good that one actually might work yeah I

93
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,600
think all these might work I think whoever smelted Delta is gonna be like

94
00:05:45,600 --> 00:06:00,040
like we're gonna see like like Supreme Court smelted be delted mr. Jonathan

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:09,280
Jonathan dealt it please approach the bench the case of the case Hugh smelted

96
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:24,780
Jonathan dealt it. Hugh smelt it. Hugh ever. Hugh smelt it. Okay. Dude, that just spent

97
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:29,160
about an entire Red Thunder's worth of energy right there. Yeah. We're about seven minutes

98
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,840
in. Oh man. Yeah, so that's unlucky. How's your leg? You've hurt yourself so badly. Yeah.

99
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:40,240
I did a skateboard trick that I have not landed since I was 17.

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,880
I already talked about this on my appearance on Seeking Derangements yesterday.

101
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
Oh, okay.

102
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,440
Yeah, we can't talk about it.

103
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Yeah.

104
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,440
Oh, sorry.

105
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,680
Do you get paid to do that show or do you get paid to do this fucking show?

106
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,680
No, I don't.

107
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
All right, so I fucking...

108
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,680
Spit it out.

109
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
I was doing a back boneless.

110
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,400
It's when you go up the quarter pipe.

111
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,840
I'll say you're back boneless.

112
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,480
Kick the board into your hand and then jump back on it.

113
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,800
Doesn't even respond to afraid.

114
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
No, I'm not.

115
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
I'll put a bone in your back.

116
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,840
not even gonna fucking humor that. I'll put a bone in your back my boner. I was trying

117
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,840
that. I'm gonna go all the way up your spine. I landed on the board. It'll unlock all your

118
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:23,760
vertebrae like oh man. Yeah you're gonna itch and it hurts so bad with my boner when I put

119
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,200
it in your back. Okay continue. I landed on the board. I'm gonna give you meningitis when

120
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:35,200
I put my man inside you. That's how far up your spine I'm gonna go dude. I got both feet

121
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:41,120
all the way to your brain stem. My leg slipped out, ramp was kind of, quarter pipe was kind

122
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,120
of dirty. Kind of got a lot of like, you know, dirt. A quarter of a dirty pipe. A dirty quarter

123
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:54,240
pipe. Alright, that one was good. But yeah, got dirt on it and I slipped out, uh, fucking.

124
00:07:54,240 --> 00:08:01,240
I won't slip out. I won't slip out.

125
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:05,240
I fell onto my leg. It went at like a...

126
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,240
I'll fall onto your leg.

127
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
Don't, it hurts.

128
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,240
Okay, never mind. That's retracted.

129
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Yeah, it went down and then I...

130
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,240
But I won't retract it.

131
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
I heard two pops. I heard two very distinct pops in my leg.

132
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Yeah, I hear two cops that are with me fucking spit roasting you.

133
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
What?

134
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,560
Bring a couple cops over.

135
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Why?

136
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Fuck you.

137
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,560
Only guys I know.

138
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,560
All cops.

139
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,640
Yeah, I heard two pops and then I called Caleb.

140
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:38,360
You didn't hear two bach because I'm moving the plate.

141
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,000
I heard two pops and my leg sat down for a little bit and then I walked away from the

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,680
skate park because I didn't want anyone to see me calling my friend to be like, "Hey,

143
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,200
can you come get me?

144
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,920
I got hurt."

145
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:59,880
The first thing I did when I like fell is like I looked at my leg saw that it was like on

146
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:06,600
the ground like slanted and I looked up and just went I'm so old!

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,680
That's a good kind of keeping your composure thing.

148
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,680
Yeah.

149
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,400
Is that a big thing at the skate park is if you die you have to pretend that you're fine?

150
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Yeah.

151
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
Ah.

152
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
So I got up.

153
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,760
The more you explain it the better it sounds.

154
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:24,280
So I got up, I walked a little bit away from the skate park, sat down, called Cale, or no,

155
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,960
I walked to this like, I walked to this like skate spot, so I was sitting by myself at this

156
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:34,160
like spot that's been in videos, and I was like, okay, no one's gonna see me here, and

157
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,160
then immediately a dude walks by on a skateboard, or dude like holding a skateboard, I'm like,

158
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,520
oh, now this guy's gonna think I hurt myself skating this big spot by myself like a fucking

159
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:51,720
dumbass, I look even more stupid than fucking up at a skate park. So I left, I walked more

160
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:55,840
down the, I walked farther down the street than called Caleb and was like, "Hey, come

161
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,600
pick me up." And Caleb's like, "I'm getting a tattoo right now."

162
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,560
Yeah, I was getting, I was in the middle of getting tattooed. And I, and it hurt so bad.

163
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,640
So I'm like the ditch of my arm inside, it was hurting so bad.

164
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,560
Oh yeah, you were in pain, oh.

165
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:18,400
No, I almost was like, "Hey man, my friend hurt himself, can I leave?"

166
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,560
I was so close to just saying that because it hurt me so bad.

167
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
Well, if you did, I wouldn't have had to spend like $40 on Uber rides.

168
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,680
Yeah, I would have just had to spend $40 to get back home. You would have been on the sidewalk

169
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,080
for like two hours. I was in Greenpoint. That's true. Okay.

170
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,320
I didn't know that. I had to go get my car and shit.

171
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:44,000
Yeah, so I called an Uber and then went to like a urgent care and as I walked into the urgent care,

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,040
like I got out, I'm like drenched in fucking sweat and I just walk in, there's a lady putting like a

173
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,320
sign up, like no mask, no entry and then like I go, I open the door, she's like, "Hi, how can I

174
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:02,720
help you today?" and I just went, "Knee!" Did you think knee was like heart attack where if you say

175
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,700
it they have to take you back immediately well she she immediately understood

176
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,280
because I was limping true I guess that's that you should have just said a heart

177
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:16,440
attack that's like yeah you should like like walking in with like you have like

178
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,600
a nail in your face just like a heart attack please the thing is there's only

179
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,160
so many opportunities that you get to like walk into like a doctor or a

180
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,200
hospital or something and just say one word like in pain like that like you

181
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:33,360
can't go in there and be like like ear infection like you really have to just

182
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,600
take those opportunities whenever you can yes I just sat down and took like she

183
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:44,680
was like okay can I get like your ID and your insurance card and I just went dude

184
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:50,080
I've been making some insane noises now I'm like it dude I woke up this morning

185
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:56,520
I was just like trying to I have this like like this thing yeah the poof yeah

186
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,760
Yeah, no, it's the Falcon Heen balloon.

187
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:01,840
Yeah, it looks like the Falcon Heen balloon.

188
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:08,200
Speaking of this thing, I watched the Anthony Weiner documentary, and in the first, he has

189
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,160
this same exact thing in his child's bedroom.

190
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,560
That makes sense.

191
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,680
So this is my pillow from Anthony Weiner.

192
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,920
Thank you, Anthony, for helping me in this trying time.

193
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,920
You found that pillow online because you googled "Wiener's child"

194
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
No!

195
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,920
Come on, why couldn't you have just given me "Wiener pillow"?

196
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Child wiener.

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,920
I was looking up "child wiener" and you hit this.

198
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,920
Comfortable child wiener.

199
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
And you hit "shopping" and that was the...

200
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
Documentary video.

201
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,920
And then you hit "shopping" and that was the first result.

202
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
That was nuts.

203
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
And that's how you got it.

204
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,480
morning it's not like I I was trying to like get my leg like at the pillow I

205
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,780
guess I kicked it off the bed in my sleep I didn't know so I was trying to like

206
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:04,640
get up so I could get the pillow and keep it elevated yeah and I like moved

207
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,580
my leg over to the bed and I moved it in the same direction I fell on it so like

208
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:15,240
it obviously just fucking hurt and I just like it sounded like I inhaled a

209
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:23,320
Wilhelm scream it was like yeah like involuntarily just like yelping at

210
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,880
certain point like I'll step on it weird and just go like I this morning I I made

211
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,240
a funny noise cuz it's like got your a in my scene okay all right are you done

212
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,600

213
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,940
Okay, is that it? Is it over? Can we stop now? Can I finish my story?

214
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,880
I made a funny noise

215
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,840
out of your ass

216
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Never mind. I went

217
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,280
Okay. Yeah, why did you do that?

218
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,080
Cuz I woke up and I hit my arm right on the tattoo on the corner of my couch cuz I just sleep on the couch

219
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,080
I wake

220
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,080
I was like what the fuck?

221
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,920
Otherwise I will goo all over everything because it seeps goo.

222
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,440
It's so cool how it seeps goo.

223
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,880
I've never gotten a tattoo.

224
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,800
I love the goo.

225
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,440
I lie myself out over every surface in my house just to get the goo everywhere.

226
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,840
You give your house a tattoo.

227
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,840
Exactly.

228
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,920
Yeah, get a perfect imprint.

229
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:33,680
I almost got one of those things, it's like a fucked up wrap that you put on your shit

230
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,560
and then you just don't touch it but then you have to peel it off and people say it's

231
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:42,880
like peeling your skin off. That sounds awful. Peeling your skin off is the best thing in the world.

232
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,240
Yeah. Dude, you ever do the old glue thing? Like the glue on the hand? Yeah, of course.

233
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:53,400
And you peel it off? You ever try to get it in one fell swoop? Like try to get like a whole hand imprint thing?

234
00:14:53,400 --> 00:15:02,720
Of glue? I have weird friends. My friends are criminals. You never did the glue thing? I'm done with you two right now.

235
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,720
No, you're not you and first you said something about my ass first of all that's off-limits to you, bud

236
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,920
your ass is on limits for me and

237
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,760
Cam's ass is to be decided

238
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,640
Whether what limit I have on his ass

239
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:25,200
Find out find out pretty soon. Yeah, I'm gonna take you to your limit. I'll say I'm gonna push your ass

240
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm on guys. I'm gonna push it to the limit to Caleb

241
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,640
I'm gonna go Corbin blue on that ass push that shit to the limit right now Corbin blue Corbin blue

242
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:38,260
Push it to the limit. That's what I'm gonna do with your ass

243
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:41,140
See you knew that song. Are you fucking kidding me?

244
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:47,220
I know I was just commenting on how I have not heard of heard about Corbin blue. Yeah in a bit. I

245
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,500
Don't remember asking you what is he up to?

246
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:58,220
What's Corbin blue if I had to guess executed by military tribunal? Yeah, he saw he saw Hillary Clinton being hanged

247
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:03,380
in Guantanamo. I feel like the move for all those people is they either do

248
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:07,820
TikTok now or they own a restaurant. Yeah. Or they're real estate agents.

249
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:12,660
Who goes real estate? Pro skaters go real estate.

250
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:16,700
That's not a pro skater. Corbin Bleu is a pro jumper dude. He's a fucking jump rope master.

251
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:21,560
Yeah but I feel like Disney Channel star and depending on the

252
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,060
Disney Channel star and pro skater. No I think you just like talking about

253
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:45,860
about

254
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:50,580
yeah i'm with you there there dude the the reason that the the nickelodeon gack is so

255
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:55,300
green and vibrant is because it contains the souls of all the children who who are acting

256
00:16:55,300 --> 00:17:00,460
on on those sets dude they suck a bunch of skulls out yeah if you act really close facial

257
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:06,340
implants like this those that would be that'd be just dis plants you can just make the face

258
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:10,020
too you don't need the implant if you can show what kind of face you know what i mean

259
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:15,380
with your big ass head they'd have to use like robert zadar implants you would end up looking

260
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:23,140
like that. You have a big ass fucking freak chin. I do. Dude if my chin was like huge like

261
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:30,660
huge like a like a big. You'd get a Thanos chin. Yeah. What would you do with it? I would

262
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,700
fucking I'd be cutting glass. I would be I would be I would be just hitting people on

263
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:43,860
the street with it. I'd eat pussy with it put the chin in her butt. Yeah. Have you heard

264
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:49,220
about this? I got my chin all the way up your ass!

265
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,740
It's kind of a cool move right? Maybe that's why Jay Leno skyrocketed to the top of

266
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,740
entertainment. That's why he wears so much denim. Yeah all the women in charge of entertainment in the 70s

267
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:04,480
he would just he would eat them out put his, what's it called? His chin in their

268
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:09,100
ass. Forget the word for chin. His chin-do. Yeah and then it felt like she was fucking getting

269
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,900
eaten out on a bicycle which has got to be the dream for anyone. I mean if you

270
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,660
when you got a chin like that you got to wear you got to wear that much denim

271
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,780
yeah when Jay Leno walked into the office wearing bike pedals on

272
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:31,380
his hips. They knew what the interns were getting into dude. That's in the oral

273
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:42,380
history of SNL book. Dude I was getting so I went got tattoos for the first time

274
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:48,500
a long time and I forgot that whenever I enter a tattoo shop it's like I get

275
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:53,660
super nervous. I feel like a little kid and so I especially because the

276
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,140
guy's tattooing me is this like fucking cool ass Italian guy like from Italy

277
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:03,280
Italians from Rome and he's like so Italian that he can let he has

278
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,180
like box braids and it looks like normal to me like I was like yeah okay that's

279
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:14,060
fine yeah and he's a white guy with box braids but he's not white he's like he

280
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:18,940
looks like he's from he looks like he was like stuck in a statue and then they

281
00:19:18,940 --> 00:19:21,660
like cracked it like an egg and he popped out and he's like my name is

282
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:28,140
Simone okay it's got that kind of thing and he was tattooing me and I started

283
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:32,220
drip my hand was sweating so much that I dripped a bunch of sweat all over his

284
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,380
dick because he was like holding my arm and my hand was it was like I just like

285
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,820
juiced a lemon with my hand it was just like dripping onto him and I was like

286
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:45,380
hey man sorry and he's just like in no problem that's the thing it's always

287
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:51,540
that to the the the tattooers are always just like the like the the coolest

288
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,420
people in the world like what you would as a teenager you would imagine yeah

289
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,420
that's the coolest guy ever and then you walk in and like they put like they put

290
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,460
like a pain machine into you and then you just have to stand there like just

291
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:09,920
staring straight ahead like yeah just pretending it doesn't like hurt so I do

292
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:15,260
this is sick dude thank yeah dude yeah this is a thousand dollars at the end

293
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:19,220
yeah and I at one point you got a cigarette break like every ten minutes

294
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,820
he was going like rolling his own cigarettes outside and he came back in

295
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:26,780
and it was not you know he tattoos you on like a hospital bed and on that

296
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,500
lining they put on there I saw there was a giant sweat stain in the shape of my

297
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,800
ass. I just like sweat through my underwear and my cargo pants onto this

298
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,220
table and then I just was like so I was just hoping so badly he wouldn't notice it

299
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,180
that as he walked back I was like hey Simone sorry about this I must have

300
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:56,960
spilled my water. It's clearly in the shape of my ass cheeks. That's the thing it's the coolest people seeing you with the most

301
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:02,600
vulnerable it's like for me I can sit well for it like I'm not I won't like

302
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,540
like freak out or anything but the cost of sitting well so I'll just be

303
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,920
completely empty-minded just like staring straight it's vacuous and

304
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,720
they'll be like oh man like that's a cool shirt I saw that band once I was

305
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:22,000
like it was like having like your your surgeon be like Anton Chigurh where you

306
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,080
you're like I don't want to fuck this up so badly. Yeah, yeah, it's like if you say

307
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:32,160
you say the wrong thing they're gonna fuck up your tattoo on purpose. Just do a Z.

308
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:41,600
Just scribble all over it. Yeah, you wanted a swastika right? Oh no. No. But yeah that was that hurt so bad.

309
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:46,320
So yeah I've always been. Cam, when did you get hurt this week? When did I get hurt this week?

week. I spilled water on my bed covers earlier today. That hurt my mind pretty bad.

311
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:58,440

00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,500
I don't respond and you guys fucking know.

322
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:26,160
- No, I know that you're checking your phone every time

323
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,540
and you're just like lying down

324
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,560
and you don't wanna stand up

325
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:32,120
because you're imagining something really beautiful to you.

326
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,600
- Aw, that's very sweet.

327
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,520
- You're imagining like some female

328
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,240
Crash Bandicoot character or something

329
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,960
so you can't move.

330
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:43,640
Like I'm gonna lose this fifth boner,

331
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,960
this fifth of a boner that I have if I if I'm right the first time cuz I get five

332
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,800
in a row no problem it's like a fucking slot machine dude five boners and I'm in

333
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:58,560
five in a row five years in a row good job okay I actually get I actually get

334
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,000
extremely strong boners and once every ten times that I look at my penis I'm

335
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,920
like that's not that bad I think I've hit my penis too many times for me to

336
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:14,920
like like you're playing knockout you're just fucking again you know you fall down

337
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:21,140
on it and you know you start you're falling down on your penis my penis is

338
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:24,920
like almost completely gone during the day this is another another fucking

339
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:28,440
skateboarding thing but I'll get hit in the penis with my skateboard sometimes

340
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,520
the penis not the balls yeah if I get hit in the penis and not the balls it

341
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,480
doesn't hurt mmm my balls hang like bats and my

342
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,480
Does that happen to you guys?

343
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,480
You'll get hit in the penis or balls very often so I don't really know.

344
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Like I've been hit in the balls before.

345
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,480
I would imagine that getting hit in the dick hurts less than the balls.

346
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,480
Maybe I've just never been hit in the balls hard enough for it to hurt.

347
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
That's a problem we can solve.

348
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Well now I'm too scared to try it.

349
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Yeah, Caleb, have you always had that slingshot duct taped to your hand?

350
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
Yes, and I'm coming for you.

351
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:12,480
for you it's gonna be like a follow up. Walking, walking, going over to Patrick's house with like a dress shoe but on the toe of the shoe there's like a boxing glove pointing up

352
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:24,480
standing behind him on the train and just sticking your foot out between his feet. Yeah. Pressing a little button. Maybe, what if I just don't have, what if I don't have nerves in my penis?

353
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:30,480
What if you don't have nuts in your penis? Dude that's probably true. You just got an empty bag. You probably have no feeling at all in there and you haven't realized till now.

354
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:38,040
yeah you have an empty bag admit it I do it's like a scally cap it is yeah I know

355
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:44,040
trust me I know well if it's it why the fuck can't I just get like a hole in it

356
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:48,280
like a kangaroo and keep some shit in there you know keep shit's gonna be

357
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:52,320

to get like a transparent sack like one of those clear back yes yeah or likes

361
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:16,240
like a zipper on it but it would look the transparent that it should still have

362
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,840
veins like a fish you know sometimes see inside of a fish yeah I want to replace

363
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:25,120
I would have placed my penis skin with chameleon skin that'd be really cool

364
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,280
have it blend in yeah I could change it to the color of my pants yeah that's not a

365
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:38,160
bad idea dudes yeah if it falls out no one can tell exactly they go what's that

366

strange extra pocket on your pants oh nothing oh nothing I just keep two of my

367

most favorite things in there have you seen that uh that uh speaking of

368
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:56,920
blending penises. There's the transition. Have you seen that C-3PO tops card from the

369
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:03,920
70s that looks like he has a giant boner? No. It's just like a porn in a Disney movie

370
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:10,920
thing. May the force be with you. I can talk about it today. I guess if there was one day

371
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:16,520
where you could do this. No, you have to get to the list. You wasted it. You spent so long

C-3PO Goldenrod.

373
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
C-3PO Goldenrod.

374
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,080
And your empty balls.

You're gonna be holding my rod.

377
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,080
No more Star Wars talk.

That's it.

379
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,080
C-3PO Goldenrod.

380
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,080
C-3PO Goldenrod.

00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,080
I will look this up actually.

00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,960
You can see his thing.

383
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,240
It looks like he's got a giant boner.

384
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,680
I guess it was like a...

385
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,880
Oh man, that's just nasty.

386
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,880
Yeah.

387
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,880

I don't like that at all.

390
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,920
I guess like a piece fell off of him while they were taking the photo.

00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,920

The ones with the big dicks, they had no choice in that.

404
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:53,320
If you had a small dick and you're gay, you made a hard, hard choice.

You guys can tie anything together.

00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,800
You don't know anything about hot dogs.

422
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:25,800
What do you think the bun is?

423
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,380
That's the skin from the leg.

424
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,380
The skin is bread.

425
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:31,020
The skin goes over the bone.

426
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
The hot dog bun is bread.

427
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,020
Did you ever take biology?

428
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
No.

429
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,340
Why do you think they boil the hot dogs?

430
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
Makes them nice and soft.

431
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Exactly.

432
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,340
Boiled bones.

433
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,340
Everyone likes boiled bones.

434
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
That's...

435
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
Remember that from a full mac?

436
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,340
That's how you make a demi-glace.

437
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,340
Boiled bone.

438
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,340
You guys ever had boiled bones growing up?

439
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,620
No.

440
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,620
I did.

441
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,620
I never touched a boiled bone.

442
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,620
After you strain them in the colander, God.

443
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:58,620
Have you ever had the bone marrow?

444
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,620
Dude, pasta tastes so good after you strain it in the colander.

445
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,620
Oh my God, that's the best one.

446
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,620
It doesn't have all that nasty water crap on it

447
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,620
and you just get the pasta.

448
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Oh man.

449
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,620
That hits different.

450
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,620
When you strain the red sauce out of the pasta, it hits different.

451
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,620
Sheesh.

452
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,620

- In that show, I think the trade-off is

487
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:43,960
you get to hear a lot about Bret Michaels' type 1 diabetes.

488
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,080
- True, that is as intimate also

489
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:51,040
seeing someone have sex is learning about their diabetes. The first episode of that show or

490
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,520
the first or like the first three episodes within that range they have to practice phone sex with

491
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:02,560
him because he's going to be on tour a lot. Practice. So he's gonna so yeah he's gonna you

492
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:07,520
get a you get like a gold star or whatever for doing the best phone sex with him and they uh

493
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:13,920
he has like a doctor that's just a fat guy in a lab coat and he hooks something up to his penis to

494
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,920
Like, he hooks his penis up to a computer so he can test whether or not he's getting a boner from the phone sex.

495
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:24,920
Wow. He needs a scientist to tell if he's getting a boner?

496
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,920
Yeah.

497
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:29,920
Well, how strong of a boner he gets.

498
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,920
But they can't say all that nasty crap on TV, right? It's gotta be a lot of bleeps.

499
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,920
There's a lot of bleeps and there's a lot of... yeah.

500
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Maybe some innuendo?

501
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:39,920
Uh-huh.

502
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,920
I hate innuendo. I like the normal crap.

503
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,920
I like innuendo.

504
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,720
Yeah, give me that normal endo.

505
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,120
Give me that exoendo!

506
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,720
I don't need no innuendo.

507
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,920
Give me the exoendo.

508
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,720
Shit's weird.

509
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,420
Yeah, potatoes are pretty good though.

510
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,920
Me loves 'em!

511
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,220
They make you fat, but so does McDonald's,

512
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:58,420
and does anyone give a scruffy turd about that?

513
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,920
This sounds like Smeagol.

514
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,420
What?

515
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,420
Me loves 'em!

516
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:05,920
That sounded like Smeagol.

517
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,220
So I hereby declare this potato day,

518
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,920
and we shall feast on potatoes until we cannot anymore.

519
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,920
He loves potatoes.

520
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,920
Fuck, that sucked.

521
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,920
I like all the vegetables in the world.

522
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
I'm so sorry for you.

523
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,920
If I see any vegetable, I would want it.

524
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Unless it came from the floor or someone's mouth.

525
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,920
I'm a vegetable addict, you see.

526
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,920
That's why I like all of them in the world.

527
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I think vegetables are pretty tight.

528
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
They are tasty and contain 0% sugar.

529
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,920
Well, apart from sweet potatoes.

530
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
They are a starchy vegetable and you can also use them for beauty benefits.

531
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:36,920
Cut slices of potatoes and place them in your eyes.

532
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,920
Leave them there for 20 minutes

533
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,040
leave them there for 20 to 30 minutes and see the results place them in your eyes

534
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:48,720
put under the eyelid have you have you ever done like gotten potato like like a

535
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,560
juice from a potato in your eye it sucks no I knew a friend of mine growing up

536
00:33:53,560 --> 00:34:00,080
his dad had cancer and he started he was like to solve my cancer I will only eat

537
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:04,320
raw potatoes and they just died like a million times faster.

538
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,680
Oh that sucks.

539
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,640
I love potatoes they're so delicious and you can have them in so many ways.

540
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:19,280
Chips, hash brown, mashed, boiled with butter and garlic. Isn't that

541
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,160
mashed potatoes? No boiled and and and and pressed with butter and garlic.

542
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:27,280
Okay. Yeah you press them all until they're like a real creamy

543
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,900
press oh yeah yeah oh no wait yeah no you can have boy I've had boiled potatoes

544
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm realizing just now potatoes equals french fries and for you couch potatoes

545
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:45,360
potato chips oh finally my brothers and sisters are recognized in the light of

546
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:53,400
the top ten I don't fuck with potatoes dude what this is it I'm uh these are

547
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,220
These are not ketosis.

548
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm trying to keep my entire body in ketosis.

549
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,480
Even one single drop of anti-keto matter such as potatoes will throw me out of ketosis and

550
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,940
put me into a just a downward spiral.

551
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,520
So I can't even fucking touch with, I can't fuck with potatoes right now.

552
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,920
I'm off of those, yeah.

553
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:14,920
You know what's great?

554
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,320
It's because you look at one and you can't eat it because it reminds you of your own head,

555
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
right?

556
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,960
Well, that's a little bit a part of it, yeah.

557
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,920
is about eating things that look as far away from you as possible. Yeah. Yeah, so I

558
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,420
eat a lot of crayons a lot. No carbs in a crayon. Is that a, it was just a rumor,

559
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:36,600
right? That I eat crayons? That my uncle started that if you eat a crayon your, changes your poop

560
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:41,700
color? Of course it changes your poop color. What, are you stupid? You can't digest a crayon.

561
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,280
Yeah, but it would just come out in crayon chunks. It wouldn't change the

562
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,520
whole poop. Well you wouldn't, have you ever melted a crayon? Yeah. Made a crayon

563
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:57,020
candle yeah you've never done that I've done it you guys ever you guys ever

564
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:01,040
melt crayons together into like one big crayon like you take all the crayons you take the

565
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,520
paper and make crayons and you melt them together so you multicolored crayon yeah

566
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:09,120
you have hot shit in your stomach that'll melt a crayon no problem probably

567
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:15,200
five or six seconds the dye the dye wouldn't retain in your poop why have

568
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:19,100
you ever fucking do you think I can't believe you right now you're eating a

569
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:24,440
beat it'll mean if you eat red broken glass your shit will be red well that's

570
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,920
from the glass yeah exactly we need to make it we need to send you on a on a

571
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:32,560
you need to eat you're gonna make me eat a crayon yeah I'm gonna send you on an

572
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,000
idiot abroad style adventure where you have a crayon you have to eat glue you're

573
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,240
gonna eat paper and I it's mostly that that's like maybe two minutes of the

574
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,360
show the rest of the show is a deep dive on your shit. I'm gonna get a scientist

575
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,520
he's gonna test it. We're gonna get color experts. We're gonna hook it up to the

576
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,720
same machine from Rock of Love. Yeah and he's gonna let you know if you

577
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:59,960
pooped or not. Yeah well your poop is looking very sexually excited sir.

578
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:07,600
Number two is corn. Who doesn't love corn? I was about to vote for potatoes. I found some corn in my number two.

579
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,200
- Those are also super good.

580
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,160
And then I saw corn.

581
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,200
It's served so good on the cob and it's super healthy.

582
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,280
Corn is sweet and delicious

583
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,920
and it's the reason why I like vegetables.

584
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,800
I would probably have 10 cavities in my mouth

585
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,780
if it weren't for corn,

586
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,520
which I learned to love more than Sour Patch Kids.

587
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,160
- Here's what I'm gonna say.

588
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,960
It might be controversial.

589
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,920
Every food would be better on the cob.

590
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,000
- You know what?

591
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,200
No, that's not controversial at all.

592
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,760
I think a lot of people would agree with that.

593
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:33,600
- Really?

594
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,800
Dude, can you imagine gummy bears on the cob

595
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:41,240
fucking like hamburger on the cob. Dude it would be also be really great because I

596
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,640
mean everybody with braces would starve and die. Exactly yeah you eliminate the

597
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,160
worst kind of people. These weak people. People who listen to what an

598
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,240
orthodontist tells them. Yeah you are cowardly enough to take advice from a fake dentist.

599
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,840
You look at a guy who's a fucking, he couldn't even be a

600
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,040
dentist. Yeah half dentist half fucking mechanic that's what you are. You're

601
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,260
cucked by the guy trying to make your mouth a robot yeah meanwhile I'm a mad

602
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:11,260
scientist who's in there trying to put a fucking Apple watch in your mouth I'm

603
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,340
eating popcorn and it's me now and later fucking I'm eating fucking a dentist is

604
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,960
a is a doctor they couldn't fucking cut it in an orthodontist is another rung

605
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:25,120
lower than that it's pathetic yeah it's like it's like a gym teacher trainer

606
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:30,140
exactly it's it the assistant to a gym teacher yeah think about all the shit you

607
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:36,940
can't eat with braces. Tootsie Roll. Tootsie Rolls suck anyway. Well the fruit ones are

608
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:43,660
good. No, bad candy. You really like Tootsie Rolls? I don't like chocolate Tootsie Rolls

609
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,860
but I like the... You like Tootsie Rolls so. The lime Tootsie Rolls? That's like maybe

610
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:51,980
one of the worst candies of all time. Yeah I'm with you. The green Tootsie Rolls is pretty

611
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:56,580
good. Like literally like maybe bottom three. No no no. Chocolate Tootsie Rolls are bad

612
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:02,940
But like the the fruit flavored ones kind of good. You're pissing me off so much today. I'm about to lose it

613
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:06,940
I'm about to fucking lose it right now

614
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,020
shut up

615
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:13,580
With the tootsie rolls shut the fuck up, dude. Hey, let me see that - that's right

616
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,220
No, that was your first example - that was like I'll think about all the great foods. You can't

617
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,200
See what are you talking on the cob?

618
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,180
We're talking about corn on the cob first of all and then you like what you can't eat popcorn - popcorn is way better than

619
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:33,180
tootsie rolls? Chicken breasts on the cob? It'd be so good! I mean it has if you eat a wing,

620
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:38,220
a wing is on the cob. Dude, shwarma on the cob? That fucking writes itself. Shwarma straight

621
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:45,420
off the spit? Yeah! Just eating the fucking shwarma? Yeah, you're on the cob! Yeah. That's

622
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:50,760
on the cob, dude. Yeah, you know what? I'll take back what I, I'll backpedal, I'll take

623
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,260
back what I said about tootsie rolls. Once I figure out how to put drinks on the cob,

624
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,200
it's over it's over it's over for food I'm only gonna be having drinks yeah

625
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:03,740
sorry dude drinks are just better I like drinks more it's a lot less work

626
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,460
water on the cob mmm not what okay that's as weird as going to Tutsi Roll first

627
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:18,580
delicious beer on the cob what no okay so would like a like a like a popsicle is

628
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:23,300
that no well first of all it's not a no it's not a drink it's solid I would if I

629
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:27,340
handed you a popsicle and I said this is juice you'd say no it's not a popsicle.

630
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:32,700
Okay if you said it was juice on the cob. No the water or the beer cob needs to

631
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,300
have some sort of gravity cob. Yeah it's liquid. That has that that's the

632
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:41,420
important part. It has its own orbit and the beer will orbit the cob. Okay so it and it is

633
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:47,860
still a corn cob also. Okay so it's a gravity cob. The gravity cob Caleb

634
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:52,480
invention not a big deal it happens. They come and go. And you hold and you hold a

635
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,640
beer with it. Wait, okay. It would be like a fair food. It'd be like a turkey leg. You

636
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:01,660
walk around with a beer cob. So, is turkey leg chicken on the cob? No, that's on the

637
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:08,580
bone! I have a new invention. I wanna... The cob conversation is frustrating me. I don't

638
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,900
care about that. I don't care how frustrated you are. I don't care. My new invention, I'm

639
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:17,160
moving forward with, I think, Coca-Cola Freestyle Machine still have a lot of potential. Cob

640
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:23,080
freestyle machine. Oh my god. There's a bunch of different foods. You know I can be like,

641
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:30,080
oh I want corn and I also want you know beef. Egg. Scrambled egg on the cob. Exactly. And

642
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,320
it has every, it's linked up to Wikipedia so anything in the food category is fair game.

643
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,200
It makes it or it orders it. If you pick something and you don't have it in stock, like if you're

644
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,360
a crazy person, you're like oh I want kangaroo on the cob. Like you're trying to act crazy.

645
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:46,000
So we'll automatically order it with an Amazon button.

646
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,200
- Cameron, there's an immediate flaw in your problem.

647
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,040
- Yeah, what is it?

648
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,860
- In your Cobb face now. - It's too good.

649
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,420
- No, no, if it's hooked up to Wikipedia,

650
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:56,960
you have to limit it to the food section.

651
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,020
- That's what I said.

652
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,660
I said anything that's under the food category.

653
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,720
- Yeah, I missed that completely.

654
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,720
- Man, if you were in an investors meeting,

655
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:06,060
your head would be chopped off by that woman

656
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,760
from Kill Bill Bill.

657
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,200
- Yeah, we'd throw you out of the damn window.

658
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,600
- Mr. Wonderful's wife would fucking

659
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,120
run her boat into you, dude.

660
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:16,520
I was just thinking of a situation where somebody gets like, I don't know.

661
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,520
Okay, new restaurant.

662
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,520
New restaurant.

663
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,520
Darth Vader on the cob.

664
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,520
New restaurant.

665
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,520
Set up like Subway.

666
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,520
Evil guy.

667
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:23,520
You can choose anything.

668
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,520
Hitler on a cob.

669
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,520
I know what you're saying.

670
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
You choose your type of cob.

671
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:27,520
Cob way.

672
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,520
Cob way.

673
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,520
Oh, Italian herbs and cob.

674
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,520
That might be a pretty good cob.

675
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,520
Different types of cobs you can pick too.

676
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,520
CMT.

677
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:37,400
Because at the end, at the end, you finish your CMT sandwich, right?

678
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:41,080
And then you forgot, oh, because here's a problem with bread.

679
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,120
You can't reuse the bread after you eat it.

680
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,220
Well that's one thing, but also you see the bread and it never surprises you.

681
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,840
You never get a flavored bread and you're like, "Oh shit, I just remembered that I got Italian

682
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:52,840
herbs and cheese."

683
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:58,000
If you get an Italian herbs and cheese cob, you've sucked all the salami and ham and fucking

684
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,960
lettuce and tomato off that thing.

685
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:03,240
You get to the bottom, you're like, "Dude, I got cob to suck.

686
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,920
I can suck this cob dry."

687
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,680
You bring the cob back, you get a discount when you reuse the cob.

688
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,680
You can't do that at Subway.

689
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:11,920
If you get a sub at Subway and you just eat all the meat and veggies out of the bread

690
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,520
and you bring the bread back, they're gonna kick you out.

691
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,680
That's a restaurant that'll have to happen after the COVID-19 pandemic.

692
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:22,520
If you keep coming up with shit, I'm gonna fucking put you on the Cobb, Pat.

693
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,400
Look, I'm trying, I'm just trying to make sure this shit works.

694
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,120
I have a new Subway spin-off, okay?

695
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
Even better.

696
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:30,600
This is different from the Cobb, okay?

697
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,600
No more Cobb.

698
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
No more Cobb.

699
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:33,600
I don't like this so far.

700
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:34,600
I'm already out.

701
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:35,920
Okay, but you're gonna like this.

702
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,920
Okay.

703
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,080
Even the traditional subway counter, it's reversed.

704
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,520
All the ingredients are facing you.

705
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,100
The cashier is shielded from it.

706
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,340
They're all in--

707
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,180
- It's the cashier.

708
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:50,020
(laughing)

709
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:50,980
- That's pretty good.

710
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:53,100
I'll give you that idea for free.

711
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:55,400
But no, you don't need bread.

712
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,820
You can eat 'em right there, right out of the trough.

713
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:58,660
Slop way.

714
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,500
- Okay, because the best--

715
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,320
- Slop way.

716
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,700
- Slop way, 'cause the best thing in the world

717
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,680
is eating a cold cut straight out of the fridge.

718
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,240
- Exactly.

719
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,620
- And even better than that, eating a cold Cobb cut,

720
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,120
crate, like trough.

721
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,680
- A crate of Cobb crud.

722
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,520
- Okay.

723
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,840
- What about a Subway style restaurant

724
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:17,180
where you are the person making the subs,

725
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,240
but then, and the people who work there on the other side.

726
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,080
- And you get paid for it, and they come and order stuff.

727
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,280
- No, so they're on the other side of a plate glass,

728
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,440
like a zoo, right?

729
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,480
But there's still like the exit part,

730
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,680
but you have to escape, and if you escape, it's free.

731
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,840
If they catch you, you pay for it.

732
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,200
- Okay, here's my idea, all right?

733
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,520
It's like that, it's like you described there,

734
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:35,800
in like a plate glass zoo.

735
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,240
You make whatever sandwich you want,

736
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,360
and they have to eat it.

737
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,840
- Oh my God, that's really good.

738
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:45,660
Yeah, ranch dressing and buffalo sauce on a wrap.

739
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,500
Actually, that sounds pretty good.

740
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,440
- You're gonna hate that.

741
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:48,720
You're gonna hate that so much.

742
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,560
With chicken? - That actually sounds

743
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,080
pretty good. - With chicken?

744
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,280
- Ugh.

745
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:55,040
I'm realizing there's only good ingredients at Subway, dude.

746
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:57,320
Olives and mustard, I'll fucking eat that any time.

747
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,160
- Well, here's the thing,

748
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,960
you can bring in your own ingredients, too.

749
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,820
- Ah, the poop cob.

750
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,280
Wait, are cobs still involved?

751
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,120
I may have lost it.

752
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:09,800
It's kind of like I think maybe we're looking too far. Okay. Okay. What if we look at the CC's pizza model?

753
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,800
What if we get like what if we like pizza?

754
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,840
What if we make a city?

755
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:18,980
And ever and we just have a bunch of different types of subways and we can use all our different subway type ideas and coke

756
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:22,560
Freestyle ideas and Cobb. Okay ideas. We can call Cobb City. I

757
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,680
Guess we could I

758
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,120
Don't know. I don't really have it in me to do something that big. I was singing like a single restaurant

759
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:35,560
maybe we franchise it out later. We were in like New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California.

760
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:38,040
Well, have you heard of Celebration Florida?

761
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:42,560
Every time I go to Florida it's a celebration, bud. I don't know about you.

762
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,720
Well, Celebration Florida is a town owned by Disney.

763
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:49,320
Hot weather, hot Miami women. What? Disney owns a town?

764
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:53,320
Yeah, Celebration. It's where a lot of the, it's like some of the employees live there.

765
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:57,320
First a land, then a world, and now a town?

766
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,120
Yeah.

767
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,320
They're really backwards.

768
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,520
- It's falling off, yeah.

769
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:01,860
- Come on, dude.

770
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,540
Yeah, Celebration Florida is a--

771
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,220
- Yeah, what's next, the House of Mouse?

772
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,640
- Yeah, it's a census designated--

773
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:10,820
- What's next, a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, dude?

774
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,980
This is, they're--

775
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,760
- They fell off.

776
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,340
Yeah, so it was like a, it's a master plan community

777
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:20,920
located near Disney World.

778
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,540
It's, what else is next?

779
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,900
- A Disney store?

780
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:29,020
- Civil suit against Celebration Florida.

781
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,260
Alright, so they're not doing very well, I'm guessing.

782
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,260
Yeah.

783
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,700
Has there ever been a murder there?

784
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,700
I really want to know.

785
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,700
Probably not yet.

786
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,700
Yeah.

787
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,700
Number three, broccoli.

788
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:43,460
Who, what kind of sicko put broccoli this high?

789
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,460
Broccoli's good.

790
00:46:44,460 --> 00:46:48,700
Broccoli, broccoli with like, like the, you know the, ah, shit.

791
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,780
I tried to think of more vegetables and all that came to my mind was different fruit.

792
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:55,540
I moved the chair too far and my leg got hurt.

793
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,540
You are a whining weiner.

794
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:59,160
- Dude, this is, here's a comment.

795
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,220
Here's a good comment.

796
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,140
"Mmm, little trees of goodness.

797
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:06,540
"A perfect fractal, as tasty as it is mathematical."

798
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:10,700
- It's Neil deGrasse Tyson commenting on this list.

799
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,900
- The, uh, here's a good one.

800
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:16,220
"I like the stems, but not that weird fluff.

801
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:19,460
"Like kid, I'm not eating a bush here."

802
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:22,900
- Fluff. - Who likes the stems?

803
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:23,740
- The broccoli fluff at the top.

804
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,540
- The comments are wilding out, dude.

805
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:28,340
put it with Japanese sauce and you are all set.

806
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,860
- Japanese sauce?

807
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,180
- If you don't like broccoli, I will kill you.

808
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,420
(laughing)

809
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,360
Broccoli fans weird AF.

810
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:41,460
- The broccoli fanship is wildin' today.

811
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,460
- Fanship?

812
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:45,380
- What's that, like those party plates

813
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:47,100
that have the broccoli and the cauliflower

814
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,380
with that ranch dip?

815
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:51,020
- Just a vegetable plate?

816
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,380
- Yeah, the vegetable plates that people get at Walmart.

817
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,220
- Yeah.

818
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,220
And you bring it to--

819
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,220
Those go crazy.

820
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,380
Such an underloved vegetable.

821
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:00,420
It tastes like heaven when raw.

822
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,420
Fuck.

823
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,420
Ow.

824
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:04,260
You coming, dude?

825
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,260
Stop hurting somebody.

826
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:07,180
I just saw some sperms jumping up onto the camera.

827
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:08,180
You didn't see any sperm.

828
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,180
Hey, you don't pet sperm!

829
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,180
Hey, I'm gonna go in his mouth where I love to go!

830
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,180
Get back in there.

831
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:12,180
Okay, I'm jumping in your mouth now!

832
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:18,760
I need to take my-- I need to take some ibuprofen.

833
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,100
You need to take a Prozac and you need to chill.

834
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:22,100
Yeah.

835
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,100
Number four, carrots.

836
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:34,280
No wait, wait, there's a comment on broccoli in all caps that says "KEEPS ME REGULAR"

837
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:42,140
Some kind of Mr. Hyde monster comes out when he doesn't eat broccoli.

838
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,140
Yeah.

839
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,140
Um, carrots.

840
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:47,540
This is probably my number one, dude.

841
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,540
Carrots are good.

842
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,780
Dude, I used to love eating carrots, and then I'd fuckin' develop this allergy.

843
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,220
And then you took an arrow to the damn knee.

844
00:48:55,220 --> 00:49:00,380
God, dude, carrots was like just eating carrots, like baby carrots on their own.

845
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:02,020
It was great.

846
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:05,100
Now I have to take a Zyrtec every time I fucking eat one.

847
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,020
But dude, is it worth it to you?

848
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,020
Yeah.

849
00:49:08,020 --> 00:49:09,020
Yeah.

850
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,020
Come on, it's worth it.

851
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:11,420
You'd be sleepy for about six hours.

852
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:14,300
Yeah, and I just pop a fucking Benadryl or a Zyrtec.

853
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:15,300
Yeah, it's nothing.

854
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:18,700
Snort a little Benadryl and then down some carrots.

855
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,700
Carrot dinner.

856
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,900
Norton Zyrtec.

857
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,020
You think that'll, you think that's good?

858
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:24,940
- It's probably not good,

859
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:26,960
but you also just inhaled computer duster

860
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,460
before we started recording.

861
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,500
- I didn't inhale it.

862
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,820
- You did. - You definitely did.

863
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,740
- You said, "I inhaled it a little bit."

864
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:35,180
And then you said, "I feel weird, that's really weird."

865
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,680
- And you started laughing a lot.

866
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,520
- Yeah.

867
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:40,980
- Well, great for my broken eyesight.

868
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,040
And making it into juice or making it in soup

869
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,820
is just amazing.

870
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,220
Have you ever seen like the people who just eat

871
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,820
like only carrots and their skin turns orange?

872
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:53,020
- Someone says, "What's up, Doc?"

873
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,860
- Hey, yo!

874
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:56,100
(laughing)

875
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:59,220
- Yeah, I had a, when I was vegan,

876
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:02,220
there was like a summer where I ate probably

877
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,660
like six or seven huge carrots a day.

878
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,820
- That's so good.

879
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,300
- They definitely changed the tone of my skin.

880
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,120
- Yeah.

881
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,420
- I was a lot more orange than I am now.

882
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:13,980
- It's true, I've been looking at you.

883
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,540
- Yeah, I'm not, I have almost no orange in me.

884
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,140
- You're blending in with your wall.

885
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:23,300
I know I'm I'm seriously white now. I'm seriously white.

886
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:30,460
Number five is lettuce. Lettuce on a sandwich they're a miracle. Lettuce is

887
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:36,300
great toss it in a salad. It's one of the things you put in the salad. Yeah well

888
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:44,420
you can you can have like a potato salad. Shut up! Shut up! I eat lettuce in salad cheeseburgers

889
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,100
and sandwiches and so good so healthy so crunchy and so delicious and then in like

890
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:56,900

891
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:02,620
peeping peepee what now you know this here's a comment from cartoon network fan

892
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:08,460
1990 and every word is capitalized individually without a doubt my favorite

893
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:16,540
greens that peas are a legume right oh so you so you let potatoes slide and

894
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,660
and corn slide but you're gonna pull out legume for peas.

895
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,660
Yeah.

896
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,020
You just wanted to show us you knew that word, dude.

897
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:23,580
I learned it recently.

898
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,540
You're just bragging at this point.

899
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:29,660
You're just fucking bragging.

900
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:30,660
I get it, man.

901
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
You spend all your time at the library.

902
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:33,340
Here's a really good comment.

903
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,340
Little circles.

904
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:40,980
Best green food ever.

905
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:41,980
I'm not a pea fan.

906
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,420
What about that green ketchup they used to have?

907
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,420
That's my number one green food.

908
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:46,420
Is that?

909
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:47,900
- The Shrek ketchup?

910
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,740
- Yeah, the Heinz.

911
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:50,300
- Oh my god, that shit was crazy.

912
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,260
- What was that called?

913
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:52,500
- The green and then the purple.

914
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,580
- We totally talked about it before.

915
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,020
I forgot the name of it.

916
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,860
- That shit was to die for.

917
00:51:57,860 --> 00:52:00,200
- Yeah, it's too bad they got rid of it.

918
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,260
- They should bring it back. - No idea why.

919
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:02,180
They should.

920
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:05,600
- Oh yeah, what could have been the problem with that food?

921
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,900
- They should have red ketchup.

922
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:10,340
- Number seven, onions.

923
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,220
Patrick, I want you to read this first comment here.

924
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,300
Onions?

925
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,520
Blimey, they're good!

926
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,560
(laughter)

927
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,720
- Caramelized, fried, roasted, onions are absolutely

928
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,680
the most fantastic vegetables on the planet.

929
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,540
Please vote onions.

930
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:28,380
Now I need to point out, the potatoes are disgusting

931
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:31,220
and should be stripped of their gold spot on this list.

932
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:34,280
- I just wanted you to say blimey, that's all.

933
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,120
- Yep.

934
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,440
- This guy says, "Ogres have layers."

935
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,440
- Yo, this person says, "Annoying ring."

936
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,160
(laughter)

937
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,480
Yo, anoint ring.

938
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,920
Yo, anoint ring.

939
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,920
Sheesh.

940
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:49,920
Sheesh.

941
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,640
Yo, my anoint ring bussing.

942
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:53,640
Sheesh.

943
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,880
I can't get enough of their zingy taste.

944
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:00,880
Just can't.

945
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:03,200
And number eight is cauliflower.

946
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,480
I want to read the two comments in a row here.

947
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:07,480
Here's one comment.

948
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:10,400
"It's a very natural veggie full of mib."

949
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,560
and then comment that's further up that says,

950
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,940
"Sorry, full of minerals and vitamins."

951
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:17,180
(laughing)

952
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:19,540
- Really good when cooked.

953
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:24,080
- A nice healthy puff, love the texture.

954
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:26,720
- It's awful.

955
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:27,560
- That's one comment.

956
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:28,400
- Cauliflower, I like cauliflower.

957
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,400
- Cauliflower's good, no that was a comment.

958
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:30,720
I love cauliflower, that's a good--

959
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:33,200
- Cauliflower, fried cauliflower.

960
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,140
- Yeah, that's the snacker's delight, dude.

961
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,880
That's a potato chip fan's vegetable.

962
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,900
Fried cauliflower on like a sandwich.

963
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,740
Pretty good.

964
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,580
- You know what's not very good?

965
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:44,300
Buffalo cauliflower.

966
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,940
- No, that shit sucks.

967
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:47,100
- Shit is terrible, dude.

968
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,740
- But cauliflower wings, fuck off.

969
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,060
- Get outta here.

970
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,340
- But what was that, that fucking sandwich they had

971
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,620
at that restaurant I worked at?

972
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:58,140
- The cauliflower restaurant?

973
00:53:58,140 --> 00:54:02,120
- It was called the Chiron, I think.

974
00:54:02,120 --> 00:54:03,100
- What?

975
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,900
- Yeah, it was called the Chiron sandwich.

976
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:06,080
- And it was bomb?

977
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,300
It had cauliflower on it?

978
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,060
It had like deep fried cauliflower and like the spicy sauce

979
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:14,340
and they put like fried rice noodles on it.

980
00:54:14,340 --> 00:54:15,580
- Ugh.

981
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:20,020
- And it had like a lime cilantro cabbage slaw.

982
00:54:20,020 --> 00:54:21,860
- It's getting worse every second, dude.

983
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,140
You gotta taste it. - It's like shit.

984
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:24,580
I don't. - Maybe you gotta taste it.

985
00:54:24,580 --> 00:54:25,420
I'll take you back there. - Nope.

986
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:26,300
- See if they have it.

987
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:27,500
- No, you know what I like?

988
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,300
A sandwich from the deli called the Gobbler.

989
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,980
- You like a sandwich called the Poop Sandwich?

990
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,060
- Nope, called the Gobbler.

991
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,900
- Oh, the Gobbler. - Is that the Thanksgiving

992
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,420
sandwich? - The Gobbler killed me, dude.

993
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,260
- I had the Gobbler twice when I was there.

994
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:36,100
- The Gobbler will take you down, dude.

995
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:40,460
It's a turkey sandwich.

996
00:54:40,460 --> 00:54:41,460
That's all it is.

997
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,460
Gobbler.

998
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:43,460
Turkey sandwich Russian dressing.

999
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:44,460
I had the Gobbler when I was there.

1000
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,940
Do you remember when we were both, when we both were very ill?

1001
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,940
Yeah.

1002
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:49,220
The Gobbler did that to me, dude.

1003
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,460
The Gobbler destroyed me.

1004
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:51,460
Yep.

1005
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:52,460
That shit will turn you into a noodle, dude.

1006
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,460
For real.

1007
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,380
If it's called the Gobbler, it's gotta be a Thanksgiving sandwich.

1008
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:57,380
I'm gonna put my foot down.

1009
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,380
A turkey?

1010
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,380
Turkey is a food.

1011
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,380
Turkey is a food.

1012
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,900
Slice turkey at the deli constantly.

1013
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,780
Yeah, but that's, no, it shouldn't be called the Gobbler.

1014
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,480
The Gobbler should be reserved.

1015
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,480
You are insane.

1016
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
You're a devil.

1017
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
Honestly, you're fucking crazy.

1018
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,080
People will back me up on this.

1019
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,220
You've lost it.

1020
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:13,900
You've lost your mind.

1021
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:17,880
You've lost your ever-loving, goddamn, white-ass mind.

1022
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,000
And stop looking at me like that.

1023
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,000
Stop.

1024
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,360
Number 9's peppers.

1025
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,360
Not interesting.

1026
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,360
Number 10's brussel sprouts.

1027
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,360
Yes!

1028
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:29,400
Brussel sprouts is pretty good, dude.

1029
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,400
Yes!

1030
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,400
Put some...

1031
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,640
I do not like the way that this person spelled vinegar down here.

1032
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,640
Not a fan of this one.

1033
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:41,440
I have to say.

1034
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:46,160
Uh, which one is that? Is that on Brussels sprouts?

1035
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:49,440
Yeah, they said I love cooked Brussels sprouts, especially with...

1036
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:50,640
and...

1037
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,640
They smelled it wrong.

1038
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:56,800
Yep.

1039
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,800
Yeah, that's uh, that's gonna...

1040
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,680
That's not the way you write that one.

1041
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,120
That's a fail blog right there.

1042
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:08,280
Yeah, that person got smart phoned.

1043
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,800
Yeah, enjoy your time on fail blog.

1044
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,360
Yeah.

1045
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:15,160
Yeah, Brussels sprouts, that is the best vegetable.

1046
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,880
Anything in the broccoli family.

1047
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,160
I feel like I'm missing something.

1048
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,600
Would you guys count mushrooms as a vegetable?

1049
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:23,280
No, mushrooms are a dirt.

1050
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,360
That's true, actually.

1051
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:27,520
Mushrooms are a type of dirt.

1052
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,800
They are kind of a type of dirt.

1053
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,120
Yeah, they're closer to an animal.

1054
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:39,000
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because they're weird. Yeah. Fair. All right. But mushroom is probably number

1055
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:44,200
one if they do count. Yeah. Oh shoot, like a deep fried mushroom? Mushrooms are so good.

1056
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:51,080
Yeah. That's my favorite vegetable. Yeah. Mushrooms are number one. Pulled pork mushroom?

1057
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:58,760
Dude, how dire is the state of the vegetable world right now that number 30 is seaweed?

1058
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:03,720
Dude, we couldn't come up with 30 better vegetables than seaweed?

1059
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,180
Seaweed?

1060
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,520
Well, I think seaweed's pretty good.

1061
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,520
Seaweed's good, but it's also just salt.

1062
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:09,560
It's just pure.

1063
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:10,060
It's just...

1064
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:14,520
It's like the equivalent of cotton candy, but for salt.

1065
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,040
It's just like nothing.

1066
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,440
It's just like eating worms.

1067
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,400
What?

1068
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:22,040
I feel like a damn dirt worm man.

1069
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,080
What are you talking about?

1070
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:23,640
Eating worms.

1071
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,880
Number 39 is eggplant.

1072
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,440
I'm gonna take a hard stance.

1073
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,720
Fuck eggplant.

1074
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,640
- What?

1075
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:31,480
- Fuck it, I hate it.

1076
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,720
- I don't really like eggplant either.

1077
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,600
- Y'all have something.

1078
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,880
- I bet you want the eggplant, right?

1079
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:37,720
- Yeah.

1080
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,160
- You guys have a disgusting part of your brain.

1081
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,440
- No, you have an Italian part of your brain

1082
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:43,520
that makes you like eggplant.

1083
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:46,080
- You have a nasty lobe in your brain

1084
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,480
that makes you like nasty crap

1085
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,200
and hate good stuff like eggplant.

1086
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,480
Eggplant should be number five.

1087
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:52,880
- You are fucking stupid.

1088
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:53,720
- No, you are stupid.

1089
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,000
- Artichoke's good as hell.

1090
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,600
- Oh, artichoke is, yeah dude, I love fucking mayonnaise.

1091
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,600
He saved our friendship.

1092
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,600
Yeah.

1093
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,600
I'm just scrolling through the

1094
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,600
vegetable list and whenever I see a vegetable

1095
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,600
I like my eyes are just lighting up and I can't process

1096
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:11,600
what else is going on. It's making me so

1097
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:13,600
hungry. Number 45

1098
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,600
Bitter Gourd.

1099
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,600
That can't be number 45.

1100
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,600
Best ever because I like the nutritional

1101
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:21,600
value of that vegetable.

1102
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,600
I don't like it. And then the next thing

1103
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,600
coming is especially I like the nutrition of

1104
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,600
that.

1105
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:30,460
- Number 50 is horse, or 49, horseradish.

1106
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:31,980
That's not a vegetable, is it?

1107
00:58:31,980 --> 00:58:34,560
- Yeah, we can't gatekeep this.

1108
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:35,400
- That's a sauce.

1109
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:37,460
- There's so many on these that are not vegetables.

1110
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:38,800
- Horseradish is a, what?

1111
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:39,900
That's a plant?

1112
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,240
- Bamboo shoots.

1113
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:45,340
Do I look like damn Jack Black, the Kung Fu Panda over here?

1114
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,620
I'm not gonna eat bamboo.

1115
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,540
- Tiger nuts, number 75.

1116
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,060
- Oh, edamame, dude.

1117
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:56,220
Alright, yeah, this shit'll turn you into a girl, dude.

1118
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:58,940
- Number 94. - One bean gives you tits.

1119
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:00,320
- Yeah, one bean you're--

1120
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,780
- One bean, you're a girl.

1121
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,820
- Last, the last thing on the list is a yam,

1122
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:07,220
which I think has been covered by sweet potato.

1123
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,660
- Yeah. - Mung.

1124
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,500
- What?

1125
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,340
- Mung beans? - Mung, you like mung, dude?

1126
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,740
- I've never seen mung.

1127
00:59:12,740 --> 00:59:13,780
- Really? - You've probably had

1128
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,300
mung beans, like mung bean sprouts.

1129
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:17,940
- I don't know what mung is.

1130
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:20,200
Mung is a goo-goo-ga-ga troll word.

1131
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,420
- What? - Wait, I just read

1132
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:24,220
the comments on ginger.

1133
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:26,500
I only like gingerbread man please.

1134
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,220
The nice spice of ginger.

1135
00:59:31,220 --> 00:59:33,980
There's one called Salsify.

1136
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:37,300
Sounds like something Bobby Flay would do.

1137
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:39,580
New start up app I'm working on.

1138
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:40,580
Sounds pretty good actually.

1139
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:42,580
Salsify, I'd go there.

1140
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,860
Cassava, sea kale, elephant garlic.

1141
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,220
Oh, what does that look like?

1142
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,540
I'm going to google that right now.

1143
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,180
Probably purple.

1144
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:59,180
garlic. Why would you guess purple? Because elephants are... What the fuck is purple?

1145
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:02,900
Damn. It's too easy for me dude. I know my colors. There's only one picture where it's

1146
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:09,860
purple. Oh okay. Oh so it's just big garlic. Makes sense. Big and purple like an elephant.

1147
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:14,820
Elephants are not purple. Yeah they are. They're not purple. What color are they then? Gray.

1148
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:21,420
A purplish gray. No. Yep. Gray is kind of just like purple, light purple. It's chill

1149
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:28,900
purple dude. Grey is like if purple was in like a black and white movie. Yeah exactly

1150
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:34,820
it's old school. Okay I can get behind that. Old school purple. Yeah the last ten vegetables

1151
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:38,740
I have never heard of. The last 100 vegetables. Well it's probably where they're in the last

1152
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:43,100
ten. Samphire, cat's ears, orachi. Freddy Godzilla just sat here and was like I gotta

1153
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:48,260
add green beetroot, anona, lulo, I gotta add these just in case someone wants to vote for

1154
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,260
Yeah, what the fuck is this one here?

1155
01:00:50,260 --> 01:00:52,260
What?

1156
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,260
Sea rocket sounds pretty cool actually

1157
01:00:54,260 --> 01:01:00,540
Let me see. I'm not like Sam fire is a zucchini. What's that sears? Am I right? Yeah?

1158
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:02,940
What is this sea rocket is a fucking flower?

1159
01:01:02,940 --> 01:01:08,100
Yo, wait, let me look this up. These people are sick. What is this one here fucking?

1160
01:01:08,100 --> 01:01:10,500
lemongrass

1161
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,580
No

1162
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:16,660
Come this is a flower that grows on the beach. Not just this horrible. Yeah, I know

1163
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:22,260

1166
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:38,780
complain about? No. I do. Your belly button. Bye. Why? Because I had it in a building.
