24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,680
these lattes from you you claim to bring your fourth latte what it's free made

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,120
Yeah, so you're making them. So you went from the fridge, you went from drinking

26
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,720
the Monster Energy to drinking those those Starbucks like chocolate latte

27
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,000
glass bottle things, right? Yeah, okay. No, not those ones. So I've

28
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,320
thought the whole time I thought this was a creamer and turns out it's just

29
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,760
pre-made latte and I've been putting it in coffee. Oh, so putting, okay, you'd be

30
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:32,920
Creaming your coffee with I was creaming my coffee with latte and I realized that it was

31
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,160
Latte why it was creamer I

32
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:43,560
Comes in like it comes in a bottle. Yeah, I thought it was like I thought it was like a caramel

33
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,960
Caramel on it. I didn't read

34
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,240
Based off shapes

35
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,960
Everything yeah, it is shaped. It is shaped like the creamer bottle and the latte is shaped like cream. Yeah

36
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,800
I

37
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,760
Am I I think my favorite customer interaction with a customer at work

38
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,520
So far the other day I came in and said hello

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,680

40
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,520
Guy a guy was paying at the register and he was like digging through his pockets for change and he had like a handful of change

41
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,200

00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,620
Imagine though going to just a bunch of stores and just showing people your golden penny

49
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,940
while you're paying for stuff.

50
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,940
I would never show off my golden penny.

51
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,940
That's a boss lifestyle.

52
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,940
Come here.

53
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,940
Come here.

54
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,940
Check this out.

55
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:02,940
Look what I have.

56
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,560
I would hide my golden penny from the world.

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,060
Is it one of those ones where it has like Jesus Christ or Donald Trump on it?

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,060
In case of pirates.

59
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,120
No, it looked like it was just like a penny covered in gold.

60
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Like it looked exactly like a penny but it was golden.

61
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
It was dripping in gold.

62
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,960
It looked like it was like it was like it was it had it had Abraham Lincoln on it.

63
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,400
Mm-hmm our golden president our goldenest president. Mm-hmm. That's right the golden age of presidents

64
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,860
Yeah, golden age of presidents probably

65
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:33,000
Not when he was president Reagan to Bush. Let me tell you yeah

66
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,360
Reagan to Bush it took a long time to get to their golden age

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,480
Yeah, Reagan to Bush. It sounds to me more like the Molden age of president

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:48,800
At one point they were the highest office in the land and you're disrespecting them in that way that's rude

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,920
They did the most coups.

70
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,920
Yeah, how many coups have you done, pussy? Actually wait, then we should probably do Nixon.

71
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,600
Nixon to Bush. You know what? We'll just say...

72
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
We'll just say George Washington...

73
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Everyone until Obama.

74
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
Yeah, George Washington until Obama.

75
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,600
We'll just say that.

76
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
That's the golden age of presidents.

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,600
And then it started again after Obama.

78
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
[Laughter]

79
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Yeah, he's sort of entering his second golden age now.

80
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,420
that that that

81
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,960
now that's not true

82
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,320
the exact opposite is true there was only one of those majorly over all of that

83
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,520
was his name was present all the no problem golden obama

84
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,640
from super smash bros

85
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,920
because i'm going to fight golden obama

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,920
and i don't know what i don't know about metal obama yeah

87
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,280
it's very actually

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,820
uh... i yesterday i i think i'm really like

89
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:51,580
I think my ability to talk to strangers is just like completely atrophied like I just

90
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,580
can't do it anymore.

91
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,940
I'm better at talking to strangers than I ever was.

92
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,940
I'm way worse at it.

93
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,940
Yesterday I...

94
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
I am.

95
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
I don't like going anywhere.

96
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,940
Shut up Cameron.

97
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Yesterday I went to a new corner store to get, I got an 8 pack of Guinness.

98
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,940
A new one that they just put it in?

99
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
A new corner store.

100
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,940
It's brand new.

101
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,940
New to you or new to the world?

102
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,940
New to the entire universe.

103
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Oh okay.

104
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:11,940
I went because I was down the street.

105
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,940
A new bodega just dropped.

106
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,660
Okay it's not the importance, it's new.

107
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,660
I got an eight pack of Guinness, okay?

108
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:19,500
- Whoa.

109
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,100
- I put it, what do you, any,

110
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,780

111
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,620
- Yeah.

112
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,780
- Yeah?

113
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,340
- How many Guinness?

114
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,180
- How many?

115
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,940
- An eight pack of what?

116
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,380
- Which by the way, insane number of bottles

117
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,700
to put in a pack.

118
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,180
I got an eight pack of Guinness,

119
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,020
I put it on the counter.

120
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,840
- Caleb trying to be Irish now.

121
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,340
- Eight like the number or eight like you ate it?

122
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,060
- I, yeah, an eight.

123
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:40,900
- It's thick enough that you could eat it.

124
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,140
- If someone had already eaten it, the pack of Guinness.

125
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,500
I put it on the counter, the guy was like,

126
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,180
he's like a younger, like, bodega guy,

127
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,540
which I'm not used to,

128
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,180
'cause it's usually like a 50 year old guy,

129
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,140
and so he's talking to me,

130
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,340
and he puts it on, he's like,

131
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,540
"Hey, how you doing, man?"

132
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:58,780
I'm like, "Uh, mm-hmm."

133
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,880
And he sees the beer and he goes,

134
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,720
"How old are you?"

135
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,500
And then just instinctively I go, "21."

136
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:07,980
And he was like, "You sure?"

137
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,900
And I was like, "Uh-huh."

138
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:10,540
And then he's like, "Can I see your ID?"

139
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,700
And I handed it to him and he was like,

140
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:26,500
it says you're 23 and I was like oh yeah you're I'm yeah I am 23 I forgot how old I was

141
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,740
I wouldn't have accepted it I would have told him his math was wrong

142
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,780
he should not have accepted it yeah mm-hmm he should have thrown that ID in the

143
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,540
trash it's from North Carolina it's 10 years old every time I go to the airport

144
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,340
the person and TSA gets mad at me because my ID yeah dude they get mad at me too

145
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,460
did at a middle school. It looks like shit dude. And they're like you gotta one

146
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,420
guy said he was like you get this in the dinosaur times at the TSA.

147
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,220
Yeah which first of all not a good joke. Yeah. Fucking back off. Dinosaur times

148
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:02,260
would be a great restaurant. What does dinosaur times mean? That's not a... That'd be a great restaurant in like the same vein as like medieval times.

149
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:07,340
Yeah. I like it's funny to say. What did you get this in dinosaur times to

150
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:12,660
mean like what did you get this like six years ago? I'm still on Dinosaur Times

151
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:17,340
the restaurant because now I've got a great idea. So it's basically

152
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:22,740
all the elements of Rainforest Cafe and Medieval Times put together. And that

153
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,380
equals dinosaurs to you? And well you so it's it looks like Rainforest Cafe but

154
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,780
there's a jousting ring in the middle like Medieval Times and... Like when the

155
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,580
dinosaurs were there. And they're on velociraptors instead of horses. I'm on

156
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:46,580
velociraptor time. VPT. I'm on, we should we should start sort of a kind of like a

157
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,180
more intelligent, more intelligent, we should do the brain forest cafe. Yeah.

158
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,500
Right? Where you come in and immediately they say instead of, instead of, hey how you doing.

159
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:01,700
It's the library. It's the library but it's but it's rain forest themed. Yeah. And so you

160
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,700
You have a toucan who's a...

161
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,700
Toucan librarian.

162
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,700
Yeah.

163
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:07,700
He's not good.

164
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
He's not good at all.

165
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,820
He's terrible at being a librarian, but he is a toucan.

166
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,820
Yeah.

167
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,820
He has a colored nose.

168
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:18,100
And instead of food, you get chess.

169
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,100
Comes on a plate.

170
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Or information.

171
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,020
What about chessman cookies?

172
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,020
What if you get those?

173
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,020
No, that's food.

174
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,020
I don't know what that means, man.

175
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,460
Well, it would have to be library-themed food, and there's cookbooks at the library.

176
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,460
No, there's no food.

177
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,300
You can't eat in a library.

178
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,660
It's against the rules.

179
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:37,740
You can't eat candy in a library with the lights on.

180
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,580
I didn't say anything about candy.

181
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,220
You just said you want them to serve you food in a library.

182
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,780
Yeah, like Prime Rib.

183
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,780
No.

184
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
No.

185
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
You can't have Prime Rib.

186
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,700
You would get the Prime Rib juice everywhere.

187
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,340
I want them to give me Prime Rib at the library.

188
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,420
Well, you'll have to go to a different library.

189
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,740
You're not coming to Brain Forest Cafe, okay?

190
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,300
You better get the fuck out.

191
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,540
God, I'm going to start my own.

192
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,180
I'm gonna start Dinosaur Times by myself.

193
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,580
No, you guys are gonna be sorry.

194
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,140
It's gonna be your newspaper.

195
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,100
Yeah. Yeah.

196
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,420
Yeah, the Dinosaur Times.

197
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,500
Yeah, 'cause you came from Dinosaur Times.

198
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,500
That's how old you are.

199
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,380
Pussy, bitch.

200
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,300
No one's gonna read it.

201
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,580
It's gonna have a very low readership.

202
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,860
People would wanna read about

203
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,020
what's going on with archeology and stuff.

204
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,380
It's not about archeology.

205
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,020
It's about the daily lives of dinosaurs.

206
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,860
Yeah.

207
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,020
Hey, Pat, what's going on with archeology right now?

208
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:25,860
Yeah, tell us.

209
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,900
There's so many new bones.

210
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:28,740
Yeah?

211
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,740
I'm not even kidding about that.

212
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
Really?

213
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
Yeah.

214
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Wow.

215
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,980
So, what's the latest headline?

216
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:44,460
So apparently, the stegosaur or triceratops was actually just like a baby of a different

217
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,380
animal, a different dinosaur.

218
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:51,900
So the triceratops is not an adult, it's just a baby version of something else.

219
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,900
So it's like you.

220
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
That's terrifying.

221
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
No.

222
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,540
So it's like you're a baby version of me.

223
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:58,660
I'm not a baby.

224
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,420
You are, you're a baby version of me.

225
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,820
Only a baby would think that he could start a dinosaur newspaper.

226
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:08,300
If I was a baby version of you, I would have one hair poking out of the top of my head.

227
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
And you do.

228
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,300
No, no, because, yeah you do.

229
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,300
It's very thick.

230
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,980
That's why you're wearing a beanie right now.

231
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,140
To hide it, because you don't want us to see it.

232
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,980
You knew we were going to keep you being a baby.

233
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,980
No.

234
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,980
No.

235
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,540
You'll never own a newspaper, bro.

236
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,540
I'll own it.

237
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,420
I'm not, I don't even want the newspaper.

238
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,420
I want the restaurant.

239
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,420
Good, because you're not going to get it.

240
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:30,820
I want the Dinosaur Times restaurant.

241
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:35,180
Okay, and what are you going to put on the tables for people to read?

242
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:38,140
I'm going to put the menu on the table for people to read.

243
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:40,940
They didn't have menus in Dinosaur Times, so you can't have a menu.

244
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,180
It's a stone menu.

245
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,940
To you I posit this question.

246
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,420
What language do dinosaurs read on the menu?

247
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,820
Jurassic?

248
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,100
No!

249
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,300
Wrong!

250
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,340
Wrong!

251
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,340
That's a movie!

252
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,340
Spanish.

253
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:56,340
They read Jurassic.

254
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Dinosaurs.

255
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,340
speak spanish

256
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,500
No, dinosaurs don't speak Spanish.

257
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:02,380
Yeah, they did.

258
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,340
What are you talking about?

259
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,100
Spanish, yeah, they did.

260
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,740
No.

261
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,620
Yeah, they did.

262
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,380
You're so stupid about language.

263
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,820
I'm not stupid about language.

264
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,940
You're right.

265
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,700
I'm not, definitely not stupid about dinosaur.

266
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,540
Speak every language right now.

267
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:14,860
All right.

268
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,940
Hello.

269
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,540
Bonjour.

270
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,980
Hola.

271
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:22,060
You're reading off of your tote bag.

272
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,900
Bienvenidos.

273
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,500
That means welcome.

274
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,140
I'm saying welcome. No, you're saying hello and then you switch to welcome.

275
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:38,060
Guten Morgen. Disqualified. That's good morning. That's different. Guten Tag. Different.

276
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,460
Just skip the Chinese, man. Guten Abend.

277
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:50,780
Uh, gut. Shut up. Nisch sehr gut. Nobody wants to hear this. Cameron's told me to do it.

278
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,820
It doesn't mean you have to do it. It means I have to do it.

279
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,460
So since when do you obey everything I say? I like to order when you drink energy drinks.

280
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,140
I don't like latte Patrick. Why? Because it kind of looks like you're eating poop.

281
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,580
This is a weird color. Yeah, it does look like poop. It's like got that green tint to it. Maybe

282
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,700
it's because you're sitting in front of a green screen now that I think about it. It could be

283
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,420
that. But maybe the light is reflecting off the bright green wall behind you. No, I don't think

284
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,420
so. Maybe this green poop is green because of the green screen. Yeah. See that's what I'm talking

285
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:24,060
about. That sentence would never come out of Monster Energy Patrick's mouth. It would. No.

286
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:39,820
this is the center so come out of monster energies of monster energy I miss when I

287
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:44,060
miss when aspartame was fucking calcifying your brain yeah turning you

288
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,380
there's no aspartame in monster zero yeah there's a we've been over there's

289
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,180
something it's some sweetener something worse it definitely wasn't good for me

290
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah

291
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,580
Yeah, I'm sure I'm sure I'm sure yeah, I'm sure yeah, no, I'm really sure I know I'm sure about that

292
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,620
Yeah, I'm actually gonna have about that

293
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:09,600
I if you had kept drinking monster energy in ten years you have like the tongue version of Artie Lang's nose

294
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,880
Completely I'd have already like teeth. Yeah

295
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,180
You look like

296
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,060
great teeth. Heroin is really good for your teeth. Especially when you snort it yeah.

297
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,620
When you snort it and yeah. It's like Daredevil where he goes blind but his

298
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:33,660
other senses get better. When your nose gets fucked up your teeth get better. Oh

299
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,780
his sense of hearing is probably great now. Tell you what's great, his sense of

300
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:45,420
humor. Yeah this guy's one of the funniest guys of all time. Mm-hmm yeah. And that's

301
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,740
just the facts Jack maybe I do need to lose some of my senses yeah I think if I

303
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,100

304
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:03,100
sense of hair good feature now I have no hair on my body you should get them like

305
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:22,280
wax imagine you should get like Morticia

306
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:34,340
Adam's eyebrows yeah like divine all the way across his head all the way to the

307
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,760
back of his head just lines I you guys want me to look like a freak I'm gonna

00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:47,320
yeah replace him with a script tattoo that says southern mm-hmm people like

310
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,040
and then also divine eyebrows.

311
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,520
- That'll go over well too.

312
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,080
That'll go over very well for you.

313
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,960
- I know somebody who has a Southern tattooed

314
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,040
in their eyebrow.

315
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,560
- Really? - Pretty cool, yeah.

316
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,640
- Yeah, it's Lauren Southern. - Very fucking swag.

317
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,760
Yeah, yeah, exactly. - Who's that?

318
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,200
- I don't know who you're talking about ever.

319
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,920
You say, we've been over this, you say names,

320
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I go, yeah, Patrick, yeah.

321
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,960
- Lauren Southern was one of those alt-right people.

322
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:11,800
You choose one of those,

323
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,640
'cause like, those like alt-right people

324
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,840
from another country who's like--

325
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,040
- Alt-right, what does that even mean?

326
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,480
Yeah, they have a website?

327
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,000
One of those annoying, like, "Oh, I live in another country, but I'm very concerned about

328
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
American politics."

329
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Oh, yeah, like Ian?

330
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, yeah.

331
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yeah.

332
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Like Patrick Miles Chung.

333
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,280
I'm not concerned about any other...

334
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,080
I'm not even concerned about American politics.

335
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,240
Oh, your Twitter tells a different story, pal.

336
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,240
You're out there tweeting about the spineless ghouls at the DNC.

337
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Think you might be a little justice.

338
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Those goblins at the DNC.

339
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm...

340
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
I'm not justice.

341
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
These freaking rat fucks want us to vote for...

342
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:53,160
These rat fucks at the DNC hate the gremlins.

343
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:58,040
Sometimes like the Democrats, sometimes like the Demacrips and the Robledicans.

344
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,080

345
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,360

Yeah, you should post that.

347
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Wow, you really blew my mind there man.

00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,000

And the hood is our, is the, is the Supreme Court.

00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,820
The hood is the Supreme Court, real shit.

353

And the hood is Congress.

354
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,540
Where I'm from, the hood's the Supreme Court.

355
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,540
Wow.

356
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,820
And it's like, and it's like the third party is the Latin Kings.

357
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,860
And a switchblade is a voter's ballot.

358
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,940

Is a gun, yeah.

00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,460
Because both sides want guns, more guns.

Uh huh.

00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,460

433
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,860
- Oh no!

434
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,140
- Let's do this list, dude.

435
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,940

- Life has an evil way of putting every one of us

445
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,100
an embarrassing situation once in a while. Think about the most embarrassing

446
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,820
situation you have ever experienced while voting. Not the imaginary

447
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,960
conceptual "ooh that would be bad" but more of the "that was the worst of the

448
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:42,260
ones I've experienced." Do they mean vote- *burp*

449

Yeah, keep going. Yeah, no, keep it going. Let's go. Do they mean most embarrassing

00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,860

underwear now the comments are where it's at on this list once in April

456
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,900
Fool's Day my friends plan to do prank with me after school she said me to wear

457
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,520
trousers and come in her home. I was very happy, but when I go there with flowers to

458
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,400
give her immediately, some strong boys of my class comes and down my trousers and ran away.

459
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,700
I wasn't wearing underwear in front of my friends, so embarrassing."

460
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,340
That's all in a sentence.

461
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,100
Ow! I hate the strong boys of my class.

462
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,520
Oh my god, the strong boys of my class need to tone it down.

463
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:45,220
My favorite comment on this one is this one here that says, "Once my neighbor came. She

464
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,060
is a small children, but very dangerous. She has a room where girls down boys' pants and

465
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,980
underwear if anyone don't she make him walk fully naked from head to toe she

466
00:22:53,980 --> 00:23:02,940
also beat whoa she beat what he beat also be all of these these are wait hold

467
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:11,020
on this it has like one two three four five like six fucking things that all

468
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,700
that all of these start with once like all of these comments start with what I

469
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:19,940
think the same person yeah this guy's been pants so many times by the

470
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:24,140
strong boys in his class. I hate those guys in my third grade class who were

471
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:28,300
always wearing red speedos and oiling each other up with Pam and getting

472
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:34,200
really really brown. Once I was falling water and auntie in school said you have

473
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,620
to undress fully I forgot to wear underwear but I have to be naked in

474
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:45,260
front of all of my classmates. Sounds like America to me. Mm-hmm. It has to be

475
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:49,540
in America right? Once some friends called me in an underwear party and I forgot to

476
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,180
wear underwear so I was forced to put all of my clothes off and make fun of me off

477
00:23:53,180 --> 00:24:03,380
and laugh. Have you guys ever been to an underwear party? I hate going to an underwear party. I hate when I get the invitation because it's like I don't really want to go but I don't want to let my friends down.

478
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:07,340
Yeah the soccer team in college used to have the craziest underwear parties.

479
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,100
It's like a birthday card shaped like a cake but it's underwear and you open it up.

480
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:16,820
Captain Underpants party. Yeah yeah you are you are cordially invited. You were

481
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:20,980
- We are courtly invited to Captain Underpants' lair.

482
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:24,220
- Whoever posted this item in here has some issues.

483
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm glad that never happened to me.

484
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,200
- Once I am wearing shorts in my school bus

485
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,740
and then it stuck on something and torn,

486
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,840
I am not wearing underwear

487
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,900
and higher class students are laughing at me.

488
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,040
- There is a girl who wherever saw me checks my underwear.

489
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,360
If I was wearing, then she'd take my pants in her home

490
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,500
and if not wearing, she forced me to be fully naked

491
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,420
ejaculate and take every clothes even if I was not wearing a pink underwear then

492
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,440
also she gave me that punishment and if wearing still she stripped my pants and

493
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:00,100
made me walk the whole town. There's definitely one guy out here who has a

494
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:07,700
serious fetish. It keeps happening to me. I keep getting pants by the strong boys at

495
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:14,340
school and then Bonti take me home and check my underwear. And my strong neighbor make me

496
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:18,260
little boy and wear no pants and she beat.

497
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,860
Once I was like this, then a bully pulled down my pants in front of my crush and her friend.

498
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:29,940
I felt so embarrassed she was as well as she couldn't walk past me for one month after that.

499
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,220
Once I am swimming my underwear was lost in pool.

500
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,820
I have to go without underwear in front of whole class.

501
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,500
Once I was changing in mall, then the mall owner came and said you look great without

502
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,500
clothes.

503
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,500
*laughing*

504
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:46,000
and said that see a boy can be fully naked for you

505
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
then everyone naked, me, impulsively made me walk out a whole colony

506
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
and embarrassed me

507
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
*laughing*

508
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
it took me to the fashion show

509
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
*laughing*

510
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
*laughing*

511
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
the whole colony, dude

512
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
that's embarrassing, that really is

513
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
once in a whole colony

514
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
sees me naked at the fashion show, dude

515
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:16,000
show dude. Oh no, it's one of those famous naked fashion shows at the mall.

516
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
The whole colony saw it.

517
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Once in a beach I am playing with my friend and talking about underwear. I by mistake

518
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
accidentally pulled his underwear then for that. He beats me very much and then he put

519
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
off all my clothes and made me naked from head to toe. And then in front of every friend

520
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
he showed me naked and everyone laughed at me. And I have to say that I am a poor guy.

521
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
And as a third punishment is that I am his servant forever. And every time comes naked

522
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,760
comes make in front of him when he says put off your clothes

523
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,360
i have to do it by saying him boss and all his friends and do what they says

524
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,140
these are his five punishments

525
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,160
candid this guy's had a rough

526
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:53,600
i wasn't wear underwear for one year once my friend call me after school when

527
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,240
there were no teachers or anyone and they locked the classroom i am a new

00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,600
student so they do ranging and forced me to down my shirt and pants

529
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,580

532
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:19,020
30 minutes can you imagine this guy's like predictive text that's what it

533
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,300
sounds like fuck dude I wish this guy had a user now I wish we could like look at

534
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,960
this guy's got I bet he's all over this list yeah there's no ways not Betty has

535
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,420
one for number two having your diaper changed in public oh baby he has to be

536
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,660
here right yeah yeah one time I was at SeaWorld and two grandparents were

537
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:42,000
changing their granddaughter outside in public my grandma even yelled look at

538
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,960
that girl naked grandma's a freak what's wrong with your grandma come on grandma

539
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:59,720
well this one's like this one's weird this one's just like weirdly racist Asian

540
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:04,640
kids always get their diapers changed in public. I have seen this way too many

541
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:11,520
times growing up especially in Philadelphia's Chinatown where I live.

542
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,280
If I ever was caught having this done to me over the age of three I'd kill

543
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:21,520
myself especially if it was on YouTube. When I was in high school a lady and a

544
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,400
baby girl was visiting my homeroom special ed teacher later the lady

545
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,280
proceeded to change the girls diaper on the floor in the classroom in front of

546
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:36,040
the students and the teacher we all witnessed it this is not a joke it 100%

547
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,880
happened for real it reminded me of the scene from the Rugrats episode little

548
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:46,600
dude where Tommy got his diaper changed in a classroom I look at they specify

549
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:50,400
special ed teacher saying that they're in a special ed class it's just nice to

550
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:55,120
know I feel like there's a pretty pretty big alpha dog move yeah honestly so get

551
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,600
your diaper change in public just it's like when you you know when you pull

552
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,320
your pants all the way down to your ankles to pee at a urinal and you look

553
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,480
around the bathroom to make eye contact with everyone so they don't look at you.

554
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,320
You turn around and then you start shitting in the urinal. Yeah exactly.

555
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,400
Nobody's gonna talk to you dude. Yeah I think this comment here is from our guy

556
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,480
I saw a seven-year-old getting his pant down by his mother to change in public

557
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:24,760
his pant down that's his key that's his keystone phrase. Well it didn't start with once though but he

558
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,820
- He did say pant down.

559
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,320
I feel like nobody else has said pant down.

560
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,060
- Number three, he's back.

561
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,100
Walking in on your parents having sex.

562
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,780
Says, "Once when I was like five or something,

563
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,980
"I was not getting sleep 'til around midnight.

564
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:39,760
"Suddenly I heard noises coming from my parents' room.

565
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,600
"I went to check.

566
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,820
"My mom was saying nibble continually.

567
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,880
(laughing)

568
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,700
"I opened the door and I saw them doing it.

569
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:50,020
"M-mom was asking my dad to nibble on her.

570
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,960
"To this day I am scared."

571
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,200
(laughter)

572
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:59,600
- We have to find this guy's account, dude.

573
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,700
This is so unlucky that he's posting anonymously.

574
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,540
- Oh, I know.

575
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,720
- Here, listen to this comment.

576
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,920
"No, I don't want to see my parents nude

577
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,120
"and having their genitals clashing against each other."

578
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,200
That's a comment by the user Swagflix.

579
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,940
(laughter)

580
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,380
- Swag movies.

581
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,220
- Swagflix, swag Keno.

582
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:29,560
did that twice when I was little. You clashed your genitals? Yeah. Yeah. If this happens

583
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:37,160
to me I'd be like no question. I have no questions because I know exactly what's going on here.

584
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:42,920
That's like the inverse of no comment. Yeah. Walking in on your parents and just going

585
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:51,480
no comment. That did not just happen. Uh yeah no thanks. They have sex now? They have sex now.

586
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:58,600
Get a room. That's Judd Apatow or fucking Joss Whedon writing a fucking... That's Judd Apatow.

587
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:03,320
That's Judd Apatow and Joss Whedon and my two parents having sex with their genitals clashing

588
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:10,280
together like symbols. Ah when when Judd Apatow's genitals clash against Joss Whedon's and you get

589
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,420
Let me tell you, it's something.

590
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,220
- Yeah, when you hear it, it sounds like somebody

591
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,540
let Lisa one of those locked up monkeys.

592
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,480
- Let me tell you, that's a freak versus a geek.

593
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,040
- Yeah, hey, there we go.

594
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,880
- That's right.

595
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,720
- That is, yeah.

596
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,540
- Yeah.

597
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,380
- Yeah.

598
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,720
- Okay, that was good.

599
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,640
Number four, being caught talking to yourself.

600
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,580
- I hate it when they hear my plans

601
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,720
when I get caught talking to myself.

602
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,440
- When I'm talking to myself, the post office bathroom.

603
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,920
- Yeah.

604
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,820
One time I was talking to myself and my friend saw it.

605
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:40,020
- Damn.

606
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:42,020
- Oh my God. - That's a scary comment.

607
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,960
My mom thinks that I have mental problems

608
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,660
if I talk to myself.

609
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,460
- This is bringing back some bad memories.

610
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,940
Left 4 Dead 2 Nick.

611
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,780
(laughing)

612
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,860
They put a quote from Nick from Left 4 Dead 2 in there.

613
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,420
- I've been talking to myself a lot more recently

614
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,820
because, especially when I'm out,

615
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,220
'cause I have a mask on, so I think nobody,

616
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:07,660
and I always have headphones in,

617
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:10,720
So I can't hear myself talking to myself.

618
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,400
And I think nobody else can hear me

619
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,640
'cause they can't see my mouth.

620
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,200
But then the other day, the homeless guy

621
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,920
who lives out front of my building said,

622
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,360
I was like, I guess, talking to myself.

623
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
Like I was like, talking to myself

624
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,680
about like a video I'm trying to make.

625
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,280
And he just goes, "What?"

626
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:33,120
And I was like, "Oh no, I'm not talking to you."

627
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,240
- I'm talking to my phone.

628
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,120
- Oh, you don't understand, I'm talking to my own brain.

629
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,220
yeah you don't get it no you wouldn't get it they tried to the cops tried to

630
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,120
evict that guy the other day really from the bit he lives on a bench out front of

631
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:52,780
my my yeah he sees he always is having a meeting with somebody like a different

632
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:56,340
person every hour comes and sits next to him and talks to him Jana calls him the

633
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:02,900
mayor and yes sir oh we had we had a mayor in Austin two days ago he the cops

634
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
A bunch of cops tried to like...

635
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,900
We had a mayor in Austin.

636
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Sometimes towns or cities could have a mayor that's in charge of them.

637
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Yeah, sometimes there's a mayor.

638
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,900
No, we had a guy similar.

639
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
We had a guy who...

640
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
Let Caleb finish his story, please.

641
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,900
The cops kept trying to like move him off the bench.

642
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
And he's like, "No! I no move!

643
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,900
You abuse me!

644
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,900
Stupid, dick-sucking

645
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
police officers!"

646
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
He sounds exactly like that.

647
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,900
That's a cool voice.

648
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,420
just like picking him up off the bench and putting him on the ground he's like

649
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:38,020
seven feet tall they can't do anything right and then they just gave up they

650
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:43,540

651
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:49,260

652
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:52,300
of his shopping carts to the front of this Indian restaurant and would just

653
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:55,380
scream at everybody when they tried to walk in maybe he's trying to start a

654
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,220
grocery store yeah maybe that's a good idea what are you what do you buy first

655
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:05,220

659
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:29,380
Maybe he's one of those M&M guys from the M&M store. Maybe that's why he said it.

660
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,540
Yeah.

661
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:37,980
Number five, peeing on yourself. Some people like this. Okay, I was in seventh grade last year when I was in science class.

662
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,740
I have to use the bathroom super badly.

663
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,320
I was going to ask the teacher, but the announcement said that the girls bathroom is off-limit till lunch.

664
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,380
OMG, I can't believe it. I have to hold it for a couple more hour.

665
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,100
My bladder was screaming at me. At the end of English class, I peed myself.

666
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:54,060
Thank goodness no one saw it. When I got home, I changed my pant before my mom noticed it.

667
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,220
- Somebody just says, "My mom beat herself once."

668
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,420
(laughing)

669
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,740
- This comment I really like,

670
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,860
"Laughing with a friend and they pee."

671
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,940
(laughing)

672
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,980
I just imagine that on like a Tumblr aesthetic image.

673
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,940
- Yeah. - Yeah.

674
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
- Just teenager things.

675
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:15,300
- I have been, I shit myself fairly often.

676
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,860
I almost never pee myself. - You shit yourself often?

677
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,300
- Yeah, dude, once every six months, like clockwork.

678
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,860
- I don't shit myself. - I think you told me,

679
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,900
I think you've definitely talked about this before.

680
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,300
Yeah, you've definitely talked about that.

681
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,300
I shit myself a lot.

682
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,300
It's still a surprise every time.

683
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
I would say like my last, probably six weeks ago.

684
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,300
That's weird.

685
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Uh, no.

686
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,300
That's weird.

687
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,980
Probably six weeks, not to me, it's just normal, you know?

688
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:34,980
That's not normal to anyone else.

689
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,580
No, it's a modern family.

690
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:42,660
You would think, if I was the one who said that I shit myself like once every six months,

691
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,340
people would be like, "Oh yeah."

692
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,340
You know?

693
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,340
People would think you were gonna die.

694
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,340
But because it's you.

695
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:48,340
No.

696
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,340
No.

697
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:50,340
No.

698
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,340
People don't think I'm gonna die.

699
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,340
People think I'm gonna live forever.

700
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:55,600
I would think you were gonna die if you shat your pants every six months.

701
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,600
I mean I definitely have cancer.

702
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,600
Yeah, you don't have hair.

703
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,600
Yeah, exactly.

704
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,600
Like the telltale sign.

705
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,600
I don't know why I haven't been diagnosed with it.

706
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,600
I just haven't been to the doctor since I was like 15 but...

707
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:12,600
I thought I had a mouth tumor the other day but it was just an ulcer.

708
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,600
Just an ulcer? And you thought it was a tumor?

709
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,600
Yeah.

710
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,600
Nice dude.

711
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Yeah, because I had a headache.

712
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,240
myself is on my on my my notes I have a note in my phone that's just everything

713
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:28,200
wrong with me you just tally it I just every every time I have a new symptom of

714
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:32,320
something it's for one day if I eventually go to the doctor I'll just be

715
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,880
like day you're gonna want to sit down for this and I'll read him off every

716
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,320
symptom that I had I did that with the dentist when I when I went when I was uh

717
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:46,920
17 this tooth is dirty this tooth is dirty this tooth is dirty I don't brush

718
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:53,400
my teeth I didn't I still don't dude I brush my teeth probably once once a day

719
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,200
once every two days it's dude it sucks they should just make a pill that brushes

720
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,600
teeth just fucking make a pill that does it for you dude yeah yeah they should

721
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:06,640
make a pill that's like a nuke for plaque in your mouth it should be yeah

722
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:11,880
no I agree yeah like something or poison that just melts off your teeth or it's

723
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:16,600
like a small type I think if I have if I ever have kids it'll be one of their one

724
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:23,720
of their chores yeah specifically for that you should get like a tooth tunes or

725
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:32,400
so like a juice world tooth no I want it to be as as trying to finally because

726
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,800
the thing about the tooth tunes is you got to like press it up against your

727
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,400
teeth so that would work sound though yeah yeah I think it's press up it's

728
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,280
No, if I had a Juice WRLD Tooth Toons, Badger, probably one of his songs.

729
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:54,200
Yeah. Lucid Dreams. Yeah. Evil House. Scariest song of all time by Juice WRLD.

730
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:00,280
If I had a... High School is Crazy. If I had a Tupac and the Outlaws hit them up Tooth Toons,

731
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:05,800
I'd probably... I had to kiss Tooth Toons when I was 10. You had to kiss Tooth Toons? Yeah.

732
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:13,880
yeah i had to kiss heim witz that's gene simmons real name oh i don't want to know that

733
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:19,960
why are you grossed out by his name what's gross about it the sound

734
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:26,920
okay just didn't like the sound okay but yeah kids should brush their parents teeth

735
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:32,120
right yeah yeah yeah yeah it should be like doing the dishes it's like a respect thing

736
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,400
- Exactly, yeah. - In some cultures they do it.

737
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,080
- I bet they do that in China.

738
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,920
- Yeah. - I bet they do that in China.

739
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,480
(laughing)

740
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,680
- I bet they do.

741
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,880
- I don't think they do it in China.

742
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,720
- I think they do because I--

743
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
- Jerry Seinfeld thinks they do that in China.

744
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,240
- Sorry, have you been in China?

745
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,080
- Yeah, I have.

746
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:49,000
- In China, they can't, it's supposed to be parents' day.

747
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,840
It just makes sense.

748
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,660
- What's the deal with that?

749
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,840
(laughing)

750
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,320
- He's so, that's, yeah, I'm so rogant.

751
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,200
- Jerry Seinfeld just making up shit about China.

752
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,720
(laughing)

753
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,000
- I heard they joined the army at age three.

754
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,840
- In China, the vaginas are sideways.

755
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,600
it just makes more sense

756
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,920
this is how it should be

757
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,700
it just makes sense to me

758
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,560
look everything in china says made in USA what's to do with that

759
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,160
i'm thinking

760
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,000
i'll become a chinese

761
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,720
i'm thinking of converting i'm gonna get a new surgery

762
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,500
i'm gonna get an experimental surgery

763
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,680
to make me chinese

764
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,780
i don't think jerry seinfeld would ever go to china

765
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:34,220
I feel like I don't think that's... I think he'd be so rich, it makes perfect sense for him to go to China.

766
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,220
That's true, he could drive on the Autobahn there.

767
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
He could drive on the China-Bahn.

768
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
The China-Bahn!

769
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,220
Yeah. Mmm.

770
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,220
China-Bahn. China-Bahn.

771
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,220
Mmm. Yeah, you pick that up at the airport.

772
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,220
Sounds good.

773
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:51,720
Yeah. Oh, that's another business idea I got now.

774
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
China-Bahn. China-Bahn?

775
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Jerry Seinfeld's Chinese Restaurant?

776
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:00,720
- Jerry, it's a Jerry Seinfeld owned Cinnabon.

777
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,520
That's all, it's like a Cinnabon.

778
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,000
- My business idea is for something

779
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,920
that's owned by Jerry Seinfeld.

780
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:06,760
- Yeah, I'm gonna get a bit on it.

781
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,360
- I would love a Jerry Seinfeld Chinese restaurant

782
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,640
and you're like, "Hey, sorry, can I have chopsticks?"

783
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
And he's just like, "Chopsticks?

784
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,200
"What do you want chopsticks for?

785
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:18,780
"You have a hand, you have a mouth, use a fork!

786
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,620
"The hell's wrong with you?"

787
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,960
- It just makes sense.

788
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,400
- It just makes sense!

789
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,800
- It's a Cinnabon. - Why are you using chopsticks?

790
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,600
Are you a caveman?

791
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,600
You wanna eat off a stone?

792
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,600
How are you gonna eat your soup?

793
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,600
It's a cinnamon roll rangoon.

794
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,600
Whoa.

795
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
That's a pretty good idea.

796
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
That's China-bon.

797
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,600
That's Jerry Seinfeld's China-bon.

798
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,600
China-bon, yeah.

799
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,600
Okay.

800
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,600
Alright.

801
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
Alright.

802
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
You got me.

803
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
I think I want you guys to go 50% on this with me.

804
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,600
I'll go 100% because I'm stealing that idea.

805
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:51,600
No, you're not.

806
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
No.

807
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
I'll tell you what.

808
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,760
for a hundred percent of your idea right now,

809
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,920
'cause I'm stealing it.

810
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:59,000
- Hmm.

811
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,560
And Patrick, after you open up

812
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,920
the Jerry Seinfeld's China Bar

813
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,560
and you can open up a spinoff restaurant

814
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,800
that's Michael Richards' soul food.

815
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:08,040
(laughing)

816
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:15,600
- It's open mic night at Michael Richards' soul food.

817
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,440
At Michael Richards' country cooking.

818
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,680
(laughing)

819
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,720
He's hosting.

820
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,520
That's how he tries to make up for it?

821
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,520
Yeah!

822
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:28,520
I'm trying to give back to the community.

823
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,520
Oh my god!

824
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Jerry, I'm moving to Baton Rouge.

825
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:46,520
Oh, that's pretty good.

826
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:49,480
Yeah, number six, caught stealing.

827
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,480
Once you are in trouble, then you are in big trouble.

828
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,480
I never got caught stealing, although I did only steal one thing in my life.

829
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,480
I stole Pokemon cards all the time.

830
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,480
Yeah, I stole Magic the Gathering cards when I was in high school.

831
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
I stole a cigar with my friend.

832
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,480
What the fuck?

833
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,480
How did you even get to where cigars are?

834
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,480
You were the lookout and you didn't steal it. You abetted.

835
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,480
I was an accomplice.

836
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,480
I smoked the cigar, so...

837
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:19,480
I used to steal stuff out of kids' houses.

838
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,480
Yeah. I never stole things. I would leave things at people's houses.

839
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:27,480
That's ingenious.

840
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,480
Like I would put, like, I would bring framed pictures

841
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,480
and put them in their stuff. I would steal

842
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,480
I would always steal headphones. Oh yeah, that's not bad.

843
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:43,480
I just thought it was funny.

844
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:48,200
like a jacket maybe. A jacket? You can't steal a jacket. I feel like a jacket's too far.

845
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,140
Yeah. Unless it's like somebody has a lot of jackets. They'll see you wearing it. Yeah. Well, you don't wear it, you put it in your

846
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:59,440
backpack. Well, then what are you gonna do with it? I'm gonna put the jacket on my

847
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,640
legs. I'm gonna put it on my... And make it look like I'm a little guy. I'm gonna put it on my beautician

848
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:10,960
dummy. Dress it up. Is that so wrong? I'm gonna make it look like Sonic the Hedgehog.

855
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,880

Oh, okay.

880
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:10,080
Maybe it was Jason Momoa.

881
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:15,080
This is my best friend Darlene, who's also my mother.

882
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,080
I'm not scared to call my friends mom.

00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,080
Hey, you guys are kinda, I'll just start calling you mom.

884
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:21,080
Is that embarrassing?

885

No.

00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,440
Number 9.

898
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,200
Caught listening to Justin Bieber songs.

899
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,780
luckily for me i'd listen to music by other artists

900
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,240

901
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,020

00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:31,760

904
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,240
i don't listen to the all-man brothers band

905
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,320
uh... there's no one has no one i've been waiting to get to this whole time

906
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:55,020
on. Number 10 is nude on stage during nursery play. What does that mean? If that

907
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,960
happened, I would fall down, my head would spin 180 degrees, then my tongue

908
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:02,480
would turn upside down and pop out of my eyes. Then I would turn bald and all my

909
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,680
hair would turn to liquid and come out of my pores. Then I would have no hair

910
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:09,160
anywhere on my body. Then my legs would do a splits and my upper torso will rip

911
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:17,320
out of the bottom and then the worst part is coming up I would turn into Justin Bieber

912
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,240
@smoothcriminal did this actually happen to you?

913
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:24,880
Would you guys ever do like a naked on stage naked show?

914
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,880
No.

915
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,880
Probably not.

916
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,240
No one is going to see my penis.

917
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,360
I got asked to do the improv boss one I gave him a hard N-O.

918
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:32,360
Yeah.

919
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:33,360
I mean yeah it's like.

920
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
You gave him a hard N.

921
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:35,360
No.

922
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:36,360
No.

923
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,360
Why did you do that?

924
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,200
No, no.

925
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,320
Yeah, I mean the thing is that--

926
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:42,680
A lot of people do that shit though,

927
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:44,720
I don't understand it at all.

928
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,120
It's not even like it's gonna be a good show.

929
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,760
It's not even like, it's like,

930
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,720
oh, this is the thing that's gonna make my career,

931
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:51,560
I guess I--

932
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:55,260
I would just be confused on like how hard do I get.

933
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:56,100
Yeah.

934
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:56,920
Yeah.

935
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:57,960
And also, I mean like--

936
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,080
If you get hard, is that okay?

937
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:04,280
If I get hard, do they have to have sex with me?

938
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:06,400
Do they all hold me down and have sex with me?

939
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,400
They can hold me down and suck my dick and fuck my balls?

940
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:11,400
Do they fuck me in my balls?

941
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,400
Wait, if they see my balls, they have to fuck my balls?

942
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:17,400
Do they have to hold onto my balls and run across the room?

943
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
What if I accidentally dip my beer in my balls?

944
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:25,400
Yeah, what if I spill water on my balls and I have to run around the room to get them dry?

945
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:32,400
What if I have to run around the room so fast to get my balls dry that I accidentally go forward in time?

946
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,280
Oh, what if they start throwing Skittles at me and I gotta windmill my penis to whack them off?

947
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,760
What if they throw a Skittle at me and it goes into my pee hole and I have to go to the hospital?

948
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,040
Oh, what if I have to do a naked stand-up show at the hospital for all the patients?

949
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:51,680
What if I sit down on the stool but the whole stool goes inside my ass?

950
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:54,960
What if my microphone gets stuck in my balls?

951
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,760
Yeah, what if the little antenna at the end of the microphone gets in my pee pee?

952
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,260
Yeah.

953
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:01,600
Yeah!

954
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:06,100
I don't know. There's a lot of like okay, so that would be a horrible place for that

955
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:14,100
What if I accidentally summon an evil genie

956
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:18,360
Hamburger meat

957
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,880
What if they have a meat grinder on the stage

958
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,880
and my asshole falls in the meat grinder on the stage

959
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:29,320
What if my penis comes off of my body and flies around the room like an RC plane and people are reaching at it and trying to grab it

960
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:33,600
The sexy lady grabs it and it squirts everywhere.

961
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:37,280
Oh no, my penis turned into the golden snitch.

962
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,400
So in short, ImprovBoston,

963
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,840
(imitates farting)

964
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,080
(laughing)

965
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,560
Sorry, I don't wanna skip ahead.

966
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:52,080
We can skip ahead if you really need to.

967
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,720
Number 12 is just parents making love.

968
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:59,000
It's one thing to walk in on your parents having sex.

969
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,780
It's another thing just for your parents to make love entirely.

970
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:03,280
Yeah.

971
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,280
[Laughter]

972
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:08,720
There's a comment on here that says, "It's actually very cute, isn't?"

973
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,580
Oh, oh my god, what are you?

974
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,580
Oh, my bad. I thought you guys were fucking.

975
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
You two are making love. This is very cute.

976
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,580
This is cute of you to do.

977
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,080
Anyway, could you heat up some milk for me?

978
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:22,080
I'm really tired, but I can't fall asleep.

979
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,080
I'm really tired, but you know I can't fall asleep.

980
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,880
I have a stomachache from looking at this.

981
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,580
Can you go make me some milk?

982
00:50:28,580 --> 00:50:30,780
There was a time in high school when I was like,

983
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,300
every night I'm gonna have a warm glass of milk

984
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,900
to go to sleep and I hated it.

985
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:37,700
- It's so psycho dude, it's so disgusting.

986
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:38,620
- It's horrible.

987
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,380
I would heat it up in the microwave.

988
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,220
- Yeah.

989
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,900
- Oh, I did that once.

990
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,740
- Dude, I don't get it.

991
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,540
I've never, my younger sibling would do that all the time.

992
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:47,900
It's so disgusting.

993
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:49,020
- Terrified, dude.

994
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,860
- Milk was meant to be hot.

995
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:56,100
It would come out of a fucking cow piping hot.

996
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,940
- That's right.

997
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:57,860
- And it would stay hot.

998
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:03,660
it would never cool down. It would never cool off. That's what a hot toddy is I think.

999
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:12,420
That's no that's a hot tata. Hey. I think you're being inappropriate right now. I'm not dude.

1000
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:17,540
I think you're being inappropriate a little bit. Did you guys come come out cold or hot?

1001
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:27,020
Hot. Hot though like freezing cold. No it's like lukewarm. Icy cold. One degree above freezing.

1002
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:35,980
I feel like it's like when you throw boiling water on a freezing day and it turns into

1003
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,980
ice.

1004
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:37,980
On your girlfriend's back.

1005
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:38,980
Yeah, and it turns into ice.

1006
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:42,500
I feel like it's like that but for room temperature.

1007
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,500
I don't know.

1008
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,340
I'm always pretty disappointed in the temperature of my gum.

1009
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,780
As soon as it leaves your pee hole it turns into like...

1010
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:51,180
It's like the temperature of spit.

1011
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:52,180
I wish that it would...

1012
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,180
Spit?

1013
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:54,180
Do I have cold spit?

1014
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:55,180
Hold on.

1015
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:57,180
Oh, oh

1016
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:06,460
Come on what do you mean? You can't waste it? You only have a little bit in your life

1017
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:11,540
It's like heartbeats finite amount of spit. Yeah, come on. You don't want to waste a lot of spit

1018
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,060
Can I have some?

1019
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:17,500
You're gonna spit transplant from you

1020
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,020
Okay

1021
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,420
Number 13, farting in public.

1022
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:23,920
Not embarrassing.

1023
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:25,220
Not embarrassing, dude.

1024
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,720
That's, uh, someone who's boss.

1025
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:33,320
Once you're a master at holding farts in, you can go into a corner and let the storm rage on.

1026
00:52:33,320 --> 00:52:37,720
I hate Frozen, by the way. I know this is stereotyping, but it's just a meme.

1027
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,520
How boys fart. Let the storm rage on.

1028
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:43,720
How girls fart. Conceal. Don't feel. Don't let them know.

1029
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,120
So true.

1030
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,720
That's so true.

1031
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:49,320
Boys fart like this, girls fart like that.

1032
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,680
yeah you know with this so you can get with that I think I'll go with this

1037
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,280
Kyle watching porn number 17 has a little script here if you guys want to read it.

1038
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:23,040
Alright let's do it. Kyle watching porn. Who's gonna be the mom?

1039
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:32,160
You're the mom Pat. Okay, Caleb's the mom. What are you looking at? Wait, okay, who's me? You. Okay, then

1040
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:36,520
you really have to read the note at the end. This is serious. Who's on first?

1041
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:43,160
What are you looking at? Mom! Wait, there's a girlfriend. You're the girlfriend Pat.

1042
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,160
No, Cameron's the girlfriend.

1043
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,160
No, he's me.

1044
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,160
Wait, there's four parts in this script.

1045
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,160
Oh my god.

1046
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:53,160
I'll be mom because mom only has one line and then I'll also be the note at the end.

1047
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,160
Okay, and then I'll be me

1048
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,160
and then Patrick will be the girlfriend and the friends.

1049
00:53:57,160 --> 00:53:59,160
Alright, let's do this.

1050
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,160
We've done so much, I feel like we need intro music now.

1051
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,160
Yeah.

1052
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,160
Is that Candy Shop?

1053
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:07,160
What are you looking at?

1054
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,160
Mom!

1055
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,160
Tom, are you looking at other girls?

1056
00:54:11,160 --> 00:54:19,920
girls? Uh, no. Ha ha ha! Wow, you're a girl of year! No I don't, now leave me alone. Yes,

1057
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:25,140
that would be embarrassing. Note, Tom is not my real name. I'm Darren, and I'm

1058
00:54:25,140 --> 00:54:28,300
making a cartoon of it.

1059
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:39,640
Yeah, I'm just, I'm making a cartoon of it. Yeah, I'm making a cartoon of it. Yeah. The

1060
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,880
The podcast about list players present

00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,640
Caught While Watching Porn by Darren

1062
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:45,640
Darren's cartoon

1063
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,640
Yeah, uh, Pat, just a little note

1064
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,640
I feel like you could have maybe given a girl voice

1065
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,640
Yeah, do two different voices, let's run this again

1066
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,640
Make some different character choices

1067
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,640
Okay

1068
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,640
What are you looking at?

1069
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,640
Mom

1070
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,640
Tommy, are you looking at other girls?

1071
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,640
Uh, no

1075
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:18,440
and I'm making a cartoon of it I think that was good I think that was really

1076
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,680
good I think I could sell that for money we can sell Darren's cartoon for money

1077
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,520
and doesn't fucking find out yeah I think we could option Darren's script off

1078
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:30,080
Darren if you're listening right now we would love to to work with you on this

- Your short.

1084
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,080
- Hey Patrick.

1085
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:42,920
- Yeah.

1086
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:43,960
- How would you like being embarrassed

1087
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,800
and getting punished too?

1088
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,060
(laughing)

1089
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,240
- I wouldn't like that.

1090
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:51,220
- That's not convincing.

1091
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:52,600
It sounds like you might actually really enjoy that.

1092
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,160
- I wouldn't like it at all.

1093
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:55,480
- You wanna get punished and embarrassed.

1094
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,360
- I wouldn't like it at all.

1095
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:58,440
- You wanna get punished. - Oh my God.

1096
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,840
- You wanna spill. - I wouldn't like it.

1097
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,680
- You wanna spill Kevin's chili.

1098
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:01,520
- I wouldn't like it.

1099
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,120
- And then you wanna get spanked.

1100
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,900
I don't like, I wouldn't like it.

1101
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,740
You would.

1102
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,600
At all. I think you would like that.

1103
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,440
I wouldn't.

1104
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,280
Stop smiling when you say it.

1105
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,740
Number 21, number 21. I wouldn't like it.

1106
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:14,300
Number 21, opposite sex public restroom.

1107
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,640
Sorry, this is the opposite sex public restroom.

1108
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:20,900
(laughing)

1109
00:56:20,900 --> 00:56:21,740
Yeah.

1110
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,740
I'm here to have sex.

1111
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,420
Oh, I think he's back. Not in here.

1112
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:26,780
One time I had a dream where I went to the boys bathroom

1113
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:29,420
and even my unrealistic second grade dream was horrible.

1114
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,840
On an unrelated note, I sing in public bathrooms

1115
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,380
until someone comes in, then I stop

1116
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,620
and hope they didn't hear me.

1117
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,460
It's not them.

1118
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,980
- I'm female.

1119
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,340
I was in Chinatown once during a banquet.

1120
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,420
(laughing)

1121
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,180
And I had to use the restroom.

1122
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,100
So I went and I saw the ladies restroom

1123
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,820
was constantly closed and when I knocked,

1124
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:49,500
no one responded and the door was locked.

1125
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,780
So I went into the men's restroom instead.

1126
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,840
- That's a crime. - How do you guys feel about,

1127
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:56,420
you know when moms or you know when moms or dads

1128
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,740
or dads or moms or something else.

1129
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,580
- Bring their kid into the bathroom.

1130
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,940
- Bring their kid into the wrong bathroom.

1131
00:57:02,780 --> 00:57:03,980
What the hell man?

1132
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,660
I was under the impression there was no girl zone.

1133
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,660
They gotta have a kids bathroom.

1134
00:57:07,660 --> 00:57:11,660
Where only the kids go.

1135
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,660
And that also, that...

1136
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:14,980
It's ingenious.

1137
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:16,220
That is ingenious.

1138
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:18,220
Well that's why they have the family restroom.

1139
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:19,020
Yeah.

1140
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:22,300
Which I would use because it's a more comfortable shitting situation.

1141
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,300
Yeah, cause you're a family.

1142
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:26,300
Cause yeah, yeah.

1143
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:27,820
Family of one.

1144
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,140
This happened to my friend who went into a girls bathroom

1145
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,180
and bike cops just happened to be riding by and wrote him a ticket.

1146
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:37,740
I found number 33. He's back.

1147
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:38,940
Oh my god.

1148
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,740
Ready? This is number 33. When your crush rejects you.

1149
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,820
Comment here.

1150
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:48,860
Once my crush rejects me and made me naked head to toe in public,

1151
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,020
I have to become naked head to toe in public.

1152
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,940
Then she called me in her room and she beats me and said that I will do this daily.

1153
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,700
Once me and my friends are walking, my old crush came and said,

1154
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,980
"Strip all of your clothes with an hunter on her hand."

1155
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:04,380
And said to my friend, "You too."

1156
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,260
She said, "Come in my van and then be naked.

1157
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,820
"I will take you to my home."

1158
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,300
I said, "Okay."

1159
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:13,900
And the I do that, then she removes me from her van

1160
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,380
and said, "Come to my house to take your clothes."

1161
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,140
And I went there and she slapped me and rejected me.

1162
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,220
- Wow.

1163
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,940
This guy's had the worst life ever.

1164
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,980
- This is like, yeah, this is like now scarred.

1165
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,700
This is just like, just over and over again.

1166
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,980
just insanely amazing stories.

1167
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,340
- Yeah, like imagine,

1168
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:35,980
imagine like just being that guy

1169
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,160
and just waking up in the morning being like,

1170
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,420
oh man, I hope strong boys don't strip my pants down today

1171
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,560
and slap me, reject me.

1172
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,700
And just every single day a new--

1173
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:46,940
- Walk in front of the colony.

1174
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,220
- Yeah, a new neighbor beats you

1175
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:51,140
in front of the whole colony.

1176
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:52,500
Every single day just waking up like, oh please.

1177
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:54,420

and I made sure that I do not enter the room,

1188
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,260
but while I was going to the toilet,

1189
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:09,820
I forgot about what I said and went inside,

1190
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,860
only for my bucket to splash all over me.

1191
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:14,100
By the way, it was blue paint, if you were wondering,

01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,300
and said, "Mom, I found a Smurf in the living room,"

1194
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,620
and all my family came to see me

1195
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,660
covered in blue paint, so embarrassing.

01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,660
- That's still a pretty good troll.

1197
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,500
- Convince your sister that you're a Smurf.
