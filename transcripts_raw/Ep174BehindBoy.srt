1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
come back and make a mess

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:08,080
and we see a black

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,040
you're a scrap monster

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,840
and while

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,360
so very imminent a little hot hold on the air

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,420
the caleb couldn't figure out how to use his recorder

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:24,200
can you get his plan i did order

8
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,480
that's a whistle

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:32,680
That's a whistle. Do I still have my recorder from Atlantic City? No, it's in my car. Oh really? I found it the other day and then I looked at it and I was like,

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:35,880
I'm not gonna put that on my mouth and then you and then

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,020
And then thank god I didn't. Yeah. Yeah. I'd be having that new variant. Ooh, Petty got the Omicron.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,480
What is it like? It's crazy. I mean, it's not crazy if you're the first one. It's a cold. It sucks.

13
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,160
It's nothing. I can't go out for two weeks for nothing.

14
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,080
I should be allowed to go to every bar in Dave and Buster's in the city?

15
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,080
I think you should just go out.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
I mean, you can.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,080
That's true, I can go out.

18
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,080
They check, they're not checking.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,080
That's true.

20
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,080
They just check your vaccine card.

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,320
They don't like smell your breath to see if you have it.

22
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,200
Well, no, I'd feel too bad if I got anyone else sick, but...

23
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,200
Just do it, man.

24
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,240
You just said yourself it's a cold.

25
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,880
Just start spreading it like crazy.

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,880
It is bullshit, yeah.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,680
Oh, I can't wait to spread it to you guys.

28
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,680
I think you already did.

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,680
I think you already did.

30
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,680
Yeah, probably.

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,240
I'm like 90% sure that you already did.

32
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:27,000
I tried to walk around all day looking for tests.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
None of them.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
It shut down.

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
There was a line so long to get a test right now.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Yeah, dude, fucking SantaCon, dude.

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
SantaCon got everyone infected.

38
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Stop!

39
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,300
You were at probably the fucking gay matrix party where everybody in the world caught

40
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,300
this.

41
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,960
I was at a gay matrix party.

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
So just admit it.

43
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,960
It's your fault.

44
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,200
There was supposed to be a pony in the living room.

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,480
Ben told me there was a pony that was supposed to be there, and then we got there and there

46
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,480
there's no pony.

47
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,400
They were literally using the pony to try and like ferment and breed the next disease inside

48
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,400
it.

49
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,160
New York City needs to be like day after tomorrow wiped off the face of the earth with a big

50
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,160
wave.

51
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Absolutely, it's disgusting.

52
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,160
I'm so glad I'm not there right now.

53
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,160
I didn't catch it until Neil got it.

54
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,160
Liar.

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,160
Liar.

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,160
That's a lie, bro.

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,760
That, no, uh-uh, because you guys know I kept testing negative.

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,560
You probably gave it to him.

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,200
No, no way.

60
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,200
And me, bro.

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,840
Yeah, definitely me.

62
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
If you gave it to me and you kill me, are you going to feel anything?

63
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,640
Yes, dude.

64
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,640
Are you kidding me?

65
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,960
What, will you feel anything if I die and it was your fault?

66
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,520
Don't make me think about that, man.

67
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,720
Oh my God, my blood is slowing down and my heart rate is reaching one.

68
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,520
Oh no, I have one heart rate.

69
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,640
That is, that literally is when COVID started.

70
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,760
That's what I would lie in my bed at night and I would think every night like, "Oh my

71
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,520
God, all my friends and family are going to be killed by me."

72
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm going to kill them all.

73
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,560
I'm having those thoughts again.

74
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,760
But in a different way than you used to do that.

75
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,480
I'm having those thoughts again, which sucks.

76
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,720
It does feel like everything's just kind of slowing down to a crawl again.

77
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,160
I like it, dude.

78
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,960
Everything's going to be back open in the summer.

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,440
It's just happened like this because it's the fucking winter.

80
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,440
That's fine, dude.

81
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,440
Winter sucks.

82
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,440
Who cares?

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,020
Are you kidding I don't have to do stand-up for like two months. Yeah, this is gonna be great, dude

84
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:30,440
Yeah, it's gonna be awesome. We get to we get to cook up some great new podcast episodes. We're all coughing and yes

85
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:33,240
Sleezing. Yeah

86
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,000
Yeah, dude, I mean it's I really immediate it's funny

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,960
I'm how fast as soon as I knew that we were gonna do a zoom episode

88
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:46,080
I just slid right back into the normal routine of just like I just sat in my house all day long

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,480
Oh, me too. I started drinking at 2 p.m.

90
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Yeah.

91
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,480
I did my famous, this is my famous cocktail that I invented last year.

92
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
Sure.

93
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:04,160
It's, okay, it's one part tequila, one part water.

94
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,160
It's really good.

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:12,800
I've actually, I invented a new cocktail that I've been partaking in today and yesterday

96
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:20,000
pretty heavily. It's called Cameron's Special. Not Cameron's Special, the Cameron's Special.

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No.

98
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Cameron's Special, yeah.

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,720
And it's basically you want to take water and you'll need an electric kettle. You heat

100
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,400
up the water with the electric kettle. You don't want it to boil.

101
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,400
Wow.

102
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,760
It's okay if it boils, but you don't really need it to boil.

103
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:34,760
That sounds awesome.

104
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:40,040
Pour the water in the mug. Get this, you're going to put in a tea bag and some honey.

105
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
You already had me on most of that.

106
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,160
I started throwing it in my mouth.

107
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
And you know what?

108
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,160
It's going to steep.

109
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,440
You throw the tea bag in and you lose me.

110
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,920
The water is enough for me.

111
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,280
The hot water, that's like the perfect drink maybe.

112
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,640
That's the difference between the Cameron Special and just the Cameron.

113
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
That and five dollars.

114
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
That's on the menu.

115
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:11,440
Yeah, yeah, I a lot more than $5 at my restaurant that I opened yesterday.

116
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
You opened a restaurant?

117
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
See this is so fucked man.

118
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
What?

119
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,760
I haven't seen you guys in so long.

120
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,120
I saw you both for like one minute the other day.

121
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,120
Yeah.

122
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,960
And now and now we're now we're we've been we've been placed on separate poles.

123
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,960
Yep.

124
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
This is so hard.

125
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,560
This is literally this this happened every winter of our lives.

126
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,760
Yeah, I know dude.

127
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,760
It's horrible.

128
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,080
that's true I just made that up and said it no because the first the first like

129
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:44,040
year of the podcast you guys left for LA that's true that was winter oh my god I

130
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,000
guess I'm so smart that I've made something up and it was true yeah winter

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,100
is so hard on us winter is one of the harshest seasons I hate the winter so

132
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:57,520
much for for I need to I need to feel you both we're a lot like we're a lot

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:01,860
like an old depression I don't we're a lot like crops yeah yeah I'm like an

134
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,180
onion because I have layers for that movie you know you honestly Pat you

135
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:10,540
might have zero

136
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,540
I think maybe you're right.

137
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
You might be an apple.

138
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
You might be-

139
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,540
I think I'm just, yeah, it's skin and then everything else.

140
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,540
You might, maybe, maybe not even an apple.

141
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,540
You might be a balloon.

142
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:24,540
Maybe like a mushroom.

143
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,540
Like, uh, the same all the way through.

144
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,540
You're just one-

145
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,540
A rock.

146
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,540
You might be the man with the least layers I've ever known in my entire life.

147
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,540
That's not true.

148
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,540
Name one of your layers.

149
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:48,680
My poetry. You don't write poetry. You are not an onion. Yes I am. And that's no slight on you.

150
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,760
You have no idea how deep I can be. Okay here, say something profound right now.

151
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,920
What if, what if I died right now? That's not profound. That's not profound at all.

152
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:06,860
I said that four minutes ago. You're not dead, you're just out of the

153
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:13,820
the fucking screen. Wait is he dead? Hey Pat are you okay? Pat seriously I need you to say

154
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:21,900
you're okay right now. Hey Pat. Pat? Pat! Oh he's moving! He's drinking water! A ghost.

155
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,140
He didn't- you don't become a gho- how fast do you think you become a ghost? I'm convulsing!

156
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,500
I'm convulsing from my covid symptoms. Instantly you think? Definitely. What? You think it has to

157
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:41,840
like load it's just a ghost it flies okay I'm back alive by the way it doesn't

158
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,940
shoot out of you flies out like a like an automatic pitching machine there's

159
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,900
got to be some transition where you're just like in your body but it's dead and

160
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,340
you're like that's dying fuck I'm dead the second your ghost shoots out of you

161
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,160
like a bullet all right where does it shoot out from your mouth that just isn't

162
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,520
true it would break your teeth okay your heart it would break your heart and put

163
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,880
a hole in your body through it doesn't break things you know it breaks my heart

164
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:16,080
what all the pain in the world okay you earned you just earned your first layer

165
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:27,240
you're now a rock in a bag you're now an onion that you open one layer of rock

166
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,920
inside and you've ruined dinner so thanks a lot.

167
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:39,320
Yeah when I when I found out um that my roommate tested positive

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,160

00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,200
He sounds awesome. Yeah he's actually sick um

171
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,280
but I told my friends I was like hey I gotta go my roommate tested positive and

172
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,560
and he went, "Oh, hell yeah, get some!"

173
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,560
I was like, did he just tell me to go get COVID?

174
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,860
I think I did it for him.

175
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,700
I think I got--

176
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,680
- That guy's a beast.

177
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,800
- Yeah, I think I got COVID for Bobby Puglio.

178
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,080
- Yeah, he sounds beasted.

179
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,120
- Did I ever show, he, somehow his name got sold

180
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
to some like Chinese company,

181
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,600
and now there's like a shit ton of bootlegs,

182
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,400
that like bootleg children's skateboards

183
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,080
that have his full name on them.

184
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,760
It's like a picture of like a shark.

185
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,760
That's really cool.

186
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
That's sick.

187
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
I wish that would happen to me.

188
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
That's actually fucking cool.

189
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,760
Dude, I wish too.

190
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
To become famous in China, dude.

191
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,760
Yeah.

192
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
Oh, right?

193
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,080
I'd like to, you know, I haven't Googled it.

194
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,440
I haven't looked into anything.

195
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,120
I'd like to think I already am.

196
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
Yeah, you might be.

197
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:45,280
I won't really know until I head over there in about 10 years to make my new life.

198
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:49,520
But I'd like to think that people are going to know me when I step off the plane.

199
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,280
But I really want to do one of those, you know those like...

200
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,380
Like imagine this, I'm sending the link right here, imagine this but it just says your name

201
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,380
on it.

202
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,380
Okay, let's see this here.

203
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,380
Let me see.

204
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,380
I'm going to look at this.

205
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,380
Okay.

206
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,560
Yeah, that would be really sick.

207
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,560
That's really cool.

208
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,560
Yeah.

209
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,560
It looks, it's, you know what, I'll say this much, it looks like that's the name of the

210
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,560
shark.

211
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,640
Right.

212
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:13,640
Which is a high compliment.

213
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,760
I would also love to have a shark named after me.

214
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,760
Exactly.

215
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:20,240
fine with me being famous in China or having a shark named after me that's

216
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:25,080
about it so tight you know if anybody is a marine biologist at the highest level

217
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:30,640
and is in charge of what's the name a shark can you please yeah you know

218
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,920
person you can there's like they have shark trackers that are like the Santa

219
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,400
tracker where you can just see where I look at it every day to make sure

220
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:43,880
they're not anywhere near that's what my dad does that would be so scary to open

221
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:51,720
shark tracker as a lark. Oh this is cool. It's next door. It's in your house. Yeah, it's in

222
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,480
your kitchen. He literally does that though. He opens up and sees how many sharks are in Cape Cod.

223
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:02,440
The thing is I think that like a shark is so powerful I feel like if I walked into my bathroom

224
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,760
and there's a shark in my bathtub it might win. You know what I mean? Duh. But like it's not like

225
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,920
Like it's in like just the smallest amount of water, but I still feel like it would win.

226
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:18,320
Yeah, but then it I guess we'd both die probably if it got out of the bath.

227
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah, if I had a shark in my in my bathroom, I'd feed it some chum.

228
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,240
You don't have to what is chum?

229
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,760
Dead fish.

230
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
Hold on.

231
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
It is.

232
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,760
Yeah, plankton was wrong.

233
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,720
No for for putting that in his no restaurant.

234
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,760
What is chum then?

235
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:49,400
a friend or companion. Alright, you know what, you've bested me. That's right. You just got

236
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,560
mentally chest. I don't know if Bobby Pui is a COVID-struther, but still a sick guy.

237
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,720
That's right, you just got mentally challenged. I just mentally challenged you in one. Oh,

238
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,640

Too far and you just make fun of his his kid that just died. Oh, I forgot he has a doodoo

251
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,720
Sorry, I'm just thinking

252
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:17,560
Have you seen that like it was like article

253
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,220
It's the article. It's the photo or it's like photo of the dead kid

254
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:28,040
And as Nick Cannon loses five-year-old child and it's like a photo of like Nick Cannon post it up somewhere

255
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
It's so fucking funny.

256
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
Yeah, no, that is a funny photo.

257
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
It's pretty good.

258
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,800
Yeah, no, it's really funny when a five-year-old child does.

259
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
No, he's five months old.

260
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,480
Yeah, that's even funnier.

261
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,760
Yeah, and you know what's even funnier?

262
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,480
The brain tumor exploding his head.

263
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,360
Yeah, sure, Pat.

264
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,360
That's great.

265
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Yeah, that's right.

266
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
His brain drowning in his own blood.

267
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Yeah, that's really, really funny.

268
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Oh, awesome.

269
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,560
I'm so congested, I can't hear you guys making fun of me.

270
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,560
It's so great.

271
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,520
It looks like when you crack an egg and there's two yolks in there.

272
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,360
I'm sorry, I can't hear you guys.

273
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Pat, what's wrong with you?

274
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
Talking about this stuff.

275
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
No, it was really funny when his

276
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
pieces of his brain fell out of his ears like spaghetti.

277
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,360
It was hilarious

278
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
when his kid's head blew up

279
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,360
like a water balloon you leave on the faucet too long.

280
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,360
That was great.

281
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,360
I'm just saying.

282
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,360
And it was really funny when Nick Cannon rapped about it.

283
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
I'm saying it would be funny to go into that

284
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
and then try to make

285
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
actual beef.

286
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,360
You wanted to make actual

287
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:33,640
beef going into the wild and out meat.

288
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,880
What is wrong with you Pat?

289
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,880
What is your problem?

290
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:38,920
You're gonna make beef patties out of a child's brain?

291
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
No.

292
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,760
First of all, it wouldn't taste good because of the tumor.

293
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,360
And because he was stupid.

294
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,360
You fucking...

295
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
You're disgusting.

296
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,360
I just got bad news.

297
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
You're so...

298
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,280
I got I have Delta too and I spread it to you too. That's tight. Listen. I don't care. Just shut up

299
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,280
I'm not saying that it's funny

300
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,440
That this is true

301
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
but if you ate

302
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,640
If you ate Nick Cannon's baby's brains out of his head

303
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:16,320
You'd become stupider instead of smarter because of how dumb this baby was are you are you doing a wild and out right now?

304
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Well, oh my god

305
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
drop the beat

306
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,740
(beatboxing)

307
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:30,440
- It's a double beat special at Wild 'N Out.

308
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,960
- Why aren't you doing anything?

309
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
- I'm just listening to the beats.

310
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,000
- Have you never seen Wild 'N Out, Cameron?

311
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
- I just like the beats.

312
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,280
But they're just fun beats.

313
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,120
I'm just dancing.

314
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,200
- You're supposed to sing.

315
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,460
You're supposed to do, I forget what the game is.

316
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,920
- I'm gonna get up to the mic at the Wild 'N Out.

317
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:59,840
some guys are gonna call me bald and ugly or whatever and then I go oh so I'm

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,520
pretty much the best singer in the world

319
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:15,680
and then I show them a one hair one long hair that I grow like a like a pad you

320
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,680
You audition wearing like a wig.

321
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:27,560
Honestly, if I go to Wild 'N Out, I'm wearing a full like, like, uh, Spirit Halloween Gene

322
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:33,040
Simmons outfit.

323
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:39,400
I'm gonna wear the Gene Simmons hair, I'm gonna have the like shitty like fake leather entire

324
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,320
suit and brown shoes with the black leather.

325
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Oh, did I ever...

326
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,320
That would be so tight, dude.

327
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:48,560
Do you guys ever see, I was Gene Simmons for Halloween when I was 11.

328
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,760
Did I ever show you guys that?

329
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,800
Oh yeah, I've seen that picture.

330
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,280
Yeah.

331
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,080
Gene Simmons or Zero Suit Gene Simmons?

332
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:59,680
I was Gene Simmons, but like the only thing my mom, my mom bought an Afro wig

333
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,840
and she did my makeup, she did the Gene Simmons makeup really good,

334
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,080
but that was the only good part of the costume. She got me an Afro.

335
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,160
The black diamonds are way too big.

336
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
And I wore an Afro.

337
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,840
I wore an afro wig that she was like, "Oh, I'll just like put a ponytail in it."

338
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,720
Because see that's how he like used it, but it's like you can't fucking do that.

339
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:25,760
So I'm just in Gene Simmons makeup with an afro wig and I'm wearing a cape and I'm wearing

340
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,800
like my school clothes under it. That's pretty cool. That is sick.

341
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,040
What's the best Halloween costume you guys ever did?

342
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,800
Skeleton. You guys want to see it? Hot Rod. When I was like 11.

343
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:39,360
You want to see my really cool skeleton costume? I've seen this. It's on your fridge, right?

344
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,880
Senior year of high school. Huh?

345
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,720
Haven't I seen it? Oh it is on my fridge. I'm gonna pull it up anyway. This is the best

346
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:49,760
Halloween costume. I'll never top this in my life. You'll never top this in your life.

347
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,920
I'm gonna top you so hard. You're not gonna top me. Oh my god. I'm on another level.

348
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:02,960
I'm on the second story. I can't find it. You guys can imagine how cool it is. I'm trying to

349
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:07,200
think of the good ones I had. I was, I was, uh, I've talked about this. I was a Rastafarian

350
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:18,900
Kung Fu Master. I was a werewolf. I was a doubly offensive costume. I wore the Jamaican cap

351
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:24,000
with the fake dreadlocks and also a ge. That's pretty cool. That looks sick, Kim. And a ge.

352
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,320
It's so cool. That is pretty fucking cool. What else was there for Halloween? That's

353
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,560
the one that stuck in my head the most, I think. I wore a white t-shirt one year and

354
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,480
I wrote the F word on it.

355
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
No.

356
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,480
Which one?

357
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,260
Not, not, no I wrote like the and then parenthesis F word meaning fuck and then I didn't think

358
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:50,920
about it because I was like oh I'm going as the word fuck but like I'm going as the F

359
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:56,640
word and then I like didn't realize I was just yeah, yeah just going around with a shirt

360
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
that says F-A-G-I-T on it.

361
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,360
Yeah and and basically an arrow pointing at your head.

362
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Yeah.

363
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,360
Yeah.

364
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:11,700
yeah yeah yeah yeah and arrow pointing out of your head that's how that's how

365
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:18,740
they used to mug people in the medieval times. They'd step out of a dark alley an elf with a

366
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:28,180
giant longbow. Avast ye. Yeah I would say it is yeah halt. I have to download this file now.

367
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,620
Honestly you're right mugging was probably so easy to get away from.

368
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:36,420
Well, mugging was probably easier back then because it was all swords.

369
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:40,920
Mugging was not profitable until like, like fucking 40 years ago.

370
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,920
The thing about, the thing about fucking mugging is like, like highway men in the West, it used

371
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,480
to be that, that you could mug somebody who was in a car.

372
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,420
Like they were like riding a horse and carriage and you walk up to them and say, "Stop, I'm

373
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
gonna steal from you."

374
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
And they'd be like, "Okay."

375
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,020
Yeah, 'cause like you can easily kill my car.

376
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,020
That's the tough part.

377
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:05,500
If you have a mortal car, that's how you came up with normal cars.

378
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,100
It's so funny to imagine like you're in your car nowadays and a guy comes up to you wearing

379
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,620
like a Zorro mask and is like, "I'm gonna rob you!"

380
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,260
And he's running perfectly at pace with your car at 60 miles an hour.

381
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:23,020
It's like a self-driving Tesla and he's like walking up to you.

382
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,700
Yeah, exactly.

383
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,420
That's why they need to put a machine gun in new cars.

384
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,360
That's the thing that's the thing if your car is self-driving no reason you couldn't put

385
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,220
a fucking a minigun.

386
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:39,840
Yeah they need the Breaking Bad gun and all Teslas.

387
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,260
That would be that I mean that's I bet that's why they explode is it's that's a weaponry

388
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:45,260
thing.

389
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,040
It's probably programmed to just if they see somebody wearing white and black stripes nearby

390
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:54,240
they instantly blow up in case you have any gold bars.

391
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,480
Yeah. I'm imagining like a nightclub where the it says dress code like no like

392
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,480
large t-shirts no gang colors no black and white stripes and a small black mask

393
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:15,920
that covers just your eyes. No giant bags with dollar signs on them. Yeah. No snapping as you walk.

394
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:24,700
yeah is that a thing in the north where they they make it to cat burglars yeah

395
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,600
no that clubs you can't wear like a big white t-shirt in them um I don't know I

396
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,780
have I've never been clubbing before in my life every like bar in the south has

397
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:39,420
a sign that yeah I think no no like no Jordan yeah no phones that are on oh

398
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,060
No backwards hats.

399
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,540
No in-your-face attitudes.

400
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:58,020
No political lyricism.

401
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:03,060
No hollering "eh, bay, bay" in this club.

402
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,260
It's kind of fucking hilarious.

403
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,100
Every bar in my hometown has some sign like that.

404
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:16,240
The place we went to in Atlantic City, when we stayed there, what was that, the Dome or

405
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,540
something it was called?

406
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,100
Yeah, Pool After Dark.

407
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,060
Pool After Dark, that's right.

408
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,500
I was nervous because I went in there, I was in the all white suit.

409
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,900
Yeah, I knew you were in the all white club.

410
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,100
I was in it, that's not true.

411
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
That was not all white.

412
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,220
Why did you say that, Pat?

413
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:38,340
Did you ignore the other people?

414
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,820
I don't have that bad of brain fear.

415
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,700
You can't manipulate me like this.

416
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,740
I'm going to manipulate you so hard.

417
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,460
I think that you're probably going to end up with long COVID.

418
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,420
No, that's not real.

419
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:53,540
Yeah, yeah, I bet it's not.

420
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
That's not real.

421
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,820
You're going to get it, dude.

422
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,020
Long COVID's not real.

423
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,020
You're going to be like this forever.

424
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
COVID isn't real, but long COVID is real.

425
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,820
Oh, what, how I'm already, how I already am?

426
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,820
What are you talking about?

427
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,740
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I'm going to bank on this.

428
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:11,380
you're gonna wake up and you're gonna feel just a little bit weird and you're gonna feel like that

429
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:16,660
for the rest of your life. Long COVID is so funny because it's like my 60. I've had so many beers

430
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:21,860
today already I'm obviously gonna feel weird tomorrow. Long COVID is like my 60 year old

431
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:27,060
dad got COVID and once he got better he breathes heavily when he walks up the stairs. Right. I

432
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:34,820
think he has a permanent syndrome. Which you long COVID. Yes. Yup. Yup. I think I almost certainly

433
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,940
have it. I'm not saying, GBO's leaving tomorrow, I'm not saying bye tonight I don't think,

434
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:45,340
cause I'm worried that I have short-covid. Now I think I do, now that what Pat told me

435
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:50,020
about that it's just a cold I think I do probably. And I think I probably gave it to a thousand

436
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,540
people. You need to go upstairs, you need to lick all your mom's food. I gave it to

437
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:56,020
so many people in Dunkin Donuts this morning. You need to lick every fucking glass in the

438
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:01,100
pantry. There was a homeless guy in Dunkin Donuts this morning who straight up had vampire

439
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,940
fangs you can't just had he just had he he had two really long teeth that were

440
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,380
that were if you're in Dunkin Donuts I didn't get it in Dunkin Donuts no you

441
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:14,980
can't sell you fucking asshole no that's what I'm saying you don't worry about

442
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,780
that because you if you go in there you're not giving it to anybody you

443
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,620
can't catch it in there it's a safe zone it's true yeah it's like a spawn zone

444
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:29,020
yeah do the Dunkin's in in mass still have a lot of the ones that I used to go

445
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:37,340
to had that Duncan like branded ATMs in them. I think so. I don't know because I always got

446
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:49,840
that cash on me. Damn. But where do you get it from? My mom. My mummy. I got it from me

447
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:56,260
mummy. I got the cash from me mummy. It's kind of, Duncan should just open a bank man.

448
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,980
Yeah, dude. That would be sick. I would switch over immediately.

449
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,980
I would literally, I would read any of the-

450
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:04,980
If I could have a fucking debit card that just looked like a Dunkin' gift card.

451
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
They have to have a Dunkin' credit card, right?

452
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,980
I might actually try and order a Dunkin' Donuts picture.

453
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
You can put anything on your credit card, yeah.

454
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,980
Yeah, I might try and do that.

455
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:16,980
Um, 'cause dude, it's the best.

456
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
Dude, you know what'd be sick?

457
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,980
What? Wait.

458
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,980
So the Dunkin' Donuts bank, right, it gives you 10% cash back

459
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:28,600
on Dunkin Donuts.

460
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
Okay, here's my idea.

461
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,100
It gives you 20% cash back on Dunkin Donuts.

462
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
That's a way better idea.

463
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,900
100% cash back and I'm not going any lower.

464
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,900
110% cash back.

465
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,420
Yeah, 300% cash back on Dunkin Donuts purchases.

466
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,980
Bro, holy shit dude.

467
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
What?

468
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,580
Dunkin Donuts has a black card.

469
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,580
What?

470
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,580
No way.

471
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,820
It's a special gift card that they give to celebrities.

472
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,780
Oh, you know who got one of those for sure?

473
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:54,300
BJ Novak it says.

474
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Ben Affleck probably.

475
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
I was just about to say BJ Novak.

476
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:06,980
Dude, the second paragraph here is "Celebrities like BJ Novak" shows off their top tier

477
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,980
Dunkin Donuts status.

478
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Can we try and get one of these?

479
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,940
Dude, I feel like it's a must, right?

480
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,940
We're all locked.

481
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
I want one so bad.

482
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,340
Now that I know this exists, I'm not gonna rest.

483
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,020
What fucking podcast reps Boston more than us?

484
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,020
True.

485
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,020
Literally, we're the only ones.

486
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
Yeah.

487
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:23,020
Fuck all this Barstool shit.

488
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,180
No, Dave Portnoy, you don't rep Boston.

489
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:30,340
do that's right I'm starting a second beef yeah unless you guys want to buy it as

490
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,460
you don't have to be a celebrity to get a Duncan black card Duncan superfans have

491
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,260
been awarded the card for other things including becoming the 1 millionth

492
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:40,680
member and Duncan's loyalty program and simply being a frequent visitor at the

493
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:45,340
chain so if we can be like if we can okay I'll be the two millionth member

494
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,380
Pat can be the three millionth and I'll be the four millionth and we'll each get

495
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:56,380
it

496
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:11,640

if anyone does

519
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:08,360
there's going to be bad stipulations to that agreement

520
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,600

521
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,440

527
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,780
fucking play head

528
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,680

530
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,280
well here we are let me let's read the car with the comments have to say about

531
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,940
or cuz i think they would disagree with you here about it being the best gift

532
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,560
there's the top comment

533
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,280
if i had a pair i say i won't wear it so my parents say i have to

534
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,900
that i will poor we in them to not wear them and they will take them away but

535
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,900
then they make me wear a nappy. But I think that is better than some underwear.

536
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,900
I think this guy might have the worst life ever.

537
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,900
Yeah.

538
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
That's a horrible situation to be in.

539
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,900
Dude, I haven't done any laundry and I'm down to my last pair of underwear.

540
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,900
Yeah.

541
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,900
And I don't know if I can go and do my laundry.

542
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,900
You know that, you're going to be in your house for the next two weeks. Just wear sweatpants.

543
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,900
Yeah, I know, but my, yeah, that's true.

544
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:14,900
You don't have to wear underwear.

545
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:15,900
You know what I don't own?

546
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:18,900
Nobody's going to be doing, nobody's doing a nappy check on you.

547
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,900
You know what I don't own is sweatpants.

548
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:26,580
Well, you gotta order some brother. Yeah, I know I literally right now never never bought a pair of sweatpants

549
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:29,840
That's why I don't like sweatpants, dude

550
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,760
You're better where if I wear sweatpants or pajama pants, I can't like I look I mean

551
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,400
Well, I leave your house. Yeah, that's the fucking point. I won't leave my bed

552
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:47,260
That's fine. You haven't there's nothing you you're you have your bed in your computer for the next two weeks. Yeah, that's true

553
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,660
God damn it dude. I already want to kill myself. You should play it then. You should play Fortnite with me.

554
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:57,940
It's fine just do it. It'll be over really fast.

555
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:02,620
It'll hurt really really bad, and then you'll be... It'll hurt forever.

556
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,300
It'll hurt, but you'll be stuck in that as a loop forever.

557
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:11,220
That's how, it's the moment of the amount of pain you're in when you die is how much pain you're in. It's your punishment for sinning.

558
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,220
Yeah, that's what they don't tell you.

559
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,980
That's what I get this one's a script so okay Patrick you'll play boy

560
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,180
Caleb you can play behind boy

561
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:31,640
Pause and I'll play everyone we are we already what I you want to be everyone too late. Oh god back to school day

562
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:39,900
I'm going to take off my pants so you could see my door underwears. No takes off pants ah

563
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,260
You want to see Dora stickers on my butt?

564
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:52,420
We already see it. That's behind a boy. Yeah, that's from Jay's top ten list. It's a pretty good script, man

565
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,020
There's a pretty good. I think I'd like to I'd like to option this

566
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,540
Yeah, I think a 24 could do something really beautiful with this. Oh, oh my god. Can you imagine?

567
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:05,380
Yeah, I don't mean they'd call it behind boy, and it would it would make so much money

568
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:09,120
I already think of a theme Michael Michael chick-list plays behind boy. Yeah

569
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:16,140
People yeah, Ari Ari Aster directs uh-huh right it's called back to school day

Yeah, that's pretty good and people people what if his dramatic roles?

573
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:31,980
People will be like the trailer now branded razor scooters, and yeah, yeah

574
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,660
24 movie the the the trailer would have no no

575
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:43,180
Voice over at all the the boy pulling down his pants would be like rhythmic to the music

576
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,060
They go like play play that they play that children's choir version of creep, right?

577
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:55,260
Uh-huh, and then fucking the guy from the Naked Brothers band would say you want to see my Dora stickers on my butt

578
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,420
And it would go ding

579
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,340
ding

580
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,340

581
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,300
Damn

582
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,500
Fine boy. Oh my god

583
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,300
That'd be really cool. That'd also be a great movie.

584
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,900
That would be a good movie. This next one would be a good movie too.

585
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:18,620
What are you supposed to say in front of everyone when presented with a pink Lacey number from

586
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:24,620
your uncle Cecil? Well, they are not actually my size, unk, but thanks anyway. Awkward!

587
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,740
Haha.

588
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,580
I love calling my uncle unk.

589
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:31,540
Oh dude. I didn't get to say that enough as a child.

590
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:35,940

For Christmas.

594
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:40,820
Damn.

595
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:44,420
I'll miss him coming up to me on- on the 1st of January saying,

596
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,700
"Haven't seen you since next year."

597
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,820
Last year.

598
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,260
Since next year.

599
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,780
He always messes it up the first time.

600
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,300
Damn.

601
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:54,740
Someone I know recently got SpongeBob underwear.

602
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,980
Seriously, he just ran a mile after that.

603
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:03,460
If you got that Spongebob underwear, you know you gonna get clowned at the playground whenever on underwear day.

604
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:03,960
Yeah.

605
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,460
*slurp*

606
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,460
This comment...

607
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,960
*laughs*

608
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:07,960
This comment's really good.

609
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,960
"You call that bad? How about Fishing for Floaters poo fishing game?"

610
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
*laughs*

611
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,460
Is that a real thing?

612
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:15,960
I have no idea.

613
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
Is that a real game?

614
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,460
*cough*

615
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,460
I hope that's not a real game.

616
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,460
I think you should check-

617
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,460
Oh, that's a real game.

618
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,960
Yeah.

619
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,460
Fishing for Floaters.

620
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:25,460
Wait, there's-

621
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:25,960
What?

622
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,960
It's a- it's a little, uh...

623
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:34,960
Yeah, dude, it's turds you put in a bathtub.

624
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,620
Oh, man, they're making dookie games now?

625
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,260
They did make a dookie game.

626
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,180
Back in my day, dookie was something you just left on the ground.

627
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,940
Now it's a whole game?

628
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,060
Dookie was something you throw out of your window.

629
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,060
That's disgusting.

630
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,580
When you're done with it.

631
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,960
Back in my day, it was something you let roll down your leg in the grocery store.

632
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,880
in my day you your mom got mad if you had dookie in the bathtub now you get a prize

633
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,840
Now she buys it?

634
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,800
Now she buys it for you? What kind of bullshit is this?

635
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,440
Now you get it on Christmas?

636
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,160
I do remember I have a very clear memory of when I was like three or four maybe

637
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:18,520
and my younger brother's like was he's like two I guess my mom put us in the

638
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:25,660
bathtub at the same time and I took a dookie in and then blamed it on him

639
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:31,060
because he couldn't speak English oh my god yeah I've never there's a floating

640
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:37,580
poop and I was like what the hell Levi you farted shit in the bathtub man. I've never pooped in a tub.

641
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:42,980
Me neither. I would highly recommend it. It immediately cleans your ass. Does it

642
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,260
feel like like a home birth if you know what that feels like? I would say it

643
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:50,460
It feels exactly like the other water births that I've done.

644
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,460
Yeah?

645
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:52,460
That's good.

646
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,340
You ever taken a doo-doo in the ocean?

647
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
No.

648
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,460
No, my cousin did that once.

649
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,540
Not in the ocean.

650
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,860
If you do that, it'll attract a fish.

651
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:08,540
My cousin was told to go to the bathroom and then she dropped a trowel and just like started

652
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,620
pooping onto the water.

653
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,020
I'd be afraid I'd attract a great brown shark.

654
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,020
Yeah.

655
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Me too.

656
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
It smells it.

657
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,220
It smells it. There's dookie in this water.

658
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,220
Yeah.

659
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,220
Comes up, starts eating my butt out of the floating.

660
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,220
The poop shark, dude.

661
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,220
Yeah.

662
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,220
Pretty scary.

663
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,220
The dookie eel.

664
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,220
Remember that shark from Zoobooks? The Zoobooks commercial?

665
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:33,220
It's the shark that like stays flat on the ground.

666
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,220
Remember Super Mario Land?

667
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:37,220
I don't know what Zoobooks is.

668
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,220
It's like a shark that like sits in the sand and like...

669
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,220
Remember colored ketchup?

670
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,220
Fuck you.

671
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,220
Shut up.

672
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
Yeah.

673
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:49,220
It's a shark with like a big mouth and it just like inhales fish into its body.

674
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:51,220
Remember riding our bikes?

675
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,220
Can you play that Uncle Adams song?

676
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:56,220
Uncle Adams.

677
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:00,220
Go to the last comment on underwear. I have some exciting news.

678
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:04,220
Oh my god, another script?

679
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,220
It's a sequel.

680
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
Holy shit.

681
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,220
To Behind Boy.

682
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,220
To Behind Boy, the hit A24 film?

683
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,220
There's four parts in this. Me, everyone, boy, and Jacob.

684
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,740
Well, I was just gonna say, imagine that Zubook shark inhaling your dookie out of your butt for you.

685
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,260
Come on.

686
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,540
That's nasty.

687
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,040
Alright.

688
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,680
Okay, if I have to, I'll play me. I guess.

689
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,320
Okay.

690
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,700
Caleb, you wanted to be everyone so bad, you'll be everyone this time.

691
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,060
I guess I'll be boy and Jacob.

692
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,260
You'll be boy and Jacob.

693
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:38,300
I'm going to take off my pants so you could see my Donkey Kong underwear.

694
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:41,020
No!

695
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,020
Too bad, takes off pants.

696
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,020
Wait, wait, wait, hold on. There's a...

697
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Sorry, this person, whoever wrote this...

698
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,020
You're supposed to say "cut".

699
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,020
Yeah, cut, there's a dire need of a script supervisor here.

700
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,020
Halfway through the script,

701
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:55,020
me changes to boy.

702
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,020
It's two different characters.

703
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,020
I don't think that's two different characters.

704
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,020
You don't think two different characters can have Donkey Kong stickers on their butt?

705
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:03,020
No.

706
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,020
Okay, can we take this from the top, please? We need to get this...

707
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
It doesn't make sense.

708
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:13,820
listen we've been shooting all day okay we are hemorrhaging money we it's cost so

709
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:19,220
much fucking money to have Michael chiklis on set okay we cannot do another

710
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:26,860
take of the studio okayed this a sequel to the palm door winning behind boy all

711
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:34,700
right all right the sequel to behind boy Jacob it's it's called shot of a

712
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,860
called a couple of people

713
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,940
yeah it's gotta be taken to the tagline is this time it's donkey kong

714
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,460
yeah i think it was a little bit they get a comedian to play a serious role here

715
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,940
they get him gaffigan plays jacob

716
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:50,620
okay are you know i'll keep that in mind for the line reading

717
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,960
okay

718
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,260
and action

719
00:38:54,260 --> 00:39:00,420
i'm going to take off my pants so you could see my donkey kong underwear

720
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,460

721
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,340
takes off pants

722
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:06,620
the hell

723
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,500
which one it's a boy

724
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,500
your boy

725
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:13,380
tied to it seriously it makes more sense of you read that line

726
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:16,500
there's two clearly it's different is a difference between me and boy here

727
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:20,260
because i will be probably everyone to the boys probably everyone is such a

728
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,180
everyone kind of includes a lot of people okay

729
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:26,940
so yeah this line you're having trouble with that you don't really more

Number two, a sex education book.

759
00:40:56,500 --> 00:41:00,900

I honestly I remember I remember I'm sure everybody holding a different kind of needle at her throat.

824
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:28,820

off and let us have sex with our crushes.

831
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,700

855
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:34,160
disposable camera with me but it's staying in my pocket. I might accidentally go off but I don't

856
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:39,080

00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:45,400
Yeah. And I might and I might and I might try and put an Xbox controller in my

00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:04,160
sounds like I'm farting yeah yeah and I might carve my name in a heart plus

862
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:10,920
Brandon's name on the walls of his penis like an old oak tree but it's just as a

863
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:19,240
a joke. And I definitely won't be skateboarding around it. I'm not gonna grind on his fucking

864
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,240
urethra if that's what you're asking. No, definitely not. That doesn't even make sense. Yeah, it's

865
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:28,600
not gonna play Superman. It's not gonna play Goldfinger's Superman. It's not gonna play...

866
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:32,880
I'm doing a loop-de-loop around a vein. It's not gonna play "If I Go Crazy Then Will You

867
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:38,000
still call me Superman hmm that's a good song damn yes sir

868
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:45,080
go crazy then will you superman they had the anonymous question box in my sex ed

869
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:49,440
class and they got rid of it because there's one kid in my class who kept

870
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,480
asking questions like if I accidentally leave cum on the toilet seat will it get

871
00:48:54,480 --> 00:49:05,760
my mom pregnant? It's a very romantic question. It's also a valid question.

872
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,400
Asking it over and over is the funniest part. It's just like having like some kind of toilet

873
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,480
baby. Well also how bad does your mom have to be?

874
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,480
That kid was probably having literally a month long panic attack.

875
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,600
Yeah. Yeah. Oh absolutely.

876
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:24,480
How bad does your mom have to be at sitting on the fucking toilet that she slushes her

877
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,480
pussy on the fucking...

878
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:28,440
The whole, the whole seat gets up there?

879
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,720
She's gotta be doing that on purpose, man.

880
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,720
Yeah.

881
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:42,000
There's no way, she saw it and she was like, "Hmm, maybe that's Ashton Kutcher's."

882
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
Number three is coal.

883
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,880
Yeah, embarrassing for sure.

884
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,720
Yeah, I would hate to get coal.

885
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,400
Oh, I would hate to get coal fuel on my trains.

886
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:57,400
Here's what I would do. Okay, you guys, Kim, you be my brother, okay? It was good for Christmas.

887
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Okay, I've just opened my present and I pull out a chunk of coal. It's coal.

888
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
Serves you right.

889
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,900
Serves me right? What do you mean? I asked for coal. I love coal and I asked for it for

890
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:18,400
Christmas. And see, that's how you keep it from being embarrassing.

891
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,840
Oh, okay. I get it now. I get the scenario. Okay, it took me a second there. That's a thinker.

892
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:30,360
Yeah, it is a thinker. Yeah. There's a little bit of a twist. Yeah, it does have a twist

893
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:36,040
on the Christmas format. Yeah. Yeah. I ask for coal every year so that when I'm naughty,

894
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,720
I don't even know. Yeah, I'm saying it's like, I've been saving it up. You've been naughty

895
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:45,600
on coal, you're getting your new, you're getting a brand new RC car. Oh, shit. I hate RC cars.

896
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,520
Yeah, and you'll probably hate that it looks like a shark and it can go in water or land.

897
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:50,020
Are you ser-

898
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:53,660
*laughter*

899
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,660
Oh, that's my least favorite feature!

900
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,660
*laughter*

901
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:02,560
And you'll probably be livid that it can fly with a helicopter rotor.

902
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,700
You have to be kidding me. Wait, is it sold separately or did I get it too?

903
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:07,700
And you're gonna hate the fact that-

904
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:10,040
You're gonna hate this tri-phibian car with batteries included.

905
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,700
Yeah, and you're gonna hate-

906
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,600
You're gonna hate that it's got a picture of Thanos on it.

907
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,700
you're gonna hate that the house

908
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:17,420

910
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:25,620

911
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,460
safety channel as intended

912
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,780

I'll play it once and throw it into the fireplace to show it how much I love it.

925
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,100
Canadians make terrible music, someone says.

926
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,100
That ain't true.

927
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:01,780
I prefer dubstep anyway.

928
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,780
That's what someone says.

929
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,780
Yeah.

930
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,780
Facts.

Scary sprites and freakier sprites.

934
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:16,380
Yeah, scary sprites and sprites with evil red eyes. That's a really scary song.

935
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:22,380
Mostly the title. The drop is crazy. The part when it goes,

936
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:27,260
the part, the part when it, when it goes like this, right before it gets really loud.

937
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:35,820
That part's, that's my favorite part. When it goes, the part right after the

938
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:40,940
but before the wow where it goes the best part

939
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,420
yeah that's what it's like this

940
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:47,420

941
00:52:47,420 --> 00:52:51,820

wall bullshit dubstep should just be the part where it's like

944
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:03,260
oh yeah i like the beginning when it's are you waiting for for cinema

945
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,780
that parts that's the best part of the song my favorite part of dj

946
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:12,700
sets is when my favorite song gets quieter. Yeah, and then my second favorite song. And

947
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:19,340
then it sounds like a like Bowser's making a noise. Yeah. I love DJs, but I hate that

948
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:27,420
scratching. Yeah, knock it off with that scratching. You're ruining the disc. I didn't buy this,

949
00:53:27,420 --> 00:53:31,100
I didn't come here to listen to my favorite songs be scratched and disrespected. That's

950
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:37,740
I came here to, here's what honestly the perfect DJ literally walks up to the

951
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:44,080
computer a MacBook Pro that has the rap caviar playlist from Spotify loaded on it

952
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,420
and you know what he does he presses spacebar and he plays it all the way

953
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,920
through because you know that rap caviar shit gives me more, that rap caviar shit

954
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:57,220
fire as hell, it gets me more turnt than anything. That's right hey DJs if you

955
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,220
You better stop scratching.

956
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:04,100
If I wanted to hear, if I wanted to hear wiki wiki wiki, I'd read out my Google Chrome tabs

957
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,100
at 3am.

958
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,100
Am I right guys?

Holy shit.

963
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,980
Would that roast a DJ if I told that to him?

964
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:17,540
Hey DJs, if I wanted to hear Scratch, I would, I would uh.

It's true though.

1083
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:49,140
