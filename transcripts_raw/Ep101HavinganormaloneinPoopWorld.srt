Patrick haunts Improv Boston like the Phantom of the Opera and he lives

58
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:10,860
he lives in the in the rafters of the drop ceiling. I jump out during the nude

60
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,880
middle of the nude show. Do you guys know anybody who did the nude show?

61
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:25,020
I don't think so. I probably know someone who did the nude show.

62
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,340
I guess if you do it you don't walk around talking about it all the time.

63
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,100
yeah Patrick says Patrick Patrick when you asked that Patrick pulled out his

64
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,460
little notebook where he listed every single person who has ever done the nude

65
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,020
show with links to their Facebook profiles you know what none of these

66
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,780
names are bringing any bells just so does everybody sit in the crowd of that

67
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,420

69
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,580

00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,220
foreigners want to see how our Joe yeah I mean if you're if you're like if you're

71
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,020
touring from Japan they don't have genitals there they just have like

72
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:13,260
pixels true they want to see real in there yeah they want to see what it what

73
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:16,020
it what a penis actually looks like yeah no it's something we're like as soon as

74
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:22,660
you cross the border of Japan into what's next as you paint the ocean you

75
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,740
- You, your penis unblurs.

76
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,000
- Yeah.

77
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,620
- Yeah, it's kind of the curse.

78
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,860
- That's what 5G is.

79
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,820
That's what they're trying to bring over here.

80
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,660
- Yeah.

81
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,260
- With all those cell phone towers.

82
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,120
It broadcasts pixels onto sex.

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,000
- Exactly.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,140
Yeah, they're trying to do that here in America.

85
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,140
Japan's been 5G'd up for, oh, I don't know, 100 years.

86
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,020
- Well, 5G stands for--

87
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,980
- Since the Bakugan era of Japan.

88
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,420
5G stands for five Japanese guys invented this.

89
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,740
It originated there.

90
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,220
- They just needed a short acronym for it.

91
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,060
- They're always so--

92
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,140
- So it can fit in the corner of your phone.

93
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:02,980
- Yeah.

94
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:03,860
(laughing)

95
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,260
- So yeah, it shows you where--

96
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,660
- If you have a logger, if you use it on an iPad,

97
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,900
it says the whole thing.

98
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:14,100
Like if your iPad is connected to 5G, it says that.

99
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,540
- Yeah, if you hold it horizontally.

100
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,380
- Yeah.

101
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:22,260
And you have screen orientation unlocked.

102
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,080
Then it'll spell out, "Five Japanese guys made this."

103
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,980
But every G just is how many Japanese guys made that specific technology.

104
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:30,980
Exactly.

105
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:35,980
So that's why sometimes you'll be in places where it's like, you know, 3G, three Japanese

106
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,460
guys, 4G, four Japanese guys.

107
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:43,380
If it just says E, that means every Japanese guy.

108
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,580
It's pretty impressive technology.

109
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:51,140
My phone doesn't have 5G yet, so I think I'm good.

110
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,500
If my phone has 5G, I'm moving into a cave.

111
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,300
My phone doesn't have 5G, but my camera...

112
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,300
I don't...

113
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,300
You have like an iPhone 5, right?

114
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,300
I'm a 5G...

115
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,420
I have an iPhone SE, I think.

116
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,420
Ah.

117
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,420
Um...

118
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,420
Sex-e-fender.

119
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,420
Sex-e-fender.

120
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,420
Sex-e-fender.

121
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,420
No.

122
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,420
That's what the SE stands for.

123
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,420
Yeah, it does.

124
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,420
No.

125
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,420
Yeah.

126
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,420
Super excited...

127
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,420
To be a sex-e-fender.

128
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,420
To be a sex-e-fender.

129
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,420
No, it's...

130
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:21,260
Again, if you put your phone in portrait mode, it will say that.

131
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,340
You've just never used your phone in landscape mode.

132
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,300
You've never used your phone in landscape mode.

133
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,020
Seriously evil is what your stands for.

134
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:30,300
Because of your sex offender nature.

135
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,660
Seriously bad meets evil.

136
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,300
Yeah, seriously Roysta59 and Eminem.

137
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,100
Just doing absolutely nonsense Taco Bell raps to each other.

138
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:43,700
I forgot bad meets evil existed until like two weeks ago.

139
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,780
And then sick you remember fucking lighters. I forgot. Yeah, I thought it's funny just a Bruno Mars song

140
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:57,460
No, I do that whole album is like lighters and then 30 songs where Eminem's like I killed a gay man and Royce was there, too

141
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:01,060
I fucked his ass and Royce ate his poo and Royce is like

142
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,580
Yeah

143
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,940
I was there with Eminem and we both fucked the guy and then you skip the lighters and it's like

144
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:10,100
You have to a man should wear a dress. I

145
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,580
Haven't listened that song

146
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:17,580
You didn't listen to Lighters. I just know the Bruno Mars part.

147
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:21,580
Yeah. Yeah, me too. I only know the Bruno Mars part.

148
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,580
I don't know any of the parts. What did fucking Royce Defy

149
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:29,580
he has some really bad like name. Everything is auto

150
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,580
tuned. Oh, that's his whole thing. Yeah, it was like T-Pain's

151
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,580
a bitch. Yeah. And yeah, all of his. T-Pain I think

152
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:41,580
is a much more talented person. That's one of the best eras

153
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:50,380
eras of rap is like from 2006 to like 2013 where just every guy like Nas or like Royce

154
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:55,540
Da 5'9" or like Black Thought all had songs that were like, like rap is dead.

155
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:57,540
Yeah, because of autotune.

156
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:01,180
Yeah, rap is dead because I sold 56 albums in a year.

157
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,180
Yeah.

158
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,180
So it must be dead.

159
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:07,420
Rap is dead because Kanye wanted to sound like a robot and now fucking everyone wants

160
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,420
to sound like a goddamn robot.

161
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:12,420
- Fucked a bald girl and just ruined rap.

162
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,980
Rap used to be about girls with long hair

163
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:17,260
and having sex with as many long haired girls

164
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,100
as you possibly can.

165
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,740
- And it used to be about going down to the soda fountain.

166
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,380
- Rap used to be about hanging out with your friends.

167
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,180

Oh, yeah, baby. So he ejected a fan from the audience and then everyone was mad at him on Twitter

187
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,320
And ejected the fan. Yeah, he ejected on the fan. That was the problem

188
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:15,440
After he receives criticism from fans he apologized in a video where he was crying

189
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,440
Fucking bitch dude, you know rapper should ever cry. Yeah

190
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:30,280

00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:45,320
Nice, dude, that's so sick nerd nerd core fans walk around in the hood and call it the scary maze game

00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:55,740
Did you guys ever did you guys think growing up that 50 cent got shot 50 times no no no

195
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:03,040
That's why I was always told I didn't know he got shot 50 times and that's what they call him 50 cent

196
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,380
Yeah, no, they call him that because his name is his real name is Michael quarters

197
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,900
His name is Michael two-quarters. That's a

198
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,620
Christian name. Yeah

199
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,580
Yeah

200
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,660
Why do they call him 50 cent?

201
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,500
Because he's because he used to sell all his albums for 50 cents

202
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:29,960
And then I was just a price tag that people put over his actual rap name, which is his first name was parental advisory

203
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:36,260
But then that was taken that was a nerdcore rapper, yeah

Let's give you just right

225
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,280
Pat was trying to just say 50 cent and he ended up talking about Pokemon

226
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,340
He has a lot on his brain the

227
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:56,260
Best buy is refusing to give him his computer because they found some questionable stuff on the hard drive. No

228
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,060
Yeah, that's what happened. It was tough results tiger direct and they

Change you admit the rest of it. No, they changed the price is what change the price to scrub his hard drive. Yeah

00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:09,420
Yeah, true. Yeah

231
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:15,900
He bought the incriminating video starter pack to add onto the hard drive to get it shipped

232
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,620
to him with illegal videos already on it.

233
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,180
I have too much head space.

234
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,180
Oh yeah, I bought...

235
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:29,580
Too much head space.

236
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,700
Pat bought Pete Townsend's computer on eBay as like a collector's item.

237
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,980
I'm such a big fan of the Who I Wanted to See.

238
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:39,780
I wanted all of the synthesizer tracks.

239
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,700
I wanted, he wanted to see what Pete Townsend saw.

240
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,580
No, you don't understand.

241
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,980
I'm just doing research on his research, okay?

242
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,580
I'm trying to figure out what he was researching.

243
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,380
I'm researching Pete Townsend.

244
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:57,260
But yeah, 50 Cent declared bankruptcy on July 13th

245
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,180
and I thought it was July, but it's June.

246
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,900
When did he declare bankruptcy?

247
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,340
July 13th.

248
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,260
Of last year?

249
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,380
2011.

250
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,260
Oh, damn.

251
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,100
I was gonna say--

252
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,140
He's like the richest guy ever,

253
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,940
'Cause he was like, didn't he start vitamin water or some shit?

254
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,720
- No, he had a vitamin water flavor.

255
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,500
- What did it taste like?

256
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,620
- It was a, oh fuck.

257
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,240
Yeah, I think it was like a grape flavor.

258
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,460
- It was just grape?

259
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,820
It didn't even do something fun?

260
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,820
- Formula 50, it was called Formula 50

261
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,660
and it was my favorite vitamin water flavor

262
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,500
when I was in the third grade.

263
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,860
- The flavor was blood on the sand.

264
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:35,140
- Yeah, it was the flavor was sand.

265
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,260
- Dude, I forgot about that game.

266
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,260
Yeah.

267
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:41,500
Where 50 cent, is that, doesn't 50 cent, I haven't played it.

268
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Yeah, he's just great.

269
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,820
He like solves, he like solves the Iraq war.

270
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,620
I don't know.

271
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,600
That's the one I think where there's a button you can press and he swears when you press

272
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,600
the button.

273
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Fuck.

274
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,600
Pretty cool, exactly.

275
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,600
I like that.

276
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,600
That's exactly what he would do.

277
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,700
I like the idea of like, George Bush was like, we think they have weapons of mass destruction.

278
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,380
Send in 50 cent.

279
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,860
He's been shot 50 times, he's invincible.

280
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Yeah.

281
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,180
You can still get, I thought they discontinued Formula 50.

282
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:15,460
But no, you can still purchase Formula 50 on Instacart.

283
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,620
All right, let's get it.

284
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,940
Let's get, yeah, we'll get a pallet of Formula 50.

285
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,460
You wanna split a pack?

286
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,300
Yeah.

287
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,120
Why not?

288
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,520
Speaking of 50 Cent, who raps like he's from another planet,

289
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,780

290
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,340
Yeah.

00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,180
Or speaking, sorry, speaking of 50 Cent--

292
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,140
Like Martians versus goblins.

293
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,500
- Yeah, speaking of 50 Cent, who's a rapper,

294

296
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:48,140
and he'd be from another planet.

300
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,700
- No, no, no, I'm saying, but we don't do that,

301
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,540

321
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,420

322
00:20:57,420 --> 00:21:00,660
of a line and a penis. Yeah, dude. It's two dimensional. I thought that was just like

323

a nickname. Nah, his name's Linus. What a crazy name. His name is Linus Tech Tips? Mm-hmm.

00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,460
No, no, he has like those,

327
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,100
he has like those, they're not like plugs,

328
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,300
they're those like, like the starter earrings

329
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,740
for when you like stretch your ears.

330
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,560
He has those and they'll like--

331
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,100
That's what I was thinking of.

332
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,700
The little like-- That's kind of a gauge.

333
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
The things they put in bulls' noses.

334
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Uh-huh, a ring?

335
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,300
Why do they do that?

336
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,140
No, not a ring.

337
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,100
People are cruel to animals.

338
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,420
True.

339
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,460
Yeah.

340
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:42,080
That's what they, it's like animal testing,

341
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,240
but they tested earrings on bulls.

342
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,840
Like they test shampoo on Patrick.

343
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,480
- They test septum rings on 16 year old girls with tumblers.

344
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,460
- Yeah, for bulls. - And that's how

345
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,720
they get them onto the bulls.

346
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,620
- Yeah. - Yeah.

347
00:21:55,620 --> 00:22:00,600
Top 10 best plans from the top 10s by Freddy Godzilla.

348
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,600
- That's a cool last name, that's a great last name.

349
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,440
- That's a good rap name.

350
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
- Freddy Godzilla.

351
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,240
- Freddy Godzilla, dude.

352
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,080
- That'd be a good--

353
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,240
- On his, so he lives in New York.

354
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
He says, "My favorite sport is football.

355
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,320
"My favorite food is meat, lol."

356
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,200
(laughing)

357
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,520
So we have a, this might be,

358
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,240
he might have been under the influence of meat

359
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,440
when he wrote this, so keep that in mind.

360
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,200
He might have, we might have some meat brain

361
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,960
kind of bleeding through this list.

362
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,000
- Number one best planet is Earth.

363
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,960
- Can't go wrong here, I'm gonna say that,

364
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,520
first and foremost, can't go wrong with Earth.

365
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,600
- Some other people disagree.

366
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,920
Someone says, "Earth is the most stupidest planet

367
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:46,040
in the world because of humans. There's a comment here that says, "I love the earth. I love

368
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:49,880
the nature. The earth, how the leaves turn into a different color. I have a thing for

369
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:54,240
tree, how they grow. It's all about nature." And that's a comment by Smooth Criminal.

370
00:22:54,240 --> 00:23:01,400
I got a thing for tree too. Oh! That's why earth is number one, dude.

371
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,800
Because you can smoke weed on earth. Because you can smoke weed on earth and you can grow

372
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,240
grow hydroponics in your closet, even if you live at home.

373
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,160
You can grow Dro on Earth because it's the planet with the water.

374
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:15,320
You can grow Dro for show on Earth.

375
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,960
You know, that's why it's number one.

376
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,120
That's why they call Earth the hydro planet.

377
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,040
Yeah, that's why they call Earth the ganja planet.

378
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,040
Ganja.

379
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,520
Ganja planet.

380
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,720
Somebody's calling out this list and says, "Ha, only because we live here.

381
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,040
I bet if we all lived on Mars, then Mars would be number one."

382
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:40,560
Yeah, obviously. No, it would be Earth. No, it wouldn't, dude. Everything's red, dude. Yeah, that sucks. That sucks.

383
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:44,740
Imagine you walk out, like you wake up, you make an egg,

384
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:48,480
you crack your- And it's red. Yeah, red egg.

385
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:53,740
Yeah, you press fucking start on your coffee maker, red coffee.

386
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,200
You go to fuck your wife's ass, red ass and wife.

387
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,480
sucks dude

388
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,420
i live in a really always in travel around the third planet it has clouds

389
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:09,680
plants caves homes and other earth stuff i kind of like earth that way

390
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,720
that sounds like an alien to me

391
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,460
the road down on a canal i bet mars has read weed

392
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,600
there are a lot of it

393
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,780
they'll not only is like for weeds

394
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,900
yeah which gives you

395
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,400
to newt g mario pat

396
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,120
that's a little higher flared in mars and the fire for her

397
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,460
her yet

398
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,820
You can smoke red weed and get into a raccoon suit.

399
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:34,900
Mars has the fire flower and Earth has the higher flower.

400
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
Hell yeah.

401
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,340
You know what I'm saying?

402
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,340
That's facts.

403
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,560
And that's facts.

404
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,560
And that's just facts.

405
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,560
Yeah.

406
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,140
That's basically, we're in the cipher right now.

407
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
Number two is Saturn.

408
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:49,260
Saturn has rings around, I guess that's pretty cool.

409
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,740
But also, it's actually-

410
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,660
I think Jupiter's cooler than Saturn.

411
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,260
That would be my number two.

412
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,900
Saturn is married.

413
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,520
of the ring. Mm-hmm. That's pretty good. Saturn, I think, I think they're only

414
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,920
picking it because it's got those rings. Saturn is what you draw when you're

415
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:12,960
asked to draw a planet. Yeah. Not me. I would draw a Shoop-De-Whoop. If somebody

416
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,480
wanted me to draw a planet or anything, I would just draw it. I could do the best

417
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,820
Shoop-De-Whoop in class. Draw it right now. Okay, I'll draw it. I had like a, no, I just

418
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:25,880
grabbed it. That's not a pen. That's a vape pen. That's a vape pen. That is a blue

419
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,920
waffle easy it's not a blue waffle that's what you have in your no I don't

420
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,200

421
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,120

422
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,920
for my penis and oh you know I never you know I could never go into a baby gap

423
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,920
and try on the clothes they have yeah because you're you know you're of a

424
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:53,320
restraining order from being in the big and tall baby clothes.

425
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
Yeah they do.

426
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Pat goes to Oshkosh.

427
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,680
Just like a 6 foot tall baby.

428
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,000
Yeah baby gap big and tall.

429
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:10,560
Baby gap, baby, casual baby XL.

430
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,200
Big babies warehouse.

431
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Yeah.

432
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Fuckin' there's only like two big and tall stores, huh?

433
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,200
I think there should only be two big and tall guys.

434
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,200
Yeah. I think we need to eradicate the big and tall population. Me and my big dad.

435
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Yeah, me and my huge dad. Yeah.

436
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,200
Top comment on Saturn is "Good luck living on this planet because it is just

437
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,200
a giant crystal ice storm."

438
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,200
I could live there. And my heart is cold as ice.

439
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,200
I would survive probably. I think you could drop me on any planet and I would survive.

440
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,560
I think if I if they were gonna execute me I'd request

441
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,480
getting sent to a planet. I would like to be killed like

442
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:58,000
like the cat at the beginning of the Simpsons movie.

443
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,820
I don't remember if he's itchy or scratchy, but the one who gets sent to the moon and then filled up with nukes.

444
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:06,540
Hmm. That's how I want to die. Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:12,500
I think I want to I want to get sent to like to Venus and then they just kind of drop me into space

446
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,900
So then I freeze and then I hit all the hot gas and Patrick wants to be he misspoke there

447
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,900
He said you meant that he wants to be sent to

448
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,100
Penis, yeah, he wants to shrink down like fantastic journey and go into a man's

449
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,940
Like the magic school bus and climb into a penis you're thinking of Ant-Man

450
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:36,820
Yeah, he wants to go into Ant-Man's penis. You're right. I'm sorry. Yeah, we were thinking of a man's feet

451
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:41,620
Yeah, he wants to he wants to he wants to crawl up inside Paul Rudd. He wants to make all my

452
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,220
Yeah

00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:57,420
What if Patrick's name was penis Pete with penis balls?

00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Wouldn't that be pretty funny? What if Caleb's name was

Fucking bitch. No, I don't think

00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,420
No

00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:11,860
Nobody would name me that somebody would name you penis ball sack because your name is the thing you love the most and the thing you

473
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,900
I beat the fuck out of him

474
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,620
I would try to but then I wouldn't be able to because I'd be laughing so hard

475
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:13,820
He would use his special ability, which is a joke. Yeah, he's a special ability, which is being dumb as hell. Yeah

476
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:19,620
He would probably try and fire me for being the only good employee if I worked at the office. Oh my god

477
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:26,100
I'd be so pissed off all day for him as a fool's errand being an absolute nightmare working for Michael Scott, dude

478
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:33,100
He'd always be making you, he's always saying like just weird shit about your body.

479
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,980
He's always commenting on your body.

480
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,340
He's trying to harass you.

481
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,860
Yeah, he's always locking the door.

482
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:46,620
There's one comment on Saturn that says, "Earth is so overrated, real men live on Saturn."

483
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,780
And there's another comment that says, "Not a single lady."

484
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,780
(laughter)

485
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,780
Saturn is the planet for men.

486
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,780
It's a dude's pierced.

487
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:58,780
You just fucking show up.

488
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,780
No, they want you to think that there's a crystal ice storm on Saturn.

489
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Because that's where the men are sent to.

490
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,780
Because women get so cold all the time.

491
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,780
They're always wanting blankets and asking you to turn the AC down.

492
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Someone says, "No, this shouldn't be number two. It shouldn't even be on this list.

493
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,780
Nor should Earth be first. I know what should be first, though.

494
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:36,780
first

495
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:41,460
on water has the most interesting ring and is beautiful. My favorite planet since

496
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:47,280
young, although I live on earth and please continue to vote for Saturn.

497
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:57,280
Although I live on earth, I respect Saturn and I hope to move there one day.

498
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:03,280
I hope soon in the future I can live on one of Saturn's many rings.

499
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,680
Saturn is actually Latin for Satan.

500
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Yeah.

501
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:15,200
It's actually short for Saturnicus, who was the demon god of buttfucking.

502
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:18,680
Yeah, and he was Patrick.

503
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
No.

504
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,680
Yeah, he was.

505
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Yeah, I'm thinking he was.

506
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,680
Yeah, he actually was.

507
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,240
I'm looking at the, I just got the results in.

508
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,800
Saturn actually was named after Saturday, which is the day they play cartoons on TV,

509
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,920
so I actually think I am going to go live there.

510
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,920
Oh that's true.

511
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,960
Imagine a planet full of cartoons.

512
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,560
Imagine a planet made out of cartoons.

513
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Who framed Roger Rabbit?

514
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Planet dude.

515
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Planet.

516
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Planet crazy.

517
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Planet Toon.

518
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Yeah.

519
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
Toon World.

520
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Oh my god.

521
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Toon World.

522
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Oh my god Toon World.

523
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,560
From Yu-Gi-Oh.

524
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Uh huh.

525
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
We need to get, what's his name, Elon.

526
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,920
We need to get him on Toon World.

527
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,920
Yeah, we need, I think that.

528
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,200
He'd probably love it.

529
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,480
He'd probably love it because he could meet Rick and Morty.

530
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,960
True.

531
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,640
He would, dude if we convince him, we could get him to get us to Toon World.

532
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,640
We could trap Elon Musk in Toon World.

533
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Yeah.

534
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:13,920
We could trap him in the Millennium Puzzle from Yu-Gi-Oh.

535
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,680
Hold on, this is kind of a weird thing.

536
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,040
Have you heard his baby's name?

537
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,040
His baby?

538
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,520
Oh my god, he gave birth to a cartoon.

539
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,280
His baby has a cartoon name.

540
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,620
Holy crap.

541
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:39,840
His baby is Spongebob's, Spongebob, his baby has a Spongebob-like quality to him.

542
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,840
Yeah.

543
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,620
Because it has a soft spot that you can poke.

544
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,620
Exactly, yeah.

545
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,940
Every baby is part Spongebob, just on like a one inch diameter.

546
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,140
You grow out of it.

547
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:52,500
You grow out, eventually you lose the Spongebob nature.

548
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:56,900
Spongebob, somebody dared, Stephen Hillenburg dared to ask the question, what if a baby

549
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:59,460
was all soft spot?

550
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,460
And he came up with Spongebob Squarepants.

551
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,460
Yeah.

552
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,460
Yeah.

553
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,460
The gay fry cook.

554
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,460
Exactly.

555
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,900
One of the most inspiring characters of our generation.

556
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,900
That's true.

557
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,900
Number two was Patrick.

558
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,660
Yeah, who is a baby with a job.

559
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,660
Yeah.

560
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:23,020
What if you could combine the job of an adult with the powers of a baby?

561
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,860
Of being stupid.

562
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,900
And pink and wearing only pants and no shirt.

563
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,020
Only pants.

564
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:37,940
pants yeah subscription box service that's yeah it's like blue apron just be

565
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:42,280
blue pants they send you they send you just thread and needle and you have to

566
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:49,300
make your own yeah very vague instructions you how to make jeans yeah

567
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,140
and then you finish it and it's like oh fuck I just got it I'm attacked by a fly

568
00:33:54,140 --> 00:34:00,580
I'm attacked by a fly. Sorry, there's been a fly. This is like that it's like that

569
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:04,820
Breaking Bad episode where there's like a fly in the lab. I've been a fly has been

570
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,340
circling my head like. It thinks your head is a big egg. It thinks it's

571
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:16,180
it's a bird and I just got hit in the head in a cartoon and I'm dazed and

572
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:21,100
there's he's flying around my head as I loopily cross my eyes. It's pretty stupid.

573
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,260
But then every once in a while he bites the back of my head.

574
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,780
The fly's been biting you?

575
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,780
Yeah.

576
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,740
I think he's trying to feed on you.

577
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,220
He's trying to communicate with me in Morse code.

578
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,160
I think that might be Count Dracula.

579
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
I don't think so.

580
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,780
I think that might be Little Count Dracula.

581
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,180
Imagine if Dracula turned into a fly.

582
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:46,860
That's a really small Count Dracula turns into a fly.

583
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Number three is Neptune.

584
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:54,260
Yeah, I know it looks cool, but it's just a ball of gas, so there's nothing to do, but

585
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
look at it.

586
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,500
If you go on it, you die.

587
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,620
It is just a gas storm with no solid surface.

588
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:04,300
Yeah, I mean, let's build like a dream planet, like as far as attributes.

589
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,980
Alright, so first thing, water.

590
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Square.

591
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,860
Water, no, Gatorade.

592
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
Square shape.

593
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:11,860
Okay.

594
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,660
Gatorade run, Gatorade ocean.

595
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,900
What flavor Gatorade?

596
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,900
Wait, okay.

597
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:16,900
Glacier cherry?

598
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,660
Glacier cherry Gatorade oceans.

599
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Okay, but then also the oceans are populated with Swedish fish.

600
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,180
Yes.

601
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,940
And the ground is chocolate ground.

602
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,940
And then if you dig in, gummy worms.

603
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,820
Yeah.

604
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,900
Yeah, and also the monkeys on the planet

605
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,460
are made out of gumballs.

606
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,220
And gummy bears are real, and you can actually--

607
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,700
Gummy bears are life-size terrifying bears.

608
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,860
That kill you and you can't eat them.

609
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,700
And also you have a--

610
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,300
And they're filled with meat.

611
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,140
Yeah.

612
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,020
They're gummy bears on the outside, so it looks like a gummy bear, but when you kill it

613
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:56,540
It's like killing a regular bear, and you get a scarab gun from Halo 2

614
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:01,060
Yeah, yeah, and there's a bunch of money on there that they they hate it

615
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,340
They hate money, and they just can't stop giving it to you, but they also have stores where they accept money

616
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,940
But then again they give it back. They have yeah, they have uh

617
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,020
What's that they have a concept store there so you can get cool shoes

618
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:19,580
Yeah, they have a GameStop. They have GameStop on GameStop concepts.

619
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:26,440
And there's an EB games. Every tree has a giant TV screen on it and you can controllers attached to it

620
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,440
and you can play games on the tree.

621
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:31,300
It's like when you went to a motel in

622
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:35,340
2001 and they had a 64 TV. Oh my god.

623
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:40,700
It's like that but the games are free. Yeah, you don't have to rent the games.

624
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:45,100
They also have school there, and you might be like,

625
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,300
"Oh, fuck school," but it's eight hours of recess.

626
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,220
Oh my God.

627
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,300
Eight straight hours.

628
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,500
That's kind of like a trade school.

629
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,140
And the play structure has a real spaceship in it.

630
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,260
Yeah, you can go back to Earth whenever you want.

631
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,460
Yeah, and the teacher has to be your girlfriend

632
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,940
if you ask her.

633
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,940
So if you get a hot teacher, that's a fucking bullseye win.

634
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:10,540
And the teacher is not mistrunchable.

635
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,940
- No, the teacher's mislunchable,

636
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,020
'cause you're gonna eat her up.

637
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:16,460
- They don't, they have no,

638
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
they have no mistrunchable there,

639
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,220
and they have no chokie.

640
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:23,440
- And also bread, bread has no crust on it.

641
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,260
So you don't even have to cut it off.

642
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,740
- All bread is uncrustables.

643
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,500
- Bread is made out of the stuff that they--

644
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,460
- Which is kind of a problem,

645
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,740
which is kind of a problem that it's all uncrustables,

646
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:37,060
because if you wanna make like a meatball sub,

647
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,020
you're gonna have some peanut butter and jelly in there.

648
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:42,900
- If it's all Uncrustables, none of it is.

649
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,660
Think about that for a minute.

650
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:46,980
- Who crusts the Uncrustables?

651
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,620
(laughing)

652
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,300
Who will crust the Uncrustables?

653
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,220
Fair question.

654
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,100
- Yeah.

655
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,140
- Neptune, this is another SpongeBob planet.

656
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,740
He's the king of the world in SpongeBob.

657
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,340
He's basically God in SpongeBob.

658
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,460
But he never meddles in earthly affairs.

659
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,300
He only really cares about the Krusty Krab.

660
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,660
- Yeah, why?

661
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:09,500
How can you be a god and love burgers so much?

662
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,820
That's a really good question.

663
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,780
Comment on Neptune that's in all caps

664
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,940
that says, "Beautiful, we need to live here."

665
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,260
Damn, facts.

666
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,300
We need to live here.

667
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,140
Damn.

668
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,420
Someone says, "It's blue, it's got water."

669
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:25,500
Need I say more?

670
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:28,460
She is my favorite planet.

671
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:30,460
She's beautiful and cool and have ring.

672
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,060
I love it.

673
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,620
Why is everything a girl?

674
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:36,300
Why are ships girls, planets are girls?

675
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,140
And girls are girls.

676
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,140
Cameron's a girl.

677
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,980
No.

678
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,900
Yeah, Cameron's a girl, Patrick's a girl,

679
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,060
I'm a boy. Caleb's a girl.

680
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,900
No, I'm a boy.

681
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:43,820
Caleb's a girl.

682
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:45,040
I'm not. Caleb's a girl.

683
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,020
No, I should not have even brought this up

684
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,820
'cause it is two against one, two girls versus one boy.

685
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:52,420
No.

686
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,240
Yeah, you guys probably think--

687
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,080
You're one cup.

688
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,500
You guys probably think Jupiter's number one

689
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,220
because you go there to get more stupider.

690
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,060
Mm-mm.

691
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,540
Yeah, me, I actually went to a little planet called college

00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,380
and i got uh... i got more knowledge

693
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,980
and h_p_d_

694
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,160
so

695
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,260
who won here

696
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,880
yeah and a college it was only boys and you got a speedy there are no

697
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,900
yet do because the lunch lady at it and she put it in a house of lunch it was a

698
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,340
lunch gentleman

699
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,220
now yeah

700
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,020
there was a lot more did

701
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,460
uh...

702
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:28,980
it was love it was lunch jeffrey who is what is the lunch lordia

703
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,720
it was lunch larry

704
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,240
what's already

705
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,900
number four is mars

706
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,480
i'm surprised is number two did

707
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,440
uh... jack the top ten guy five

708
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,020
which is really good user

709
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:50,240
as uh... says i've heard that there will be life on mars will

710
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:55,420
i think that's not what mars is going to be uh... higher up on this list

711
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,680
Mars low-key fell off, dude.

712
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,520
Yeah, Mars is kinda slipping.

713
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,080
Mars used to be a lot of people's number,

714
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,980
Mars used to be a lot of people's goat.

715
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:03,460
Uh-huh. Yeah.

716
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:06,700
Somebody's listing the benefits of Mars here,

717
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:10,460
and they say, "God of War, candy bar, red."

718
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,860
Someone says, "Red like the Soviet Union."

719
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,700
That's what I'm talking about.

720
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,580
We know who said that, that was Rob Rousseau.

721
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,420
This guy.

722
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,100
That was a Rob Rousseau comment right there.

723
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,980
Mars is, yeah, Rob Rousseau's perfect planet.

724
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:30,180
It's populated by by communist girls who turn 18 tomorrow forever.

725
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:38,660
Yeah dude the years they are worth or the same length as 100 earth years so

726
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:44,980
uh girls can be barely legal. Only once you turn 17 and 364 days old. Exactly.

727
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:48,580
Yeah so it's just him like it's just him watching them and biting his knuckle.

728
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:57,940
Man that video is fucking weird. All every video he's made is so weird. Yeah. Let's get him on.

729
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:02,660
All right he probably will come on now. He's probably my best friend. He actually is my

730
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,420
best friend. He's actually one of his friend uh what's that other guy who uh. Oh Joshua for

731
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:14,900
Congress the other TikTok guy. Oh that dude yeah. No what's the what's the there's a guy who was

732
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:22,340
like one of those guys who was super into Warren. Sean McIlwain? Is it that guy?

733
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,060
Yeah, we're gonna get him on too. We're gonna have him and Rob Russo. We're gonna challenge

734
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:34,500
him to a finger off. He's better at fingering me. He's better at fingering? Yeah. I'm gonna dress up

735
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:43,300
like an anime girl and I'm gonna say, "You guys need to seize the means of reproduction."

736
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,740
And so who can finger my asshole better?

737
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,780
(laughing)

738
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,300
- 'Cause you reproduce with your ass.

739
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,580
- Yeah, I do.

740
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,740
It's actually an ability I learned in college

741
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,820
while you were on Jupiter.

742
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,660
- You lay a brown poop egg.

743
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,860
- I lay a brown poop egg.

744
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,500
- And a goblin hatches out of it.

745
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,340
- And then I crack it every morning for breakfast.

746
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,980
- Yeah, and the food is still perfectly preserved

747
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:07,820
inside of it.

748
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,020
(laughing)

749
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:14,020
You learned how to save some food from your stomach

750
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:19,020
and then poop it out untouched inside of a hollow orb.

751
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,980
- If Caleb just eats his poop like an egg all the time,

752
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,500
do you think it's gonna be like pee

753
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,580
where it's like you can drink pee once

754
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,420
but if you drink your pee again?

755
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,180
- You can eat poop forever.

756
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,020
- Oh, okay.

757
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,780
- 'Cause if you eat food, it turns into poop.

758
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,620
If you eat poop, it turns into food.

759
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,340
- I've never done it, so I wouldn't know.

760
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,860
- I'm a scientist, so I would know.

761
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:40,900
- Yeah, so I think Cameron knows by experience.

762
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:43,460
- No, I'm a scientist, I study things like this.

763
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,500
- What do you think poop tastes like?

764
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,860
- I would say probably brown and stinky.

765
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,460
- Yeah, I mean, like,

766
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,180
Munster cheese doesn't smell great all the time.

767
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,020
- Yeah.

768
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,580
(laughing)

769
00:42:56,580 --> 00:43:01,580
- Munster, Asiago, these are very strong scents,

770
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:04,620
but all extremely umami flavors.

771
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:05,460
- Exactly.

772
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,620
- You know, so it might be something where like you,

773
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:10,580
You take a little bite, it's exactly.

774
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,700
It has an overpowering smell.

775
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,020
I'm sprinkling MSG on poop just to see.

776
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,020
It's like durian.

777
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:21,340
It smells bad but it's perfectly edible.

778
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,500
It's actually a great vegan alternative.

779
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:26,660
It's a great, you can make some doggos out of it.

780
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,260
Exactly, yeah.

781
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:33,300
I don't know, I think we might, you know, we might solve something.

782
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,580
- Yeah, I think we should contact the Beyond Corporation.

783
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,420
'Cause I think Beyond Poop--

784
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,140
- Yeah, you know it's Beyond Meat.

785
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,980
Poop.

786
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,820
Poop and shit.

787
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,300
- Butthead.

788
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,140
- That's right.

789
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,260
It's not a bad idea.

790
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:52,240
- Just hot Italian poop.

791
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,060
Brat, poop bratwurst.

792
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:58,660
- Poop bratwurst, cooking a poop like a sausage

793
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:00,380
with like onions around it.

794
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,780
I feel like that's a good idea.

795
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:06,980
It's like a beyond vegan poop, but it's that thing where they have to spell the meat differently,

796
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,980
so it's called P-O-U-P.

797
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:16,540
Patrick's been eating poops like hot dogs for years.

798
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:21,580
He puts sour crap on it.

799
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:28,020
And ketchup, and poop ketchup, which is red poop.

800
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,020
You eat a poop.

801
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,020
And mustard.

802
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:34,560
You eat a poop kielbasa with a throw up sauerkraut

803
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,060
and you put pea mustard on it.

804
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:36,900
- No, dude.

805
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,420
- No, Patty's poop mousse. - Pat, you put mustard.

806
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,260
Mustard.

807
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,100
- Yeah, that's right.

808
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:42,980
- Yeah, I must turd on Caleb's food.

809
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:45,700
- And then eat it yourself 'cause you can't help yourself.

810
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,660
- No.

811
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:47,660
- He can't help it.

812
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,500
- Yeah.

813
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:49,340
- Yeah, no, he can help himself.

814
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,740
I have self-control.

815
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,780
- He pranks Caleb by putting a log of poop

816
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:56,140
into a hot dog bun and leaving it

817
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,300
right outside Caleb's door.

818
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:58,780
And then he turns around to leave

819
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,660
and then he turns back and he goes, "Oh, a hot dog!"

820
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,140
- Yeah, and then he sticks his hand in

821
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,980
and forgot that he put a bear trap there.

822
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:08,220
- And then he eats his hand, and then he eats his hand.

823
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,880
- I wiggle my fingers around and I go,

824
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,500
"Ooh, don't mind if I do!"

825
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:12,540
- Yeah.

826
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:13,380
- And then you slurp it down.

827
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:14,820
- It's not that funny when I make fun of myself.

828
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:17,480
- And then you slurp it down like a big, thick noodle.

829
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:21,180
And it rockets into the back of your throat and chokes you.

830
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:23,460
- You can never slurp a turd like a noodle, Cameron.

831
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:27,380
- Right now, Patrick and Cameron are lady in the tramping

832
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:33,500
being poop. Man we're going back to our roots today. Yeah. Talking about poop and shit.

833
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:37,780
Yeah just talking about eating crap. I was thinking about the ages of this

834
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,180
podcast. We went first it was all about eating poop and then it was all about

835
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:45,980
the Grinch. We did that for a very long time. And then it's about and then it was about

836
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:49,700
uncles and cousins and then it was about teachers and now we're going back to

837
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:56,020
start the cycle again. Yeah. And the Grinch is a through line there too I

838
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:02,020
I think yeah, because I said the Grinch was perfect for the holidays. It was the holiday seasons

839
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:07,500
Poop the Grinch and cousins and teachers in that order. Yeah, what's that? What's our next move?

840
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:10,020
Yeah, let's

841
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:16,160
There's actually a Rothschild style council that decides what all of our

842
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:23,340
Sessions are gonna be we get a letter in the mail at the beginning of every month that says okay this month you have to

843
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:25,340
talk all the time about

844
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:30,620
um drinking pee out of a straw that's going to be the new thing that you guys are going to talk about

845
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:36,060
that's going to be it yeah injecting pee intravenously mainlining urine all right i

846
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:40,700
guess that's it i guess it's p this time yeah what's the um what's what's that fucking that

847
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:47,340
jay-z verse where he's just like werewolf frankenstein monster it's just yeah it's just

848
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:54,780
that but it's just like the grinch uncle's cousins what are these things all have in common

849
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,780
Oh man, they're all fucking stupid.

850
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:02,460
That's a little jab at ourselves right there that I just did by saying we're fucking stupid.

851
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,460
Yeah, we like to be self-effacing.

852
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,100
We like to be a little meta here.

853
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,180
Actually, I like to be self-effacing.

854
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,580
Cameron and Patrick like to be self-cum-facing.

855
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:14,260
You like to be self-soy-facing when you see your crap on the ground and you go...

856
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,260
No, no, Patrick does.

857
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,260
And Patrick, you actually...

858
00:47:16,260 --> 00:47:17,260
You eat a poop.

859
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,260
No, you actually eat a poop.

860
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:19,260
You eat a poop.

861
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,260
No, man, you ate a poop.

862
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,260
You ate a poop.

863
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,260
You ate a poop.

864
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,260
You ate a poop.

865
00:47:23,260 --> 00:47:24,260
You ate a poop.

866
00:47:24,260 --> 00:47:25,420
- Oh man, you ate poop.

867
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,160
You ate poop for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

868
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,360
And fourth meal, like Taco Bell.

869
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,360
- Caleb.

870
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,540
- What?

871
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:32,380
- You.

872
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:35,660
- No, don't finish that sentence.

873
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:36,700
- You eat a poop.

874
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:37,540
- No.

875
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,360
- Yeah.

876
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,260
- No.

877
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,600
- Yeah, number five is Jupiter, more like poopeter,

878
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,440
the home of Caleb.

879
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,980
- Yeah, ooh!

880
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:45,480
- Yeah, Caleb lives on that.

881
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:49,140
Well, hey Caleb, I know what planet you live on.

882
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,660
- Yeah, number six, that's where you live, Uranus.

883
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,500
- I just said it.

884
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,460
- No, you didn't say the name of the planet,

885
00:47:55,460 --> 00:47:57,060
'cause you can't read that fast.

886
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,460
- I said that you live on your anus.

887
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,820
- No, you live on my anus.

888
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:03,140
- You live on my anus.

889
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:03,980
- You live on your anus.

890
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,400
- I really like the top comment on Jupiter,

891
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,180
really quick before we go straight into you guys' anuses.

892
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,860
The top comment on Jupiter is in all capitals says,

893
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:15,420
"This is freakin' giant, dude, LOL.

894
00:48:15,420 --> 00:48:17,060
"Love the planet Jupiter."

895
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,700
(laughing)

896
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:21,100
- Someone says, "It is just a ball of fart gas,

897
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:25,980
but it is sideways and it is basically Saturn's retarded inbred cousin.

898
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:26,480
Yeah.

899
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,980
That's about Caleb's anus.

900
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,480
No.

901
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,180
They're changing the name of the planet to Caleb's anus.

902
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,180
It's basically a ball of fart gas.

903
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:34,180
Yeah.

904
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:36,180
Yeah, it's basically just a ball of fart gas, but okay.

905
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:37,180
Yeah, basically.

906
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:44,180
Just doing a NASA press conference where they're like,

907
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,680
"You're releasing new discoveries from on the planet Uranus."

908
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:52,360
Yeah, basically it's just a ball of fart gas.

909
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:53,680
We did a check on it.

910
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,400
We actually did a check.

911
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,720
We smelled it.

912
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:58,120
We actually smelled it.

913
00:48:58,120 --> 00:49:01,880
It's like how radio waves take a very long time to travel.

914
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:04,920
Fart gas actually takes millions of years to reach Earth.

915
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,960
But now a wave of fart gas from Uranus is reaching Earth so we can identify it now.

916
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:16,920
The problem that we had before when we couldn't tell what the smell was, was we were all trying

917
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,000
We thought my friend Todd did it.

918
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,200
We were going off the knowledge that whoever smelt it dealt it and we couldn't figure out

919
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,520
just which planet it was coming from.

920
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:32,820
We were afraid to announce that Uranus was a ball of fart gas because we would get blamed

921
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:33,820
for it.

922
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,820
Exactly.

923
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:39,080
Yeah, I mean, and we had people here in NASA that we called crazy back in the day.

924
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:43,960
Like there's this guy, Warner Von Brown, who originally said that Uranus was probably a

925
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:48,680
a ball of fart gas, but we just didn't believe them for whatever reason.

926
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:55,240
And finally we figured it out, see, because radio waves take longer to travel, we finally

927
00:49:55,240 --> 00:49:57,160
got a signal that said doorknob.

928
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:58,840
Yeah, that's true.

929
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,560
Yeah, and we said safety pretty quick.

930
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,520
And you know, we're starting to use AI.

931
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:07,280
We used AI to say safety almost immediately.

932
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,440
Yeah, yeah.

933
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:12,000
And we have a new, it's called Operation Diaper Shit.

934
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,340
And basically we're going to get all the smartest white guys to figure out exactly where the

935
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,840
fart came from.

936
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:28,880
We have new infrared scanners in space that are tracking farts from Saturn.

937
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,220
And it looks like, I mean, we're looking at it through a thermal call of duty scope and

938
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:38,980
we see we see a white cloud that's obviously giving us some heat signatures

939
00:50:38,980 --> 00:50:44,720
and it's leading directly to a man named Patrick Dorn's asshole. It seems as if he

940
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:51,060
created from the time he was born millions of years ago a giant fart cloud

941
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:55,780
that grew a mind of its own and decided to move to space. He basically made a

942
00:50:55,780 --> 00:51:01,500
fart baby who grew up to be Uranus. There's a the second comment on Uranus

943
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:06,380
says it is beautiful and rains diamonds yet bullied the planet didn't get to

944
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:08,660
choose its name so quit bullying it.

945
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:12,820
Do you guys think it rains diamonds?

946
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:20,300
Somebody says it just that word that make me laugh.

947
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:25,500
And while we're on the topic here at NASA one thing that's been a huge a huge

948
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,100
problem in researching that planet is that it just that word that make me laugh

949
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:35,820
and we can't even think about it without laughing so hard so someone says

950
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:44,700
Uranus is named after a butt what the check

951
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,040
I only voted for this name that's okay now that's the strategy that's how we win

952
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,900
the next election okay we change Bernie Sanders name to Bernie butt and then

953
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:58,140
people are going to vote for him just because of the name.

954
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,140
That's how we win.

955
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,140
Penis ball sack.

956
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,140
Yeah.

957
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,020
Penis ball sack is running for president.

958
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,020
You don't even have to campaign.

959
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,140
People will just see the name on the ballot and go, "Okay.

960
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:09,420
Yeah, alright."

961
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:16,700
Even the most far right, even Cameron and Patrick, two of the most far right people I know, they

962
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:22,420
will be led to vote for penis ball sack.

963
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:24,820
I'm actually voting for Rocky De La Fuente.

964
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:25,820
No.

965
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:26,820
So.

966
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,820
Yeah.

967
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:28,820
Yeah, from the movie Rocky.

968
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,380
I'm actually voting, I'm writing in essential workers on the ballot, actually.

969
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,380
Yeah.

970
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:38,020
I'm actually donating my money through the ballot.

971
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,980
I'm putting a $5 bill on the ballot.

972
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:45,540
I'm just writing $100 on the ballot and I'm hoping it gets to someone who needs it.

973
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:49,260
I hope it gets to the end of the right hands.

974
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:50,260
Number seven is Venus.

975
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:55,300
penis. Which very close to, it could be penis. It could be. There's a comma here that says

976
00:52:55,300 --> 00:53:03,580
ugly and boring and common. There's a lot of penises. This is a dime a dozen planet,

977
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:11,300
dude. Hottest planet. They gotta make a planet named Pagina to finish the pattern. Uranus,

978
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:19,200
penis, and Pagina. My younger brother, my brother Levi, until he was like 16, thought that avocado

979
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,040
was called Abocado.

980
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,160
I think you said that before.

981
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:25,160
Have I?

982
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,160
Yeah, you did.

983
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,120
Sorry, I'm just thinking about it right now because I'm looking at him through the window.

984
00:53:30,120 --> 00:53:33,200
Yeah, flip him off for me because he just...

985
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,200
I just flipped him off.

986
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:36,400
He's tying a noose around his neck.

987
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,400
Oh, wow.

988
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:40,680
Yeah, and a smaller noose around his penis.

989
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,680
Damn.

990
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,680
Yeah.

991
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:43,680
Yeah.

992
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,480
Oh, now he's doing kind of a Cirque du Soleil act with the two robes.

993
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,720
Oh yeah, he's fine.

994
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:54,400
Number eight is Pluto, which could be Poopo.

995
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,800
It could be.

996
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,160
You could call your penis your Pluto if we're going off.

997
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,160
You could.

998
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,160
Yeah.

999
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,160
Yeah, that's a good point.

1000
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:09,480
Especially if you have gender reassignment surgery.

1001
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:18,900
comment on Pluto that says the only one named after a dog. That's not true. Yeah.

1002
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:24,540
My dog is named... My dog's name is Earth. That's what dogs say. They go "Earth, Earth."

1003
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:30,960
Oh my god. They know where they are, dude. That's what they've been saying the whole time. Oh my

1004
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:36,120
god. They've been trying to tell us. Yeah, and they don't realize we already know.

1005
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,120
We don't need to know.

1006
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,120
Yeah.

1007
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,280
Yeah, there's gonna be one dog that's like, "Wait a second, guys.

1008
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,120
I think I just saw, I just, they know that they're on Earth.

1009
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,400
We can say other stuff now."

1010
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,400
And then they're gonna be able to talk.

1011
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:52,060
Pluto's just really cool and it's black.

1012
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:55,800
It was also named after my second favorite Roman god.

1013
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:59,720
Yeah, Pluto from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.

1014
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:01,320
Yeah, that's your favorite Roman god.

1015
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:04,800
Yeah, that's your favorite Roman god, you fucking idiot.

1016
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,800
you know as a moving rock

1017
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,720
move fucking and harsh

1018
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:14,760
uh... this fly just landed on my eyeball

1019
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,680
system like a mccall

1020
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:21,800
the socks number i skip ahead to because that there are a lot of contenders on

1021
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,920
this one is thing is funny 'cause what i think the person who made the list

1022
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:28,960
freddie godzilla just like real like one sentence about every planet

1023
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,600
that like dislike all these

1024
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,080
crazy planets uh...

1025
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:36,200
and uh... like for example

1026
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,560
let's see here

1027
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,480
homey uh...

1028
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:43,160
on the arts neptunes orbit this dwarf planet shaped like an egg and its

1029
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,880
temperatures reach below four hundred degrees fahrenheit

1030
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,720
there was one of the horse below four hundred degrees fahrenheit that's also

1031
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,560
what it's like on earth

1032
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:55,960
that's it's a lot of places that's below four hundred degrees fahrenheit that's

1033
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,440
not that impressive

1034
00:55:57,440 --> 00:55:59,600
it's that it's called homey uh...

1035
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:02,840
'Cause it's the hip-hop planet and it's cold because it's cool as ice.

1036
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,840
Yeah.

1037
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,840
Sedna.

1038
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:08,600
This is the planet farthest from our solar system.

1039
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,320
Sedna.

1040
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,600
I said "na" to that.

1041
00:56:11,600 --> 00:56:13,200
I said "na."

1042
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,200
Kepler- Make-make.

1043
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:15,200
Kepler-12b.

1044
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:20,280
I heard of this dwarf planet.

1045
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,920
Make-make sounds like a Pokemon planet.

1046
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,920
Yeah.

1047
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,400
Sounds like what a Pokemon says.

1048
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:25,400
Yeah.

1049
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,400
If its name was Make-make.

1050
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,400
Yeah.

1051
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:29,720
Why did Pokemons know their names?

1052
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,120
Because that's what they were named.

1053
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:33,240
But why do they...

1054
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:33,740
*sigh*

1055
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,360
This is... this whole world is falling apart to me now.

1056
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,120
So, they can...

1057
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,640
Did they name...

1058
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,840
Who names the Pokemon?

1059
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:41,480
Do they name...

1060
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,200
Are they just named after what they say?

1061
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:43,920
It was God.

1062
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,040
Oh, that must be it.

1063
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:45,820
Right?

1064
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,240
Yeah, like when Venusaur says Venusaur.

1065
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:50,120
That's when they know it's Venusaur.

1066
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,960
That's... they just call him Venusaur?

1067
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,060
Yeah.

1068
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:56,200
Yeah, because they don't really have like a...

1069
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,080
A Latin, like...

1070
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,080
That's how we name animals here too.

1071
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,080
You didn't know that?

1072
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,080
Is it true?

1073
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,080
Dog, yeah they go dog, dog.

1074
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:07,080
You never even listen really closely.

1075
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,080
The noise of a fish swimming through water is like

1076
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:11,080
fshhhhh.

1077
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:13,080
If you just think about it all the stuff is there right?

1078
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:15,080
That's a really good point.

1079
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:17,080
But they only say it in battle.

1080
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:19,080
No.

1081
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:21,080
Ok, listen, a fly, it flies.

1082
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:23,080
And when it flies it's saying

1083
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:25,080
fly, fly, fly.

1084
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:29,320
Well, the problem is most animals are so small that you can't hear them.

1085
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
Exactly.

1086
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,680
The vast majority of animals are this tiny.

1087
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,120
The only time a fly's ever been heard is the movie Racing Stripes.

1088
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,120
That's true.

1089
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,120
Yes.

1090
00:57:39,120 --> 00:57:40,120
You know.

1091
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,640
Wasn't Snoop Dogg one of the flies?

1092
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:44,240
It was Snoop Dogg and me.

1093
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:47,320
We just went into the booth and we just did the whole thing in a day, dude.

1094
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,880
We smoked like an ounce of weed.

1095
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:49,880
You just riffed.

1096
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,880
There was no script.

1097
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:51,880
There was no script.

1098
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,280
They didn't even know that they were making the movie.

1099
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:57,560
Me and Snoop Dogg just got high as fuck and I was like, "Yo, Snoop, what if we went into

1100
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,600
the booth and pretended to be flies for like 8 or 10 hours?"

1101
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,560
You guys went into the booth, had a conversation, and then the recording people listening to

1102
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,280
were like, "Oh my God, we need to make these guys flies in a movie."

1103
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,280
We have to write a movie about this.

1104
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,280
We have to write a movie where they're flies.

1105
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,560
It's just me and Snoop Dogg just smoking weed and we're like, "Man, I love being a fly and

1106
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,760
our best friend's a zebra, man.

1107
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:19,400
This is fucking sick, dude."

1108
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:20,880
We live on a zebra's poop, man.

1109
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,280
We live on a zebra's poop.

1110
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,640
Man, I love- me and Snoop Dogg just saying, "Man, I love eating poop."

1111
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:31,600
And he's like, "Nephew, poop is one of my favorite flavors."

1112
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,600
That's right.

1113
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,120
He said, he held a nug up to my nose and he was like, "Smell this, dude."

1114
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,920
I was like, "It smells like shit."

1115
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,360
And he was like, "Exactly, Playboy."

1116
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Yeah.

1117
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:51,000
There's a planet on here called Glease 581G, and the only comment on it is, "It's actually

1118
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:59,920
not known to exist. Yeah, there's actually a planet, there's a planet called, called,

1119
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:06,120
or whatever the Transformers planet is. Cybertron. Cybertron, there's a planet called Cybertron.

1120
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,360
We don't know if it exists, but we also don't know that it doesn't exist. Exactly. So I'm

1121
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,320
gonna go ahead and throw this. That's true, we don't know if Tatooine exists or not. Yeah.

1122
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,520
But we're just gonna, we can just say that it does. All the Star Wars planets technically

1123
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:19,820
exist because if you think about it there's alternate universes for every

1124
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:23,600
different decision that someone made in the universe right it like splits off

1125
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:27,480
and forms a parallel universe and God could have chosen to make all the Star

1126
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:30,800
Wars planets instead of Earth and the Earth's other what planets the other

1127
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:35,400
brothers of Earth. There's even a planet there's even a reality not the one we're

1128
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:39,640
in but there is a reality where Cameron is a boy. That's the one we're in.

1129
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:43,720
Okay. No it's not the one we're in. No that is the one. It's as far away from our

1130
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:50,720
universe as possible. There's also a universe where Caleb is correct about which universe

1131
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,200
he's in, but it's not this one. Yeah, it's this one. It is this one. It's not. See, there

1132
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:59,280
we go. He's proving my point even further. I'm going to go ahead and hit the reverse

1133
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:03,040
seize button on that one. I'm going to go ahead and... I just hit it, so it's back to

1134
01:00:03,040 --> 01:00:07,680
you. I'm going to touch your buttons. I just put down a reverse Uno card and it just hits

1135
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:26,160
to

1136
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:31,460
hot in this room but I we're not we can't read the patreon people anymore

1137
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:36,720
because there's too many because we are too good at this now yeah so thank you

1138
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:41,060
guys yeah thank you everybody if my performance on this episode said

1139
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:46,600
anything it's that we're too good is that Patrick is he carried us on his back

1140
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:51,720
yeah we put the whole team on and we respect him for that I said something

1141
01:00:51,720 --> 01:00:57,120
about Headspace. He said something about Headspace, the app. I would say, so instead

1142
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,080
of shouting out patrons, who should we shout out? I'd say we should

1143
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:08,120
shout out donations to protesters, honestly. Yeah, to bail funds. Yeah, you can go to

1144
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:15,040
blacklivesmatters.card, C-A-R-R-D dot C-O, and it has a bunch of really good links.

1145
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,080
There's ways you can like donate even if you don't have money, like they

1146
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,800
have like streamed like the YouTube videos with ad revenue.

1147
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:24,560
- Turn off your ad blocker for that.

1148
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:27,480
- Yeah, if you wanna donate, but you can't spare money.

1149
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:31,800
- I know it's annoying to see that fucking ad on YouTube

1150
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:34,040
where it's like the family and they're like,

1151
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,000
we had triplets, oh, here we go.

1152
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:41,080
But just turn it off, mute the thing and fucking stream it

1153
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,240
if you don't have money, that's what I've been doing.

1154
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,880
- Yeah. - I've been donating too.

1155
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,680
And the second Final Destination movie.

1156
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:50,720
(laughing)

1157
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,120
Okay. It's really good.

1158
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:53,720
It's really good, go watch it.

1159
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,400
It has so many cool kills.

1160
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:56,600
So like those two things.

1161
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,320
The fifth one is the best though.

1162
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,960
Hard disagree, hard disagree.

1163
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,880
So we're doing, so definitely go donate,

1164
01:02:05,880 --> 01:02:08,160
go donate to Bale Funds and Black Lives Matter

1165
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,920
and go check out Final Destination.

1166
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:11,880
And stream all the Final Destination.

1167
01:02:11,880 --> 01:02:14,280
Yeah, it's actually, it's a great series.

1168
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,920
If you're not old enough yet, technically,

1169
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:21,480
if you're not 17, you're not allowed to watch it,

1170
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:24,840
tell your parents that it's really just violence.

1171
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,200
There's no nudity and there's very little strong language.

1172
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,520
- There is nudity, though.

1173
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,560
- There's, well, maybe in the end you like.

1174
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:32,400
- Well, then just don't say--

1175
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:33,440
- Doesn't the second one have the one

1176
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,240
with the tanning bed kill?

1177
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:36,080
- No. - That's the third one.

1178
01:02:36,080 --> 01:02:37,560
- That's the third one. - Oh, okay.

1179
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:38,400

01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,240
the amusement park or is the third one the amusement park?

1181
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:42,160
- The second one's the amusement park.

1182
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,000
- Okay, yeah, so that one has Ramona Flowers in it.

1183
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,640
If you're a kid, you'll love that.

1184
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,400
You can tell your parents the sequel to Scott Pilgrim.

1185
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,380
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1186
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:51,680
- Oh, and watch Scott Pilgrim too.

1187
01:02:51,680 --> 01:02:53,120
- Yeah, stream that too.

1188
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:56,120
- Scott Pilgrim is about a 22-year-old grooming

1189
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,040
a 17-year-old with video games.

1190
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:00,160
So if you like that-- - And he's awesome at it.

1191
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,720
- So if you like that, check it out.

1192
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,840
- If you like that, which Patrick does.

1193
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:05,600
Yeah, it's actually based on Patrick's memoir.

1194
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:06,960
- It's not based on my memoir.

1195
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,520
- Yeah, it's like-- - Your memoir?

1196
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,120
- It's stylized like-- - My memoir

1197
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,240
has not been written yet.

1198
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:14,280
It's stylized like Pac-Man, but it says Fat Man.

1199
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:16,160
(laughing)

1200
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:18,280
And it's a picture of Patrick and he's eating a ball.

1201
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,120
That's funny.

1202
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:20,400
He's eating a basketball.

1203
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:23,980
Yeah, well in Fat Man, he doesn't go for the fruits

1204
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:24,820
to eat the fruits.

1205
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:27,600
When you eat the fruits, it lowers the score.

1206
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,840
Yeah, and then he eats the ghosts too, and also the walls.

1207
01:03:31,840 --> 01:03:34,120
Oh, you could eat a ghost at any point.

1208
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:35,040
You couldn't.

1209
01:03:35,040 --> 01:03:36,760
You could just open your mouth and inhale it.

1210
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:37,600
Yeah, I'm eating a ghost right now.

1211
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,200
It's like a spider, it's like how you eat spiders

1212
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,040
in your sleep.

1213
