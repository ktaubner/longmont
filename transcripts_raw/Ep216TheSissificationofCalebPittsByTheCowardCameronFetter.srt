1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
You will listen to the whole episode. You will watch the episode on YouTube.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:12,500
You will laugh at the funny parts. You will cry at the sad parts.

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:20,500
You will put $15,000 in my pocket for a $13,360 T-shirt in Oregon, Texas.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I'm a genius, I got this!

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,080
(upbeat music)

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,220
- Yo, what are you doing?

7
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,820
- I'm looking through all my bits.

8
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,460
- Your mic is completely off.

9
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,900
- Turn your microphone on.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:38,700
Oh my God, there's a bit right there.

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,540
- Is it?

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,360
- Yeah, now it's on.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:41,200
- Okay.

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,020
- There's something right there.

15
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,860
Kalo's microphone.

16
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,500
- Oh, we can do the turned off microphone here.

17
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,700
- Okay, wait, all right.

18
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,740
- Okay, I'm doing it too.

19
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,480
(audio cuts out)

20
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,420
And then--

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,860
(audio cuts out)

22
00:00:58,860 --> 00:00:59,700
And then this and then--

23
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:00,700
- I don't think that's gonna sell that well.

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,060
Now that I think about it, I don't think that'll sell

25
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:05,260
very well on the audio part of the podcast.

26
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,380
- Or on the video either.

27
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:07,220
- Maybe the video would be the least too.

28
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,620
- I had my mic shut off that whole time,

29
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,780
but I couldn't think of anything to say.

30
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,140
- Right, yeah, there's some ideas I have,

31
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,120
but I don't think, yeah, I probably won't end up

32
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,660
doing that one, that one might be a little too involved.

33
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,460
involved? What is it? I was thinking maybe I could get like a... Well don't say it

34
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:24,700
because then when we do it later... But I don't think we'll use this one. I think

35
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,360
it's probably a little... You think we don't use it even at all? There's no

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,440
chance? Once you hear it you'll probably say, "Yeah we probably shouldn't use that

37
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,700
one." Okay. I was thinking maybe I'd go... Well this is a perfect time to

38
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:42,380
actually cut your mic. I'd pretend I get... Well I was pretending I was maybe

39
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:46,300
thinking I could pretend I got like a hair transplant, right? And then come in

40
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:49,780
and I was wear like a bag over my head for a while

41
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:52,260
and then I'd reveal my hair transplant

42
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,420
and I just got like maybe a Hitler mustache.

43
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,420
- That was your transplant?

44
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,100
- Yeah, you see like the fucked up ant legs,

45
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,740
but only here and maybe a little up there.

46
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,260
- It's really red and blowy.

47
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,100
- Yeah, it's like a--

48
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,460
- Yeah, yeah, exactly.

49
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,220
Something like that might be kind of funny.

50
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,060
Hitler hair.

51
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,900
- Nobody, that's the thing, why is it just the mustache?

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,940
Why not his hair?

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,780
- It's the hair.

54
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,780
Everyone has that style.

55
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,780
It's the hair too.

56
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,780
Everybody knows the hair.

57
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
I see that hair everywhere.

58
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,780
You know who has that hairstyle a lot of the time?

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
Who? Pipsy Zero got me burping.

60
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,780
Holy shit.

61
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,780
That's the hardest burp I've ever...

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
That was a weak burp.

63
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,780
You know when they're spiking?

64
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,780
You couldn't think of something in time.

65
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,780
I was going to say, emos have Hitler hair.

66
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,780
No they don't.

67
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Are you kidding me?

68
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,900
Emos have Hitler the hair. Yeah the swoop like that. It's different

69
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,500
Okay

70
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:57,140
He has one purple highlight

71
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,540
Actually, yeah, I think I'm your thing of Hitler I'm thinking you are

72
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,780
Hitler's

73
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,060
Emo that emo Hitler picture his emo guy from the Peter Jackson documentary

74
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Peter Jackson documentary.

75
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,100
Meet the Feebles.

76
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
I didn't watch it.

77
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
You know Peter Jackson took all that World War 1 footage of people

78
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
getting their legs blown off in trenches and stuff

79
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,100
and was like, I'm gonna make it HD and 16 hours long.

80
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,100
Can I put it in full K?

81
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,100
Is that what he sounds like?

82
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,100
You know he like ruined New Zealand?

83
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,100
Yeah.

84
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,100
Pretty funny.

85
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,100
He put a big chess board there.

86
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,100
Did he?

87
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,100
A big upside down house.

88
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:40,980
a couple of fun things about the set that we are the bunker that we didn't know

89
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,540
you move over for a second watch this can you cut to the plasma ball cam watch this

90
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:55,500

91
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,340

92
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,980

93
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:11,380
episode. Baaa! What the hell is going on? This is the craziest shit ever. I think there's something magic on Cameron.

94
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,420
There's something fucked up about this plasma ball. Baaa! I didn't really realize

95
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:19,160
plasma was so anti-mortal. And watch, now watch what happens to Caleb, cut to the

96
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,940
Caleb camera, when I do this. It's pretty, it's, I think it's really similar to what

97
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:29,620
happens in the plasma ball. It's showing up. Yes, I don't know if it's showing up on camera. And now watch this.

98
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:36,420
"Bah!" So it got a little scary. It honestly did scare me a little bit. But it doesn't

99
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:43,620
happen to Patrick. No. "Bah!" Nothing. Try it again. "Bah!" Try it again on me. "Bah!"

100
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,860
But you guys know... Wait, you just transferred your "bah" to me. Whoa. "Bah!" "Bah!" Wow!

(laughter)

106
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,700
- I was in the middle of talking.

107
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,040
- Oh whatever.

108
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,720
- Yeah, okay wait what about this one?

109
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,800
E.T.

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,840
- Okay.

111
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,120
- Goes home.

112
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,960
- Okay.

113
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,780
- I like E.T.

114
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,620
- See I'm just trying to do a movie.

115
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,720
- I like that E.T.

116
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,560
- If you stick to movie references I can do that.

117
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,400
Stop flying over my tongue.

118
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,840
- I like that E.T. looked like a toad.

119
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,680
- You liked that?

120
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,500
- A toad skin.

121
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,340
- You liked that?

122
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
- Yeah.

123
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,280
- 'Cause he could've just been a toad.

124
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,400
- I think I would've made this.

125
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
- Enormous toad.

126
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,680
- Oh, that's an E.T. set. - Oh, E.T.

127
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,920
- Enormous, I get it. - Oh, yeah, okay.

128
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,880
- I think if you had to make any food out of E.T.,

129
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,920
I would really love to eat E.T. calamari.

130
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,880
- Like his asshole?

131
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,840
- No, his fingertips.

132
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,140
- His fingertips and neck.

133
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:08,320
- Like cut it, just cut, dissect him,

134
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,640
and just eat him like that?

135
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,480
Deep fried.

136
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,800
- Well, yeah, but not just like that.

137
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Prepare it, of course. - Have you seen these?

138
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,480
- You've seen these?

139
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,300
- There's like a five-star chef.

140
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,140
- Yeah, yeah.

141
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,800
- There's these, this animator made a bunch of these videos

142
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,800
where it's him, not him, but it's somebody,

143
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:27,380
He animated like a chef cooking the starter Pokemon.

144
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,560
- That's funny.

145
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,320
- And it, honestly, the pulling off like Squirtle's shell

146
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,400
made me a little sad.

147
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,640
- Well, you've talked about this before,

148
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:39,120
how in Pokemon, they don't eat meat in Pokemon.

149
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,600
- Yeah, they're all vegetarians.

150
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,080
- That's the whole thing.

151
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,720
And I've never, anybody would eat any Pokemon.

152
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
- Right.

153
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,680
- They would all be pretty good, I think.

154
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,600
- Yeah, but have we talked about it?

155
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,680
Have we talked about which one would taste the best?

156
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,640
Definitely, I can tell you that we have

157
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,600
'cause there was a good month or two of my life

158
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,080
when I asked everybody that question every day.

159
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,480
- But the only one, there's a couple

160
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,760
that would not be good though.

161
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
- Yeah. - Any of the ones

162
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,080
that are made out of rocks, I don't want to eat a rock.

163
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,040
- I think it could be good, have you ever had rock candy?

164
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
- But sweet. - Yeah.

165
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,440
- Do these rocks have, does the rock have--

166
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,600
- Salt is rocks.

167
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,760
- Have you ever seen those, you know, like the,

168
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,760
you can cook a piece of chicken on like hot stones.

169
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,760
- Do you know a Pokemon I wouldn't--

170
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,640
- You could cook a Charmander with a Geodude.

171
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
You could burn the Geodude.

172
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,120
- Oh! - Okay, yeah, yeah.

173
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,480
- That's like, maybe there's a Pokemon

174
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,360
that's like a cast iron pan.

175
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,720
- Because no other food, really, you can cook it.

176
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,000
So you use a Charmander, you use its flaming tail

177
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
to cook, let's say, a Squirtle, okay?

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,540
You eat the Squirtle, and then you can eat the Charmander.

179
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,320
There's not another food that you can make something with it

180
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,760
and then eat the thing that made the food.

181
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,600
- That's a damn good point.

182
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,880
- You can't eat your oven or stove.

183
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,040
Here's an idea for, where do you buy pots and pans?

184
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,880
- The store.

185
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,700
- Crate and barrel.

186
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,600
- Here's an idea for crate and barrel,

187
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,520
how about you start making the pots and pans

188
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,160
out of stuff that you can fucking eat?

189
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,000
- Yep.

190
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,820
- Yeah.

191
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
- Yeah.

192
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,500
- Yeah, like a salt lamp.

193
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,320
- Like a bread bowl.

194
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,160
- Or like a tostada.

195
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,680
- A bread bowl that you can heat up and then eat at the end.

196
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,520
- Yeah, you should be able to cook in a bread bowl.

197
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,160
- A bread bowl you can buy at home.

198
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,560
- Is that so much to ask?

199
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,280
- Look, this is why people listen to this show,

200
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,120
is our amazing ideas like this.

201
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,880
- Well, oh my god, listen, this is,

202
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,520
okay, this is gonna be trippy as fuck,

203
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,240
So anybody who's smoked weed recently,

204
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,880
don't listen to this part.

205
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,320
But imagine you have a bread bowl,

206
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,400
you're making your food in your bread bowl, okay, right?

207
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,520
- I'm already giving you money for this idea.

208
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,400
- Yeah, you're making food in your bread bowl,

209
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,560
and then it's like, well how did they make the bread bowl?

210
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,480
They made it in a bigger bread bowl.

211
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,520
And how'd they make that bread bowl?

212
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,440
- Oh my fuck.

213
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,560
- Because everything you make,

214
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,160
you should be able to eat the thing you made it in.

215
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:44,660
- Speaking of bread bowl, it rhymes with Red Bull.

216
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:47,720
Have you tried this new Red Bull flavor?

217
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,700
- What Red Bull flavor?

218
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,640
- Fig Apple.

219
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,380
- I can't go buy you one right now.

220
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,220
- We live in the Fig Apple.

221
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,060
- Ow.

222
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,260
- Ow.

223
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,100
- Okay.

224
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,920
- It's not so funny now, is it now?

225
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
- Hey, Caleb.

226
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,580
- It really hurts when you're paper cut.

227
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,420
- Hey, Caleb, you know what?

228
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,260
- Bah.

229
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,080
- Okay, now don't.

230
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
- We're going back to bah.

231
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,740
- Don't paper cut.

232
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,580
- And you're gonna get,

233
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
I'm gonna slice the shit out of you.

234
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,660
- You're not gonna do that ever.

235
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,940
- Ow!

236
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,300
Stop!

237
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,640
Do you think I could,

238
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,980
I could maybe give you a paper cut with this.

239
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,060
- No, it's too thin.

240
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,500
- Do you know which Pokemon I wouldn't eat?

241
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,340
- Crap-Dar.

242
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,420
- I probably wouldn't eat Crap-Dar.

243
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,380
I probably wouldn't eat the ice cream cone one.

244
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,580
Too spicy.

245
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,420
- True.

246
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,260
- For you, I bet.

247
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,740
You did just have a Chippy Chip for lunch.

248
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,780
- Yeah, I'm too full.

249
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:31,900
- Get a close up on the Chippy Chip.

250
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,020
- This used to be full.

251
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:36,420
- What a great name for a chocolate chip cookie.

252
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,060
- Dolly Madison Chippy Chip.

253
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,180
- Dolly Madison?

254
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,500
- Dolly Madison Chippy Chip.

255
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,900
Vanilla flavored ice cream between

256
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:44,340
Two chocolate chip cookies rolled in chocolate chips.

257
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,100
You've never been to the Dixie Stampede.

258
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,500
You guys have any idea what that is?

259
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,020
No.

260
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,140
Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede.

261
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:49,940
I know what it is.

262
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,440
I don't.

263
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,820
Where you go and they start--

264
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:56,380
it's basically Confederate medieval times.

265
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,380
And you get to eat--

266
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,060
they roast the pig and all that stuff.

267
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,020
And they have a lady who they pretend

268
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,540
is Dolly Parton, who's like--

269
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:06,620
The lady with big tits.

270
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,260
Yeah, I think she's wearing--

271
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:12,180
She has like a pillow from her bed in her chest.

272
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,020
- Do you remember that time we,

273
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,300
it was before a show we were doing

274
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,720
back in like 2018 or something like that,

275
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,980
like summer 2018.

276
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,680
There was that dude selling all those books outside.

277
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,700
It was in Boston.

278
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,500
Dude on the corner selling these books.

279
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:35,220
And then he had this one box of just adult books.

280
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,180
And there was that big book that he had.

281
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,780
It was like a German book.

282
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Yes.

283
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:51,880
The whole thing was like, it was a 1970s, like, just women with just boobs that were too big.

284
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,180
Like heart hurting ones.

285
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,180
Yeah.

286
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,180
Like, like prosthetic.

287
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,180
I remember that.

288
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,180
I completely forgot about this.

289
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,180
Prosthetic boobs.

290
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,180
I don't remember.

291
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,180
You might not have been there.

292
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,180
I don't think you were around then.

293
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,180
I don't think you were around.

294
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,180
No.

295
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,180
I wasn't born.

296
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,180
Yeah.

297
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
You weren't around then.

298
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,180
You, you, once you.

299
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:12,100
around back then. Yeah, definitely not. I don't think I... That was so funny. I honestly don't think I

300
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,700
came onto the scene until around 2019. Yeah. I don't think I was really around. I think it was 2019,

301
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:22,940
because it definitely wasn't 2018. I didn't know you guys that well then. You're not that old. I'm

302
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,140
not that old, but I've been on the in the scene since then. Oh, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah,

303
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:32,700
I do. I feel like anytime you go to an antique store, there is always that bin of like... Old

304
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,740
porno old porn but it's always like mostly playboy and then one of them is

305
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:41,180
like a 70s thing about who like bush yeah who can grow the biggest bush yeah

306
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,460
they're doing Chia they're doing the Chia thing on their bush they like to be

307
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:48,700
silly with them yeah the bush thing I'm listen I'll say it I'm glad that's out of

308
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,900
style hope it never comes back in a style giant bush I don't want that giant

309
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,940
bush yeah unless it's my own stuff and yeah I definitely don't want to have to

310
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:03,820
shave all the time. Me too. Yeah and also deodorant? No. Yeah. No no no no. Yeah. No.

311
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,180
Thank you. I want to grow my armpit hair out so long that it looks like a

312
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,860
predator's hair. Yeah well all you have to do is stop shaving it. I mean you keep

313
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:16,620
shaving it. Yeah. Well I shave it because of how much I swim. Yeah. Armpit hair has a

314
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:21,220
has a limit right? It can't get longer than like. No. That must be a friction thing.

315
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,020
Anybody with short armpit hair they shave it. How come your head hair can

316
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,020
grow forever but your armpit hair... I guess it's because it has to be because of this.

317
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,020
Your head hair cannot grow forever.

318
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:39,020
Ow! That hurt my feelings. So maybe take it back.

319
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,020
Okay. Thank you. Moving on.

320
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:45,020
Well that hair can grow forever. Yeah, that hair is gonna grow forever.

321
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,020
Somebody told me, somebody very rudely yesterday asked, he was like,

322
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:54,020
he's like, "Do you, oh, Caleb, I love your mustache. So like, every day do you

323
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:59,300
shave right in between the two parts of the mustache? I was like, "No." He was like,

324
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:04,300
"Oh, it just grows like that?" Then he laughed at me. He laughed at you? Yeah.

325
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:11,620
It doesn't even go up. It doesn't go... I don't have any... I mean, I can't even see it on camera.

326
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:15,900
It doesn't even like... Oh, I guess never mind, because it does... I was like gonna say, it

327
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,620
doesn't even like connect. It doesn't connect anywhere. Yeah. It looks like

328
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:26,540
eyelashes. Yeah, honestly. You should get a John Waters thing going.

329
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:31,820
That's what I'm going for. You should dye it jet black. You look like if they

330
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:43,260
combine John Waters and Divine. What? What the hell? I honestly don't know what

331
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,140
you're talking about. You have no idea? Okay, so... I don't know what you're talking about.

332
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:53,180
Not so artistic. Somebody doesn't care so much about transgressive art.

333
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:57,180
Isn't that movie about she eats diarrhea and fucks a dog?

334
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,180
She doesn't eat diarrhea, she eats a dog poop at the end of the movie.

335
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:03,180
It's dog poop. It's hard and solid dog poop.

336
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,180
That movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

337
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,180
What?

338
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,180
They make a butthole saying bird is the word.

339
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,180
That sounds like pretty funny honestly.

340
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,180
Yeah, it's so good.

341
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:15,180
Is it nasty though? It's nasty as hell.

342
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,180
Oh, I hate nasty shit.

343
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,180
I'm not too big a fan of the nasty stuff myself.

344
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,180
I think I don't like, I think I'm getting to the age where I'm a little too aware of,

345
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:28,180
I'm starting to get scared of blood again and I don't like blood in movies anymore.

346
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,180
Really?

347
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:33,180
Yeah, I've been watching some scary movies. I watched some clip from Terrifier 2 where

348
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,180
something horrible happens. I don't even want to repeat it because it's so great.

349
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:40,180
I didn't know the Terrifier was a film series. I didn't know Terrifier was a, I thought you made that up.

350
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,180
They made Terrifier 1 in 2016.

351
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,180
I thought I made it up too. Yeah, but apparently.

352
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,380
- Nobody named Terrifier in it,

353
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,640
they just called the movie that.

354
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,940
- Oh, what's the guy's name?

355
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,340
- Art the Clown.

356
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,340
- Art the Clown.

357
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,300
- Art the Clown.

358
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,500
- I bet that has some kind of double meaning.

359
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,400
- Well thank God, I'll say this much about that.

360
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,860
Thank God that they stopped making

361
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,060
the scary movie franchise,

362
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,380
because that has gotta be the most easily lampoonable name

363
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:03,660
in horror movie history.

364
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,620
- Yeah, Bart the Clown.

365
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,220
- Yeah, and he could look like Bart Simpson.

366
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,900
- That's actually, that's yeah, that's even smarter.

367
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:10,740
- Bart the Clown.

368
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,300
- And he gets choked by Homer the Clown.

369
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,300
- Homer the Clown. - He's a weed cart.

370
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,500
- Yeah, okay, let's keep going.

371
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,540
- And Marlon Wayans character. - Dart the Clown.

372
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,900
- I was thinking it would be-- - Dart?

373
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,180
- I was-- - And he's a cigarette.

374
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,580
- Yeah, I was thinking it was gonna be

375
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,340
maybe a kind of commentary on consumerism,

376
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,460
Walmart the Clown. - Ah.

377
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,220
- And he'd, I guess he'd be Walmart colors.

378
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,340
- Does Walmart have-- - Maybe like Lart the Clown.

379
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,180
- Walmart used to have a mascot.

380
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,140
- This is a crazy nonsense. - It's a nonsense, yeah.

381
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,120
- Does she ever have a mascot? - What does her name even mean?

382
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,460
- Yeah, well, Lart the Clown, asshole.

383
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,060
- You guys remember that Walmart used to have,

384
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:45,340
it was the smiley guy. He used to have guns too. Yeah. Thanks.

385
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,940
Thanks Trump for getting rid of the guns in Walmart.

386
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,940
That asshole hated guns. Yeah. The smiley was a smiley guy.

387
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:54,700
He just had a smiley face. That was Walmart's logo.

388
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,460
The mascot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then they got rid of it.

389
00:15:57,460 --> 00:16:00,260
They don't have that anymore? They don't have, I don't think Walmart has a...

390
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,260
This is Walmart's logo now.

391
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:07,540
Walmart's logo is, or mascot rather, is the greeter.

392
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,740
Oh, it's a it's a 120 year old lady.

393
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,840
Yeah, that yeah.

394
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,940
Yeah, a woman who's there was there was originally it was it

395
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,040
was the the greedy greeter and you would grab all the items

396
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:18,540
from Walmart.

397
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,040
He became friends with the smile.

398
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:20,340
Yeah.

399
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:24,040
Yeah, I honestly can't tell sometimes if the person at the

400
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,040
front of Walmart is a greeter or a homeless person at like

401
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,140
you're asking me for something.

402
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:29,840
They stop you.

403
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,340
Really told.

404
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,240
They're asking you to say hello to them.

405
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,540
It's really funny that they stop you at the greeting thing

406
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:38,040
to like do loss prevention and it's like they're they're two

407
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,660
jobs are to say like hi yeah and then their other job is like you fucking I

408
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,440
know you fucking stole something and if that is a shit I'll say this if the last

409
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,680
line of defense for Walmart for like stealing is a 100 year old woman who

423
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,960
put it in the trunk of my van.

424
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,480
- You pull up, you drive up--

425
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,760
- I need a female employee.

426
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:37,600
- With a big grabber in the trunk.

427
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,200
- Can you come plug it in the console?

428
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm completely paralyzed and I can't move at all.

429
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,920
And then they crawl in and then click.

430
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,200
- Before that was never possible.

431
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,520
You'd go into Best Buy and be like,

432
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,100
I'm having trouble carrying this,

433
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,160
can you bring it to my car?

434
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,880
And they'd say yes, but only if it was a TV,

435
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
it was thousands of dollars.

436
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,720
- Yeah, exactly.

437
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:55,540
- I'm not spending thousands of dollars

438
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,960
to kidnap Kevin with long hair.

439
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,800
He looks like a girl, that's why I want him.

440
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,160
- Kevin with the long hair?

441
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,520
- Yeah.

442
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,340
- He's skinny.

443
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,340
Yeah, he's skinny.

444
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,340
Little skinny string bean Kevin.

445
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,340
Arm acne.

446
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,340
Arm acne, but shoulder acne.

447
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,340
That's what you got on Kevin.

448
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
Yeah.

449
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
Right, but if you blur your eyes.

450
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
Kevin.

451
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,340
But if I get him on a regimen once he's in my house, I could clear that shit up.

452
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:18,340
That's the main reason I want him.

453
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,340
I think he could be a contender.

454
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,340
Gonna be putting retinol on him.

455
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,340
Yeah, cover his body in retinol.

456
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
He blows up.

457
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:25,340
He looks like he got stung by a bee all over his body.

458
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,340
And if he misbehaves, that covers his body in ethanol.

459
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
Yeah.

460
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
That's right.

461
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
That's the shit right there.

462
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:35,700
Cut right and then all of a sudden you're sending him into the hood to do videos

463
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:46,480
Full of keratin debris yeah, yeah, you want I also want to say you want to be getting guys from Best Buy

464
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:02,280
Dog-human mutant hybrid runs wild. I

465
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:10,860
Just watched the fly to recently speaking of dog-human hybrid is there a dog-human hybrid in the fly - oh, yeah

466
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:15,500
You haven't seen it. No. Why don't they call it's on it's on HBO max. You should you'd really like it

467
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,660
It's made by the the special effects

468
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,020
Supervisor of the fly. Mm-hmm. So the director of the fly - that's it

469
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:29,800
Movie it's it's good. Oh, yeah, I don't like HBO max. What the hell is wrong with

470
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:38,900
Are you the guys been laying off all these people from HBO Max? I don't like HBO max. I don't like Discovery Plus. I don't like

471
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:43,580
You know I only like the parent you like peacock. You know what the paramount one is fire

472
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:52,600
I'm about to say to you. I was about to say you can bite my shiny metal ass that weird guess what that's a paramount property

473
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:57,000
Dude, I always thought Paramount Plus, I always thought that was the joke one.

474
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,900
I always was like, that's stupid.

475
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,400
That is the most fire one.

476
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
You know what they got on there?

477
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
Everything.

478
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
They have all of Star Trek on there.

479
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Strangers with Candy.

480
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
They have Strangers with Candy.

481
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
They have every movie.

482
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,600
They got Fixer Upper.

483
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,040
They got Mission Impossible.

484
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,040
They have Jackasses.

485
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
They have Jackasses.

486
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
The Wild Jackasses.

487
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
My favorite movie series.

488
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,040
The Wild Jackasses.

489
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:19,040
And you can connect it to your Amazon Prime.

490
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,560
And that's what today's episode is about.

491
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:27,280
- We're gonna do a tutorial on how to connect Paramount Plus

492
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,120
to Amazon Prime.

493
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,160
- So what you wanna do is go into Amazon Prime,

494
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,920
go to subscriptions, and what you will do is

495
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,680
where you can add a subscription,

496
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,720
add a subscription to Paramount Plus,

497
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,640
and that will authorize a monthly charge on your account,

498
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,320
9.99 for Paramount Plus, and that's ad free.

499
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,600
Because Paramount Plus has 9.99 subscription,

500
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,440
which is ad free, but they also have a lower subscription,

501
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,000
which I believe is 5, 6, 8 dollars, I can't remember,

502
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,840
but that's not available on Amazon Prime.

503
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,560
You'll only be able to get the ad-free plan

504
00:20:58,560 --> 00:20:59,840
as an Amazon subscription channel.

505
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,960
- If that's expensive. - If you have an existing

506
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,280
Paramount Plus account. - It may seem expensive,

507
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,180
but when you see the catalog,

508
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,520
you're gonna change your tune.

509
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,280
- Is it worth canceling my loop rate?

510
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,080
- And if you want to change your tune

511
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,440
from Spotify or Apple Music,

512
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,080
Amazon Music is a good alternative.

513
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:19,000
- And Amazon, that thing sucks.

514
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,520
- Amazon Music, Amazon Music.

515
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,360
- Don't you wanna get your music from the same place

516
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:25,540
you get your Paramount Plus and your packaging?

517
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:29,760
- You know what they should offer on Amazon Music?

518
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,920
If you buy a movie on Amazon Prime Video,

519
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,240
you should get the soundtrack for free in Amazon Music.

520
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,280
- That's actually a really good idea.

521
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,040
- If I buy Moulin Rouge, I should get the soundtrack

522
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:44,860
for free.

523
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,680
- You really want the Moulin Rouge soundtrack?

524
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,720
if I buy, I just, I'm thinking musicals.

525
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,440
- Well, it's just if you want the movie.

526
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,280
- Or you know what?

527
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,320
Full audio track of the movie in my library immediately.

528
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,160
- Why not both?

529
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,880
- I buy Joker on Amazon Prime Video.

530
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,040
The whole Joker.

531
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,960
- You just listen to it?

532
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,800
- Just listen to it.

533
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,720
- Yeah, probably be better that way.

534
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,680
- Audiobook style.

535
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,520
- Audible.

536
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
- Damn.

537
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,360
- I think--

538
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,640
- This boy hates Todd Phillips.

539
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,120
- We should do, what are you doing?

540
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,960
What are you looking at?

541
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:14,800
- Look at--

542
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,620
- Dollar bill?

543
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,460
Show the camera.

544
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,560
There he is, Benjamin Franklin.

545
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Right there.

546
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:26,060
I mean, if you don't know that face, then you're not American.

547
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:30,040
Yeah, if you're an American and you don't know Benjamin Franklin, honestly I think that

548
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,460
you've gone to a charter school or something.

549
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
He looks so good in this picture.

550
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Yeah, and there's, I mean, that's the, there it is right there.

551
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
I mean, it's like...

552
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Right on the back here.

553
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,460
He looks great.

554
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,460
He looks incredible.

555
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,460
Flip that over, flip that over.

556
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,540
put that over here. You have a better, you have a better, right there, Statue of Liberty.

557
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,940
There it is. It's like the, just, just, what everyone loves about America. And they got

558
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:55,860
a little, they got a little excerpt from the Declaration of Independence here. This note

559
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:03,620
is not legal. It is to be used for motion pictures. Yeah. And this is actually, it's, it's actually

560
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:24,420
Hoffarth. Who's Hoffarth? That's Hoffarth. Type in, will you Google this name? No, you won't be able to see it. Yeah, that's...

561
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:34,500
that's it says Hawthorne. I want to learn who this Hawthorne. Yeah, can we look up Hawthorne

562
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:42,300
really quick? H-O-F-F-A-R-T-H Hawthorne. One of the little known founding fathers. Hawthorne

563
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:48,380
look up Hawthorne $100 bill. Yeah, why was he on the one? What did Hawthorne do that

564
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,100
was so great. Hoffarth.

565
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,700
100... it doesn't say much about Hoffarth.

566
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,100
Images of Hoffarth $100.

567
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,940
Maybe it's the owner of the...

568
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,180
Is it... could it be Joseph Hoffarth right there?

569
00:23:59,180 --> 00:23:59,580
There it is.

570
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,540
Oh, there's... there's Hoffarth.

571
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:07,380
These are rare. These are like $2 bills.

572
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:07,700
Yeah.

573
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,660
You know, you got to go...

574
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,300
Get the Hoffarth $100.

575
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:13,820
Yeah. It's a special edition. It's like a McDonald's BTS meal.

576
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,260
Yeah.

577
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,660
And the treasurer is Linda.

578
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,780
Linda?

579
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:21,380
Linda what? I can't read that. Linda Hoffarth?

580
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,300
Mike, Mike, see Mike Lee. I love having props.

581
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,500
Yeah. I'd love to have so many props in my life. Oh wait there's a, it says it right here.

582
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,940
Oh, Secretary Pablo Banana.

583
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:38,420
Hey, I didn't vote for him. Yeah. Okay. Oh that's Linda there, okay. Yeah.

584
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,860
Doesn't that look like that says Pablo Banana? I did vote for Hoffarth.

585
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,660
I did not vote for Pablo Banana. Zoom into lower right there, Pablo Banana.

586
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,380
The treasurer? The secretary right there?

587
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,380
Yeah, right where your mouse is.

588
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,820
We need to see... I need everyone to see this signature here and help me verify that it says Pablo Banana.

589
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,620
Okay, we're having a little bit of a technical difficulty.

590
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,920
Some kind of technicality.

591
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,920
You're just zooming in on Hoffarth.

592
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Alright.

593
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,920
Yeah, right there.

594
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,920
There it is.

595
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
Alright, well...

596
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,920
[laughter]

597
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,080
Yeah, who do you think is the next person that gets put...

598
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,320
'Cause due to inflation, we know about inflation.

599
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,160
Yeah.

600
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
Inflation is gonna, eventually we're gonna need

601
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,360
a thousand dollar bill.

602
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,200
A $10,000 bill.

603
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,020
There used to be a thousand dollar bill.

604
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,860
I know, I know, you dickhead.

605
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,960
And you know who was on it?

606
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:27,960
Shut the fuck up!

607
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,800
Hoffarth.

608
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,640
Hoffarth wasn't on it.

609
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,460
I know.

610
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,300
He's on the hundred.

611
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,140
I was doing a callback.

612
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:32,960
Who was on it?

613
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,000
U.S.E.'s S. Grant, I think.

614
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,840
I think it was Mr. 1000.

615
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
(laughing)

616
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,680
Really?

617
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,500
Yeah, don't you remember that?

618
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,340
He had the sunglasses.

619
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:42,040
(laughing)

620
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,920
- Sunglasses is a 1000. - Misto one foul wow.

621
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,720
- I don't think it's Ulysses S. Grant.

622
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,280
- Why are you saying Ulysses like that?

623
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,320
Ulesses. - Ulesses.

624
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,160
- Ulysses. - Ulysses.

625
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,000
- Ulysses. - Ulysses.

626
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,160
- Ulysses. - Ulysses.

627
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,360
- Ule-pee.

628
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,680
- The-- - Ule-pee.

629
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,520
- Ule-pee. - Ule-pee.

630
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,560
- Ule-pee somebody. - Ule-pee somebody.

631
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,380
- I won't.

632
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,760
- When I freeze it and I put it in a snow cone maker.

633
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,720
- I think it was actually Bill though.

634
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,040
- Who's Bill?

635
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:05,200
- $1,000 Bill.

636
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,280
(laughing)

637
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,080
Okay. Plasma ball right now. Plasma ball right now.

638
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,380
Bah!

639
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,080
Bah.

640
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,380
Bah.

641
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,180
There you go. That's just a mental reset I need. I see that every once in a while.

642
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:28,080
But with inflation, we're gonna have a $5,000 bill. We're gonna have a $10,000 bill.

643
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,680
There's gonna be, eventually, $100,000, million-dollar bill.

644
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,380
Who should we put on it?

645
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,680
I think I have an idea.

646
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,680
Oh, who?

647
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,180
Bill.

648
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,680
$1,000 bill.

649
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,560
Why would you put $1,000 bill on the $10,000 bill?

650
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,200
Okay.

651
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,760
I was thinking maybe it would be somebody like Lady Gaga or Lizzo.

652
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:54,160
Do you think they'd ever do a bill that had three people on it at the same time?

653
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,320
I mean, what do you look at?

654
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,120
I always Grover Cleveland.

655
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,040
You know we have a guy who looks things up for us.

656
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,880
Yeah, but I didn't want to make him do that.

657
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,560
That's very nice of you.

658
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:13,460
people on one bill, kind of a $3,000 bill, and it's like, "Oh my god, what if the $3,000

659
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,200
bill is three $1,000 bills together and it's like this big?"

660
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
Holy shit.

661
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,600
They just never cut them apart.

662
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,400
Yeah, it's a square and it has three different faces.

663
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,960
And I don't know who the three faces could be.

664
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,240
I actually have no idea what three guys...

665
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Yeah, I mean, it's kind of hard to find three guys who work perfectly together and have

666
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,400
kind of the exact same look that you need for a bill like that.

667
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:47,360
And maybe their heads are really close together in the thing too.

668
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,960
What does it say under on the crest though?

669
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:49,960
Does it say three guys?

670
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,960
Does it say everyone's name?

671
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
Three guys.

672
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
Three guys who don't give a fuck.

673
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,960
I have the perfect idea for the $4,000 bill.

674
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,960
Three identical strangers.

675
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
That's what it says.

676
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,960
It could be completely digital and on the computer.

677
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:57,960
Let's only have three guys on it.

678
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
It could be completely digital and on the computer.

679
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Let's tell them we have three guys on it.

680
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Yeah, you know, these NFTs basically eventually

681
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
there'll be pretty much everything.

682
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
You'll be using NFTs to wipe your ass with eventually

683
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,960
because they'll be actually physical.

684
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Non-flushable toilet paper.

685
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Yeah, well that's what that would be.

686
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
That's what the baby wipes are.

687
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,960
NFTs, I say no fucking the way I'm using those.

688
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,960
No fucking the way.

689
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,960
No fucking the way I'm using those.

690
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,960
No fucking the way.

691
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,960
No fucking thought.

692
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:26,960
fucking thought.

693
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Because I have a lift.

694
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,560
I have a lift and a speech impediment.

695
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,560
An NFT what else could that?

696
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,360
Why are you making light of speech impediments?

697
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,360
What?

698
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,360
Cease?

699
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,800
I'm maybe of a personal best interest.

700
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Why are you making light of speech impediments cease?

701
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,120
Cease what I mean?

702
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,120
I will cease my speech impediment joke.

703
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:52,680
Remember Max Keeble's principal would say that shit.

704
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,920
Did you ever know anybody who couldn't say their R's well into adulthood?

705
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,920
No.

706
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:58,920
I think I did.

707
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Kind of.

708
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,920
I knew one person who did not well.

709
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,920
I knew only homeschooled kids, so pretty much that was the only other person I knew.

710
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,880
That was the only people you knew.

711
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:09,960
I knew a lot of people who were 16 years old, like, "I just got my Dwyva's license."

712
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,520
I'd be like, "Oh, cool, man.

713
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,520
That's awesome."

714
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,520
I knew one kid, I swear to God, name was Ethan, looked exactly like a fucking bird.

715
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Yeah.

716
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:23,560
had a look like a pigeon had a this kind of thing going on and couldn't say as

717
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:28,520
ours. Hope he's doing all right. Yeah me too. Yeah I was doing good. We have a list

718
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:36,000
today. Yeah. Cameron found. Yeah Cameron. You intro this one. Sure. Yeah wait I am

719
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,760
curious how'd you stumble upon this? Stumble upon I was looking up lists. Yeah.

720
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:47,480
Just a normal just looking up. Just doing my Google rounds. Checking my different

721
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:51,480
different web groups for what's funny or what's like funny on the web.

722
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,480
This seems like so hyper specific. It doesn't seem like it has that many views even.

723
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,480
How did you end up finding this?

724
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:03,480
I was just finding lists, googling around, personal.

725
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,480
I'm in business. It seems like you're saying the same thing

726
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:11,480
so that we stop asking you, but you're not answering anything.

727
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,480
Stop asking me what? I'm saying where'd you find this list?

728
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:24,080
It's on, it was on, I was Googling around and you were looking at different groups. You

729
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,080
already said all that.

730
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Yeah, web groups.

731
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Yeah, web groups.

732
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Subscription, like email.

733
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,560
Listen, everybody's a part of web groups, okay? I think we all are pretty familiar with

734
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
how those work.

735
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Yeah.

736
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,560
Web groups.

737
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Web rings.

738
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Exactly.

739
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,560
Web 3.0.

740
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
No.

741
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Google Plus.

742
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Do you remember that?

743
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
I think no fucking the way I'm on there.

744
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:47,320
I mean, not to get sidetracked, but do you remember that one time we were hanging out

745
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:54,440
at this bar one time, we were talking about photography, and somebody walked up to us

746
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,960
and said, do you remember?

747
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,960
You were here.

748
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Yeah, I was there.

749
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:01,640
Somebody walked up to us and said, "Were you talking about digital photography and Web

750
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
3.0 spaces?"

751
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,600
This honestly, this city should be just bulldozed completely.

752
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:14,040
Well, okay, but it was somebody who was like clear just clearly very like like fucked up

753
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:22,120
Yeah, and they still were like no and she's like fuck you. Yes. She said she said she literally was just like okay

754
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:28,560
Fine fuck you then and then she's my ears stole Patrick's drink all my beer and drank it and then walked away

755
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,840
And then her boyfriend walked back with the beer and was like I'm so sorry you got owned dude. I

756
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,720
funny.

757
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
It's fucking owned.

758
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
Yeah.

759
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
And then Patrick went like this.

760
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
I don't even want that.

761
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
Wait, I was there.

762
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,720
I think I came back.

763
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,720
You came back.

764
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,720
You were there after.

765
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,720
You didn't see it.

766
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,720
You were there after.

767
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,720
You didn't see it, but that was.

768
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
It was pretty funny.

769
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,600
That was a crazy interaction.

770
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,120
I'm basically not there breathing these days.

771
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,320
I've been thinking about that.

772
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,720
Anytime I hear the word Web 3.0 now, all I think is that person stealing my beer, and

773
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,720
guess what?

774
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,360
I'm not getting on board with that shit.

775
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
Oh no.

776
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:05,720
I hear all I'm saying is I hope I hope a spider doesn't make a new web 3.0

777
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:13,080
Cuz the spider webs that we have these days are already enough. Yeah, there are enough with the webs like there's one right there. Yeah

778
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:20,280
This is scared of it. Sorry. You said it's he said he said it was scary. He didn't even get scared

779
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:30,420
Enter the list yeah sissy factory yeah

780
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,260
- Yeah.

781
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,080
(laughing)

782
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,820
- Sissy hypnosis and behavior modification.

783
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:37,260
- I went to the sissy factory on a tour in high school.

784
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:39,180
- I went to your sissy factory, nobody knew you.

785
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,620
- Pound that out.

786
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:42,660
- Yeah, that's what I saw at the sissy factory

787
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,500
was some sissies getting pounded out.

788
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,100
(laughing)

789
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:47,860
I went to the sissy factory on a tour

790
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:51,980
and they let me put, they let me go in the tube.

791
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,380
- There's a tube at the sissy factory?

792
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,100
- You got Willy Wonka'd at the sissy factory?

793
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,780
- I fell into the chocolate river.

794
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,040
(laughter)

795
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,100
- Bro got glooped.

796
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,100
- There is definitely a sissy named Augustus Gloop.

797
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,420
- Yeah.

798
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,020
- So this is a sissy website.

799
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,420
And it's a sissy factory for sissies.

800
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,460
- I'm just imagining just like a,

801
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,620
and let's say it's like,

802
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,780
(humming)

803
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:22,180
just like a conveyor belt of all these like.

804
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,540
- Just tough guys getting pumped

805
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,860
in the sissy factory. - Getting justified.

806
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,100
- And just getting, getting.

807
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,420
What's that thing, the thing from like Attack of the Clones

808
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,620
where it like squishes like C-3PO's arm

809
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:31,460
and then they come out--

810
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,420
And then they just turn into like a sissy.

811
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,260
Beautiful sissies.

812
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,100
Yeah, yeah.

813
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,980
Yeah, that's basically what this website is.

814
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,420
Yeah.

815
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,620
And oh, you got, so okay, so yeah, you have to,

816
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,300
this clicker thing, yeah, it has to be focused over there.

817
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,940
Okay, all right, so this is the Sissy Factory.

818
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,920
And it says, okay, so let's be clear here.

819
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,540
The goal of this blog is to fill your mind

820
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,880
with new concepts and ideas

821
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,780
and turning you into a well-trained sissy,

822
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,680
to corrupt you, to play with your insecurities

823
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,280
and manipulate you little by little

824
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,880
until you realize it's too late.

825
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,880
I know you're way too afraid to really embrace your destiny.

826
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,720
It's all right.

827
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,440
Here, you can take all the time you need.

828
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,280
I know that you will come back again and again

829
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,800
unable to resist your urge, to your urge,

830
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,640
unable to resist to your true self.

831
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,620
Because no matter what happens, you keep coming back,

832
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,520
you keep looking for more, you keep surfing for sissy porn,

833
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,600
you keep fantasize about being a girl,

834
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,200
you keep having thoughts about submission.

835
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,620
It's probably not the first time you read this page.

836
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,080
Accept it.

837
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:26,960
I feel like you're reading this to us to maybe hypnotize us.

838
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,280
It's also, I'll say you didn't really stumble much.

839
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,840
It's almost like you had this thing memorized.

840
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,560
Yeah, I was reading it off the screen.

841
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,360
Yeah, but you just like, you hit every B,

842
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,480
you had all the right inflection.

843
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,320
Are you, you're--

844
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,140
Have you read this before?

845
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,980
You're not trying to corrupt us.

846
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,760
I had to go through it to make sure

847
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,600
it's suitable for the show.

848
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,240
You went through Sisyphication.

849
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,760
Well, no, I had to go through, no, okay,

850
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,200
I didn't go through, I had to go through the factory.

851
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,480
I had to like inspect it.

852
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,960
I'm like the health inspector.

853
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,720
Okay, but the health inspector usually

854
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:58,000
eats the food I think. Sure, but the health inspector doesn't usually turn into food.

855
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,840
That's a really good point. Not usually, unless it's a very bad restaurant. Yeah, so here's

856
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:10,680
some comments on this main page here. Okay. Shia1girl says, "I have been comming 10 times

857
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,520
a day on your blog since more than a year and can't stop. I really can't." It seems like

858
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:21,380
that might hurt your body to comm that much times. And two anonymous's say, "Just found

859
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:24,340
this place and we'll be back all the time and someone else says can't wait for

860
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:29,100
updates a new girly tasks. There's tasks on this website. Yeah. So it's kind of like

861
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,260
geocaching. Well I mean we'll get into what the tasks are I don't want you guys.

862
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:36,100
But I want to. I need you guys to kind of go through the process organically. Okay.

863
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,700
Alright. So are you, it really does seem like you're trying to sissy-fy at me. Yeah.

864
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:46,540
And hey I don't need to sissy-fy you guys at all. Okay. So a lot of these

865
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:52,820
commenters really like this website as you can see, but there are some who feel a little

866
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,700
differently which I think is the next one I put on here.

867
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:58,940
Yeah, fuck you, piss of shit, playing with our mind.

868
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:01,940
We straight, love girls.

869
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,780
So not everybody's on board so much with the process.

870
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,380
Fuck you, piss of shit.

871
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:10,500
I guess that's the other thing is like, this guy, how does he end up on this website in

872
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,500
the first place, right?

873
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,940
Because somebody who's not all that interested in becoming a sissy.

874
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,580
Imagine you stumble on this website by accident like a sorry imagine somebody yes

875
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:24,840
Stumbles on a website like this by accident random guy could any random young man

876
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,440
Yeah, of course stumbles on something like this on the internet

877
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,740
Maybe looking about googling funny top 10 list mm-hmm

878
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,140
And they end up on something like this and they find themselves

879
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:38,620
Sissified because the process that they went through was not under their control. That's a good point imagine

880
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:43,900
How much rage you must feel you probably bubbling with just just bubbling to the brim. Yeah, absolutely

881
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,580
To the right to the fill a little it just completely ready

882
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:53,960
We're only like a pot of noodles like a vat of lye. Oh, that's so fucking up like shakshuka. Yeah, just

883
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:01,060
Bubbling yeah your eggs inside it with those eggs inside of you as a sissy boy now. No you're not a sissy

884
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:05,100
No, you're mad that they're trying to make you yeah, yeah, I thought that you turned into it

885
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,820
No, you can I understand how any random guy could be oh I tried to Google thirsty

886
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:13,500
I tried to Google thirsty or I tried to I tried to I was okay

887
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:18,140
I was I yeah, I was good 60 year old looks like I googled anal play yeah

888
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:24,740
But and I found something I found a I found a list of ways to you know well. Yeah

889
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:32,180
Gory details I tried to Google sissy spasic movies and what came up was sissy gaping movies

890
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:37,620
What the hell happened here basically the internet is a dangerous place, and that's why yeah

891
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,980
- Yeah, if someone is trying to sissify you at every turn,

892
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,360
you don't know when stuff like this could happen

893
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,200
or where it could happen.

894
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,340
I mean, it can happen.

895
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,620
One second you're watching,

896
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:49,580
I can eat spicy food hypnosis.

897
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,180
Your YouTube auto plays,

898
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,940
I'm a girl.

899
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,060
- I'm a sissy dude hypnosis.

900
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,900
- I'm a girl.

901
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,380
- Yeah, yeah, no, it's scary.

902
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,780
- But I can eat spicy food though.

903
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,420
- That's true, which might be--

904
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,900
- Taco Bell, here I come.

905
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,740
- Is there a--

906
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,580
- Finally, I have enough spice tolerance.

907
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,280
I may be a complete sissy,

908
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,000
But I finally have enough spice tolerance to go to Taco Bell.

909
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,360
I can finally get a Mexican pizza.

910
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,680
I'm wondering if there's a--

911
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,960
Goddamn that auto play.

912
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,260
I had Taco Bell the other night.

913
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,040
I pooped more than I ever pooped in my life the next day.

914
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,540
Really?

915
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:21,680
Yeah, I just felt terrible after that.

916
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,520
I felt great.

917
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,960
I pooped literally more than I've ever pooped in my life.

918
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,640
OK, I'd like to say this really quickly.

919
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,560
That's the third story that you guys have told that is you two

920
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,880
and I wasn't there.

921
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,200
Well, you don't stay out late enough.

922
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,600
You guys go to Taco Bell--

923
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,320
Oh, yeah.

924
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,000
We have some weird-ish, dude.

925
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,680
Yeah, like this fucking damn list.

926
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:47,040
I was wondering, is there, do you think, I guess, no, because there can't be macho hypnosis,

927
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
right?

928
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
There can't be.

929
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
There's hypnosis for everything.

930
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
I guarantee it.

931
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:55,040
There is, okay, because there's, I mean, this seems to be a very big sub-sect, this seems

932
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,840
to be a very big community, but I'm wondering if there is the reverse community, which is

933
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:05,440
like people trying to, men or women trying to become...

934
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,840
Macho guys. The exact opposite which is like women trying to become

935
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:16,120
macho guys. I like 1000% guarantee that that is just fully an actual thing

936
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,480
in the way that you described it. There's so if you, I think it was...

937
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:23,920
Every action has an opposite reaction. Well no, there's just people, there are hypnosis videos for

938
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:27,560
literally everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah but you don't hear, you hear more about

939
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,720
about sissy hypnosis. You hear more about them but I guarantee it exists. You never in the

940
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,680
sissy hypnosis community you don't hear about the macho hypno community. Do you think there's

941
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,480
YouTube videos that can help me grow a horn? Yeah. I've been thinking about that. Grow horn

942
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,760
hypnosis. I've been really thinking about that. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I think that that is

943
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,760
something. Do you think it would work? I think I'd need to drink like a crazy amount of milk

944
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,240
for that to happen for me. Yeah. I don't remember what's next here. Let's see here. Oh yeah

945
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,240
Post more slush.

946
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Oh, that was posted the day before my birthday.

947
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:59,240
This person is, this is almost, they're trying to sissify the sissies.

948
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
Yeah, the factory.

949
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,240
The factory, the factory, yeah.

950
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Who owns, is it a sissy that owns a factory?

951
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
I don't think so.

952
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,240
Again, it's not usually.

953
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,240
I think it's a master.

954
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
If you're at the Doritos factory, a Dorito doesn't run the damn thing.

955
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,240
Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

956
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,240
The first sissy small business owner.

957
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
[laughter]

958
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I can't wait for the first sissy president.

959
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Yeah.

960
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,240
That's gonna be huge.

961
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,240
Oh, well, no, because that was Herbert Hoover, right?

962
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
The FBI guy.

963
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,160
- Hoffarth, you don't think he might have been?

964
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,420
(laughing)

965
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,240
- You don't think he might have been his,

966
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,720
more like putting the sissy president on a dollar bill

967
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,960
and doing like a kissy face?

968
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:31,800
- Hoffarth.

969
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,640
- Hoffarth.

970
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,600
- What's the Herbert Hoover, is that a conspiracy

971
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,680
that he would wear like ladies underwear?

972
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,240
- No.

973
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,080
- So he did?

974
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,480
- We don't talk about conspiracies or support things

975
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,320
like that on this show.

976
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,140
- Yeah, no thanks.

977
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,960
- It's not okay to talk about presidents in that way.

978
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,120
- Herbert Hoover was the president of the FBI though.

979
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,560
- He's a president of anything.

980
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,400
- Yeah.

981
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,920
- It's not okay to demean them.

982
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,960
- How about you check your democratic politics

983
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,240
over at the door there, buddy.

984
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,080
- Yeah.

985
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,480
- 'Cause we're trying to get sissified right now.

986
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:02,320
Okay, so we got--

987
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,160
- I think you're trying to get sissified.

988
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,360
- Here's the actual list we're doing.

989
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,680
- I'm not trying to get sissified.

990
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,560
- Here's the actual list we're doing, okay?

991
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:10,000
10 things not really manly you should do.

992
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,840
- Okay.

993
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,660
- Hello, sweetie.

994
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,500
- Hi.

995
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,340
- Today you're going to, so all right,

996
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,160
already working on Pat.

997
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,000
- What?

998
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:15,840
- Didn't even do anything.

999
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,880
- Did I say something? - Yeah, voice, yeah.

1000
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,360
- Today you're going to learn how to appear more girly.

1001
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,840
If you want to be a better sissy, you must think as a female.

1002
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:24,320
In fact, you must be overly feminine.

1003
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:28,440
You must be a stereotype of the woman.

1004
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,320
- Okay, so what are even some women's stereotypes?

1005
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
I'm not even-- - Shopping.

1006
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,160
- Shopping is big, probably. - Shoplifting.

1007
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,560
- Okay, true shoplifting is--

1008
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,520
- Well, let's take a look here.

1009
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,560
Let's see what the first thing is on this list.

1010
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,440
- Being too tired.

1011
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,640
- Oh wait, this is not, okay, so, but how?

1012
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,600
I mean, this is here, we're gonna get some information here.

1013
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,480
But how?

1014
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,080
Well, it's very simple, princess.

1015
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,600
- No, thank you for calling me that.

1016
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,440
Thank you for calling me that.

1017
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,520
- Thank you for calling you that.

1018
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,320
You just have to add some girly behavior

1019
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,240
to your everyday life.

1020
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,760
Everything you do must be overly feminine.

1021
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,980
At first, it will ask some efforts,

1022
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,120
but very soon your mind will change.

1023
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:03,360
Your brain will make new connections.

1024
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,920
You can change the way you think

1025
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,760
by constant repetition of this girly behavior.

1026
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,640
You could even not notice it at first

1027
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,640
because we are talking about the long term,

1028
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,280
but it will affect your psyche, your mind, and personality.

1029
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,880
Here's a list of 10 things to add in your attitude.

1030
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,000
- Okay, so I-- - Ready?

1031
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,040
- I'd just like to say, even before this goes any further,

1032
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,140
this is not working on me.

1033
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,800
This is like the last thing I'm interested in, I think.

1034
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,520
- Right, and so it says it's long-term,

1035
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,000
so you wouldn't actually notice a change yet.

1036
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,040
- But I mean like, first-- - So it was working on you.

1037
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:35,000
- So far, first item and shit, it's like, pfft, don't care.

1038
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,240
- You don't even care?

1039
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,080
- I mean, that is-- - This isn't the first--

1040
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,920
- It's not working on me either.

1041
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:38,740
- This also isn't the first--

1042
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,840
This is not the first item.

1043
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,840
- It's just, but-- - This is,

1044
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,680
we haven't even gotten to the first item yet.

1045
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,760
first item here. But I barely feel anything. You barely feel anything? Barely nothing.

1046
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:51,120
So go ahead, test me. Test you? Okay. Yeah. Alright, well let's look at what the first

1047
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:58,120
thing is here. One, tears come really easy. And all these are by the way are gifts. Okay.

1048
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:03,400
But I couldn't, I didn't want you to, we can't go to this actual website because the amount

1049
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:11,400
of pornography and buttholes that are winking and flexing at the screen is unsuitable.

1050
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:15,520
You always see that in porn and you're like, "How do they do that?"

1051
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,520
Yeah.

1052
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,520
Easy.

1053
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,520
You can flex your butthole?

1054
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,520
Yeah.

1055
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,520
What?

1056
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,720
What kind of ass kegel do you have to-- what exercise to flex your butthole?

1057
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:23,720
Mine just opens up like a--

1058
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:24,720
Shit, shit in a lot.

1059
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,720
Yeah.

1060
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,400
Mine opens up like a garbage disposal and then just closes.

1061
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,880
It's really bad.

1062
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Yeah.

1063
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,880
Mine beatboxes.

1064
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,880
If I'm farting.

1065
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,880
True.

1066
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:35,880
Come on.

1067
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:39,080
You would think that the sissy website wouldn't have so much god damn pornography on it.

1068
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,880
You'd think it would have more good advice.

1069
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,880
Yeah.

1070
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Right.

1071
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,400
Well, this list has no pornography in it at all, but I just didn't want to be on this

1072
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,480
website because there really is something around every corner.

1073
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,600
There is a thing going in a thing or a thing coming out of a thing.

1074
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,600
It's really...

1075
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,600
Really tip toe.

1076
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,160
It's really, yeah, it's dangerous.

1077
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,320
Try to be overly sensitive and show your emotions.

1078
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,620
For too long, you've learned to hide your feelings.

1079
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,880
From now on, you will show where you're sad, happy, or excited.

1080
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:11,320
Crying at the end of a romance movie is something you should be proud of.

1081
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:12,320
Okay.

1082
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,320
Yeah, it's not really for me.

1083
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,800
I have more cry at the end of like sports and dad movies.

1084
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,960
But you do cry?

1085
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,560
In like my own kind of stoic way.

1086
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:22,640
Dad movies like what?

1087
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,960
Like the daddies gets hurt.

1088
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,960
The daddies?

1089
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:27,960
Or have you been watching a movie called The Daddies?

1090
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:30,360
I know like the dad, the fathers, sorry.

1091
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,040
So like the daddies or fathers get--

1092
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:33,920
Oh, the founding, oh Lincoln.

1093
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,760
Lincoln makes me--

1094
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:35,600
Hoffarth.

1095
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:36,420
Hoffarth, Lincoln.

1096
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:37,260
(laughing)

1097
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,580
Hoffarth biopic.

1098
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,420
You know who would have been great, rest in peace,

1099
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,260
Philip Seymour Hoffarth.

1100
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,400
Oh my god, yeah, look at how--

1101
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,240
He would have been incredible.

1102
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,640
He would have been a perfect Hoffarth.

1103
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:47,520
For Hoffarth.

1104
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,080
So that's pretty sad.

1105
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:51,360
But I don't even really wanna think about that.

1106
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:52,200
Yeah.

1107
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,480
I'm fucking Hoffarth.

1108
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:55,720
(laughing)

1109
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,560
Fuck man.

1110
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,560
I'm gonna be on the fucking $100 bill.

1111
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:02,560
I need to go across the fucking Delaware somewhere.

1112
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:03,560
We're gonna fu-

1113
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,560
No, that's not what Hoffarth did.

1114
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,560
Hoffarth didn't do that.

1115
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,560
What did Hoffarth do?

1116
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,560
All he did was take a picture, a painting of himself.

1117
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:09,560
Yeah.

1118
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,560
To be on the $100 bill.

1119
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,560
He took a picture.

1120
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:12,560
He died the next day.

1121
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:13,560
He took a picture and he-

1122
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,560
He was the guy, he was, he was, Benjamin Franklin was, was sick that day and he, they were like,

1123
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:21,560
"We need to paint this today so it can go, we can send it to the press."

1124
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,560
And he was just, he was just off to the side and he was like, "Oh fuck, man, I guess you

1125
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,880
Yeah, he invented he also invented gravy

1126
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:37,080
We're gonna fucking add flour to fucking bacon fat oh

1127
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:44,840
Yeah, this is all a fucking yeah that way he was he was I mean one of the he's a founding father for a reason

1128
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
Yeah, yeah, I'll say that much

1129
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:54,200
What's next on here to have a diary? Okay, so I don't have a diary. I have a notebook. You know, it's a diary. No

1130
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,800
It's not really a diary, I put ideas in it.

1131
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,800
It's a diary.

1132
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:07,800
I guess the difference between a diary and a notebook is a diary I guess doesn't have that, it has less ideas, more of a recounting.

1133
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,800
Yeah.

1134
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,800
I've never thought about that.

1135
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:15,800
The notebook is nice, but I will say I fucking hate when my little brother breaks into it.

1136
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Yeah.

1137
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:17,800
It pisses me off.

1138
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Oh, because the...

1139
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,800
The lock on it.

1140
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,800
Yeah.

1141
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:21,800
The heart-shaped lock.

1142
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,680
It's like, okay, I get that you're mischievous and shit,

1143
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,800
but that's literally my personal ideas are in my notebook,

1144
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:30,760
so please leave those alone.

1145
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,720
- Yeah, exactly.

1146
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,200
Theories, diagrams.

1147
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,840
- I'm putting, there's math in there and stuff.

1148
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:35,680
- That type of thing.

1149
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:37,200
- There's a lot of numbers and measurements.

1150
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,040
- Yeah.

1151
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:42,180
- In the past, many people regularly kept a personal diary.

1152
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,220
It's a great way to record your thoughts and feelings,

1153
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:46,620
like why you've cried at the end of this particular movie.

1154
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:49,560
Try to write few lines a day about girly things you've done

1155
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,920
and use as much color as you can.

1156
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,760
It seems like crying at the end of a movie is a big thing into sissy hypnosis.

1157
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:00,080
What was the last movie y'all cried at?

1158
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:02,840
Probably it would have to be...

1159
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,920
Oh, let me think about this.

1160
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,760
Probably it would have to be...

1161
00:47:06,760 --> 00:47:08,840
Hold on, let me think for a second.

1162
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:09,840
Think about it.

1163
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,840
Probably...

1164
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,840
Well, hold on, let me think.

1165
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,840
You have all the time you need.

1166
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:13,840
You don't have to keep asking.

1167
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:14,840
Yeah, let me think.

1168
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,760
Yeah, I never cried at a movie.

1169
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,240
I just went through all the movies I ever watched.

1170
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,080
- Oh really?

1171
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:22,320
- That's why it took me so long, yeah.

1172
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,600
- I think when I was a kid I cried at Click

1173
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,040
and I cried at Shrek.

1174
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,040
And I think I also cried at The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.

1175
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,360
Those were probably the big three.

1176
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:32,640
- I cried at Bridge to Terabithia.

1177
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,960
- Yeah, I thought that, I remember my friend Joma

1178
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,520
cried at that and I accused him of having a crush

1179
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,360
on the girl.

1180
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,180
- No way.

1181
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,020
- Right?

1182
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:44,720
- I cannot tell you, my little nerdy kid asked,

1183
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,320
I can't tell you how mad I was.

1184
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,520
'Cause I had read the book of Bridge to Terabithia

1185
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:50,800
before the movie, of course.

1186
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,520
And they make up a fantasy world,

1187
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,400
and they're playing, how fucking mad I was

1188
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,480
that there was no dragons or giants in that movie.

1189
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,480
- And also-- - That they play in a treehouse.

1190
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,880
- Show the girl dying.

1191
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,440
- Yeah, make her hit her head on the rock.

1192
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,280
- Yeah, blood.

1193
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,840
- Do a Mortal Kombat x-ray attack.

1194
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,680
- Yeah, exactly.

1195
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:07,800
Get a close up of a blue bone breaking in half.

1196
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,120
- And a health bar going down.

1197
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:09,960
- Yeah, yeah.

1198
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:12,560
- I don't think I've ever really cried in a movie.

1199
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,840
- I already said that, so.

1200
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,160
- No, I don't think I've ever been able

1201
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,440
to suspend my disbelief enough in a movie.

1202
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:18,940
Shut up.

1203
00:48:18,940 --> 00:48:21,940
That's got to be one of the lamest things you've ever said.

1204
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,940
Yeah, I can't believe that you said that.

1205
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:30,440
I've never been able to suspend my disbelief enough.

1206
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:30,940
Aww.

1207
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:34,440
I'm just in pure disbelief. I can't even cry.

1208
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:35,940
My disbelief is too active.

1209
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,440
I'm not crying because this didn't really happen.

1210
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,440
Yeah, it's too just nothing's actually happening.

1211
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:42,440
When I see Tom Hanks on screen in a movie,

1212
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:43,440
I'm not crying.

1213
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:46,940
I'm never thinking, "That's Sully Sullenberger."

1214
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:49,180
I'm thinking that's Tom Hanks playing Sully Sullenberg.

1215
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:53,100
And that's and what makes you cry is to really believe that something is currently happening.

1216
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:53,420
Yeah.

1217
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:55,020
It's not to have a sad emotion or anything like that.

1218
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:56,540
You might be like a sociopath.

1219
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:57,660
Yeah, that's kind of scary.

1220
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:00,300
No, I cried at a video of a dog once.

1221
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:00,940
But that's real, right?

1222
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:01,820
Dog getting...

1223
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:02,140
But the fact that...

1224
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,900
You don't cry at anything that has a...

1225
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,420
Have you ever cried at a sad song?

1226
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:07,020
No.

1227
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:07,740
Yeah.

1228
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,300
What song?

1229
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,700
Um, "Pop Goes the Weasel."

1230
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:11,580
That is sad.

1231
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,660
Because you realize they're not playing the song live.

1232
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,900
Yeah.

1233
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:15,180
It's an mp3 file.

1234
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:16,060
Well, that's what's sad about it.

1235
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:16,780
Or a flack.

1236
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,700
- Is that their, oh, I wish I could've heard them play

1237
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,420
Pop Goes the Weasel live.

1238
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,660
- I wish this was a flack.

1239
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:22,500
- Oh.

1240
00:49:22,500 --> 00:49:23,400
- It's too compressed.

1241
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:28,340
- Okay, and let's see here.

1242
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,060
Three love gossips.

1243
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:31,020
- Okay. - Yeah.

1244
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,360
- I do love gossiping.

1245
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,340
- You have to show a special interest to gossip.

1246
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:36,500
You must know every detail about the new girl or guy

1247
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,900
everyone is speaking about.

1248
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,100
You have to speak about Caleb, too.

1249
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:40,940
- Okay, that's not.

1250
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,060
- Did you know that Angelina and Brat

1251
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,540
were living in a new house?

1252
00:49:44,540 --> 00:49:47,460
(laughter)

1253
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,620
- You have to speak about futile details

1254
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:50,780
and be jealous of course.

1255
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,080
- This was clearly written by somebody

1256
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,980
who's midway through their sissification journey.

1257
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:55,460
They're not getting the details correct.

1258
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,220
- Well no, no, Brett is Brad Pitt's name

1259
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,140
after he got sissified.

1260
00:49:59,140 --> 00:49:59,980
- But there's no--

1261
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,820
- True sissy fans know that.

1262
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:03,140
- Or somebody's halfway between the macho and the sissy,

1263
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,780
they're saying Angelina and Brat.

1264
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,220
They're thinking about sausages still.

1265
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:08,300
- Oh, they're thinking about the sausage

1266
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,660
that's gonna go in their butt.

1267
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:11,060
- Oh, that could be sissy.

1268
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,620
Back to sissy mode.

1269
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,460
It's a good point.

1270
00:50:13,460 --> 00:50:16,260
- Yeah, let's see what's next here.

1271
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,300
For drink girly alcohol only.

1272
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,700
And I want you to read this quote for us.

1273
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:21,940
- Everything that has been listed so far

1274
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:25,020
has been something that I do.

1275
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,260
- That you do?

1276
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,300
You already said you don't cry at movies.

1277
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:30,380
You don't keep a diary.

1278
00:50:30,380 --> 00:50:31,220
- Yeah, you don't do any of this stuff.

1279
00:50:31,220 --> 00:50:33,420
- It's the last, you gossip and drink.

1280
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,260
(laughing)

1281
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,580
- Yeah, I guess you know what?

1282
00:50:36,580 --> 00:50:37,900
I guess it's the last two.

1283
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:39,140
- Yeah.

1284
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:40,980
- Pink wine. - His brain's already resetting.

1285
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:43,460
Pink wine makes me slutty.

1286
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,620
Yeah, do it in maybe her voice.

1287
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:47,220
I don't remember what she sounds like.

1288
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,060
Pink wine makes me slutty.

1289
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:50,880
Pink wine makes me slutty.

1290
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,100
That's what Jordan Peterson.

1291
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,100
Oh, it makes me bloody slutty.

1292
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:57,820
Pink wine turns me into a complete slut.

1293
00:50:57,820 --> 00:50:58,660
I turn into a complete, sissy slut.

1294
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,700
They're being sissified by bloody pink wine,

1295
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,420
it makes me a slut?

1296
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:04,940
No, I don't remember who that is.

1297
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:09,940
When you introduce pink wine, it turns me to a total slut.

1298
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,780
- Total slut.

1299
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,460
(laughing)

1300
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,900
- He was in slut rehab for a while, I heard.

1301
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:16,820
(laughing)

1302
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:18,540
He was acting like too much of a slut.

1303
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:20,180
- Jordan Peterson was addicted,

1304
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:22,380
his daughter got him addicted to pink wine.

1305
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,860
- Yeah, and addicted to lipstick.

1306
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:24,900
- Yeah.

1307
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:27,100
- And then I started to put on lipstick,

1308
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:30,060
and it turned me into a total and complete slut.

1309
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:32,260
(laughing)

1310
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,300
- What do they mean by girly alcohol?

1311
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:36,980
- Fruity drinks are the only alcoholic beverages for you,

1312
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,540
with a glass of wine, of course.

1313
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:43,160
The way you drink is also important. Try to be as classy as possible when you're drinking

1314
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,380
your second Cosmo. By the way, have you read the last issue?

1315
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:49,660
Okay, so they're saying you can't order... See, this is an important...

1316
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:55,720
So you can get a Cosmo, but you also have to get a glass of wine. So when you're drinking,

1317
00:51:55,720 --> 00:52:01,100
you have a martini glass in one hand, and then the other hand you're holding wine. So

1318
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:08,520
it's like rose and then a fruity girl... like an espresso martini or something. So basically,

1319
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,920
You just have to be an alcoholic too.

1320
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,920
You just gotta get fucked up.

1321
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:12,920
Yeah.

1322
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:13,920
Yeah.

1323
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,920
You gotta also be a light.

1324
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:17,960
You have to be one of these girls who drinks one beer and is like, "Ahh."

1325
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:18,960
But not beer.

1326
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,960
We're not talking about beer.

1327
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:20,960
But not beer.

1328
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,440
Unless it's a mixed beer.

1329
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,440
Mixed beer.

1330
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Yeah.

1331
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,440
Ooh.

1332
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:27,440
A mixed beer.

1333
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:28,440
I'm kind of interested in that.

1334
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,440
A mixed beer.

1335
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
Candy and beer.

1336
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,560
It's Bud Light and it's Coors Light and it's a splash of Miller Light.

1337
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:37,720
I will say, I think I'm approaching this.

1338
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,420
(laughing)

1339
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,420
- That's a good idea.

1340
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:41,880
(laughing)

1341
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,800
- Dropping a Jolly Rancher into this beer thing

1342
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:47,640
like it's a fucking, like it's lean.

1343
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,080
- Dude, what'd you just put in my drink?

1344
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:49,920
No, it was a Jolly Rancher.

1345
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:51,600
(laughing)

1346
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,280
No, I just put a, no, I'm serious.

1347
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,680
It was literally a Jolly Rancher.

1348
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,000
- It was actually just a Jolly Rancher.

1349
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:58,480
(laughing)

1350
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,200
- Five, spend time with girls.

1351
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:01,040
- No thank you.

1352
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,280
- The more time you spend with girls,

1353
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,160
the more you will get used to the things they do,

1354
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,260
the way they talk or think will become normal for you

1355
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:07,280
in no time.

1356
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,200
You will learn what they like and their hobbies.

1357
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,480
Of course, you should spend some time

1358
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,640
with the most feminine girls you know.

1359
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:15,200
- I'm spending time with them right now.

1360
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,080
- You and me.

1361
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:21,040
- Yeah, yeah.

1362
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,860
- And they're in my head.

1363
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:23,720
(laughing)

1364
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:25,000
- It's Tinkerbell.

1365
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,320
- Tinkerbell was bad.

1366
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,680
- She was feminine as fuck.

1367
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:30,920
- She was bad, bro.

1368
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:31,840
She was bad.

1369
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,200
- She was feminine as fuck, dude.

1370
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,440
- She actually was.

1371
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,560
Tinkerbell was yeah fucking bad. I do bet she liked girly drinks

1372
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:42,360
Definitely kept a diary

1373
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:45,960
Do not use a harsh language or curse words. What are you talking about?

1374
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:51,760
That's what it says like hose always say that yeah, we're not talking about hose you're right sissy's mother not talking about

1375
00:53:51,760 --> 00:54:00,180
Distinction you're right. Let's get one thing fucking straight. I'm sorry. Hey, you know sometimes I you know this new world

1376
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:05,080
Hey, let's get one thing straight, and let's get one guy on straight. It's not working on me

1377
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:07,240
I'm not becoming a sissified girl.

1378
00:54:07,240 --> 00:54:08,740
Thank you very much.

1379
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:09,580
- That's very simple.

1380
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,120
No curse word, it's not elegant.

1381
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,220
And you want to be an elegant princess, don't you?

1382
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,160
- I'm gonna do male-- - A sissy would be too

1383
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:17,440
scared to wield the sword of fuck.

1384
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,140
- I'm gonna do masculine affirmations for myself.

1385
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:22,720
- Dude, the sword of fuck is one of my favorite weapons

1386
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:27,040
in one of those irreverent, earthbound inspired

1387
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,880
comedy RPGs. - Sunset Overdrive.

1388
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,920
- This is just making me want to do even more manly stuff

1389
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,360
like drink a, or have a hot dog.

1390
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,760
Like play with your hands.

1391
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,760
A hot dog? It makes you want to have a hot dog?

1392
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,960
Yeah, just fucking gulp a hot dog down.

1393
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,560
What's more manly than that?

1394
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:42,560
Okay, so we're talking about-

1395
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,760
At a football game!

1396
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:46,960
I just want to go and watch a football game and have a hot dog and gulp it down.

1397
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:49,960
Yeah, he'll be at the girls football game.

1398
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:51,760
Yeah, to jack off!

1399
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,160
Yeah, the flag football game.

1400
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,160
Yeah, I'll be at the girls football game to fucking jack off in the audience, asshole.

1401
00:54:57,160 --> 00:54:58,560
Yeah, he will be a cheerleader.

1402
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:00,760
Yeah, he's gonna be at the flag football game and guess what?

1403
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,760
He's gonna have all the snacks cut up.

1404
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:03,600
- Not true.

1405
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,420
- I'm gonna be a--

1406
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:06,220
- I don't need a guy to cut my snacks up for me.

1407
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,460
- Hey guys, just a heads up,

1408
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,460
I'm gonna be a cheerleader this year.

1409
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:11,380
A leader of cheer at Christmas cheer.

1410
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:13,560
I'm gonna be one of the cheeriest Christmas celebrators

1411
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,900
of the entire world.

1412
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,900
- You know, I could actually believe something like that.

1413
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:18,780
- Yeah.

1414
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,360
- Okay, the next one is seven smile often.

1415
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,260
- Not my thing.

1416
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,640
- Smiling is a way to show your feeling

1417
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:28,060
and also not to appear as an alpha man.

1418
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,340
You must smile more and more to look offensive.

1419
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,900
If someone pushes you, just smile and...

1420
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:35,020
What's... I'm hanging on the edge of my seat.

1421
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:37,740
It was probably like a gif of somebody...

1422
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,660
Oh, sucking a cotch.

1423
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:40,700
No, there was nothing.

1424
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,260
There was nothing?

1425
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:41,740
Yeah, there was nothing.

1426
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,460
It just said, "Smile and..."?

1427
00:55:43,460 --> 00:55:44,300
Yeah.

1428
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,620
I got me hanging on the edge of my...

1429
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:46,860
I mean, not hanging... I don't care.

1430
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:48,780
This is a sissy trick.

1431
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:49,780
I'm not tricking you.

1432
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,060
Sissies don't trick.

1433
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:51,780
Sissies get tricked.

1434
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,140
You just said, "I'm not tricking you.

1435
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,660
Sissies don't trick," which means that you're a sissy.

1436
00:55:56,660 --> 00:55:57,660
I didn't say that.

1437
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,920
(laughing)

1438
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,980
- Swipset doesn't, that word, swipset doesn't work.

1439
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:04,820
(mumbling)

1440
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:05,660
(laughing)

1441
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:06,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

1442
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,300
- All right, I'm gonna get you one day.

1443
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,260
You can be a sissy, I'll hold you down.

1444
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,220
- Always say sorry.

1445
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:16,460
- Oh, that's the next one. - That's what the and is.

1446
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,860
- Always say sorry, I'm sorry.

1447
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:19,860
That's what it says.

1448
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:21,980
- I'm getting you.

1449
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:23,900
- You're getting me what?

1450
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,540
- Getting me a bag of smart food?

1451
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,220
- No, I'm not gonna get you.

1452
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,100
If I do, I'd have to cut it up and maybe chew it,

1453
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,180
feed you like a baby bird.

1454
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,660
By the end of this, dude, you're gonna be fully sissy'd.

1455
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:33,940
- I'm, check this out.

1456
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,940
- Damn, he actually, yeah, we got it like that.

1457
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:37,780
- Yeah.

1458
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:39,320
- We got a 28-pack of chips.

1459
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,460
Not that big of a deal. - I don't even care.

1460
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,740
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'd throw shit like that.

1461
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,580
- Doesn't fucking matter. - That might break

1462
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,340
some of the corns. - Hey, cut to the wide shot.

1463
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,260
- Fuck. - I don't even give a fuck.

1464
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:48,300
You see that throw, too?

1465
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,380
Manly throw. - That was--

1466
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,620
- Not like a girl at all.

1467
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:52,820
- It's perfect form.

1468
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:56,060
- Always say sorry, I'm sorry.

1469
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,120
Even if it's not your fault,

1470
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,180
even if you have no reason to apologize,

1471
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:01,340
saying sorry must be one of your gimmicks.

1472
00:57:01,340 --> 00:57:03,700
You should always sound like you're begging.

1473
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,100
- Ugh.

1474
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:06,140
- Okay. - Oh.

1475
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:06,980
- No.

1476
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:08,180
- I might have to try that.

1477
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,020
(laughing)

1478
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,860
- Okay.

1479
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,900
- Ah.

1480
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,740
- Let's begin.

1481
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:13,240
- Okay, Ash.

1482
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,300
- Okay.

1483
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:16,580
- How would you, I mean, always sound like you're begging?

1484
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:19,680
Like in every situation?

1485
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:20,520
- Yeah.

1486
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,340
- That's hard.

1487
00:57:21,340 --> 00:57:24,420
- Yeah, I guess.

1488
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,820
Like, how do you say like, hello in bed?

1489
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,940
- Hello. - Can I say hi to you?

1490
00:57:28,940 --> 00:57:30,420
- Please, can I say hi?

1491
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,140
- That's exactly, yeah, that's, that's.

1492
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,980
- Girls don't do that. - You nailed it.

1493
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:34,540
You nailed it instantly with one try.

1494
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:36,900
- No, I don't act, I don't have a natural.

1495
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:38,260
- Yeah, what would that even sound like?

1496
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:41,060
(laughing)

1497
00:57:41,060 --> 00:57:43,140
- No, it didn't work out.

1498
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,220
No, I don't know what the, no.

1499
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,940
- Okay, be too obsessive about cleaning.

1500
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,700
That's not me, my fucking clothes are dirty all the time.

1501
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,100
Not only you hate dust, but you should look overly disturbed

1502
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,320
when something is messy.

1503
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,040
Clean a bit, even if you're at a restaurant

1504
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:02,900
or at a friend's place.

1505
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:04,740
If someone asks you why you're doing this,

1506
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,380
just say, "Sorry, I can't help it."

1507
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:07,620
Yeah, I'm afraid of dust.

1508
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,460
No, I hate cleaning fucking dust.

1509
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:10,740
I hate dust because the mites are too big.

1510
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:11,860
Yeah, it's not my thing.

1511
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,700
I don't like mites.

1512
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:15,700
See, I don't care that this fucking, this table's filthy.

1513
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,060
There's cables everywhere, it doesn't bother me at all.

1514
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,580
I don't care at all about any of that.

1515
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,540
Not a big deal to me.

1516
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,280
- I was gonna put something on the table,

1517
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,100
but then I don't really have much to grab over.

1518
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:28,940
- Yeah, there's not too much to put on the table.

1519
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:29,780
- Yeah.

1520
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,020
- Oh, nevermind.

1521
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:31,880
I thought I saw something.

1522
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:32,720
It was nothing.

1523
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:36,580
Number 10, don't be afraid of being dumb or silly.

1524
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,420
Okay.

1525
00:58:37,420 --> 00:58:38,240
- Okay.

1526
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:40,160
- I'm pretty sure most of you are pretty smart,

1527
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,540
so it's not going to be easy,

1528
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:43,660
but there is some way to achieve this.

1529
00:58:43,660 --> 00:58:45,780
You can stop having an answer to everything.

1530
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,540
Relax and speak spontaneously.

1531
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,920
Acting silly is fun.

1532
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,000
Don't be afraid to look silly.

1533
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,320
You can even pretend if you want.

1534
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:53,160
The key is to ease your mind

1535
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:55,000
and stop trying to solve any problems.

1536
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,600
- Kind of a zen.

1537
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:57,440
- Yeah.

1538
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,880
- Of a zen situation.

1539
00:58:58,880 --> 00:58:59,720
- Yeah, no it is.

1540
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:01,420
- Honestly, that one, pretty good advice.

1541
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,720
- Not bad advice, it's not bad life advice in general.

1542
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,700
I think even non-sissies like us

1543
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:09,640
could probably find something.

1544
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,120
- Yeah, non-sissies like us.

1545
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:14,640
- Yeah, yeah, could probably find something to gain from.

1546
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:16,780
- Everything on this list, now that I think about it,

1547
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:17,720
maybe all 10.

1548
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:20,080
- Yeah, you know, most of them has a little, you know,

1549
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,980
it's like, yeah, you know, a couple of things.

1550
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:23,480
It's like, you know, what they say about

1551
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,120
every religious text has little nuggets of truth in it.

1552
00:59:26,120 --> 00:59:27,200
- Right. - So like,

1553
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,920
Bible, the golden rule, Islam,

1554
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:32,600
it's like Muhammad was the number one guy, you know.

1555
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,280
Like, you can learn a little bit from the sissy thing.

1556
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:38,760
Not, you don't have to take everything so seriously,

1557
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,880
you know, but-- - The sissy king.

1558
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,560
- The sissy thing, they got something.

1559
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,240
- The sissy thing of ours.

1560
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:46,080
- All right, well, that's pretty much it, right?

1561
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:46,920
Is there anything else?

1562
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,160
- Yeah, there's a few things here.

1563
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:49,520
- Okay, show me. - You should go through.

1564
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,040
You know what you have to do now, sissy.

1565
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,000
See you soon.

1566
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:52,840
- Okay.

1567
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:54,040
- Okay, look what Patrick just did.

1568
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,000
- What? - So he's saying so,

1569
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,160
I'm again-- - Completely, completely.

1570
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,000
I'm just gonna try this slide again.

1571
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,160
- It's working on anyone?

1572
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,600
- So I'm just gonna throw this slide up again.

1573
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,560
- Okay.

1574
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:02,000
- All right, don't wait. - Okay, that's interesting.

1575
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,360
- I'm not gonna say don't.

1576
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,080
- I mean, you need to just--

1577
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:05,920
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1578
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,240
- Let me just try one more time here,

1579
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,400
'cause, okay, so three times, that's kind of--

1580
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,160
- Three times what?

1581
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,520
Okay, never mind.

1582
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,320
So we're just gonna move on here.

1583
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:15,840
There's a few comments I wanted to read.

1584
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:18,000
I practically do she all these things now.

1585
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,680
Well, what they're saying is I do she things.

1586
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:22,240
Yeah, she all.

1587
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,040
She all, all she all.

1588
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:25,560
Everything I do is a she thing now.

1589
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,320
Everything is a she thing.

1590
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,280
Shell.

1591
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:29,440
Or shell things, yeah.

1592
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,880
Thank you, training accomplished.

1593
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,640
Well, that guy, you should get,

1594
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:34,720
do you think you get like a diploma when you're sissified?

1595
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:35,640
That would be huge.

1596
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:36,480
Yeah.

1597
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:37,300
I would not like to have that.

1598
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,140
Well, that would be very small.

1599
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,720
That would be, is good about it.

1600
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,800
That's what the sissy thing is.

1601
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:41,960
- They like small stuff?

1602
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,960
- Yeah, it's like a little cute little dollhouse thing.

1603
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,800
You know?

1604
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:50,200
- I'm Janine Spades and I've completed the training.

1605
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,260
- That's a good name.

1606
01:00:51,260 --> 01:00:54,640
- You should have--

1607
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:57,240
- I still did anonymous for the username.

1608
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,840
- Are they accredited?

1609
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,680
- Janine Spades.

1610
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:00,520
- An accredited sissy.

1611
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:01,800
- Do you think my credits would transfer

1612
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:03,440
to the sissy factory?

1613
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,680
- I've been in a macho factory for a little bit.

1614
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:06,900
- Yeah, but I kinda wanna transfer.

1615
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:08,680
Probably not a lot of things.

1616
01:01:08,680 --> 01:01:10,240
- Yeah, and here's, I think this is,

1617
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,540
Yeah, this is the last one.

1618
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,600
Hello, I just wanted to let,

1619
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:14,000
I wanted to just let you know,

1620
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,280
you've inspired me to write.

1621
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,680
I really like the way you write and train us sissies.

1622
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:18,840
Thank you for the content.

1623
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:19,680
- Wow.

1624
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,920
- That's so funny to me to go through this entire website.

1625
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:24,640
It's like how to become an anal submissive slave.

1626
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,160
And you're like, I should be a writer.

1627
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,200
(laughing)

1628
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,440
This makes me want to be an author.

1629
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,160
- You know that novel I've been thinking of.

1630
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:33,400
- Just a completely different type of hypnosis.

1631
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,400
- Yeah, writer's hypnosis.

1632
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,320
- Yeah.

1633
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,360
- Speaking of hypnosis,

1634
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,720
I feel like the plasma ball is kind of hypnotizing me.

1635
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:41,500
Can you cut to the plasma ball really quick?

1636
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,520
And I have something to say while the plasma ball is on.

1637
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:44,400
- Go back this way?

1638
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,580
- Yeah.

1639
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,100
You will subscribe to the podcast about list Patreon.

1640
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,920
You will give money to the podcast about list Patreon

1641
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:57,000
where video episodes are being uploaded every week.

1642
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,720
That's right, the video episodes are not just on the YouTube

1643
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:06,720
they're actually also, they are on the Patreon

1644
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:09,520
which has plenty of video episodes for you to look at.

1645
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,680
It's only one so far, but soon there will be millions.

1646
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:14,240
And you will want to subscribe there

1647
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:15,740
because big things will be happening.

1648
01:02:15,740 --> 01:02:18,680
And at some point, maybe even behind the scenes things

1649
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:20,820
of other things may be on the Patreon,

1650
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:23,740
or even footage of things you couldn't even imagine

1651
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,580
will be on there.

1652
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,800
And on the Patreon, it's not uploaded to YouTube,

1653
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:29,880
so we're able to look at porn live on episodes.

1654
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,780
We can look at pornographic websites

1655
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:35,280
and show a butt with a plug or a pussy with a finger.

1656
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:36,720
- And you know what?

1657
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,120
And I'm gonna say this right now.

1658
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:43,120
If you subscribe to our $3,000, I think it's still called--

1659
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,400
- It's Filipino Mr. Bean, I believe.

1660
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,520
- You get to come to the studio and touch the plasma ball.

1661
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:52,360
- Yes, look how fun the plasma ball is to touch.

1662
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,080
- If you give us $3,000 a month,

1663
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,920
you will be allowed to come in here,

1664
01:02:56,920 --> 01:02:59,120
touch this plasma ball as much as you want.

1665
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:00,900
You can do this trick with it.

1666
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:01,740
Wait, wait, hold on.

1667
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:02,780
- Okay, do that, yeah.

1668
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,740
Okay, now just make it look really hypnotic right now, okay?

1669
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:06,900
You will give us money.

1670
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:08,220
You will watch us YouTube.

1671
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,900
You will listen to us audio.

1672
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,780
You will look at our RSS feed.

1673
01:03:11,780 --> 01:03:13,940
You will like us all.

1674
01:03:13,940 --> 01:03:16,380
Okay, well, I think that about covers--

1675
01:03:16,380 --> 01:03:17,220
- That'll do it.

1676
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:18,100
- Everything, right?

1677
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,020
Yeah, so, whoa.

1678
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:23,140
- What?

1679
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:28,020
- All right, see you next week.

1680
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,780
Did you turn into a-- - Bye!
