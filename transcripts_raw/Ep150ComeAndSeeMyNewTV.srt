You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,900

4
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,940
(laughing)

5
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,780
(thunder)

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:13,620
- Hola.

7
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,440
- What's up?

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,280
- Yeah, hola.

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,120
- Hola.

10
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:16,940
- Yeah, hola.

11
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,920
We're going with hola today.

12
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,440
Oh, are you looking down at your Duolingo?

13
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,280
Is that what you're gonna do?

14
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,320
- No, I actually don't do Duolingo.

15
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,520
I'm doing immersive learning for Spanish right now.

16
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,520
- You're doing immersive learning?

17
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,360
What do you, yeah.

18
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,180
- What does that mean?

19
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,020
- So here, so just ask me.

20
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,480
- That's when you break into a person's house

21
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:34,040
you listen to them. You sit there for a little bit. Yeah, well you talk to them back. Yeah.

22
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,680
Just ask them to change the TV and stuff. So ask me, ask me what app I'm about to open

23
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,980
on my phone. Just ask me. Duolingo. Are you opening Duolingo? No, just ask me what app.

24
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:51,980
What app? Clima. What is it? Clima. Clima. Clima. Clima. What is Clima? No. Clima. Okay,

25
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,380
- Climb on these hills. - Okay, fine.

26
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,660
You know what, I'll open up Notas.

27
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,700
- Notas?

28
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,280
- Yeah, or photos.

29
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:01,240
- Oh, I see.

30
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,500
- It's called immersion learning, okay?

31
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,920
- Oh, so you're putting your whole phone in Spanish.

32
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,100
- My whole shit's in Spanish right now, dude.

33
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,460
If I wanna change the configuracion, I might have to.

34
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,820
If I want to open Camara, is that Camara?

35
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,080
(laughing)

36
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,740
If I need to know what time it is,

37
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,740
Perhaps I'll open Reloj.

38
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
Reloj.

39
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,740
Reloj?

40
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
Reloj.

41
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,740
Oh.

42
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,740
Perhaps if I'm hungry I will go to 7-Eleven.

43
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:31,740
I don't think it changed that one.

44
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,740
I think that one stayed.

45
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,740
Siete.

46
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,740
Siete-Eleven.

47
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,740
Onze.

48
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,740

49
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,740
Siete.

50
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,740
Siete-Onze.

51
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,740
I don't speak Spanish.

52
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
Onze.

53
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
ABCD.

54
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,740
ABCD.

55
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
AFJ.

00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
HITKLM.

57
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
Perhaps I will open Yara.

58
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,740
Yara.

59
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,740
Yara.

60
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,580
- Yo, band.

61
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,580
- Yaraj band and make a reggaeton song.

00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,700
- Yeah.

64
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,820
- I mean, I am liable to, now that I've been fully immersed.

65
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,780
- It's true, you could.

66
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,260
- God damn, I'm so yo immersed-o'd.

67
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,100

68
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,140
- I got, hold on, I gotta.

69
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,420
- What?

70
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,260
You gotta change shirts again?

71
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,860
- Yeah, I gotta change my, I'm in front of my AC

72
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,580
and I was wearing this, I put a crop top on as a joke.

73
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,540
- Yeah, big joke.

74
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,220
- Yeah, it was just for me, really.

75
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,380
I'm the only one in the room

76
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,180
and you can't even see it on the camera.

77
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,860
- You got up and showed it to us,

78
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,540
and I gotta say, you should be wearing one, dude.

79
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:26,380
- Yeah?

80
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,340
- Yeah, dude, here's what you should do.

81
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,140
Once you start skating again, grab your skateboard.

82
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:32,300
Actually, start riding a penny board,

83
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,540
and head on down.

84
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,920
- Yeah, ride a penny board, wear a crop top,

85
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,260
wear short shorts, wear tiny little shoes

86
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,540
that don't fit on your feet,

87
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,900
just wear a bunch of clothes that are too small for you.

88
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,780
- I was gonna make a joke about how--

89
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,820
- It looks like you were a gnome

90
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,500
and you got struck by lightning and grew three feet.

91
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,020
I was gonna make a joke about how I shouldn't wear this, but now you guys are telling me

92
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,020
I should.

93
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,560
Dude, apparently all these girls want you to wear short shorts.

94
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,740
The other day I walked outside in a bathing suit.

95
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,900
I was wearing a bathing suit because it was hot and it's a very short bathing suit and

96
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,900
I was like, "Oh fuck, I want an energy drink."

97
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,980
So I walked down the street to the deli to grab one and I made it about 30 feet before

98
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,260
an old Dominican dude called me the F-slur.

99
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
Yeah?

100
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,260
Yep, just instantly.

101
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,380
And I was like, "Yeah man, I can't be mad at you.

102
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,860
I shouldn't be wearing this.

103
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,020
I look ridiculous."

104
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,560
i don't think i just want to know what's like an hour and a half to say that

105
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,060
that's true to the copies are well he's wearing his head for the city as a

106
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,420

107
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:28,420
the head for the court now that but now you know he's going through the shirt

108
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,420

125
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:04,180
I just was saying how nice you looked.

126
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,180
We were admiring the different colors you were wearing.

Yeah, I really like your different, you know.

128
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,180

129
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,180
You dress like Skittles today.

130
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:19,020
I'm not I'm wearing a blue hat and a green shirt. Yeah, it's not skittles. Is there a blue skittle?

131
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,900
You know what? I don't and is there a green? I mean skittle

132
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:29,880
Anyway, the thing about the though, you know, the men's short shorts thing like the five inch inseam like to you guys

133
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,300
That's basketball shorts, but to me that's like a speedo. You know, I'm yeah, I that I can't do that

134
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:41,780
I'm sorry, like it just like that work. Not possible. That's about that's about four inches from my cock just slipping out

135
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:48,620
Yeah, exactly dude. That's dangerous. You know, if somebody rolled up my shorts four inches without

136
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,500
asking me, the tip of my penis might just show a little tiny bit. It's true. So I got to be very

137
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,300
careful with an inseam that small. I got these, I think my legs are pretty short. I think I can go

138
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,980
about wearing those. You what? I can go about wearing those. My legs are short. I got short

139
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:12,560
legs you have five inch legs I do I got five inch legs so I think that the the

00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,200
shorts would just kind of look like pants kind of like baggy yeah they'll

141
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,660
be like that's why they call them Patagonia baggies just cuz they look

It sounds like a really friendly conversation.

158
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,500
I wish I could get in on this.

159
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,500

166
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,740
(laughing)

167
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,740
(singing in foreign language)

168
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,620
That's a beautiful song, dude.

169
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,120
Yeah, oh man, maybe that should be our goal.

170
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,960
That's a reggaeton song.

171
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,300
That, when you translate into Spanish,

172
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,660
that reveals the true meaning,

173
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,500
'cause they'll start going,

174
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,540
(singing in foreign language)

175
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,860
and you're like, oh, it did say

176
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
he's in need of a guy in there,

177
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,100
'cause you hear hombre, you know?

178
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,460
Also, for all we know,

179
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,460
(singing in foreign language)

180
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,860
could be Spanish for something.

181
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:27,460
Yeah, I think Dabba Dee Dabba Die is actually, uh, 'cause where are the, where is Eiffel 65 from?

182
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:27,960
They were from, uh...

183
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,760
I'm gonna say Germany.

184
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
Eiffel, so that's Paris.

185
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:30,760
Oh, it could be Paris.

186
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,860
Well, they could be Belgian, those fucking freaks.

187
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,860
Uh...

188
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,860
65 could be, um, America, the 65th country.

189
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:44,360
Eiffel 65 is an Italian music group, so I think Dabba Dee Dabba Die is probably just Italian.

190
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,860
What do you think it's Italian for?

191
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,860
Uh, pizza pie.

192
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:48,860
I don't think so.

193
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,360
Yeah?

194
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,860
Nope.

195
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,860
It's Italian for pizza and spaghetti and cannolis.

196
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:57,860
No, you are... we don't speak Italian.

197
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,860
You are white.

198
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,860
No.

199
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,860
You are big, white, whore.

200
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,860
No, I am pink.

201
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:12,860
No debate there, dude.

202
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,860
I think we should start moving to the Latin market.

203
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:23,380
market. It seems to be growing year after year. We're losing out on money. I'm sorry, pesos.

204
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,620
And every year we're losing out on more and more pesos. So I think that we need to start

205
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,920
changing our content to kind of, I don't know, to appeal to a different audience.

206
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,020
We could do what The Office did. Start kind of a remake, you know?

207
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,020
Oh, yes!

208
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,100
We could do a Spanish remake for the podcast.

209
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,540
That's such a good idea.

210
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,580
Who, okay, who do we want in our Mexican remake?

211
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Salma Hayek.

212
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
Uh huh.

213
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,580
Who do we put?

214
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,580
Cameron.

215
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,060
Uh, I will play myself.

216
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,060
No, no you won't.

217
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,060
And Pablo Sobre La Lista.

218
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,060
Yo hablamos espanol.

219
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,620
That's what we'll call it.

220
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,660
It's Pablo Sobre La Lista.

221
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Uh huh.

222
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,660
No.

223
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,980
Who plays Patrick though?

224
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,980
Dolph Lundgren.

225
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:07,980
I don't think he...

226
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,820
I think Dolph Lundgren will learn Spanish and play Patrick.

227
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,980
I think he's Obama's Espanola.

228
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,700
I do look a lot like him in most ways.

229
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,100
Yeah, well it's like partly like the iron jaw and the height.

230
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:27,220
I would say those are the two main kind of factors you guys have in common.

231
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,580
Yeah, that's true.

232
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,980
But why stop at Latin America also?

233
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,060
Right, we could get German...

234
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,660
We could get a German thing going.

235
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,180
Yeah, German...

236
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,060
Uh-huh.

237
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,540
Uh, Australian.

238
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,340
Podcast Auf...

239
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:40,980
Listen.

240
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,820
I mean, why not just do just one for every country?

241
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,900
And then we just hit everything, you know?

242
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,540
- That's a pretty good idea too.

243
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,860
- Yeah, I guess the big thing here would be

244
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,940
we don't have any money.

245
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,060
- Right, yeah, we're completely poor

246
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,020
and we're living in the street right now.

247
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,660
- Okay, so it's podcast Uber Liste.

248
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:03,500
- Ooh!

249
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,220
- Podcast Uber Liste.

250
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,660
- That's pretty cool, yeah.

251
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,380
- I haven't taken, my German sucks so bad.

252
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,580
My German is so rusty. It used to be so good though.

253
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:17,380
I used to be speaking perfect German all the time.

254
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,380
Ich sammle Briefmarken.

255
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,380
What's that mean?

256
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,880
I collect stamps.

257
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,380
Why'd you learn that?

258
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,380
I don't remember.

259
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,380
Does German have its own...

260
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,380
We had to write a thing on the board every day.

261
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,380
We had to write a sentence every day.

262
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,380
And I would write the same thing every day.

263
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:36,380
I would write, "Ich laufe Skateboard."

264
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,860
I collect stamps every day

265
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,960
Mm-hmm, and I didn't learn any other fucking German. I could have used that to like learn other German phrases, but no

266
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:51,420
Right like you could have said like my name is stamps or like yeah, my favorite color is skateboard me me

267
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,220
I'm okay on it

268
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:58,620
Yeah, does German have its own version of like how in Spanish class you just learn like this like it has its own version of?

269
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,620
me amo

270
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,300
See you know

271
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,500
It's ish heiser

272
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:12,500
Shice yeah, you shite suffice. I gotta suffice a

273
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:21,620
You should I studied French in high school. Yeah, really go that's that's nothing that's useless that nobody speak. Hey, that makes sense

274
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:30,700
Why oh no reason because I'm cultured my knowledge something like that. Yeah, my naman is to slip slim shady

275
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,500
Is that on the that was one of the assignments?

276
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:43,440
You have to translate all of the real sub shady. Uh-huh, I'd be good. Yeah, I took Latin in high school

277
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,160
yeah, I was kind of a thinker kind of a philosopher kind of a

278
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,120
Latin is Latin is the slacker language because you'll never have to speak to another person in it besides the teacher

279
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,380
That is you there's no way that somebody can tell you don't I I do remember in high school being like mom

280
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,720
"Mom, why the fuck am I taking Latin?

281
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,220
"Why do I have to take Latin?"

282
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:08,060
She was like, "What if you wanna become a doctor?"

283
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,900
- Oh, what?

284
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,100
- I was like, "What?"

285
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,140
- Yeah, you're gonna become a doctor.

286
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,180
- What is that?

287
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,620
Doctors don't use Latin all the time.

288
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,700
- Right. - Yeah.

289
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,540
- Well, I mean, if they say the Hippocratic Oath,

290
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,420
they probably have to learn Latin.

291
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,300
- Hippocratic, it's not like you're Miranda rights.

292
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,860
You don't have to read it in Latin

293
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,060
every time you're about to operate on somebody.

294
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:29,220
- Why are these fucking guys taking a bunch of oaths

295
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,400
to be a bunch of hypocrites?

296
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,400
That's the thing that pisses me off the most.

297
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,440
- That's a good point.

298
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,760
- Yeah, let's say hypocritical.

299
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,720
- If you're gonna be a hypocrite.

300
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,720
- I can do surgery on you, but you can't do it on me.

301
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
Tee hee, tee hee.

302
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,960
- I mean, that's true about doctors too.

303
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
It's one of the fucked up things.

304
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,080
- Yeah, they're all hypocrites.

305
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,080
- About the industry.

306
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,280
Yeah, is you can't do surgery on them.

307
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,420

Let me tell you, it is, it's liberating.

337
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,080
It's so beautiful to see other people's movies.

338
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
I watched...

339
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,480
I don't understand it all.

340
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,000
I watched Come and See on Sunday and I got, that took me out, dude.

341
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,840
I got so depressed.

342
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,320
You watched Come and Pee in the Toilet.

343
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,720
I wish, I wish I watched that instead.

344
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
I wish I watched the video...

345
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,480
You watched it swirl around and you tie-dyed your shirt in it.

346
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,680
I wish I did.

347
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,000

Not for me. It's pretty easy. Yeah, I I watch I laugh

You can't say that you can't say that with your your head

351
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:40,040

417
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,800
- It's a different guy named Brandon Lee.

418
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,280
- It's a different guy named Brandon Lee,

419
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,280
but he's also dead.

420
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,600
- Yeah, he's still--

421
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
- He died the same way.

422
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,620

423
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,800
(laughing)

424
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,360
So it's not disrespectful.

425
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
- And then here's the twist of the movie, right?

426
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,000
You guys get into my house,

427
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,800
I have a giant L-shaped couch that I got from Ikea.

428
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,240
- And there's not enough room.

429
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,960
- No, there's plenty of room.

430
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,820
I say, "You guys ready to watch the movie?"

431
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:42,720
You say, "Yeah."

432
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,080
I press play, the movie starts over again.

433
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,120
It's an endless loop.

434
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,520
- Okay, yeah, but it's on the screen this time.

435
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,800
- But it slowly pans into the screen

436
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,160
and then the movie starts again.

437
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,600
I mean tell me there's ever been a more genius movie than that and then plus

438
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,720
this becomes world cinema because we've spoken so many different languages plus

439
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,180
Jackie Chan is there. And get this too the DVD of the movie looks like a

440
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,440
donut like the Simpsons movie yeah but it's a different color donut it's a

441
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,680
different color donut it's purple instead of pink it's purple instead of

442
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,760
pink and it's got jelly beans on it it's like the Easter it's got jelly donuts

443
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,760
Easter donut if I like Jackie Chan movies am I a world cinema fan?

444
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:26,760
Yes you are. Really? That's yeah. That's fucking sick dude.

445
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,760
I just get away with saying like yeah I love world cinema. I love cinema nouveau

446
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,760
and then I'm a Jackie Chan fan. See I don't even know what that means. I think I've

447
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,760
heard that before. Cinema nouveau. Isn't a nouveau that thing women put in their hole?

448
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,760
That's French. Okay then I love it. You love new cinema?

449
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,760
I'm a cinema new cinema fan. Yeah. Cinema nouveau

450
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,760
Cinema, new line cinema.

451
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,760
New line cinema fan.

452
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:59,760
(speaking in foreign language)

453
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:10,760
Are you doing French?

454
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Are you doing French?

455
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,760
Yeah.

456
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,760
That's how you speak French.

457
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,520
French I thought you were doing Spanish for some reason I think I put your finger

458
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:26,320
in your ass while you were talking that is how you speak French those you just

459
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,200
you need to know just a few for you need to know the phrases that are how do you

460
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:36,520
say and like something and what and then you got that and go like in in the

461
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:41,480
middle of it it's a lot that's what I've learned by by trying to learn Spanish as

462
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:47,660
well when I talk to my phone is I have to go like "ee" and "eh" a lot.

463
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:51,700
Yeah it's like most languages have like a version of "um" that they use

464
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:57,860
way more than I say "um." Yeah yeah and French they say they go "euh"

465
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,860
"euh" "euh" "euh"

466
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,860
What a horrible language.

467
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,860
Why is that?

468
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,860
Can you guys explain why they're called the romance languages?

469
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,860
"Mackelpenis"

470
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:14,240
And also why do the romance countries have the highest population of pedophiles over any other countries?

471
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,140
I mean, I think you just said it right there, unfortunately

472
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,740
Yeah, the pedophiles are hopeless romantics always have

473
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,780
Can't say that on homeless

474
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:32,100
You see that we're on a video call yeah, we're on TV right now

475
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,340
This is being live streamed to millions of Americans. Yeah, whoever

476
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,900
There were you know back in the in the olden days

477
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,580
There were the people who'd like rolled around in a hog stable to do it

478
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,580
And they're the people who'd set a nice table, and you know you know unfortunately

479
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:53,680
Table work, but it's nothing romantic to me about France. I don't know I need to go

480
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,780
Romantic to me if I'm gonna make a statement. I don't give a shit about the Eiffel Tower

481
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,260
You fuck that thing dude. I've seen bigger shit. Yeah, they got the Empire State Building here

482
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,560
I mean like the Tower of Pisa, then we'll talk yeah

483
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:12,540
Tell you what's a tower a more impressive tower the Citadel from Half-Life

484
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:16,940
Uh-huh, yeah, why don't they just try to I mean make something that big I'd fuck dare you oh yeah

485
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,060
Make it make City 17 a real place, and then I'll go there. Yeah, you know stop pussyfooting around with all this

486
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:31,140
Why did they build it was an accident it was so it's like a magnet for snails

487
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,060
It's a big

488
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:38,580
It's a big magnet for snails. That's how they get all the snails to come to France for the escargot

489
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:44,220
So you just walk over and they just scrape them off the side like barnacles. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a lightning rod kind of

490
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:48,880
Well, what I did now has to be struck by lightning pretty often, right? I think it was

491
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,060
Very lucky. Yeah

492
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:58,560
There's no protective measures if it does so they were just across their fingers and it's lasted this long

493
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,820
Man, it would be funny if they only had the Eiffel Tower in France

494
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,060
It's just so that it like it's just the world's biggest lightning rod

495
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,260
That's it. It looks you know what it looks I'm gonna say it

496
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:15,380
This is gonna offend a lot of our French listeners. It looks unfinished finish that damn thing

497
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,780
It looks like scaffolding. What's wrong put a damn wall on this thing. What god damn put some money

498
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,300
How do you go to the bathroom there if you work there?

499
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,300
Right!

500
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
Everyone's gonna see!

501
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,300
Yeah, what if your office is up there?

502
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:34,300
Yeah, too many holes in it.

503
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Exactly.

504
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
Hey, hey!

505
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,300
Why don't you take your lunch break?

506
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,860
Hey, Eiffel, here's a fucking novel idea.

507
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,860
What if it gets cold?

508
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,860
Uh-huh.

509
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,060
Fucking dumbass stupid French guy.

510
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,060
And look, there's like a huge, there's a huge, it's shaped like an A, you know?

511
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,860
It's like there's a huge gap, you know what you could put-

512
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
Finish the word!

513
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,060
Yeah, you know what you could put inside of that A, that tower? You could put a big hammock.

514
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,260
I just had an idea for art. I just had an idea for art.

515
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,380
Are they armresters?

516
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,300
Yeah, I mean we've been basically getting them in the art game recently.

517
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,260
Eiffel Tower, Eiffel Tower.

518
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:03,500
Yep.

519
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,100
Circle around it.

520
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,540
Okay.

521
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:10,060
Because it's shaped like an A. Circle around an A.

522
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,220
Wow.

523
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:10,700
Anarchy.

524
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,300
Whoa.

525
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,780
How about this? Eiffel Tower, Eiffel Tower, big ol' S.

526
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,220
As.

527
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,380
Spelled it wrong.

528
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,940
Oh, okay, Eiffel Tower, two S's.

529
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,440
Yeah.

530
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:21,940
Ass.

531
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,440
There you go.

532
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:22,940
Yeah.

533
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,440
Well, there were two S's in France in 1940, but I don't want to bring that up.

534
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:26,940
Oh.

535
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,440
Those people are still healing, dude.

536
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:29,940
I know.

537
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
I know.

538
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,440
Come on.

539
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:31,940
That's my bad.

540
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
You fucker.

541
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,440
I think, well, I'm just saying, I think the French people would not like it if you put two S's...

542
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,940
If you brought two S's back to France.

543
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,940
Yeah.

544
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,940
It's honestly so beast to have never been invaded by anybody.

545
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:45,440
Mm-hmm.

546
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,940
We just, like, we just...

547
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,940
Except for aliens.

548
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,760
Well, maybe. But we've just never... we're like undefeated with like...

549
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,920
What's going on with that? There's aliens or some shit?

550
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,160
Like...

551
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,840
They're supposed to drop the intel. I mean, I'm like way up on all this stuff,

552
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,040
obviously, because I'm smart.

553
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:04,360
Yeah, I mean, like you and Tom DeLonge have been...

554
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,960
We've been working together, you know, but the thing is... the hard thing is you get me

555
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,000
and Tom DeLonge in a room. I just call him Tom. It's hard for us to be around each other

556
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,200
without making a song.

557
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,040
Yeah, without making a song, without making just like kind of like a funny little like...

558
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:23,320
a funny little song yeah yeah it's like you guys are getting together fuck my poop that was the

559
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,640
right recent one we did you know and that looks really good i i i remember you sending me over

560
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:34,200
the file for that the uh you sent me the the the what's it called the roots is that the

561
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,800
stems the stems you sent me the stems over for that because you guys wanted me to play bass on it

562
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:47,960
because yeah you know and and tom to launch but uh i also alien invasion so i've been we've been

563
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:52,120
trying to kind of stay focused and talk more about aliens and apparently they've

564
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:58,460
heard our songs. Really? Wow. Have they heard "Aliens Exist" by Blink-182?

565
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,840
I think that's their favorite song and the thing is they keep getting really

566
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,720
close to "Invading Earth" and then Tom DeLonge will drop one of these alien

567
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,740
classics and then they get it you know that because all radio waves just keep

568
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,240
going forever into the space so they keep getting them and being like ah

569
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:15,440
maybe we should hold off they seem to be pretty big fans of us. They could make a sequel to this song.

570
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,600
Yeah, yeah, so they recently got aliens exist and they decided to stop the invasion. Yeah. Mm-hmm

571
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:27,440
Something I mean the segue here something else paranormal that I wanted to share with you guys. Oh, yeah that I found online

572
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,340
This is just you know, just you know aliens

573
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,320
Ghosts pretty much the same thing I would say and many ways to me. What is this?

574
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,360
This is a little web page. I didn't really I just thought it was very funny

575
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,940
I just wanted to to share it on the on the podcast because I think we do

576
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:57,300
So this is a web page I found for about a haunted subway in Wisconsin in Dodgeville, Wisconsin.

577
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,800
1400 State Road 23.

578
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,740
If you want to visit it, they got a picture of it here.

579
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,820
Incredibly normal looking subway.

580
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,820
I mean, I can't lie.

581
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,820
It looks like a subway to me.

582
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:09,380
They even put that they have specific directions here on how to get to it.

583
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,940
So if you live in Wisconsin, from Highway 151 coming from the east, take a right onto Highway

584
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:18,220
18 into Dodgeville, take a right on Highway 23, North Beckett Street.

585
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:23,260
The subway will be on the left-hand side at the corner of Highway 23 and Highway YZ, King

586
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,260
Street.

587
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,180
Don't go to the other subway on the right-hand side.

588
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,180
Right, yeah.

589
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,980
That one's even worse.

590
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,180
So here's the background of this spot, okay?

591
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,780
Of this paranormal activity hotbed.

592
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:40,180
prior to being a subway restaurant a Harley-Davidson shop owned by a man named

593
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:45,780
Eugene Forbes sat at this location. So you can tell that's going to be very haunted already.

594
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:48,980
Here's the type of haunting that's going on. Here's the paranormal activity that's taking

595
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,520
place in this subway. Items being knocked off their shelves both on the main floor and

596
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,340
in the basement. Subway has a basement? That's already scary enough. That is one of the scariest

597
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,740
places you've ever been to. Also is this a subway where they have like a, there's like

598
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,740
book shelves everywhere.

599
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,740
There are books flying off.

600
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,740
What is there besides like chips?

601
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,740
Subway library.

602
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
Yeah.

603
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:14,740
Foul odors that seem to fill the restaurant with no known source.

604
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,740
Hey, I can tell you, I know where that source is.

605
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,740
It's the god damn food.

606
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,740
Yeah, it's all the food at Subway.

607
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,740
I'm gonna say quick,

608
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
quickly, uh, fuck Subway.

609
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,740
Why?

610
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,740
Horrible establishment.

611
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,740
You're a dumbass, dude. Subway rules.

612
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,420
It's fucking are you stupid dude subway fucking rocks.

613
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:35,420
Jimmy John's way better and their CEO kills elephants.

614
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,420
It's so cool.

615
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,380
Dude, Jimmy John's you get less sandwich though.

616
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,380
It's too skinny.

617
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:40,380
Yeah, but free smells.

618
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,380
Yeah, free.

619
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,380
Exactly.

620
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
They have free smells here.

621
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,900
See foul odors that seem to fill the restaurant with no known source.

622
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,100
It's true.

623
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,600
The apparition of a woman is seen standing behind the cash register.

624
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,600
See below.

625
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
That's scary.

626
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,780
Nothing is scarier than a woman behind the cash register.

627
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:00,140
It was the most terrifying thought I've ever had.

628
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:04,380
Door buzzers to let employees know that someone has entered the building go off without any

629
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:05,860
reason.

630
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:08,620
That's very scary.

631
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,820
One of the scariest things you can hear when you're working at Subway is "Ding dong!"

632
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,380
Yeah, a guy just walked in.

633
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,380
A customer coming in.

634
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,380
And they're like, "Who was that?

635
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,380
What is that?"

636
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,380
He's like, "Guys, I'm...

637
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,380
Who is this?

638
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
Show yourself!"

639
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,380
You smell!

640
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:23,980
You smell for no reason!

641
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,980
I guess I'll just leave.

642
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,380
Employees hear their name called when nobody is there.

643
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,540
I mean, whatever.

644
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,980
Now this is this last bullet point.

645
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:35,940
This is the one that made me decide to share this with you guys.

646
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,660
This is making me laugh a lot when I found this.

647
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:43,540
Employees preparing sandwiches have turned their backs only for a moment, only to notice

648
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,740
that their sandwiches have already been cut for them.

649
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:52,260
Seems to me less like a haunting, more like a Casper situation.

650
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:58,560
who's a bit friendly. Yeah, a ghost that cuts sandwiches for people. Yeah, dude. Saving

651
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:07,020
so many seconds. Yeah. Why is it haunted? Why, this is a whole story about the Harley Davidson

652
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:13,740
store that used to be there and then, here we go. Subway employees, oh what is it? Both

653
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:17,600
Eugene and Shirley were killed in the crash as was Pindell and his two passengers, also

654
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,500
young men in their early 20s. Alan Forbes, Eugene's son, inherited the Harley Davidson

655
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:25,700
shop and eventually sold the land to the Subway franchise. The years passed by and all seemed

656
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:30,900
calm. Then, in 2000, things changed. Subway employees began reporting strange occurrences

657
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,420
taking place in the restaurant. Items were being knocked off their shelves, employees

658
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:37,680
hearing their name called when no one else was around. Even more disturbing was when

659
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,780
some employees began seeing the vision of a woman standing behind the cash register.

660
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:46,000
Described as being about 50 years old, skinny, and wearing a dress, the woman is said to

661
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,820
give a dirty look at the employees and when confronted, she simply disappears before the

662
00:31:49,820 --> 00:32:06,880
the

663
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,880
I think this might be a Karen.

664
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,380
Dude, I hate Karens so much.

665
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,380
You guys want to see my impression of a Karen?

666
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,380
Yeah.

667
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
Alright, ready?

668
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,380
Yeah.

669
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,380
Watch this.

670
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,380
I'm ready.

671
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,880
Hey, yeah, I'll have a million dollars for free.

672
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,880
What?

673
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,380
You can't order that.

674
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:24,380
Oh my god.

675
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,380
Oh, I can't order that?

676
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,380
Well then I'm going to sexually assault you.

677
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,880
I'm a Karen, by the way.

678
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,380
I don't know about that one.

679
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,880
That's not what they say.

680
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,880
I don't think Karens say that.

681
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
I think Karens do.

682
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
I think you're going to say...

683
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,880
They say I'm going to speak to the manager.

684
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,720
- Yeah.

685
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,840
- Oh, I'm gonna, okay, all right, let me try again.

00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,000
If you don't give me a million dollars,

687
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,920
I'm gonna sexually assault your manager.

688
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,760
- No. - No, stop saying that.

689
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,920
- What is that? - Don't say that.

690
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,300
- Stop saying that. - That's what Karens do.

691
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,340
- No, they don't.

692
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,120
- No, you know that they don't say that.

693
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,080
Stop saying that.

694
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,560
- I'm gonna--

695
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,440
- Don't, no.

696
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,520
- Speak. - Speak.

697
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:01,520
- Say, say it with me. - I'm gonna speak to the manager.

698
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,400
I'm gonna use my hands and I'm gonna use my love language to speak to your manager.

699
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
No! Don't say that!

700
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Oh, so somebody's on the Karen side.

701
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
I'm not on the Karen-

702
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
So then why are you defending the Karen that I invented?

703
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,200
Don't say you're gonna sexually assault somebody on the podcast.

704
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,200
I'm not! The Karen is!

705
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,200
What the fuck?

706
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,400
You guys are so pro-Karen it's disgusting me right now.

707
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Just don't say that.

708
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,400
You fucker.

00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,640
Uh, top ten ways to tell someone is a psycho.

710
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,320
I got one way.

711
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,320
What way?

712
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:41,120
They fucking ruin the podcast by saying shit like that.

713
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,480
How is that, that was, everybody thought that was helpful, informative, maybe even a little

714
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
bit funny.

715
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,480
God damn it, this fucking show.

716
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,320
Yeah, 150th episode and you, this is what you do.

You go Karen on us every day.

719
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Now it means something else.

720
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Why does it mean something else?

721
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
Because you made it mean something else.

722
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
No. You don't know what you're talking about.

723
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
You're being a Karen right now and I'm scared of you.

Number one.

732
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,800
They keep posting nasty comment about artists and their fans.

733
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,400
Okay, you know what?

734
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,520

That is the number one psycho move.

739

I mean, when I see people talking shit on my stand list, I send it to my besties.

740
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,600
And they take them down.

I mean, this guy's got to be stan-able

754
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,720
more than anybody else.

755
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,720
Jake Paul, not

756
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:19,720
Logan Paul.

757
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:21,720
Logan Paul is not stan-able.

758
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,720
Not stan-able, no.

759
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,160

I did not.

787
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,800
That's true, yeah.

788
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,840
No, somebody says on this item, "Always jellious with every person."

789
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,840
True.

790
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,000
I hate when people get jellious of me.

791
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,520
Number two, "They keep starting all kind of worst lists and cannot stop hating."

792
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Yep.

793
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,240
YoshiDude says, "I do this, but I'm not a psycho."

794
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,720
Sounds like you might be a psycho, YoshiDude.

795
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,120
This is one of the ways to tell, so I think you are so psychopathic that you're actually

796
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:15,120
a stupid idiot.

797
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,720
Uh-huh, yeah, this is normal to you because you're a psycho.

798
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:22,520
There's a number of, there's another comment on this list here, it says, "Their eyes are

799
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
full of hatred."

800
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,520
I mean, that's also, that's a pretty easy way to tell if somebody's a psycho.

801
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
If someone's eyes are full of hatred.

802
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
Iry eyes full of hatred.

803
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Yeah.

804
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
That's got to be like a clear telltale sign.

805
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,520
They have like Sith eyes with yellow pupils.

806
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,760
Yeah, if their face is veiny and white and they have what look like horns popping out of the front of their head

807
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,520
Oh, yes, they could be a psycho. Yeah, and also when you go to inspect their character model, they're there

808
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:51,520
All the way in the red and they have a red smoke behind them. Yeah. Yeah, it's like there

809
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:56,720
yeah, you know that that thing the like Japanese thing where like if you're if they

810
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:59,740
They had this called like senpaku eyes

811
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:13,740
I

812
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:26,740
to

813
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:30,740
of a psychopathic killer these eyes want to gain power of you. Senpaku eyes. They're just

814
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:37,300
high hooded eyelids. Yeah here. No it's about like the what the your iris like where your how much

815
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:42,900
space there is around your iris like what directions. Look at this picture I found uh that's the

816
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:48,980
first result when you look up Senpaku eyes. It's a picture of so it's just describing Senpaku eyes

817
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:54,820
then it has six pictures and the six people on it the first one left to right Charles Manson,

818
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:07,620
James Holmes, uh, the, the Heaven's Gate guy, Adam Lanza, Casey Anthony, and Jimmy Savile.

819
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:18,020
All right, I see Billie Eilish is on here too. I see AOC here as an example of someone with Senpaku eyes.

820
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:24,660
So Billie Eilish has Senpaku eyes, is that, so people are just like mad at her now? No,

821
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,660
No she's evil.

822
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
So she, okay.

823
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:32,140
Well, she did, I mean, surprise, surprise, she did say that she was the bad guy.

824
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,820
So it's like, why, why are you freaking out?

825
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:37,500
Exactly, if she would have said duh.

826
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Which is rude, on top of being bad.

827
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,980
Oh my gosh, first she's evil, then she's rude?

828
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,420
It's like, can't this be funny?

829
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:46,460
Okay, if you're evil, that's one thing.

830
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:50,700
If you're evil and sarcastic, you're getting kicked out of school.

831
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:53,780
Number three, they don't understand great jokes, but laugh at silly things.

837
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,300
Here's another comment. I don't laugh when the rest of my family or friends

838
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,820
laugh but I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe when my mom put a black sock in

839
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,860
the white washing load and they all got annoyed when everything turned gray.

everyone is dying laughing over and yet I'm laughing to the point of crying when

843
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:56,860

one of the biggest psychos on TV sure you want to talk about some Paco eyes I

849
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:28,820
think he has him now maybe didn't he ten years ago he's got him now dude

850
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:33,040
those fucking pictures of him now he's got so much he just doesn't look real

851
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,660
he looks like an animal yeah he does not look like a human anymore he looks like

852
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:50,660
Like

853
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,540
He does look really messed up.

854
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:56,220
People have been saying he looks like a GTA 5 NPC.

855
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,740
And that's yeah, for 100%.

856
00:41:58,740 --> 00:41:59,740
Oh my god!

857
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,120
Wait, he was in an accident.

858
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
He was in an accident?

859
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,120
He had a back injury.

860
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
That should make your face look like that.

861
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:10,340
That makes Simon Cowell break his back falling off of an electric bike in California.

862
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:14,220
How do you...

863
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:15,220
He got caught in the spokes.

864
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:18,220
He was going around and around.

865
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,900
yeah no this guy's a fucked-up fucking fallout 4 character somebody just

866
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:28,220
deleted his lips he was one of the most handsome men in the world at one point I

867
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:35,820
mean he was up there for sure I mean for a British smashed his spine to pieces by

868
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:39,900
falling off an electric bike oh I get yeah he's old I get mine's already in

869
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:46,900
pieces can we can we hold vertebrae can we edit this out because I'm gonna try

870
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:53,740
out for American Idol in two weeks. Oh, I had no idea. Yeah, I don't know. I know he's not

871
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,620
a judge anymore, but he might still be like an executive producer or something. I feel

872
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,660
like just as your friend I should be able to like give you some advice or something. So

873
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:08,660
could you like show me what you're auditioning with? Yeah. What are you doing? Like a bridge

874
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:13,260
Bridge over troubled water

875
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,760
I'm gonna be honest with you, dog. You're going to Hollywood, dog.

876
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,360
Yeah?

877
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,060
Yeah, G.

878
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:20,060
You mean it?

879
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,960
I mean it, G.

880
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,460
No.

881
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:24,660
Number five, they keep insulting people.

882
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:29,260
I'm sorry. I'm still stuck on Simon Cowell falling off of an electric bike.

883
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,760
I found this article and it's...

884
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,860
The article is called "Simon Cowell did not fall off an e-bike"

885
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:41,320
and that's not my italy's there is a difference between a bike and a

886
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,420
motorcycle

887
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,900
and it's a whole article about how it he fell off his technically a book

888
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:49,700
recycle i was thinking maybe this is a kind of like like uh... fake paul

889
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:53,220
mccartney thing with a look at it and i have a suicide if he died so they were

890
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,100
there

891
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:58,780
are eight hundred and ninety comments arguing about whether it's a biker

892
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:02,540
motorcycle only shot website

893
00:44:02,540 --> 00:44:04,100
and what's the difference

894
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,620
I'll stick with the new two-stroke dirt bikes. At least then I won't have to eat granola and wear my hair in a bun.

895
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,220
True.

896
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,220
True!

897
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:14,220
That's what happens when you have a spine injury.

898
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:14,720
Yeah.

899
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,720
The only thing you can take is granola.

900
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,220
As soon as you break your spine, the first thing you do, go out and buy a dang Prius.

901
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,220
Well, they put you on an all-crunchy diet.

902
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:24,720
Yeah.

903
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:25,720
Because it's easier to eat.

904
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Right, it's all crunchy because your spine got crunchy.

905
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,220
Yeah.

906
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:32,720
LOL, not a motorcycle, not an e-bike. This is just a new iteration of the moped.

907
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,520
Oh yeah, good point.

908
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:39,700
Number five, they keep insulting people.

909
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:45,400
I'm gonna issue a psycho watch on one Jeffrey Ross Roastmaster General because this guy seems

910
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:49,480
to like insulting people more than almost anybody alive.

911
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,040
So if this is a psycho-

912
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:53,440
And he's the general.

913
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,480
He's also the general.

914
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:01,840
So if this is a psycho attribute, I think that he might be public psycho number one.

915
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,120
And he should be dishonorably discharged for being a psychopath.

916
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,600
I mean have you ever seen Doctor Strangelove?

917
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:11,400
You see what a psycho general can do?

918
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,640
Discharge Geoffrey Ross, replace him with Hannah Gadsby.

919
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,760
Or maybe just like if they don't want to do a whole thing of like discharging them they

920
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:22,280
could have like maybe the people close to him influence him into committing suicide

921
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,280
or something.

922
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,280
Might be a good idea.

923
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,320
I mean the CIA listens to this and I know that they'll take that to heart.

924
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,320
I mean and honestly it doesn't even have to be the CIA it just could be whoever.

925
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,320
I mean it could be like three guys.

926
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,320
He's also listening to it.

927
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
Maybe we can do it.

928
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:40,880
Or like maybe set up a situation where like you know, he, you're like for example maybe

929
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,040
you put him in a giant frying pan or something and he wants to get out of the frying pan

930
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,360
because his flesh is like sizzling and melting but like if he jumps out there's spikes underneath

931
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:51,840
so then technically he is killing himself and you're not liable for it because he's

932
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:53,880
the one who threw himself out of the frying pan.

933
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,640
Well what if it's like, it's a cast iron pan you put in the oven to roast him.

934
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,640
Yeah.

935
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:06,040
poetic isn't it? Uh-huh. Yeah. That's true. No judge will convict you for a poetic crime.

936
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:10,160
Yeah. Ah, I would convict you for this murder but its irony was too beautiful.

937
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:16,040
Yeah. It's ironic. It was too poignant. Yeah. And that judge, the Honorable Alanis Morissette.

938
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:22,720
I'm pleading guilty. I'm pleading guilty with a point. Yeah, with a moral. Yeah,

939
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,520
with a "Bah, but have I not created a new moral tale? One that you may, you may tell

940
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:33,720
to your children before bedtime? Yeah, a guy reading a bedtime story to a kid

941
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,720
and it's like, "And that's why you never put a man in a giant cast-iron pan and put him

942
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:43,160
in the oven." And it's thanks to Caleb Pitts that we have that moral today.

943
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:47,840
You know what, I'm a veritable brother Grimm. Yeah.

944
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:50,840
Number seven, the voices in your head communicate with the voices in yours.

945
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:52,920
You skipped number six. Oh.

946
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:56,320
Number six, they come up to you at scream in your face.

947
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,880
important yeah I believe you tried you tried to skip that because you do that

948
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,960
and you didn't want anyone to know you're no I don't come up and at scream

949
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:07,280
in your face you absolutely do I've come to the conclusion that almost anyone

950
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,960
could be defined as psycho and that's another comment from rock fashionista

951
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,680
rock fashionista has a point yeah moose for life 19 says um that's pretty crazy

952
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:22,600
yeah and imagine somebody coming up to your face and screaming um that's pretty

953
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,160
crazy in it yeah I don't want to I don't want to stick on this thing of like

954
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,720
maybe all comedians are psychos but maybe ever heard of a little guy named Bobcat

955
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,600
Goldthwait? Oh yeah. This is one of the loudest dudes who's ever lived. Okay. Yeah.

956
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:41,600
He's broken sound barriers and he's short as well. Yeah. And he uh he made a movie

957
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,280
about Bigfoot. He directed World's Greatest Dad. That's true he did World's Greatest Dad.

958
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:52,120
You know he made a... Which was about Bigfoot. I mean only a psycho could have come up with his Bigfoot.

959
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,800
only a psycho could have come up with the idea to make a found footage Bigfoot

960
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:00,960
movie but then not show Bigfoot at the end and show a naked old lady instead

961
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:06,760
yeah that is pretty diabolical yeah yeah only the craziest mind would make

962
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:13,400
Junie Cortez true Robin Williams child number seven the voices in their head

963
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:20,000
communicate with the voices in yours this seems to have come it this just

964
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,820
This seems to have more to do with like ESP or some kind of mental communication than being

965
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:28,820
a psychopath.

966
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,580
Yeah, maybe they thought it was psychic.

967
00:48:30,580 --> 00:48:34,220
Also, this means that you both have voices in your head.

968
00:48:34,220 --> 00:48:36,040
And here's the top comment here.

969
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,680
Don't judge us, but my friends and I do this a lot and I for sure am not giving them up

970
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,720
because I think it's cool and since some of my friends are boys, they have said that guys

971
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:45,640
I think are cute, they don't know that, actually have crushes on me.

972
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,360
One even said he had feelings for me.

973
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,280
Oops, got off track.

974
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,280
Wow. You got off track.

975
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,780
Yeah. I mean, you revealed the existence of telepathy.

976
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,580
Yeah. Maybe they're psycho and that's why they're saying that.

977
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,680
True. I also got the same experience since from 13 years old.

978
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:09,280
I have hundreds of voices in my head.

979
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:14,780
And as far as I'm concerned, they've never communicated with any real person before.

980
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,980
Rock fashionista. That's also from rock fashionista.

981
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:25,060
Number eight, they are having a conversation and no one and no cell phone is part of it.

982
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:30,140
Whoa. This is the truth because for psychopaths are

983
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:33,420
people who want the feeling of importance so they do this.

984
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:37,540
So they just have a conversation? Mm-hmm.

985
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,820
What if they're the Long Island medium? Oh my God.

986
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,820
Yeah, what if they're speaking to...

987
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:47,620
By the way, there can't be a group of more fucking annoying ghosts

988
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,620
than the ones on Long Island, dude.

989
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,620
I would rather fuck it...

990
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,620
Go anywhere else but Long Island if you're gonna be a medium.

991
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,620
That is a bad, bad move, dude.

992
00:49:55,620 --> 00:49:59,120
You know how much, like, racist shit you're gonna hear?

993
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:01,120
You can't help where you're from.

994
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,120
And I think that, you know,

995
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,120
she was born with those powers.

996
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:07,120
And I think the people of Long Island,

997
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,120
maybe this could help them.

998
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:14,400
I don't think anything can help those poor souls. They should be put out of their misery.

999
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:20,480
If I was a medium, I would live in a zoo and I would walk around, I would talk to the animal ghosts.

1000
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,680
Yeah, well that one's an easy one.

1001
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:22,880
I'd make that, yeah, because I would go like...

1002
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,720
Tell us, what is the monkey saying?

1003
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,120
And he's going...

1004
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,080
Yeah.

1005
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,200
And then he says...

1006
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,680
And then I would just be walking around, they would like...

1007
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,200
You know, at first they'd be like, "Oh, there's that weird guy."

1008
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,080
He's walking around going like...

1009
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:37,520
And then it's like, "Oh, he's talking to the dead lion that died because it had to get

1010
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:44,880
tranquil way too much and and do you want a banana right now somebody says you

1013
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,400
like a family that it was that one of the you know and I'd be like and I'd be

1014
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,880
like a spirit has a message for you and I'd stand there for a while and they'd

1015
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:08,480
be like "well" and I'd be like "well I already said it was from the giraffe"

1016
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,380
teehee! teehee! teehee!

1017
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,380
and I'd run away and say teehee

1018
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:14,880
I'd be a prank medium

1019
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:17,880
Goddamn that medium!

1020
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:24,380
I think that's the most important thing about being a medium is probably having fun

1021
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,380
mm-hmm pranking

1022
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:32,380
I mean you hear the cries of the dead all day it's like hey can you tell me like at least one or two

1023
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:35,980
I'll tell you some jokes. Yeah, exactly. I would like to be the

1024
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:44,500
The comedy store medium. Yeah, right where I'm in there and I'm like, hi, Richard Pryor saying he wants to have sex with a mannequin

1025
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:54,800
I'd be a medium and I'd I'd be walking I'd be walking around that I'd accidentally walk through like

1026
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,960
Like walk past like a skydiving class and just go

1027
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,200
(laughing)

1028
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:03,360
- It's over and over.

1029
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:04,200
- Yeah.

1030
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:06,780
Sorry, I'm picking up, I'm sorry,

1031
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:08,240
I was picking up a voice.

1032
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,260
- Yeah, I'm sorry, I was picking up the 10 people

1033
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,580
who were here this morning.

1034
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,720
(laughing)

1035
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,640
- He's a bad instructor!

1036
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,760
Don't go to his class!

1037
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,640
Sorry, sorry, that was, ugh, that was,

1038
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,220
I'm hearing John, I'm hearing John.

1039
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:27,180
That's the funniest thing about the,

1040
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:31,060
Just ruining every business, just walking into a restaurant and being like

1041
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:36,380
"I WAS POISONED! I WAS POISONED BY THE CHEF!"

1042
00:52:36,380 --> 00:52:40,380
Yeah, just doing that in every store you go to.

1043
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,380
"The security guard is evil! He killed me! I'm a ghost!"

1044
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:49,380
"Unless they give the medium a gift card and then nothing happened, and it was all fine."

1045
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:57,620
Yeah, I mean if you were like a famous medium, I'm sure you could just be like, "Oh, I'm

1046
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:00,580
hearing that my appetizer is 50% off."

1047
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,740
I'm hearing that from the ghost of the manager.

1048
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,900
The medium says it's true.

1049
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,980
What's the, oh fuck, wait, Gary Spivey.

1050
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,460
Yeah, Gary Spivey is the-

1051
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:15,340
Oh, the guy that everybody had as their profile picture in 2009.

1052
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,860
Because he has that big white afro?

1053
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:18,860
Yes.

1054
00:53:18,860 --> 00:53:19,860
Yes.

1055
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:23,880
Sylvia Brown Sylvia Brown was on the Montel Williams show all the time cool

1056
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,820
growing they wouldn't my mom would watch that all the fucking time and I hated

1057
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:35,140
Sylvia Brown I thought she a medium yeah she was a medium it's crock of shit yeah

1058
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:39,220
such that her job you don't believe in mediums I believe in every medium but

1059
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:45,780
Sylvia Brown Sylvia Brown I'm challenging I'm right now I'm doing a psychic attack

1060
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:51,180
on you. I'm sending brainwaves, I'm sending you the souls of so many people.

1061
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:56,380
If you don't think that she has some sort of defense mechanism, iron shield for psychic energy.

1062
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:02,380
Oh my god, no! I'm being attacked by her ghost, she's been dead since 2013!

1063
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,380
I can see it on your face right now.

1064
00:54:05,380 --> 00:54:07,380
It's flying around you.

1065
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:13,380
Number 9, they bitch complain, and this is something that maybe Caleb would know a thing or two about.

1066
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:16,580
They bitch, complain, cry, and cause a scene no matter where they are.

1067
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:20,080
I don't think I know anything about that, 'cause I haven't cried in 15 years.

1068
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,380
Are you complaining right now?

1069
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,380
No, I'm just making an observation.

1070
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,380
What are you whining about?

1071
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:26,380
Oh, I'm not-- Oh, am I whining?

1072
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:27,380
You're crying.

1073
00:54:27,380 --> 00:54:29,380
Oh, does it appear that I'm crying? I wasn't here--

1074
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,380
I can hear it in your voice.

1075
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:32,380
Oh, did you think I'm crying?

1076
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:34,380
Okay.

1077
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,880
I know a person whose daughter is studying with us.

1078
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:40,080
One day, she complained to her parent that she is not happy with the class.

1079
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,880
The parent was at a yoga class from where he started shouting.

1080
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,880
He stated calling bad words and making a bad scene without even knowing...

1081
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,880
even without knowing what the matter is.

1082
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:50,880
Okay.

1083
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,880
So just yelling and screaming seems to be a big part of the of the psycho's repertoire.

1084
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,880
My husband is a psycho.

1085
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:59,880
He loves to criticize, doesn't know how to enjoy life,

1086
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:01,880
loves to take stress and pressure all time,

1087
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,880
saddest, rude, has two personalities,

1088
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,880
the world believe he is good, which in reality he isn't.

1089
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,040
I went to a party and met this guy named Richard and he seemed nice, but he is a real pain

1090
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,120
He has scared seven of my friends off. They don't talk to me. He is a stalker

1091
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:20,600
He went up to my old job and threatened the people for my phone number and he is really crazy

1092
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:23,600
I try to get right off him. I don't know go in town

1093
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:28,480
I got a job far away and I need to do something about this. He scream and follow me. He shows up at night

1094
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,760
He's psycho person. I don't try to talk or see him

1095
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,640
Richard sounds really bad. Oh my god. He's scream and follow

1096
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,120
You show up

1097
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:42,560
That's horrifying dude. That is horrible. He's a stalker

1098
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:47,160
Stocker number 10 they walk out the door naked

1099
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:55,200
Yeah, well, that's pretty yeah, I hate that psycho Lana Rhodes. She is such a psycho. Okay, I definitely

1100
00:55:55,200 --> 00:56:03,360
Definitely wouldn't do that. That's from Yoshi, dude, Sylvia Brown and I have made up by the way, really? Oh, what does that entail?

1101
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,560

1103
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,940
number 11

1104
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,940
They stare at you and smile. I

1105
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:19,520
Do it especially creepily just to disturb the crap out of my friends or people spreading rumors of me

1106
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,840
I hold scissors to accompany the psycho effect works awesomely

1107
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:28,340
You know something is wrong is they give you that mischievous smile that says I'm up to something

1108
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:32,260
Let's see here

1109
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:39,980
Number 15 they start preaching about the giant flying spaghetti monster. Oh hell no that's facts. Yeah, I'm a psycho because of this

1110
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:45,140
Oh hell no not the spaghetti number 16. They misunderestimate you

1111
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:49,180
Number 20 they have chili in their shoes

1112
00:56:49,180 --> 00:56:55,740
That is a is psychotic every time they walk into a room the psycho shower scene music plays

1113
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,720
That's a pretty that would be pretty pissed if I as a psycho they kept blowing my cover with that

1114
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:09,220
Number 25 they become interested in death and the top comment is they are interested in death more than life and hence

1115
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:14,480
They become psychos a psycho is a person who is very interested in the opposite face of reality

1116
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:18,660
Number number 31 they live in a world of their own

1117
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:24,700
Number 28 I can't tell the difference between the real world and my imaginary world

1118
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:34,180
world rock rock rock actually has a mental number 28 their favorite movie is psycho and they

1119
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:46,900
want to reenact it 34 have an attraction to preteens at the age of 38 they are determined

1120
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:51,500
to have sex with every young woman they meet.

1121
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,200
Number 35, they know what you are thinking.

1122
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:58,560
Again there seems to be some kind of disconnect here.

1123
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,140
Number 51, they joined the KKK.

1124
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:07,780
And there's one comment from jasmine21064 that says, "Duh."

1125
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:11,960
Number 48, continuing the thread, if someone is about 15+ years older than you and they

1126
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,340
want to become close friends with you.

1127
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:16,340
Total psycho dude. Something's going on.

1128
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,340
Oh no, this is a bad one.

1129
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,340
Number 66, they live in downtown New York, New York.

1130
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,340
That's true.

1131
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,340
Yeah. Yeah, there's tons of psychos down there.

1132
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,340
Number 70, they like pony porn.

1133
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:34,340
Number 54, they try to kill all the time.

1134
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,340
Never a break for these psychos.

1135
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,340
Happy death, sad death, death all the time.

1136
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:43,340
Number 71, they laugh crazily.

1137
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,340
So true.

1138
00:58:45,340 --> 00:58:47,340
Oh, even more proof.

1139
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,340
There's a comment on it. I know one who laughs like

1140
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:51,340
"Kia ha ha" in an evil voice.

1141
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:53,340
Can you do that? Can you do that in a more

1142
00:58:53,340 --> 00:58:55,340
evil voice? "Kia ha ha!"

1143
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,340
Number 55 is

1144
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:59,340
"They cut themselves." And there's two comments.

1145
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,340
One is, "I actually do this myself

1146
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:03,340
for several and understandable reasons.

1147
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:05,340
Some that people don't care about."

1148
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,340
And then the comment under that is

1149
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:09,340
"Girl in my class bites herself."

1150
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,340
[laughter]

1151
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:23,340
Number 56, they are obsessed with you and stalk you and the two comments say, "I happen to do this often" and then YoshiDude says, "I did this twice!"

1152
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:35,340
Number 57, they think music is getting better. Here's a comment by Rock Fashionista, "I'm practically psycho and the only music I ever listen to besides rock and metal is 80's music."

1153
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:37,340
Damn, that's so true.

1154
00:59:37,340 --> 00:59:39,340
They laugh crazily.

1155
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:42,900
Number 59 they eat salami with marmalade. Yeah

1156
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:49,420
That's a chart that's a charcuterie board, yeah, dude, that's how I'm so good you're telling me

1157
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:57,740
Charcuterie is psycho. Hell no number 69. They're obsessed with serial killers only comment serial killers are 100% psychos

1158
00:59:57,740 --> 01:00:04,220
I'm not all of them. There has to be a serial killer who killed who did it for a good reason. Yeah Dexter. Oh

1159
01:00:05,380 --> 01:00:09,420
My fucking god. Mm-hmm. I think you just cracked the psycho code

1160
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,220
Here's it. Here's what we should do. Honestly

1161
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,860
psychos, we should get rid of the

1162
01:00:14,860 --> 01:00:21,420
Of it being like a social faux pas to be a psychopath and we should hire these people if Dexter is any indication

1163
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:24,220
We should hire these people as police officers

1164
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:29,700
Because they are so effective at stopping crime according to this TV show Dexter

1165
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:36,380
That on Showtime that I think that we would actually see a much better and more effective police force

1166
01:00:36,380 --> 01:00:40,140
