I'm trying to get that burp out.

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,440
Welcome back to Beers We Drink and we're going and...

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,320
Hold on let me crack my thing open.

21
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,760
I thought you were farting.

22
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,760
You wish.

23
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
I wish I was farting.

24
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,480
Wait I don't have the...

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,560
My drink is pretty fail today I'm not gonna lie.

26
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,020
Okay, let's go from drinks from fail to least fail.

27
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,740
So, Keller, go first.

28
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,200
Well, I'm not saying I have the most failed drinks.

29
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,400
Rex is probably going to have a halo beer.

30
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,120
Rex already promised an epic beer,

31
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,160
so I'm going to put him at least fail.

32
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,460
Mine is kind of fail,

33
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,960
but it probably won't be as fail as yours.

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:15,460
So, go ahead.

35
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,220
I'm double dipping because I just was in a rush on the way home,

36
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,260
and I didn't have time to go to a beer store,

37
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:22,960
but there was a liquor store on the way.

38
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,140
So, I just got one of these again,

39
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,740
these on the rocks pre-made Manhattan's.

40
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,380
But this one's even this one's smaller.

41
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,640
This is actually completely fully drink already.

42
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
This kid. Well, I just poured it.

43
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,540
Actually, this is the

44
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,040
you find it open on the floor.

45
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,380
It just I think I think this would be this funniest alcohol to get addicted to.

46
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:49,080
Hopelessly addicted to pre-made cocktails

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,840
that cost $10, this little thing that happened to my to my dad.

48
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,760
He got one of those things that's like a

49
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,160
juice arrow for like alcoholic drinks.

50
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:05,840
It's like you literally just like get a pre-made can and then it's like a cure egg,

51
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,880
but it just has alcohol in it and then it puts it into, you know, what's one of those

52
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:16,640
things that I've, that I've, that I've seen like online that happens in the U S but I've never like seen in real life.

53
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,720
Democracy.

54
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,680
Yeah, that's right.

55
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Kami.

56
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:22,920
Okay.

57
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,320
I was also going to say, the pre-pack, it's like mixed drinks that people get.

58
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,760
You open a fridge and on a Ziploc bag, it's a beer and a juice and something like that

59
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,400
and you mix it in a gas station.

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I've never seen that either.

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I don't know what the fuck that is.

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
I've seen TikToks of that.

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,640
I don't know what they're called, but I've seen them.

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,880
That does not feel American.

65
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
That feels South Korean.

66
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,840
You know how South Korea, they always introduce some, for whatever reason, there's robots

67
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,180
between you and just the most normal convenience store food.

68
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:53,680
Yeah.

69
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,680
You know?

70
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,720
Like you can't just get a pint of ice cream.

71
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,020
You have to see a robot hand make it in a vending machine.

72
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,100
Yeah.

73
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:02,480
Yeah.

74
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,700
And then also, here's another thing while I'm talking about Korea,

75
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,860
that pisses me off and a lot of the countries in that part of the world.

76
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:14,880
Don't make, don't make things cost $4,000 anything when it is actually $2.

77
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,300
Dude.

78
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,660
That makes me so mad.

79
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:23,500
I'm about to change up to your entire worldview on Korea specifically.

80
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,220
South Korea, they are huge on Christ and Christ-like things.

81
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
I grew up...

82
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
In Korea?

83
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:38,980
I grew up, I lived like very close to a Korean Baptist church.

84
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:45,460
I'm intimately aware of the Korean Christian...

85
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:51,340
I was surfing the radios of the world and I went to South Korea and they got a lot of

86
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:57,500
Christian songs and radio shows in English over there and it was a little wild to me.

87
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,180
That's because we literally used to fly over the country and push lava out of airplanes

88
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:07,980
directly onto their houses and so they started believing in the devil.

89
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,980
Yeah, like Minecraft.

90
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,480
Like literally we griefed all of Korea and they were like,

91
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,520
well, this is, they don't, they were like,

92
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,640
we don't even necessarily think there's a God,

93
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,280
but there's definitely a devil that is doing really bad stuff.

94
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,760
The Korean creeper.

95
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:26,440
My beer is a little fail because it's also kind of a repeat,

96
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,700
but it's a repeat of that curse beer that tastes like shit and it was really

97
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,000
ghost in it. The redemption arc.

98
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,920
So this is the last of these that I have in my fridge.

99
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,700
So I'm gonna try to drink this,

100
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,300
and when I inevitably fail,

101
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:44,300
I'm gonna drink this lemon-lime white claw that I have.

102
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,340
- That's sweet.

103
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,740
That's, you know, I will say, I wouldn't say that's a fail.

104
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,700
It's a repeat, but you didn't really even get to drink

105
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,860
that beer the first time.

106
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:56,060
But open it and show me the top of the lid.

107
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,420
I can't believe you didn't even just, no way.

108
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,260
- Oh my God, dude.

109
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,740
It's gross.

110
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,580
- What?

111
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,020
- It's really gross.

112
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,580
How is that possible?

113
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:10,300
- You think it's like past due?

114
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
How do I check that?

115
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,340
- Just drink your white coffee.

116
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,940
- Take a sip, that's how you check it.

117
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,660
Tell us how it tastes.

118
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:21,520
Does it taste the same?

119
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,340
- It looks great.

120
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,020
Oh my God, it's spilling all over the place.

121
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,260
(laughing)

122
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,980
Oh, what the fuck?

123
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,660
- I knew that was gonna happen.

124
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,700
- God damn it.

125
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,660
He did the classic, the freshman move, dude.

126
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:38,500
He went bottoms up on a bottle.

127
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,220
I should have gotten a less epic beer

128
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,060
because I wish I could have started drinking mine already.

129
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,180
I've been waiting for Julio to clean up.

130
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,180
Okay, I would like to say,

131
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,840
yes, I have a pre-made cocktail,

132
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,840
but I did already have an angry orchard,

133
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,020
Something is like an angry, angry orchard, murder,

134
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:08,780
murder, rape brew or the rape brew.

135
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,760
I don't know if it was called that, but that was kind of the that was like,

136
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,120
you know, how when something has a lot is really high alcohol level.

137
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:15,960
Yeah, yeah.

138
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,660
So what they call it, the bastard.

139
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,260
Yeah, the stupid fucking bitch brew.

140
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,720
And you do in reality drinks 75% of it.

141
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,320
You fall asleep watching The Simpsons.

142
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,620
But they're like, this is for hardcore assholes only.

143
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,080
That's why I like Bud Light, because they got, they call it platinum.

144
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,120
You like Bud Light for other reasons.

145
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,800
Yeah.

146
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,280
You like Bud Light politically.

147
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,040
Yeah.

148
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,760
Oh yeah.

149
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,600
I'm politically aligned with Bud Light.

150
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:44,520
Okay.

151
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,000
Are you saying?

152
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:45,400
Yeah.

153
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,080
You, you, Caleb Mike is strong.

154
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,440
Let's just pretend to talk, to say what he was going to say.

155
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,920
Uh, my name is Caleb.

156
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,240
I'd really appreciate that Bud Light has changed their

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
spokesperson to that Bud Light.

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,080
Okay.

159
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,800
The point about Bud Light is this.

160
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,560
Okay.

161
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,560
I don't care that if people are mad about it, the gay can.

162
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,220
I think that's actually, I think that is what it is about,

163
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,460
is the gay can, that they have a gay can now.

164
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,580
- They have a gay can?

165
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,420
- They do have a gay can?

166
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,980
- That Kid Rock video is one of the best videos ever made.

167
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,060
- I love Kid Rock.

168
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,100
- Where he shoots an MP5.

169
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,740
- That is so fucking incredible, dude.

170
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:31,180
That, okay, Kid Rock gets shit on because of, you know,

171
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,020
everything about him,

172
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,660
but the Osmosis Jones song is easily

173
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,380
one of the funniest recorded lines in the music.

174
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,600
- I feel one way or the other.

175
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,460
I don't care if she's 16, she's beautiful to me.

176
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,820
- I just call that statue Tory.

177
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,500
- But I say it's mandatory.

178
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,160
- That's the line.

179
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,820
Mandatory.

180
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,660
That's what he says.

181
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,900
(laughing)

182
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,740
- It's mandatory.

183
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,580
- Yes, dude.

184
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,660
(laughing)

185
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,560
- And people are disappointed in him.

186
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,940
He's making videos where he's transphobic

187
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,460
and shoots an MP5 into Bud Light cans,

188
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,940
which is the funniest video ever made.

189
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,420
And people are like, "Really, kid?

190
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,700
"Seriously, Mr. Rock?"

191
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,540
Yeah.

192
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,360
- Grow up.

193
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,200
- Grow up, Mr. Rock.

194
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,040
Kid, kid.

195
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,980
- No longer mandatory for you.

196
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,420
(laughing)

197
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,260
- Mandatory.

198
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,540
How much PCP do you have to be fucking smoking

199
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,140
to not just write that line

200
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,900
but put it into a kid's movie about germs?

201
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,740
(laughing)

202
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,260
- Dude, how does that,

203
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,820
how do people just listen to that

204
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,140
and just let that shit go through as well?

205
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:44,100
- That, I would say that is,

206
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,980
a lot of times you see people talk about the Mickey Rooney

207
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,380
like thing or like stuff like that

208
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,300
and people say, oh, it was a different time.

209
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,940
when people at the time were like,

210
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:57,200
"Oh, this is not okay," right?

211
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,400
Like definitely there was that kind of shit going around

212
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,300
even back then in the '60s.

213
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,300
But that specific thing of Kid Rock writing the...

214
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,180
That actually was just a different time.

215
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,520
It's a different time.

216
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,820
That is the only way to explain it,

217
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:16,080
is like how, yeah, people didn't even know.

218
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,380
He must have not known what those words meant.

219
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,780
They must have just been like,

220
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,840
"Well, you know, again, it's a germ saying this."

221
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,140
You think it was like a young thug,

222
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,880
you don't have internet type of thing?

223
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,220
Yeah, I guess.

224
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,100
Yeah, it was just like,

225
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,760
I don't fucking know,

226
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,060
but something just was not...

227
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,180
Here's the thing, right?

228
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,860
If you were a musician of that kind,

229
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,140
up until literally that point,

230
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,980
you could just be with 16 year olds.

231
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,860
That was fine.

232
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,980
That is true.

233
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,160
I should say it's fine.

234
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,200
That was normal.

235
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,940
Nobody knew about it.

236
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,800
Let's record it.

237
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,780
Greg said he was fine and he approves of it and he agrees with it.

238
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,940
I think it's fine.

239
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,880
I do. I actually.

240
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,540
You guys ever think about how you live?

241
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,080
Tyler didn't know that Stephen Tyler was her dad

242
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,540
until she was like 19 or some shit.

243
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,480
And apparently she was a big Aerosmith fan.

244
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,580
So she probably was like her dad.

245
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,640
Listen to a lot of Aerosmith for some reason.

246
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,200
Well, she she probably was fucking.

247
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,900
She's probably like rubbing her shit

248
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,780
thinking about Steve and Tyler had a big poster of him in a room

249
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:24,780
and then one day found out that was her dad.

250
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:27,240
What if your daughter had a poster of you in her room?

251
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,940
I would just say you better say best dad ever. Yeah, right. Yeah.

252
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,940
What if a pedophile had a time machine and they went back in time

253
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,780
to molest themselves as a child?

254
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:41,280
Has anyone asked this before?

255
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,080
Yeah, I just know.

256
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,580
Read it. I just that is.

257
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,540
He just he just wrote that.

258
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,080
You wrote that and read that.

259
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,080
Yeah, I wrote that.

260
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,080
I wrote that just before the show.

261
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:50,920
Really?

262
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,120
That's a really good topic for today.

263
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,680
Wait, I actually want to talk about this.

264
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,520
That is such a compelling movie.

265
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,640
That's like, that is like Primer 2.

266
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,800
That is so smart.

267
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,640
Yeah.

268
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,200
I mean, what are you, yeah, I mean, okay,

269
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,120
so here's the thing.

270
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,400
On one hand,

271
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,040
you, what are you, it's kind of best case scenario.

272
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,160
Yes.

273
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,980
Right?

274
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,820
I put it off, I was doing it to myself.

275
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,260
But here's what I might say.

276
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:22,000
That might be what we call a vicious cycle.

277
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,300
- I was thinking the same thing.

278
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,660
'Cause that kid is gonna grow up

279
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,700
and know that he has to molest himself.

280
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,580
- Yeah, well no, he's gonna be a pedophile

281
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,220
'cause he was molested as a child.

282
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,220
- But it's still like self-contained, no?

283
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:36,540
Like let him just do it, I guess.

284
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,500
- Yeah, I guess, yeah.

285
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,700
It's like-- - He's not hurting anybody.

286
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,740
- Well, he's hurting himself.

287
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:44,460
I mean, he's a buddy, right?

288
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,300
- He's my buddy. - Not my buddy.

289
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,000
That's not my buddy.

290
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,500
Really? That's why I brought it up.

291
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,100
This is his future.

292
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,700
Yeah, he told me.

293
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:55,680
Tell you what, man, even on my worst of days,

294
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,780
I would never molest anybody.

295
00:11:57,780 --> 00:12:00,240
Yeah, that's an awesome.

296
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,080
Church on that.

297
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,420
That is the seriousness that is just sick.

298
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:05,320
You have to be.

299
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,560
I'll say it.

300
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,360
You have to be seriously fucking sick in the head to molest a child.

301
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,400
I agree.

302
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,520
You have to be, there's got to be something wrong with you, man.

303
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,560
So after 17 minutes, I would like to introduce my beard.

304
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,660
Oh yeah, introduce your, sorry, why are you talking about your topics

305
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,060
if you still have a beard intro?

306
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:31,000
It felt on top, it felt, you know, logical to go to that first.

307
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,060
OK.

308
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:38,260
I have an honest Abe, forefather of craft, Mexican lollipop,

309
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:43,320
a watermelon and habanero cider.

310
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,920
That sounds pretty good actually.

311
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:46,920
Is it spicy?

312
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Yeah.

313
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,920
I would hope so.

314
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Damn.

315
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,920
How does it taste?

316
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Good.

317
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,920
Why is the honest dave a Mexican drink?

318
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,920
I don't know.

319
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,560
What's your honest dave review?

320
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,960
Pretty good.

321
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,520
It has that flavor of like tajin and like fruit.

322
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:11,160
I mean I'm going to need a numeric value between 1 and 10.

323
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,160
7.

324
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:17,280
pretty good. We don't do that around here. We're not Siskel and Ebert.

325
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:21,440
Well, well, well. A Mike-tion had to occur.

326
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay, so as I was saying, the elites clearly don't want us to do this episode of Beers We

327
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,320
Drink. They've been keeping me and Rex busy all day so that we're as tired as can be.

328
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,160
They made Rex wear that beanie over his beanie.

329
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,160
They're trying to hide his beautiful hair from the world.

330
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
I know somebody gave you that beanie today.

331
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,160
Somebody on the street dressed like a Jehovah's Witness gave you that.

332
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,160
And it was definitely some kind of CIA operative.

333
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
Yeah, it's reducing the brainwaves.

334
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,160
It's because we're tackling dangerous ideas.

335
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
Yeah.

336
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,160
Such as what if a pedophile went back in time and molested himself?

337
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:11,560
I'm kind of feeling like, I'm almost feeling like that was some kind of, maybe you didn't

338
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,560
write that.

339
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,560
I'll come clean, it's an Ayela poll.

340
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,960
Oh my god.

341
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,960
What's Ayela?

342
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,400
Oh, she's a girl.

343
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,480
She's a lady who says she's in love.

344
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,680
I have a pretty good one.

345
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:37,560
Would you rather fight 100 horses or 100 ducks?

346
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,600
I think it's supposed to be 100 duck-sized horses.

347
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,860
You just exposed yourself.

348
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
We got you.

349
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,620
You got me what?

350
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,320
You got me for correcting you?

351
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,360
Yeah, you used Reddit.

352
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
I just got you.

353
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,160
- You've just asked that before.

354
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
- Hook, line, and stake.

355
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,400
(laughing)

356
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
- I've asked it before.

357
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,680
It's my favorite question.

358
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,740
I'm giving a toast as a best man.

359
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,240
Toast to the happy couple,

360
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,040
but also, would you guys rather fight?

361
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,300
(laughing)

362
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:18,480
- I would take a hundred ducks, I think.

363
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,440
- I could easily snap the neck of a hundred ducks.

364
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,200
- I would kill, I'd love to kill some horses.

365
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:32,600
Horses are fucking, I'd take out all my aggression I have for dogs and just out on one horse.

366
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,760
The thing about the question, right, is it presumes that the hundred animals have some

367
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,760
sort of teamwork.

368
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:43,040
Like, you're like Neo in the Matrix fighting a hundred Mr. Smiths.

369
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,400
The thing is, a bunch of horses are just going to stand there and fight.

370
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
All at the same time.

371
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,680
Yeah, they're not going to be like, "Whoa, that guy's fighting that horse.

372
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
other horse we should help that horse.

373
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,680
We should do a horse genocide.

374
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Yeah, dude, people fucking, have you ever, you know what,

375
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
people, there's guys whose entire job

376
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,680
is to kill one thousand cows

377
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
in a day. The other

378
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,680
nine hundred cows don't do shit

379
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
about when he's got a

380
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,680
fucking air gun to one cow's

381
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,680
head, they're not like, oh shit, he's

382
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,680
gonna kill that cow.

383
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,680
They just sit there and wait their turn.

384
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Speaking of killing animals,

385
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,680
do you see that thing, I really

386
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,520
want to do that thing.

387
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,720
Oh, did you kill another?

388
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,820
Did you throw another fucking animal?

389
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,520
Unborn?

390
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:26,680
All right.

391
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:27,120
Preborn.

392
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,320
All right.

393
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,660
Say that preborn animal.

394
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:29,760
I'll do it.

395
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,180
I'll do a bird update real quick.

396
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,680
The birds are completely gone.

397
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,520
Yeah.

398
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,820
They they fly.

399
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,960
Fly sometimes.

400
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:36,820
Good.

401
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,180
That's what I wanted to happen.

402
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:38,480
Yeah.

403
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,280
They haven't laid a shit.

404
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,220
The bird or a twig.

405
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,780
Yeah.

406
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,380
There's a lot of gay guys walking into Jeffrey Dahmer's house.

407
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,080
You fucking psycho.

408
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,920
Yeah.

409
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,780
What'd you just put in your mouth?

410
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,320
Me?

411
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:57,380
Yeah, I tried to I pushed a piece of ice around in my drink and then I I sucked off my finger

412
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,680
From my drink. Did you think I ate a booger?

413
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:06,460
What did you think that I put a booger on my desk and saved it for now?

414
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:16,620
What kind of boogers do you think I have you think I've crunchy boogers my boogers are soft as silk mine are hard dude

415
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,360
Okay, what I said I'm shooting cement

416
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,280
How does that work?

417
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,720
The fucking it dries up and it's hard

418
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,040
Okay, I can have the same thing of a sinus infection. He's a dry boogers

419
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:42,480
Yeah, but right. Yes, probably I blow spider webs onto my hands whenever I sneeze and shit. I'm just purely

420
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,360
ooey gooey disgusting

421
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:49,680
I'm serious

422
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,680
Anyways, these beers are crazy.

423
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,680
What?

424
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,680
You guys think that's gross?

425
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,680
No, I think that's normal.

426
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,680
Yeah.

427
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
I think Julio and I are weird.

428
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:03,680
Julio, what's your topic for today for beers we drink?

429
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,680
Oh, I want to...

430
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,680
The number one beer podcast in the world.

431
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Thank you.

432
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
Stay with us, please.

433
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Okay.

434
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,680
Look around.

435
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,680
So, good thing you said that with the number one beer podcast in the world.

436
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,680
What about if we made our own beer?

437
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,760
But what would our own dream beer look like?

438
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,760
- This is so fucking contentious.

439
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,920
I've thought about this so much

440
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,360
because we have three different types,

441
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,160
we have three different tastes, honestly.

442
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,600
Which is that I almost never have a beer on the show.

443
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,440
- Okay.

444
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,660
- Rex always has a very funny beer.

445
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:40,200
And Julio, you always have the worst of the three, somehow.

446
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
Even though I don't even have a beer,

447
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,040
you always have the worst choice.

448
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,080
So I don't really know what,

449
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:51,760
I don't think there is a beer that can be triangulated with those three tastes.

450
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,980
I think a sweet one.

451
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,480
Chocolate beer.

452
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,280
Nobody wants a chocolate beer, mate.

453
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
That's disgusting.

454
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,840
Have you ever had a chocolate stout?

455
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Wait, you just had one.

456
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:09,320
The one that you spit out because it had some kind of trisipeps or whatever.

457
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,880
No, I don't think this has any mushrooms.

458
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,680
I could go for a milk stout right now.

459
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,360
I wish I was drinking a milk stout instead. I'd go for a glass of milk

460
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,600
That's what if I and I'll say it a lot of people want me to say this if we were three babies

461
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,720
That's what the podcast would be about. Yeah milk. We drink drink

462
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,040
Cracking open abreast. Did I used to love?

463
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,720
Talk about I don't love milk

464
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:38,360
Yeah, I used to Loki not me. I love my Jewish genetics. My ass was not drinking any milk

465
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,080
Yeah, I could tell you were bottle or you were a formula bottle. I

466
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:49,420
Was the opposite of formula fed but after that we're what's the opposite of formula fed big-ass fucking tits

467
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,260
Huge tits

468
00:19:53,260 --> 00:20:06,920
They smell

469
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,100
Just fed normally

470
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:15,080
Massive yeah, there's so you know it's so big that the shirt comes off and you're like what the fuck does that smell?

471
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:27,060
It just smells like a you know like the back of a leg that's been sitting on a car in a car seat too long

472
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,460
You know kind of got that just

473
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:34,780
That road trip smell that your balls get road trip smell you're at the gas station

474
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,780
And you take yeah, you smell your balls when you sit down on the toilet

475
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,260
Yeah, yeah when I go like you've been drinking so much caffeine your whole body is sweating

476
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:48,700
Yeah, exactly. Like I feel like probably some women who have Brett really large breasts. I bet when they pop them out. They're like, oh

477
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:56,960
It smells like the inside the inside of my knee, you know, yeah

478
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,300
So that was your entire childhood then Rex, right? Yeah, right. I was getting in my whole childhood. They're really big smelly ones

479
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,860
The big stinkers

480
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:13,600
My childhood man, my mom basically had no tits at all. That's so sad man. No wonder you're like flat. Yeah

481
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,180
so I just didn't get any of my

482
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,980
Nutrients and I really struggled in school. I had attitude issues

483
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Oh, I had those you know

484
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:28,340
He's trying to sneak in I used to try to pretend that I was a younger kid because I

485
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:31,260
Just I thought that I'd be better in those classes. I

486
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:34,260
Tried to do Madison when I was four

487
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,260
That's really smart.

488
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:38,260
I tried to do a full Billy Madison.

489
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:42,260
If you get an A, they have to give you an A for your real class.

490
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,260
I was a good kid.

491
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:48,260
That's how you get a 5.1 GPA.

492
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,260
But that's what I did have, is heart.

493
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,260
I had real heart.

494
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
Right.

495
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,260
I had real heart. And then I got older.

496
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
At the end of my childhood.

497
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,260
And your heart just...

498
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
No.

499
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
Closed up?

500
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,700
- I would say that I have, of the three of us,

501
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,400
by far the most open heart.

502
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:09,460
You two are both just kind of cold, mechanical,

503
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,700
evil people, bad, really bad people.

504
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,480
- Who do you think is the most cringe-like?

505
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,100
- Most cringe-like is you.

506
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,220
- Okay, that's not what I said.

507
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,620
I said cringe-like.

508
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,460
- Also you. - Cringe-to-like.

509
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,300
- Yeah, definitely still you.

510
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,780
- That's not true at all.

511
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,620
- You are the cringe. - Well, what, then it's me?

512
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,900
- I love Christmas.

513
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:30,300
- One of us here does not love Christmas.

514
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,420
(laughing)

515
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:35,860
- Okay, save for the small fact that you love Christmas,

516
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,140
you are the most Grinch-like.

517
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:39,220
If you took Christmas completely

518
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,780
out of the story of the Grinch.

519
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:43,580
- That's impossible.

520
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,880
- What if the Grinch was about a guy

521
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,020
getting an Airbnb for his friends?

522
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,020
Who would then be the most Grinch-like?

523
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:54,680
- Yeah, who's the stingiest with money here?

524
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,260
It's actually Julio.

525
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,460
- Yeah.

526
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,860
I have none of it.

527
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,980
- Well, see, that's what a stingy person says.

528
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,740
Oh, I can't pay, I have none of it.

529
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,140
I can't pay for the bill.

530
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,420
You've never bought me and Rex dinner once.

531
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,820
- Julio has a-- - That's not true.

532
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,660
- A joke wallet that opens up and a fly comes out

533
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
on the spring like a cucumber.

534
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,620
(laughing)

535
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,140
- I'm not the broke friend ordering wings.

536
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,740
- You are the broke AF friend ordering wings

537
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,020
and having us memo you for one of them.

538
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,540
- That's not true. - We take one wing

539
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,220
and you go, "Hey, can you Venmo me for that?"

540
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,020
And I go, "Okay, what's eight divided by 12?"

541
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,500
(laughing)

542
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,140
All right, I'll send that to you, whatever.

543
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,820
- That is not true.

544
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,260
- That is true.

545
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,060
Back me up on this, Rex.

546
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,860
- Oh, I honestly, I'm thinking about it.

547
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,780
And my favorite Julio thing that he does

548
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,420
is I'll get the Airbnb,

549
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,580
I'll drop thousands of dollars on housing.

550
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,420
- Tens of thousands.

551
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,660
- And he will very politely get the cheapest meal

552
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,140
on Uber Eats for both of us.

553
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,140
That's not true.

554
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,140
He'll get us halal food. It'll be like $12 each.

555
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,140
Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy with it. I appreciate it.

556
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,140
I gotta say something, Leo. I've done that move too.

557
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:16,140
I've done that move. When I was in Raleigh with Adam, I was like,

558
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,140
"Hey, do you want any Taco Bell?"

559
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,140
[laughter]

560
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:26,140
for Ipe's or every fucking meal and I'm like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm ordering."

561
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
You're ordering a fucking chalupa?

562
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,140
I'm ordering, "Taco Bell, you want something?"

563
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,180
He's like, "Bro, yes, thank you so much."

564
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,820
I was like, "Yeah, dude, it's not a problem."

565
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:37,140
Yeah, don't worry, I fucking got you.

566
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,260
And then afterwards I was like, "Damn, he really is not even going to offer to like

567
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,340
reimburse me for that $25 time.

568
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,340
That's kind of whack."

569
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,340
Yeah.

570
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:51,580
Listen, I just didn't know I was such a burden on my friends.

571
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,680
I guess I'll just go kill myself.

572
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,440
- We're just waiting for you to get your paper up

573
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,040
so that you can start shipping in.

574
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,040
And then it'll all fall on you.

575
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,880
- I'm trying to make you,

576
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,920
I'm trying to raise you like a son

577
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:05,200
to be a professional athlete.

578
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,040
- We support you.

579
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,920
- I really, really want you to play.

580
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,760
I really think that you have the perfect brain and body

581
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,300
to be a professional golfer.

582
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,840
- I would love to become a golfer.

583
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,080
- Now, can you imagine?

584
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,000
That has to be by far the easiest, not easiest sport.

585
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,240
It's the hardest sport, I'll say.

586
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,080
- Right.

587
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,840
fun sport to be a professional in?

588
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,680
Do you have to be, does my height, is my height helpful at all in golf?

589
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:29,800
Yeah.

590
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,880
Is height at all like a factor in golf?

591
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:36,760
I would say, if I had to guess, most pro golfers are around six feet, maybe a little over.

592
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,600
Okay.

593
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,160
Yeah, then I can do it.

594
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,320
As far as, there's not a lot, it's not like basketball where you need to have like long

595
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,840
arms and big hands or something.

596
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:51,440
Like there's pretty much good golfers at every size, you know.

597
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,000
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

598
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,880
- But I think that you just have a genius brain for golf

599
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,880
because I've seen, I've watched you play PGA Tour 2K22.

600
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,300
- Dude, I love that game.

601
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,140
- Yeah, I know.

602
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:03,980
I know you play that game.

603
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,820
And I've seen you play it,

604
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,240
and you were an ace in the hole in that game.

605
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:11,800
I've seen you hit 175 yard just dunks,

606
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,560
just right into the pin.

607
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,800
- Me and Rex was just like sitting at this court

608
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,760
all together like at 12 in the morning just like playing golf in silence

609
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,520
through each other until we're so tired we're like I just gotta go. I kind of

610
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:31,320
want to do that tonight I'm not gonna lie to you guys. After we record this we should play some PGA Tour 2k22.

611
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:36,520
Because that is a fun fucking game. I think we should do a live episode from Topgolf.

612
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:45,040
I think we should do that this May. I would love to go back to Topgolf. Topgolf is...

613
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:49,960
Is there Topgolf in New York? Oh yeah there is. There's also we could go to the Chelsea

614
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,560
Pier. Chelsea Pier's driving range where you like hit into the river. That's awesome.

615
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,000
Yeah I think about golf it's the most it's the sport that most sets itself to drinking a beer

616
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,160
and doing it at the same time.

617
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,880
Exactly.

618
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,160
I feel.

619
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:12,120
Oh, dude. The first time I ever played golf, I got so unbelievably fucked up and I played maybe four – I

620
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:17,720
paid for an entire 18 hours that I'd never played before on a really hard course, the municipal course

621
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,080
in Wilmington, which is a tough course. Good golfers play at it. And it was really expensive.

622
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:31,520
It was like $60, $65 for a car. And me and my brother just brought a bunch of Michelob

623
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:38,000
ultras and we just got so fucked up and embarrassed ourselves hitting 15 times

624
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,340
on every single hole and then by the fourth one we had let maybe six or seven

625
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:47,440
groups play through like play in front of like play through us yeah so we're like

626
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,920
okay we're just not gonna finish this like we're gonna be here all day so we

627
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:59,840
just gave up sounds fun it was honestly one of the best days so so fun I got to

628
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,500
The first time I ever played golf,

629
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,440
I really, really thought that the entire thing

630
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,840
was just dressing up.

631
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,180
So I raided my stepfather's closet,

632
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:11,360
I found every quarter zip shirt that he had.

633
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,840
- You're dressed for it right now.

634
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,680
- I remember exactly what I wore.

635
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,720
I wore black slacks.

636
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,640
I wore Skechers.

637
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,800
That's right, I wore Skechers.

638
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,760
- Wow, okay. - I wore a braided brown belt.

639
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,860
I wore a purple striped polo

640
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,360
and a gray, a heather gray quarter zip.

641
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,340
And then on top, I had a Boston Red Sox hat on.

642
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,280
And in my mouth was a $2 cigar.

643
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,120
- Yup.

644
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,080
- Yup, and let me tell you,

645
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,040
I looked like about a million bucks.

646
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,880
- You did.

647
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,700
You looked like about $2.

648
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:47,000
- I was using my little brother's clubs,

649
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,720
his children's clubs that are about eight inches too short

650
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,520
for me to use because he was at the time nine years old.

651
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:58,800
And I was using those in front of just a bunch of old guys.

652
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:02,960
And they were saying this guy wait, this guy is gonna be something one day

653
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,640
This guy could become a professional golfer and play on the tour

654
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:09,040
I think you could go

655
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:17,360
First of all, he's gonna be really good at smoking cigars by then because I was spitting all over the place

656
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,480
I had the thing was a different color halfway down the cigar because it was wet

657
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:27,480
And then

658
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,920
Yeah, man, I just want to get to the point where I get to do one of the proams with Justin Timberlake. Hmm

659
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,600
That's such a goal of mine. I think you could go pro

660
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,280
like driving f1

661
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:49,100
Definitely a crash test on me. Yeah, cuz you're you're so smooth that the wind just yes

662
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:56,040
Aerodynamics. Yeah, you're so aerodynamic out of the three of us. You're the most aerodynamic. Actually, you're a small as a pill

663
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,080
Speaking of I think I'm gonna I accidentally called my ball sack my pills the other day

664
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:05,760
That's gonna stick. I think that's gonna stick around

665
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,920
How did that happen?

666
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,680
Somebody

667
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:20,840
You know how your voice kind of if you if somebody punches you in the balls as you're talking your voice like changes

668
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,160
Yeah

669
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:30,900
I tried to say don't hit my balls and my wife hit my balls at the exact time.

670
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,400
So it kind of sounded like I was like, "Don't hit my pills!"

671
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:39,400
So now I think I'll call them my pills the rest of my life.

672
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,400
Don't hit my pills!

673
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,400
Don't hit my pills!

674
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
Don't hit my pills!

675
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:50,900
I think it's funny to fucking try to hit my balls all the time. How fucked up is that?

676
00:30:50,900 --> 00:31:01,540
You should you should do something that is kind of on the same level for women which i don't know what it is girls don't have a simple they say like oh you don't understand.

677
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:13,380
Start punching them don't let me punch every single square inch of your body and see what hurts the most and that is what i would punch all the time i think it's funny that's what you're doing.

678
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,700
(laughing)

679
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,800
How fucked up is that?

680
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:19,220
- It is fucked up that we get a big

681
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,260
like Zelda style like weak point.

682
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,100
- We have a weak point, yeah exactly.

683
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:26,820
We have a glowing weak point, a red glowing weak point.

684
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,940
- Literally.

685
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,140
- That women think is so funny.

686
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,780
They think it's so, so funny.

687
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,980
And I've seen grown men vomit because they hit their balls.

688
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:38,500
That isn't funny.

689
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,340
- They're pills you mean.

690
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,900
- That's how funny it all is.

691
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,740
- They hit their pills right on the fucking,

692
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,380
By the way, you can also consider your penis

693
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,780
part of your pills, depending on--

694
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:48,060
- That's a thick pill.

695
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,900
- The third pill.

696
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:49,720
- Not for me.

697
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,700
- Yeah.

698
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,060
- I would say my balls and my penis

699
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,540
are about the same size.

700
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,580
- Yeah.

701
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,260
- Yeah, soft.

702
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,660
- You got triplets?

703
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:01,100
- Yeah, I have three pills that just kind of sit perfectly.

704
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,060
It's like, you know those magnets?

705
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,780
Those magnets that spin around like this?

706
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,460
They're all like that, you know?

707
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,300
- Yeah.

708
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,980
- Three of those just in a row.

709
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:10,500
Sometimes I think I'm jacking off

710
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:16,180
I'm just grabbing my balls and doing this for like 45 minutes.

711
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:19,180
Why is this working?

712
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,180
Yeah.

713
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:25,820
But I think that pills is definitely going to make its way into the lexicon very soon.

714
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,220
I'm going to use that.

715
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,340
I think that's how most stuff that we say is born.

716
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
You just said something stupid.

717
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,340
Exactly.

718
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,340
Like fud.

719
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,340
Or pills.

720
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:38,740
This is like somebody doing, or you know I invented cap.

721
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,740
You did not invent that.

722
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,740
Prove me right.

723
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:44,740
What was the context of you inventing cap?

724
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
What were you calling cap?

725
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,740
Someone capped right at me and I said that's cap.

726
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
Capping about what?

727
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,740
They were capping about, I don't even remember, it's been so long.

728
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,740
I invented that probably 2004.

729
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,740
Right.

730
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,740
Yeah?

731
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,740
Well I invented the gritty.

732
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:02,740
You invented gritting your teeth.

733
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
No, I did not invent that.

734
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
You did not invent that.

735
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,620
No, I did not invent that.

736
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,620
You did invent that.

737
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,620
That's stupid.

738
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:15,620
Yeah, you invented the shitty, you invented shitting your pants.

739
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,620
You invented that.

740
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,620
That's not true, I did not invent that.

741
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:24,820
Okay, how did you invent the gritty then?

742
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
I saw someone do it and I was like, "That's the gritty."

743
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
Wait, that's not, that's not, wait.

744
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,820
You can't say you just saw someone do it.

745
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:29,820
That's naming the gritty.

746
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,820
Yeah.

747
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,820
Yeah, I invented it.

748
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,820
Yeah.

749
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:35,120
I invented it.

750
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I saw someone do it.

751
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,620
I guess that's the same thing with Cap.

752
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,120
Like I didn't invent lying.

753
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,120
Yeah.

754
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,120
Although I wish I did.

755
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,120
I don't know what Ricky Gervais is.

756
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,120
See if they rebooted that movie

757
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:45,620
it'd be called The Invention of Capping.

758
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,020
Right.

759
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,520
And isn't that...

760
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,420
If that doesn't make Kid Rock shoot up a fucking school

761
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,420
then I don't know what will

762
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,720
because that is some serious shit.

763
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
Kid Rock shouldn't shoot up a school.

764
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
How funny would that be?

765
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,520
I mean...

766
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,720
Would you even be mad if your kid got shot by Kid Rock?

767
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,240
Oh yeah. Yeah, I'd definitely... yeah.

768
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,740
And then what?

769
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:12,640
I'd probably be mad if anybody killed my child.

770
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:17,380
Wait, who was he threatening by shooting all that beer?

771
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,920
He's threatening me.

772
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,240
He's threatening us. Wait, he was threatening this podcast.

773
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,740
Wait, what? We need to stand our ground.

774
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,240
He was saying, "Beers we drink, beers I shoot."

775
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,440
He should shoot Kid Rock.

776
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,720
Yeah, exactly.

777
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:37,880
That's what we need to do is we need to get a beer that shoots kid rock.

778
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:38,400
Yeah.

779
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,720
Yeah.

780
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,240
Tie it all together.

781
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,080
That's a dream beer.

782
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,360
Our dream beer.

783
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:43,920
Yeah.

784
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,560
This beer bites back.

785
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:46,320
It's sweet.

786
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,360
It's chocolate.

787
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,440
And it shoots kid rock.

788
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,120
Wait, that's the label.

789
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:56,880
It's like it looks like this machine kills fascists, but it says this beer kills kid rock.

790
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,560
This is so smart.

791
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,000
Yeah, like, we could, it could be like a, like a death type thing.

792
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,640
It'll be just like, just like an edgy name.

793
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,540
Yeah.

794
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
That's, we'll be like, "Whoa, that's awesome."

795
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:11,840
We should do a line of different "This Machine Kills Fascists" laptop stickers

796
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,900
that are just not even recognizable as parodies.

797
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,940
Yeah.

798
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,300
"This machine drinks beer."

799
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,200
Yeah.

800
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
"I drank a beer."

801
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Just in that same font and kind of width.

802
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,500
"This guy drank a beer."

803
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,200
Yeah, "This guy drank a beer."

804
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
Tattoo on your back

805
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,680
Whatever

806
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:41,040
This machine kills fascist stick you're like this is the inspiration but I don't want to say any of these words

807
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,300
That's a good idea. We need to get you guys a bunch of tattoos like me

808
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:01,600
hundreds and hundreds of tattoos

809
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:09,200
You're a virgin like me yeah, I wouldn't be able to be buried in a cemetery

810
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:15,240
Yeah, that's true. You don't want to be buried in a Jewish cemetery. I don't

811
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:22,680
Oh, yeah, is your family do not right

812
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:35,560
the

813
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:44,600
the

814
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,800
Honestly, I think you should get a tattoo wearing your forehead that says the devil

815
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,080
That's the devil. Yeah

816
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,800
That's good

817
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,440
Like the Drake one, yeah

818
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,520
Yeah

819
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,800
To meet Drake no

820
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,800
What about some knuckle tattoos that say "Dunceville"?

821
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:16,800
I saw knuckle tattoos the other day that literally were nonsense.

822
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,800
I swear to God, I saw this guy, I was at a diner, and a guy...

823
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,800
Dirt Evil?

824
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,800
That's cool.

825
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,800
Dirt Evil.

826
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,800
I saw a guy at a diner, a guy who was working at a diner in the kitchen the other day, and

827
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:39,800
I couldn't even remember, I can't remember exactly what they said, but they might as well have said like "mobile bedoodle".

828
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:51,800
Like they said just nothing. It was just like random consonants and letters and like vowels in like just alternating order to make it look like it was a word, but none of them were words.

829
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:58,800
Oh that's cool. It could be like just like the initials to something and it just, no one gets it but you.

830
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:07,940
It was like trying to do it was like he was you know when you start a word all but you don't put a word you just do like words letters you think might be in just yeah yeah.

831
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,280
Yeah it's like that and i.

832
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:20,920
Yeah i kinda wanted to ask him like is that is that like grandma's name is that like.

833
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:30,640
Is that some kind of thing that you like is a food that you like or something left left hand word second hand.

834
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,440
I would do.

835
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,600
How do.

836
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,080
Oh this is actually really smart.

837
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:45,640
I would be left on this one on my on my palm it would be the number four.

838
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,080
Uh-huh, okay dead and then on the other promise to say left for dead -

839
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:59,760
And people be like what's that it's a game

840
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,040
Yeah, did you really like that game? See?

841
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,960
Yeah, oh PS

842
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,360
That's good

843
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,080
Yeah, I

844
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:20,500
I think getting I I know somebody who has a dishonored hand tattoo that's dope

845
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:25,040
dishonored like the video game yeah they have there's some symbol in it or some

846
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,380
shit and she that's the side of someone on her hand whose whose impulse control

847
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:35,540
is so bad they don't like have the time to think about the fact that this

848
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:39,800
honored will be forgotten in like six months because they had to have gotten

849
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,600
that like right away, right?

850
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,880
- Yeah.

851
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,600
- You know, that's why--

852
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,520
- I used to be such a,

853
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,760
I used to be kind of such a snob about tattoos.

854
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,280
And I was like, yeah, you should always get something

855
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,240
that's like always gonna look good

856
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,080
for the rest of your life.

857
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,120
- Yeah. - And like be time,

858
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,840
no, you should get--

859
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,680
- No, you should get a return--

860
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,520
- If you wanna get tattoos,

861
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,520
first of all, you shouldn't get tattoos.

862
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,800
But if you're going to,

863
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,920
you should get every,

864
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,840
the first thing that pops into your mind

865
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,080
every single time and never think about it.

866
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,280
- No, 100%.

867
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:09,280
- You should just get them.

868
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,800
There's like, there's no such thing as a good tattoo.

869
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,480
They're all stupid.

870
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:16,440
If you wanna be, if you wanna have them, just get them.

871
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,400
- I think the thing that-

872
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,320
- Getting a beer mug tattooed

873
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,120
and someone asking me what it means.

874
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,680
- That's it, I've had people do that with this.

875
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,200
It's a fucking eagle.

876
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,200
It's a bird.

877
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,320
- What does that mean? - Or this one.

878
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,200
This one, a skull with flames in it.

879
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,920
They're like, what does that mean?

880
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,440
I don't know, I'd probably-

881
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,720
- It's a skull with flames in it.

882
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,320
- Yeah, it's like a dead guy's head, bones,

883
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,120
and then it's on fire.

884
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:40,960
- Yeah.

885
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,360
I think people love getting like Givley tattoos

886
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,120
and like cartoon tattoos.

887
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:49,320
I think that's what people get these days.

888
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,160
- Yeah. - Yeah, I would never

889
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,980
do that shit.

890
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:52,400
I think that's for the devil.

891
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,360
- Yeah.

892
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,560
- I think it's an evil endeavor

893
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,400
and I would never sell my body like that.

894
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:00,040
- I would get a beer re-drink tattoo like yesterday.

895
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:02,240
- What would it look like?

896
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,120
- I'm gonna get like an old English tummy rocker

897
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,800
like Tupac had West Coast.

898
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,300
I'll just have beer like around my my belly.

899
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,400
Yeah, I think it'd be cool.

900
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,140
I want to get one of those like Yakuza style tattoos,

901
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:18,240
but instead of like a cool animal, it's like a beer splashing with water.

902
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,080
Like like the Japanese wave.

903
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,680
Mm. That's a good.

904
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,140
Yeah. Great wave of beer on your right.

905
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:26,380
Giant back. Just huge.

906
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:30,180
And people and just like in like for one person, one month.

907
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:32,380
It looks exactly like this.

908
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,880
Yeah. Like it looks like a piss.

909
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,880
Yeah. The color just goes awful.

910
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,680
Yeah, yeah, it just gets so so bad.

911
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,680
I'm going I'm I'm hiking up the mountain to get the Thailand like,

912
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,560
you know, tick tick tick tattoo.

913
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,260
Tabori.

914
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:50,760
Yeah, I'm going I'm walking a mile uphill every day to get that done.

915
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,560
I finally show it and it's just a huge bug.

916
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:58,100
Yeah, you get a Tabori fucking like

917
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:04,880
18000 dollar beer mug tattoo done by a 90 year old man in Korea.

918
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:10,240
He's just hitting you're hitting a needle with a mallet for days at a time.

919
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,500
He's going to get that by the biceps into cans of Sapporo.

920
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:18,140
Like the guy turned to the professor,

921
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,200
you know, turn himself into a snake or whatever.

922
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,500
Yeah, but it's just different beer cans.

923
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:28,380
And then your face, a big smiley face.

924
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:31,100
Yeah, that is the happiest man of all time.

925
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,140
It is the the serpent guy.

926
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:36,780
know the beer man that we just invented.

927
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,280
Yeah.

928
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,780
He could be like, uh, uh, did somebody check in on Mr. Cool Ice?

929
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
I don't even know who that is.

930
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,780
I think he's dead.

931
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,780
You don't know Mr. Cool Ice? Look up Mr. Cool Ice right now.

932
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:46,780
I know Mr. Cool Ice.

933
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:51,780
Mr. Cool Ice is this guy who has, um, all these great tattoos.

934
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:55,780
That say, uh, that say Mr. Cool Ice.

935
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Yeah, that guy.

936
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,780
Oh wait, he's, he's, he's doing alright.

937
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,740
it improved. Dude these are cool. This is on shitty the shitty tattoos subreddit. These

938
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,900
are cool tattoos. Yeah. These are awesome. These are cool dude. I would have that on

939
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:18,980
my body tomorrow. Wait did he get it on his head though? Oh yeah he has the uh he has the

940
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:22,860
sunglasses on the back of his head. That is so cool. Sunglasses on the back of the head

941
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:27,180
is fucking dope. Rex I think you should do like Mr. Cool Eyes but with that outfit that

942
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:28,940
69 or like years ago.

943
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,320
What's that like, pussy?

944
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,520
Oh yeah, pussy.

945
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,480
The N word.

946
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,480
Oh yeah.

947
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:36,020
I think you can do that one.

948
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:38,160
That is the funniest thing of like,

949
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,360
there's only like four guys in the world.

950
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,660
Is that like that image was so funny 10 years ago.

951
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:44,160
Yeah.

952
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,460
Nobody can like a rapper.

953
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:45,960
Yeah.

954
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,300
Who's another person like that?

955
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:52,100
Every single rapper of all time.

956
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,280
You know who I think is going to be like that is the backpack song kid.

957
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,940
I feel like he's trying to get that.

958
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,820
I think that in like I think I honestly think in 10 years

959
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,360
he's going to be like an A24 director or something.

960
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,960
Yeah, we're like he's going to make a movie or he'll be the lead in a Saftey Brothers movie.

961
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,020
And you know who's going to be in a Saftey Brothers movie?

962
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,520
Oh, genius. Who?

963
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:15,560
Matan Evans.

964
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,700
Probably.

965
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:19,560
It's probably already in the next one.

966
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:22,860
What we were talking about, I think with we're talking about with Alex,

967
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,580
where like, it's so stupid, that whole thing of like,

968
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,660
oh yeah, he's everywhere.

969
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:32,900
But literally, what the, how the fuck is he doing that shit?

970
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,380
That's so scary. - I know, dude.

971
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,140
Literally, he shows up once a day, right?

972
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,660
- Yeah, I could all day be like,

973
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:41,420
ah yeah, this kid's trying too hard,

974
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:44,300
but then like, does he have like a whole team

975
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:45,140
working on this?

976
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:46,980
Like, this is unreal.

977
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:49,700
- Are we just going to like LA-based events now?

978
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:52,020
- No, dude, he's all over the place.

979
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,320
I don't think it's a little bit of background of every video.

980
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,960
I don't it's it is crazy.

981
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,100
It's a it's like a Nathan Fielder thing.

982
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:02,520
Like we'll find out that it's like, yeah, it does feel like a setup.

983
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:04,420
Yeah. Yeah.

984
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:07,400
And also, there's the like that kid definitely one day

985
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:12,060
is going to be some kind of world leader or something that I think he's 15 or 14.

986
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:14,660
A very powerful voice for a 15 year old.

987
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:15,320
Yeah, definitely.

988
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:19,060
He sounds like me when I was like the same age and I had a high voice

989
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:23,820
And I would try I made runescape videos and I would make I would do a deeper voice

990
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:27,060
because, yeah, I didn't want people to think I was a girl.

991
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,260
Well, being like the most famous guy now just means that you make

992
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,320
like the worst videos of all time.

993
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,800
So like he could easily be like an Aiden Ross type figure.

994
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:43,600
Like, yeah, yeah, with these kids, man, they're all having a rough go of it.

995
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,620
I think they need a potential figure.

996
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:50,700
- They need books, they need three different

997
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,820
personal figures that do make a single podcast

998
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,620
about drinking a beer.

999
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:57,220
- Should we step in?

1000
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,060
- Yeah.

1001
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:59,380
- Should we do something about this?

1002
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:02,500
Should we take over Twitch?

1003
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,060
- Yeah, you see that tweet about like,

1004
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:08,900
oh, Rogan is bad, Peterson is bad, Tate is bad.

1005
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,340
All right, but who's gonna be a good male role model?

1006
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,620
That's us, that's us right there.

1007
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:16,140
Yes.

1008
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,100
Rex is gonna teach him about money.

1009
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:28,100
Caleb is going to teach him about life and I'll teach him about gaming using the computer.

1010
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,100
I'll gracefully go bald at 25.

1011
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:33,100
Okay, so you insulted me.

1012
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,100
Yeah.

1013
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:39,100
And also, actually, there's a big compliment that you're saying I went bald this year.

1014
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,100
As I said gracefully.

1015
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,100
I would say that I went bald at...

1016
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,100
Two years old.

1017
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:53,860
17. I would say I'm a bald at 17. Yeah, but you didn't shave your head until...

1018
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:58,260
You didn't give up. No, no, no, no, but that's not when you go bald. You go bald the second you

1019
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:03,900
start balding. That is when you go bald. You look fine. Why? Because that's the only

1020
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:08,580
place that you can place a line. Because otherwise the line is when you have no

1021
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:14,580
hair on your entire head. Yeah. If you go bald not by your own volition, it's

1022
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,380
It's the second that you start balding.

1023
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:18,500
- Okay.

1024
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:23,500
I feel like the moment you go past here, right?

1025
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,020
When you're at the crest of your head.

1026
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,580
- This is coming from somebody who's already started balding.

1027
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,020
You've already gone bald.

1028
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:33,180
That's what I'm saying.

1029
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,560
You're bald.

1030
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,860
You have a full head of hair, but you're bald.

1031
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:42,180
Yeah, see the widow's peak, it's over.

1032
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,500
It's over for me.

1033
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,500
It's completely over.

1034
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,500
I guess no one's ever gotten like hair plugs?

1035
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,500
No.

1036
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:55,060
I know somebody who might get them.

1037
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:56,060
You?

1038
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,700
He keeps talking about it.

1039
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,700
No, not me.

1040
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:06,140
I don't think, I think, uh, I, the thing is if you get the hair plugs you have to do stuff

1041
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,880
for the rest of your life.

1042
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:08,880
And I hate that.

1043
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,860
Isn't that just for like six months?

1044
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,860
And then...

1045
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:12,860
No.

1046
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:13,860
No no no no no.

1047
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,340
an oxidil for the rest of your life,

1048
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:16,620
if you wanna keep them.

1049
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:18,020
- And right. - The hair.

1050
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,420
- The hairs. - Okay.

1051
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:20,460
The hairs.

1052
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:23,940
- Yeah, what I'm really hoping is that AI technology.

1053
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:28,260
- It's gonna put hair on every single picture

1054
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:29,980
that's taken of you?

1055
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:32,940
(laughing)

1056
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:34,700
- I mean, you know, we will get to the point

1057
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,560
where you have a, it's funny if that is like

1058
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:39,340
just a problem we can never solve.

1059
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:41,860
- Like hair loss?

1060
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:48,740
Like we cure every kind of cancer, there's no poverty in the world, but if you're bald,

1061
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,460
that's just how it works, man.

1062
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,460
Sorry.

1063
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:52,460
You know what it is, it's big pharma.

1064
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,940
I have been thinking about that, which is like, probably as much scientific research

1065
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:01,940
goes into curing cancer as does not being bald.

1066
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:08,060
No, I actually think it's severely underfunded, because that's a pretty hard thing.

1067
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:11,140
You know, the only people who give money...

1068
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,060
People with cancer fucking die.

1069
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:15,940
People with no hair live.

1070
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:17,460
And they're suffering every day.

1071
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:20,620
I can't argue with that.

1072
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,300
I can't argue with that.

1073
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,300
You're right.

1074
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:28,240
There has to be more money going into baldness because those people are alive.

1075
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,220
The fatality rate for baldness, it's not zero.

1076
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:36,020
It's not zero, but it's not as high as cancer.

1077
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,260
I'll say that.

1078
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:41,900
How many rich people have cancer?

1079
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:45,260
How many rich people are bald?

1080
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:46,980
On purpose, almost zero.

1081
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,940
Basically what I've learned using YouTube is that basically every Hollywood leading man

1082
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:54,820
has had hair surgery.

1083
00:49:54,820 --> 00:50:00,180
The most successful ones, Joel McHale had a really good one.

1084
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:03,820
McHale's hair surgery, his hair comeback is great.

1085
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:06,980
Matthew McConaughey is a legendary hair comeback.

1086
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:08,220
Yeah

1087
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,660
This is breaking my heart. You're ruining the Hollywood magic for me right now. Look up Matthew McConaughey bald

1088
00:50:13,660 --> 00:50:16,420
There's he had a fucked up

1089
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:22,900
hairline, well, you knew you know who are like really good like images like before and after for like

1090
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:26,020
Like Harold and come back so like soccer players

1091
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:31,240
Because they could like taking pictures of them like every single day like you've been doing shaved his hair. He looks fine

1092
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:34,180
No, he had there's there's a couple photos

1093
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:38,220
He did shave his head, but that's Regenix

1094
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:42,420
Yeah, he was on his way out, what would you

1095
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:49,460
Yeah, that's like a point I think that's like really popular like the football world and

1096
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:53,860
You know since they get like take take taking the pictures like every like every single day

1097
00:50:53,860 --> 00:50:54,560
Yeah

1098
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:59,740
you can see like people who are like like they're just like all the way back here and then then they're like the next year

1099
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,740
They look like the hairline is completely back

1100
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:08,900
Yeah, dude, the only and here's here's a proof that no matter how much money LeBron James is proof that if it's bad enough

1101
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:16,440
No amount of money will ever fix it because LeBron's hairline always goes back and forth every single year

1102
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,940
Where the beginning of the year it's perfect and then but when the time the playoffs come he has to go get new plugs again

1103
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,180
Yeah

1104
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:29,640
It's it's fucking crazy. It's a plus like finite

1105
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:35,400
Yeah, it's I mean if your body doesn't want them. I mean if you're if you are already balding

1106
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:40,700
It's just gonna shoot that hair back out, right? So I think Rogan's got plugs like three times

1107
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:43,660
Okay

1108
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:48,300
Cuz you just have to keep getting them fucking installed. That's so sad, dude

1109
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:50,860
We kind of hey looks great now

1110
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:57,720
Yeah, shit with no hair, you know who looks insane that I think looks insane. It's Chris Pine

1111
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:00,820
Did he get a hair thing? I

1112
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:06,500
Think he got a face thing. He looks like the most beautiful girl. I think he's so good-looking

1113
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:12,140
He always looks like it's so pissed off his silver Fox. Can I look I?

1114
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:14,820
Don't know about the

1115
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:17,260
City is something to us

1116
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:20,940
The weekly Rex

1117
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:23,980
Guess yeah

1118
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:26,540
I was talking about this the other day.

1119
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,540
He looks, no, his face looks so crazy.

1120
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,540
He looks like he's always mad and he's doing like a kissy face.

1121
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,540
I like it because I would want to...

1122
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:35,540
You want to kiss his face?

1123
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,540
No, I don't.

1124
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,540
You know who I found out had plastic surgery?

1125
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,540
Who?

1126
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:45,540
And this is going to break your heart because she's one of the baddest bitches in the world right now.

1127
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,540
Mm-hmm.

1128
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,540
Wait, let me look up her name real quick. Hold on.

1129
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:55,600
- Wait, hold on.

1130
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:57,160
That's right guys, Brie Larson.

1131
00:52:57,160 --> 00:53:03,460
Yeah, Brie Larson used to have a fucked up nose,

1132
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:06,340
but she got something called rhinoplasty

1133
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,180
and they turned her nose into a Doritos.

1134
00:53:10,180 --> 00:53:11,020
- Okay.

1135
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,340
- Yeah.

1136
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:14,620
But she used to have a big fucked up,

1137
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:15,780
she used to have a normal nose

1138
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:20,380
and now she has some kind of odd GI Joe nose.

1139
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:22,700
- Who do you think is the baddest bitch right now?

1140
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,820
Let's talk, you know what, this is a guys podcast.

1141
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,580
I don't think we've ever gotten into the weeds on women.

1142
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:28,420
Right?

1143
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:29,240
- True.

1144
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,680
- So here's the baddest bitches.

1145
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,680
Wait, hold on, I need to look up another game.

Yeah, top 10 women.

1148
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,760
- Well, I think it's a title that gets passed down.

1149
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:40,660
- Okay, all right.

1150
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:43,840
Baddest bitches in the game right now.

1151
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,240
Number one, Mary Elizabeth Winstead.

1152
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,860

Number three.

00:53:59,820 --> 00:54:01,780
No, no, number three.

1159
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,260
That one girl who did the rap,

1160
00:54:04,260 --> 00:54:09,260
or the like sing-along version of "Look At Me Now"

1161
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:11,780
by Chris Brown.

1162
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:12,620
You remember her?

1163
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:14,460
- Yeah.

1164
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,980
- Carmen, Carmen.

1165
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:17,940
Carmen is fine.

1166
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,100
- I don't know who Carmen is.

1167
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:22,100
I'm gonna go with the

1168
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,100

Yeah.

00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:54,540
If I was a Roddy rich man, that would be my box.

1184
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,300
If I was a Roddy rich man.

1185
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,460
Harriet Tubman.

1186
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,140
OK, yes.

1187
00:55:00,140 --> 00:55:02,900
Emmeline Pankhurst.

1188
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:04,860
Who's that?

1189
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,740
I don't know. Rosa Parks.

1190
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,740
I don't know if she's bad.

1191
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,500
Rita Calo.

1192
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,060
Kamala Harris.

1193
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,220
Yeah.

1194
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,220
Actually no.

1195
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,460
Maya Angelou.

1196
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,820
Yep.

1197
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,820
Don't know who that is.

00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,820
I'm gonna go ahead and get

1199
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:32,800
the- additional resources wait-

00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:38,840
you're so silly. Yeah I will say

1201
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:40,840
did Kamala Harris back in the day

1202
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:43,840
she was pretty fun. She's right

1203
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,840

1204
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:53,840

1205
00:55:53,840 --> 00:56:14,320
that

1206
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,720
a picture and I'll see if I change my mind. Montel Williams. Montel Williams, that's who

1207
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:26,720
it was. Yeah. I think you guys are, I think you guys are severely wrong. No. No what? I

1208
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,680
think there's only one bad bitch in the game right now. I do think she's a bad bitch. And

1209
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:40,720
her name is Kate Upton. Kate Upton is so fire. I can't lie, Kate Upton is so fucking fire.

1210
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,720
Yeah, what's she now like?

1211
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,240
100 years old

1212
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:47,360
Dead

1213
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,120
Kate up to now

1214
00:56:51,120 --> 00:56:52,360
I

1215
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:53,880
Don't know

1216
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,080
Probably selling her body probably selling her body for for money

1217
00:56:58,080 --> 00:57:01,400
Yeah, he up to now

1218
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:06,000
She looks to be married to a guy who knows just leave her lander. That's right

1219
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,720
From Rick and Morty. Yeah. Yeah

1220
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:10,560
- Yeah.

1221
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,380
(laughing)

1222
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:12,220
- That's good.

1223
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:13,060
- Anyways.

1224
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,460
- We have to talk about how we need,

1225
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,620
we haven't gotten any updates on whether or not

1226
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:19,460
Justin Rolland is gonna be in the next Rick and Morty season.

1227
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:20,740
- He's not, unfortunately.

1228
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:21,780
He should be though.

1229
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,460
- You think he should be?

1230
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,020
You think they should let him back in?

1231
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,460
- He's vindicated.

1232
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:27,300
I don't see why not.

1233
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,860
- According to law, there's nothing we can say.

1234
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,380
- I think they should launch a competing project.

1235
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,620
- I can't argue with the judge.

1236
00:57:33,620 --> 00:57:35,020
Oh, okay, wait.

1237
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:35,860
What was his?

1238
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,700
- Called,

1239
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:37,540
uh,

1240
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:38,860
Make an Rorty.

1241
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:45,300
Okay, and this would maybe be about like a guy and maybe it's like a 60 second or

1242
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,420
we'll say it's a nice because it's different, right?

1243
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:52,180
We're having 16 year old sexual situations because she's well,

1244
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,260
she gets she gets stuck in something on every single planet.

1245
00:57:56,260 --> 00:57:58,860
Yeah, he's got to help her out of it.

1246
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:02,420
It'd be funny if it was a woman and she had to park the spaceship and

1247
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:05,580
she like hit something every time that'd be a good recurring gag.

1248
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,180
That's too much.

1249
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:10,380
That would be, what do you mean, how would that be a sexist?

1250
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:12,880
I don't understand.

1251
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,280
Like, guys.

1252
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,080
Ever since you put up this beanie.

1253
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,480
Yeah, what if there was a Jewish alien, Rex?

1254
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:19,880
Huh?

1255
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,780
You're gonna laugh at this?

1256
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:25,180
What if there was a fucking Jewish alien?

1257
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:27,380
And what does he do?

1258
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:28,580
What does he do?

1259
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:29,580
Does he probably...

1260
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,180
He's fucking, he's greedy.

1261
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,380
You think that's funny?

1262
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,940
- Yeah, it's a bit funny. - What if there was a Jewish elf

1263
00:58:34,940 --> 00:58:37,900
who was running the banks in the Harry Potter world?

1264
00:58:37,900 --> 00:58:40,020
- Yeah, I bet you'd think that was really, really funny

1265
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,860
if they had a bunch of Jewish elves.

1266
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:42,900
- I thought that was great representation.

1267
00:58:42,900 --> 00:58:45,820
- That's not true. - It is crazy how,

1268
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,860
I mean, it's been harped on enough,

1269
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:51,860
but a couple of those goblins

1270
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:54,260
look exactly like Alan Dershowitz.

1271
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,900
Like one to one, it's unreal.

1272
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:57,740
Like definitely they were like--

1273
00:58:57,740 --> 00:58:59,880
- Yeah, he does. - Yeah.

1274
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:02,380
- Just Googling Jewish guys.

1275
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:05,580
the guy at a Universal Studios or whatever that has to like.

1276
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:08,740
That's like modeling those, because, you know, they have them like super life

1277
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:13,480
like, yeah, and like what kind of references for those got to be bad.

1278
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:18,220
That they would have got that trumpet guy, the little Jewish guy.

1279
00:59:18,220 --> 00:59:19,620
Oh, yeah. What's his name?

1280
00:59:19,620 --> 00:59:22,820
Yeah, that is legitimately a he's a green guy.

1281
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:25,220
Escape from Green Card. Yeah.

1282
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,640
Do you guys love Harry Potter as much as I do?

1283
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:38,040
I used to. I literally watched all the Harry Potter movies at the same like only one day because I had never watched them.

1284
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:41,540
I have this concept in my head.

1285
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:46,540
I used to not make a big deal out of it. When I was growing up, I was the biggest Harry Potter fan.

1286
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:53,540
I loved it. And now and still to this day. You pop one of those movies in, I'll watch it front to back no problem.

1287
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,540
It doesn't matter which one. I love them.

1288
00:59:56,540 --> 00:59:58,540
What's the best one you think?

1289
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:03,660
The best one man. A lot of people would say it's the third one because Alfonso Caran made it

1290
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:08,360
It's the fourth one. It's gobbled of fire. It's definitely gobbled of fire

1291
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:17,740
Yes, any person who says that the third one is the best one is such a fucking herb who is like yeah

1292
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:23,780
No, it's Alfonso Carani made it eat - mama tambien. It's like dude. Shut the fuck up. Okay, the fourth one has a

1293
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:31,620
Underwater mermaid first of all and actually I'm gonna leave it at that cuz I don't want to spoil anything because it's such an amazing movie

1294
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,900
Okay, I think it's been out for

1295
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:38,580
20 years. Okay, then I'll spoil it. They're gonna make a grimdark HBO

1296
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:44,900
Harry Potter remake and here's what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna wait four years and then I'm gonna skip that fourth season

1297
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:51,620
Yep, I'm not even gonna watch the first three. I'm gonna skip to that fourth season. They should what I'm serious

1298
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,880
- They could do so good. - And by the way, guys,

1299
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,420
guess who's getting maybe cast as Dobby?

1300
01:00:57,420 --> 01:01:00,420
(laughing)

1301
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,220
- You look very pink today.

1302
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:05,340
- They should make a Harry Potter with rape and murder.

1303
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,420
- They're going to, that's what the HBO one will be.

1304
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:09,100
Dude, they're gonna show tits.

1305
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:14,100
They're gonna show Professor McGonagall's flappy grannies.

1306
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,460
They're gonna show that on like episode one.

1307
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:19,580
'Cause they have to, the HBO thing.

1308
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:20,500
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1309
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,100
- Well, that's what I'll be saying when I watch it.

1310
01:01:22,100 --> 01:01:23,180
Wait, you know what?

1311
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,420
I don't think Succession has any breasts in it.

1312
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,820
- I think.

1313
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:32,140
- But they say stuff like, they say fuck stick.

1314
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:32,980
- Yeah.

1315
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:36,460
There's plenty of HBO shows that don't have breasts.

1316
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:37,300
- I wanna say that.

1317
01:01:37,300 --> 01:01:38,980
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

1318
01:01:38,980 --> 01:01:39,820
- Maybe not.

1319
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:43,300
- I think there's like a scale

1320
01:01:43,300 --> 01:01:46,060
and it's like you can either put money on tits

1321
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:49,100
or you could put money on like language

1322
01:01:49,100 --> 01:02:07,100
are

1323
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:08,740
their head should pop off.

1324
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,260
- Their shirts open up and their breasts show.

1325
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,180
- Yeah, well that's the two options they have.

1326
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:16,940
Yeah, they should do like Leisure Suit Larry,

1327
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,340
but it's Harry Potter is going around

1328
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,220
and he's doing x-ray on all the girls' clothes and stuff.

1329
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:24,100
- That's kind of what the game is like, right?

1330
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:28,180
Just like, the wand is just like a gun, pretty much.

1331
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,820
- Yeah, and that's sick.

1332
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,780
- Yeah, no, the game is, that's the thing,

1333
01:02:32,780 --> 01:02:34,820
the game, I think at the end of the game,

1334
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,740
you learn how to do the kill the avada kedavra, the killing one.

1335
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:44,700
And so, but it doesn't like prevent you from using it anywhere.

1336
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,540
So you just walk up to like the head of the entire school, just kill him.

1337
01:02:49,540 --> 01:02:53,840
Yeah. But it's not like GTA. There's no star system.

1338
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:57,020
So you just kill him and people just go, nobody does anything.

1339
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,380
People just walk right over his body. They go, Oh, what's that?

1340
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,380
- Nope.

1341
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:05,760
- Did Harry Potter just give us the sequel to Bully

1342
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,100
that we always wanted these years, but we never got?

1343
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,060
- Kind of, dude.

1344
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:09,900
I love Bully.

1345
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:11,540
I was talking to somebody today

1346
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:14,340
that that is probably my second favorite Rockstar game.

1347
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:15,340
I love that game.

1348
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:16,660
- I've never played it.

1349
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,940
- Yeah, I've never played it either.

1350
01:03:17,940 --> 01:03:21,000
- I think it's worth going back and playing it.

1351
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:23,020
- Yes, it is worth going back and playing.

1352
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:25,700
I only played it maybe five years ago.

1353
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:27,100
I never played it when it came out,

1354
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,660
'cause I thought it was gonna be too scary,

1355
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:30,360
'cause I was so scared of bullies.

1356
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:37,360
I think I'm going to get into emulation in a bad way this year.

1357
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:40,360
I don't think there's a good way to get into emulation.

1358
01:03:40,360 --> 01:03:43,360
The thing is a lot of those games don't hold up.

1359
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:51,360
With N64 it's like Starforce Gemini, is that what it's called? Something Gemini, the rare game.

1360
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:54,360
And Mario 64, that's pretty much it.

1361
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,360
I think I would still love Star Fox to this day.

1362
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:18,080
a

1363
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:19,880
And it has like the weird zombies.

1364
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:24,380
And guys, I'll admit it, when Peppy gets infected by the zombie, I cried.

1365
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:27,180
I really cried. - What? I didn't know that happened.

1366
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,380
- Okay, I'm not gonna... - Spoilers.

1367
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:32,980
- Never mind. Peppy fans, I hate to break the news to you,

1368
01:04:32,980 --> 01:04:35,680
but he gets assimilated. It's very, very sad.

1369
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:36,780
- I thought Peppy was a girl.

1370
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,780
When I was playing Star Fox 64. - What kind of girls do you hang out with?

1371
01:04:40,780 --> 01:04:43,280
- Peppy one? - Hey, there, Julio!

1372
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,180
- Oh, wait, not Peppy. Slippy. I thought Slippy was a girl.

1373
01:04:46,180 --> 01:04:47,880
- Slippy might be a girl, it's a frog,

1374
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:50,000
it's that there's no difference.

1375
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,640
But Peppy is the old rabbit.

1376
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:54,360
- Yeah, Peppy's a guy, Falco is a guy,

1377
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:57,200
Fox is a guy, Slippy is a girl.

1378
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,440
- Slippy definitely has a girlish attitude.

1379
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,320
I don't know that I would necessarily call him a girl.

1380
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,060
Crystal, on the other hand, from Star Fox Adventures,

1381
01:05:05,060 --> 01:05:08,160
is foin.

1382
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,900
- Yeah, well she had boobs, I think.

1383
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,080
- She seriously had some boobs on her, yeah.

1384
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:14,920
Yeah, yeah, and when I was a kid.

1385
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,020
- Yeah, they also, like, they tried to discourage you

1386
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:19,680
from having sex with her in two ways,

1387
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,040
which is one, she's a fox,

1388
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:24,040
but then number two, they made her blue.

1389
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:25,980
- Right.

1390
01:05:25,980 --> 01:05:29,560
- And I still was just, I was beating it raw to Crystal.

1391
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,320
- I think you might've been a furry when you were a kid.

1392
01:05:32,320 --> 01:05:37,960
- Man, these Kamala Harris pictures are just fucking insane.

1393
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,240
She just looked so different.

1394
01:05:40,240 --> 01:05:43,480
- All right, Rex, tell them about your new project.

1395
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,560
Link to your new project.

1396
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:46,400
This camera, that camera, go ahead.

1397
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:47,480
- What new project?

1398
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

1399
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:49,840
- Go ahead.

1400
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:51,080
- I don't have any new projects.

1401
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:53,200
There's no new projects.

1402
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,240
- Admit it.

1403
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,400
- There's no new projects.

1404
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:57,040
- I'll admit to your new project.

1405
01:05:57,040 --> 01:05:57,880
- I don't have any new projects.

1406
01:05:57,880 --> 01:05:59,120
- Admit to your new project.

1407
01:05:59,120 --> 01:05:59,960
Okay, so what were you bragging about?

1408
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:02,280
- Rex is gonna start in the new,

1409
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:05,320
the reboot to Pranked with,

1410
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:06,960
it's gonna be Pranked with Rex.

1411
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:08,400
That's what it's gonna be called.

1412
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:09,960
- Are you thinking about Punked?

1413
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:11,880
- Fuck.

1414
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:12,720
(laughs)

1415
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:14,720
Thinking about something, really?

1416
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,720
[laughter]

1417
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,720
Yeah, we'll end it there.
