[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The gang left the town of Idiot Village to find the village idiot that lives in a cave who could save the town from its own rampant stupidity.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,200
They ran into a merchant on the way, Larry the Planeswalker,

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,740
who liked getting roasted to the point where he wanted people to touch his penis,

6
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:38,320
which was off-putting.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,400
His bodyguard, a pleasure man, approached Evil Stievel,

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,720
but Evil denied his involvement in what happened at Mount Honestoodle, confusing the pleasure man.

9
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:55,160
When they reached the cave, they met the wizard Why Me, aka the village idiot, a towerless wizard who whines about how

10
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,280
everything that happens to him is someone else's fault.

11
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,880
Why me, oh why me?

12
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:07,440
As they listen to Why Me's woes, and Why Me reveals to Dogen that the Dirt God doesn't

13
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,840
even need dirt to commune with him, the wizard told our heroes of the threat of an orc brigade

14
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,700
that collects taxes on the plains, and how idiot Volage will not be able to pay it.

15
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:24,260
The boys convinced Why Me to return to the town and declare himself the mayor, save it

16
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:28,260
by escorting the villagers to his cave and maybe make something of himself instead of

17
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,940
deflecting.

18
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,380
Our heroes escorted the townsfolk to the cave, only a quarter of whom vanished from being

19
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,700
too stupid to walk over the short journey.

20
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,620
Once they arrived at the cave, knowing that they were unable to pay, Thorax and his orc

21
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:46,140
group arrived to either make the village citizens into slaves or make them into food, whatever

22
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,140
worked.

23
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:51,460
However, Thorax took a liking to our three heroes, because of their beef with the brave

24
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,460
lions.

25
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,820
the resistance group who wishes to liberate all the terrifier kingdom from the grips of

26
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:59,020
king nardwuar and all the terrifier born.

27
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,180
patritch, dogan, and evil pitched a solution to the problem.

28
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:19,300
make a theme park called idiot land stupidville which would be the first amusement park in

29
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:27,820
the land and make the denizens of idiot village work there as walk around characters because

30
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:30,220
they will just think it's their life anyway.

31
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,780
Dude, I'm like so smart.

32
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,660
I did not remember that that was the plan.

33
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,140
That's a really good plan.

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,140
It's a good plan.

35
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,140
Yeah, that's like smart.

36
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,580
If I had tried to think of a plan for the amusement park right now, I would not have

37
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,780
come up with one as good as us three weeks ago.

38
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,260
It was all me, dude.

39
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,820
The walk around characters.

40
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:53,900
Thorax was enthralled with the idea, and our heroes set out on a journey to the city of

41
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:59,900
Gal Gadot, the orc capital of the Terrifier Kingdom, and the cruellest place in the land,

42
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,020
all with the intent of pitching this idea to investors in the city.

43
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:08,400
With Thorax and their group, however, the passage was remarkably easy, but what comes

44
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,900
next will be much harder.

45
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,380
So you're all standing in the barracks of the arena, where you see nervous young entrepreneurs

46
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:24,180
just like yourselves milling about and pacing around practicing their pitches

47
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,180
on dummies and trying out different weapons on those same dummies the arena

48
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:42,660
is called the get some dome and it is the largest combat / business arena in all

49
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:47,460
the land. Like much of Gal Gadot, it is made of the skeletal remains of Kaiju who

50
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:52,340
came before. The bone of this beast was so tough, Cameron's

51
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,860
sorry-facing, that not much could be done to change its shape, even with the most

52
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,500
powerful magics. And so you are more or less in a pelvis with some stone

53
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:09,060
interspersed to make it a bit more arena-like. - Godzilla. - Thorax and

54
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,260
fuck you who's now why me is now called

55
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,300
fuck you who's you guys sort of told me

56
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,060
should call him so yeah I remember that

57
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,660
yeah yeah yeah are having a tense

58
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,500
conversation about ROI and different BC's

59
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,100
are catering as well the concerns about

60
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,940
the current supply chain of the fabrics

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,540
and vendors who won't return with the

62
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,940
signed SOW because as always everything

63
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,700
gets stuck in legal right so you three

64
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,060
though you're the pitchman you're the

65
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,060
idea guys okay you stand to make a tidy

66
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,060
Not ideas guys, but idea guys.

67
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,060
I said idea guys.

68
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,060
You guys stand to make a tidy profit from this if all goes well.

69
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,060
A consistent revenue stream.

70
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,060
And with one of the Ork 5 by your side in this Ork tank.

71
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,060
They're going to open some doors for you guys.

72
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Okay?

73
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:00,060
So, before we get into it, we're going to do a level up.

74
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,860
And then we're gonna do five minutes of real-time discussion about your pitch

75
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,800
Okay, okay, so first though. We're gonna level up. Okay. Keep the tension keep the tension up

76
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,300
So you guys are leveling up your level three very exciting for some classes less exciting for other classes nothing for me

77
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:24,440
Yes clerics clerics get a lot of their exciting stuff early on yeah, you can definitely go go to the bathroom

78
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,440
You can jerk off you everyone

79
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,960
So but it's true. Oh, yeah, we're all we're doing this in person

80
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,760
This is presumably if all goes according to plan and nobody dies here in this wonderful city

81
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,820
We'll be trying to do this in person for the foreseeable future. It's a better time

82
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,880
Yeah, so I've decided to move

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,780
So um but you two paladins and thieves

84
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,320
Rogues rather you guys have level three is pretty big for you guys. You're kind of oh, yeah classes here. It's pretty big

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:11,000
Patrick you are picking your your roguish archetype mm-hmm, so you have a number of things to choose from inquisitive

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,540
You pick inquisitive, so that's interesting because we were talking about this leading up to this

87
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,480
You were saying you're gonna pick just the vanilla sort of thief

88
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,360
uh... i've got what's right through inquisitive and it is me

89
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,260
reader

90
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:26,580
here for deceit which is a when you choose is our good site

91
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:30,540
you develop a talent for picking out lies and i'm sick of being betrayed in my

92
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,240
life

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,040
okay

94
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,700
uh... that's a good move then

95
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,920
and uh... i for detail

96
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:41,560
uh... starting at level three you can use a bonus action to make a wisdom check to

97
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,940
spot a hidden creature objects to make an intelligence check

98
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,820
to uncover or decipher clues

99
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,340
which is probably gonna

100
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,940
be pretty good for the foreseeable future. Insightful fighting

101
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,540
uh...

102
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:57,820
Ooh, this one's cool. I do know this one. Go, go, go. You gain the ability to decipher

103
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,500
an opponent's tactics and develop a counter to them.

104
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,460
As a bonus action you can make a wisdom check against a creature

105
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:09,180
you can see that isn't incapacitated, contested by the target's charisma check

106
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:13,100
which I mean my charisma is like the highest stat. It's gonna be your wisdom

107
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,100
in their charisma.

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,900
Oh, okay.

109
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,800
But it's still very good.

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,100
Keep going.

111
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:16,400
Okay.

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,200
Yeah, it's very good though.

113
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,200
If you succeed you can use your sneak attack against that

114
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,900
target if you don't have advantage on the attack roll, but

115
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,900
not if you have disadvantage on it.

116
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,400
This benefit lasts for a minute or until you successfully

117
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,800
use this feature against a different target.

118
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,700
Yeah, it's basically like you can you have the potential

119
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,200
of like getting additional sneak attack options.

120
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,900
So yeah, I mean if I were if I were trying to optimize your

121
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,800
build I'd say next level pick something that can boost your

122
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:47,560
wisdom because a sneak attack is rogues best friend their big DPS because of

123
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,800
that I'm interested in I want to do a little a little a little like a

124
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,640
character thing I don't know like because like different like classes have

125
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:01,960
like oh you pick this archetype and this journey for this character is such that

126
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,320
like when they pick a Bard college for example or they pick a discipline and

127
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:09,680
um that's in New York domain I want to know what was what was the I don't know

128
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,560
what the rogue is I don't know what the flavor around that is but what makes you

129
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:17,760
Patrick Jodar gravitate towards this more you said betrayal is that sort of

130
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,120
the that was the impetus for it? That was my real life. What's Patrick Jodar?

131
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,880
that's just a real-life thing but um you think this fits into his character? Do I have to say this in character?

132
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,920
uh you don't have to I would say like yes okay all right yes is this we have

133
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,760
What is it?

134
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,160
- Yeah, my uncle Trunchbull,

135
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:42,740
he was good at telling when people were lying.

136
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,740
So I just wanna do that.

137
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,560
- Amazing.

138
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,280
- Told me to say it in character, I don't know.

139
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,360
I just think it's probably easier,

140
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,500
'cause I mean, it could probably help,

141
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,280
I mean, in the Shark Tank segment,

142
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,080
I can tell when somebody's lying.

143
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,920
- Right. - Yes.

144
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,000
- I can detect a lie. - That's a huge part

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,840
of Shark Tank.

146
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,100
(laughter)

147
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,940
- They lie constantly.

148
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,500
- I hate when they say,

149
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,680
when they say, "Okay, I'm making you an offer

150
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,060
"$75,000 for 20%," and I find out that all along

151
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,220
they were only gonna give me $75 for 100%.

152
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,060
- Yeah.

153
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,620
- Or they just say, "I don't have any money."

154
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:21,300
- And if only I had been inquisitive,

155
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,620
then I would have been able to tell.

156
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,540
- I think this is great.

157
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,500
I think this is like Patrick Jodar,

158
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,940
but it's a little bit more on the crafty side,

159
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,380
'cause you're a big shoplifter.

160
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,220
- Yeah.

161
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,180
- But in this case, you're sort of a,

162
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,820
what if the shoplifter thought a little bit bigger picture?

163
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,820
I like this. What if you can make people shoplift for you?

164
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,120
What if you stole the whole shop?

165
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,820
Yeah, right. Right from under them. I like this.

166
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,320
Um, that's good.

167
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,820
So do I just hit next?

168
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,820

Yeah, you should do that. What do I do? Pick whatever you want man. Pick whatever is good for your character. Skill?

00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,520
Hello, I'm communing with dog in the dirt God

213
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:38,860
What's up, I knew I fucking knew it this isn't dirt this is crushed up Oreos

214
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:43,140
Shit, I thought I never had to put dirt in my mouth the whole fucking time

215
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,860
Yeah, you were making me fucking eat dirt for no fucking reason

216
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,880
I like dirt, but I don't like fucking eating it. It makes me sick

217
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:56,840
It was just kind of throw up like every fucking night. Okay, my shit. It's like soft and hard at the same time

00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,040
It's like wet sand

219
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,720
It's like moon sand like moon's in

220
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:11,680
I just found out that we live in a medieval world. There's no such thing as urinals. So people just piss in the dirt

221
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,880
Yeah, well, you know it was okay. I'm sorry

222
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,400
I'm sorry. I'll admit I make my you know disciples eat dirt cuz it's kind of funny

223
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:29,120
You know what? I don't even want to hear it. No Dogen from now on. I'm Dogen the Oreos

224
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,240
He's just yeah gone. I'm an oathbreaker. I broke my palate and oath so now I turned evil

225
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,520
Are you doing the sweet goblin or dogan the Oreo Oreos?

226
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:55,320
So we'll also need pitch Oreos

227
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,960
Because yeah, there are now a thing called Oreos. I'll figure that out later

228
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:04,120
Well, I invented them you did. Oh, that's the part of the

229
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:07,960
So Oreo

230
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,960
Oreos.

231
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,960
Fuck my ass.

232
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Hey Cameron, tell me about Oreos.

233
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:17,240
Cam, I don't know what you know about the Oathbreaker.

234
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,240
I can obviously chime in there.

235
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,640
Yeah, well what I saw that I'm very excited about is that I gained the ability to control

236
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,640
undead.

237
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
That is correct.

238
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,640
You guys are going to have a lot of synergy.

239
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,640
Really?

240
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,640
Yeah, so I can control it.

241
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,920
You have that as well in the death domain, so there's sort of a lot of overlap of just

242
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,280
darkness between you two.

243
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,000
You have more magical abilities over that, okay?

244
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Ha ha.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Okay.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,560
Yeah, I also, I basically just start turn, I also, I get Hellish Rebuke and Inflict Wounds

247
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,360
and Dreadful Aspect.

248
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Yes.

249
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Hellish Rebuke's really cool.

250
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Basically if somebody hits you, you can, as a reaction, do I think 2d10 fire damage to

251
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,600
them?

252
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,320
I mean, you know, you have the roll and stuff, but it's pretty cool.

253
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,440
It's basically you become a really petty, dark person.

254
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,560
pretty badass and usually it's to pursue some dark ambition according to the

255
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:15,280
flavor text your dark ambition is basically is I guess sweets Oreos in

256
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,080
particular. If you see candy you can't. Yeah I can't control myself. Yeah the coolest part is that

257
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,920
you're a fang. Your 20th level is called like the dread Lord is like what you

258
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,520
know if you like don't multi-class you go all the way to 20th level for

259
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:34,480
Oathbreaker you become a dread Lord. That's sick. Which is tight. I'm gonna do

260
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:41,480
that. Yeah, it's a pretty big deal. Dogen is now gone, at least for the moment. Yeah, and

261
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:50,160
then you, Evil Stevel, I think you probably just got a few more spells right now. You

262
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,800
get more stuff later on, like you kind of have more of an eventful level 4 like everybody

263
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,800
else does, but you're kind of on the steady path where you're just getting more shit for

264
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,960
for your butt. - I get it, man.

265
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,520
You don't have to, I get it, I suck.

266
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,360
- I know, that's not what I'm saying.

267
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,440
- This is like in middle school

268
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,600
when all the girls get taller than you.

269
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,560
- Well, it is like that,

270
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,400
but that's neither here nor there.

271
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,720
- That never happened to me.

272
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,760
- Oh, shut up.

273
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,240
- Shut up, dude. - Shut up, tall guy.

274
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,640
- You, you get it, you're tall like a girl.

275
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,240
(laughing)

276
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,200
Cool, so, okay, cool, that was exciting.

277
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,320
I love when my friends level up.

278
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,200
Let's get back to the notes.

279
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,040
Here and out.

280
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,840
(laughing)

281
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,680
Sorry.

282
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,000
You guys are a little, yeah.

283
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,560
You guys are so much more powerful than me now.

284
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,760
You're all level three, so you're all--

285
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,100
You're just at a different stage in life.

286
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,520
I look at you guys, I'm like,

287
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,960
hey, you guys still like playing, right?

288
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,400
You still wanna play?

289
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,920
Yeah, I'm actually playing math right now.

290
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,440
Yeah, we're more interested in business.

291
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,560
You know, we're about to go on Orc Tank, so.

292
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,000
Not really a lot of time for playing.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,840
That's all right, yeah.

294
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,680
- Yeah.

295
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
- You have it like you're playing to get money.

296
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,200
- Okay, yeah, I mean, I didn't, you know,

297
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,280
I don't really like playing anymore either, so that's fine.

298
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,200
I'm like, I don't like playing pretend anymore,

299
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,760
so like we're all at the same level now.

300
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,560
- Yeah, it's not pretend.

301
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
- Okay, yeah, no, I'm getting it, all right.

302
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,480
- Yeah, it's real, it's for real.

303
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,720
- Hey, Patrick, do you wanna go to the cinema later?

304
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,320
- Yeah, I'd love to go to the cinema.

305
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
After that, we can go to a bistro.

306
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,240
- Oh my God, that would be divine.

307
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,280
Hey, do you guys want, after all that shit,

308
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,600
do you wanna go to like the arcade or something?

309
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,880
Maybe play perhaps the casino.

310
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
Yeah the casino or the barcade.

311
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,440
I'll go to the arcade with you, Evil, if you want to go to the arcade.

312
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Yeah, you can hang out with Sullivan here.

313
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,040
Sullivan, seriously? He's like 8 years old.

00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,240
You can hang out with him. He likes the arcade.

00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,440
thralling performance once before it rest you could use one creature that

335
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,200
watched and listens you perform for one minute. Each target makes a wisdom saving

336
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,920
throw and is charmed if it fails for one hour. So basically you can do some little

337
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:47,320
silly dance and then people will be charmed for one hour if they fail.

338
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:53,200
Didn't he already have that ability? Uh, no. Oh wait, was that Gun City? Yeah, no it was somebody else.

00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,840
It was Colin. Colin the pig had that. Colin the pig had that. Yeah he started, he has echoes of

340
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,080

464
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:40,500
should have done is incorporated both of their ideas don't worry we don't worry

465
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:45,780
we the dancing the dancing sponge the dancing sponge is a backup idea if they

466
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,780
don't go for the amusement park. We can be like, we can say...

467
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,780
I'm saying the dancing sponge will be the mascot in the amusement park.

468
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,780
I mean, a dancing... I was about to say, a dancing sponge could be a mascot.

469
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,780
No, the mascot... the mascot is clearly...

470
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,780
The dancing sponge should be the mascot. It's the best idea that we have.

471
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,780
What do you mean the mas... we got all these stupid people. They own mascots.

472
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,780
They're walk-around characters.

473
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Wait, hold on. I think there's a... there's a timer in my brain that might start going down if we talk about this.

474
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
What are you talking about?

475
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,780

479
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,180

480
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,180

481
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,180

00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,980
[laughter]

499
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,980
Uh, we are gonna be in an arena.

500
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,980
You guys know that, right? - Yeah, but it's gonna be empty.

501
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
- It's gonna be no one else's arena, right? - No one else, no one, yeah.

502
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,980
- I mean, we all get stage fright, you know, like, you know how it is.

503
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,980
[laughter]

504
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,560
horrible stage. My teeth are gonna chatter if there's any. I kind of pee

505
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,340
myself sometimes. The entire way here you guys kept bragging about your stage

506
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,280
presence. What is what is happening? Well part of it's like a thing where we turn

507
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:28,000
the stage right into a stage presence. It's kind of like a subversive like

508
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:33,800
like. So the presence is that you're pissing yourself. If I'm on the stage I'm present.

509
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Talk to them, Thorax.

510
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,600
Look guys, we can do this, okay?

511
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,280
We have built-in imbeciles who can work the park, okay?

512
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:47,160
We have a solid labor force right out the gate, okay?

513
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:49,040
It's a no-brainer, it's a layup.

514
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,400
Relax, loosen up, okay?

515
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,600
- No-brainer can be one of the names of the restaurants.

516
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,440
- Amen.

517
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,680
(laughing)

518
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,440
Shit, that's really good.

519
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,560
- That's a really good point, yeah.

520
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:09,280
Okay, that's what I'm talking about man. That's that's off the dome - brother. Okay, you just show up in there

521
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
I wrote that down a mile ago

522
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:25,560
If only someone would offer us five minutes of time to discuss it

523
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:30,800
You're after you have to you have to date. I want okay. We're gonna take it

524
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,320
Okay, okay, you can obviously just roll it in there. It's fine. Okay ready

525
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,720
Says give me the three of you in character and solve it. Yes, ready wait

526
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,320
What what is the do are they gonna call us in in five minutes?

527
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:47,940
Is that the pressing time does a stage hand come over and say five minutes till you walk out?

528
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,400
Yeah, I think that's sort of the fiction here, right? I basically was I wasn't I'm sorry

529
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,920
I should have actually yeah, that would have been a bit bit of better more immersive do it do it now

530
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,920
You can cut it out. Okay, okay, okay

531
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,640
Come with the stagehand character

532
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,040
How the third time sir?

533
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:11,400
Whoa five minutes you guys gonna go out bitch. Okay. Where is your neck? I?

534
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,240
Lost it in a bet, okay

535
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,960
Campbell brother, please just you're eating into our time and you're doing our partying so oh

536
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,880
Bitch don't get me hurt

537
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,280
How about this minutes and 45 seconds?

538
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,120
- Okay, bye.

539
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,400
- Fuck you, man.

540
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:33,360
- Okay, all right, all right, let's go.

541
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,840
We're gonna ask for 100 trillion gold coins

542
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:40,320
for 1% of the business.

543
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,400
- Because you gotta set the bar high.

544
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,860
- Exactly, because if we ask for a small amount,

545
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,640
they're gonna think it's a worthless business.

546
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,640
- I just think we gotta try to provide

547
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:52,480
some sort of proof of concept or of sales or something.

548
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,120
Maybe some sort of like pitch maneuver.

549
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,360
- We just lie.

550
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
- Maybe we draw a picture.

551
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,320
Maybe we walk, maybe we send in the idiots first.

552
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,160
Maybe we-- - I'm the only one here

553
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,060
who owns the business. - Will you be quiet?

554
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,320
Maybe we send in the idiots first,

555
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,960
and then the orcs are like, "What the hell?

556
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,520
"What, these guys are doing a horrible job pitching."

557
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,300
Then we come out and say, "Wasn't that so funny?

558
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,720
"Imagine if they were walking around selling you hot dogs."

559
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,400
- That is an amazing idea.

560
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,240
- Okay, I'm not opposed to that.

561
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,960
- Also, they're dressed like the Rockettes.

562
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,840
(laughing)

563
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,920
- What are the Rockettes?

564
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,160
The women that dress up like different types of rocks?

565
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,440
- Yes. (laughing)

566
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,440
In this world, yeah, that's what they is.

567
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,440
Okay, and then...

568
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,440
A gal could show a staple!

569
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,440
We could just take turns just throwing out statistics for them about our sales and our margins and you know, it doesn't...

570
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
Ah, pretty much 100% and stuff like that.

571
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Yeah, pretty much, that part does not matter. At all.

572
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:53,440
No, I think, the thing is, if we say 1% for 100 trillion, I think we'll be in a good spot because even if they say, "Okay, we want 2% for 50 trillion," we say...

573
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
That's at least 100!

574
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,360
And in their brain, they're like, "Well, we got 'em.

575
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,200
"We got 'em on the road."

576
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,680
- I got an idea.

577
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,220
Okay, so it's gonna be 100% sales.

578
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:05,800
Maybe we should divvy that up into two 50,

579
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:10,320
50% and another 50% of,

580
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,520
guys, I'm freaking the fuck out.

581
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,520
I have no idea.

582
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,160
- Okay, listen, and here's the thing, right?

583
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,320
They say no to 1%.

584
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:18,080
We say, "Okay, how about $100 trillion

585
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,360
"for 100% of the business?"

586
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,200
Then, then we don't have to run the business

587
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,240
and we can just leave.

588
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,600
No, but we don't own any of it so we're not getting any profit from it.

589
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,300
But we just got a hundred trillion gold coins you stupid frog!

590
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,900
Let's go into the business, it's not gonna go to me and you.

591
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,900
Okay, what if we say-

592
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:36,400
Wait, what?

593
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,400
Yeah!

594
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,400
What do you mean?

595
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,400
We- we- it's our idea.

596
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,960
Okay, 99%, 100 trillion.

597
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,940
We start with 100 trillion for 1%, then we go to 100 trillion for 99% if there's no

598
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,940
bucks.

599
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,940
Okay, yeah, that's actually pretty good.

600
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,940
That's a lot of money in that case.

601
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
That's not a bad idea.

602
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,600
We can cash that out and just vibe.

603
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,760
we can make Sullivan go in a spinning teacup on stage.

604
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,320
- Why do you want me to do that?

605
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,480
- I think we figured it out.

606
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,320
- Okay.

607
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,760
- Your honor, I'd like to cede the rest of our time

608
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,840
to Sullivan doing an opera song.

609
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:06,820
- Between now and the end?

610
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,480
(laughing)

611
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,320
All right.

612
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,160
- Hold on.

613
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,520
- We could just hang out for the rest of the time.

614
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,040
- Let me actually look a bit old standard, I used to say.

615
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,360
- I believe you have two minutes and 20 seconds left

616
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,680
to blow me away.

617
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,300
You know, we're about to be our shark tank. I want you to pretend you're on American Idol.

618
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,300
*singing*

619
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,300
*singing*

620
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
*singing*

621
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
*singing*

622
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
*singing*

623
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,300
*singing*

624
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,300
*singing*

625
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,300
*singing*

626
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,300
*singing*

627
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,300
*singing*

628
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
*singing*

629
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
*singing*

630
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,300
*singing*

631
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,700
Yeah, I don't really know if there's anything else to talk about.

632
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,200
Are we gonna have a pitch idea? So we're gonna have the idiots walk out, okay?

633
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,200
You're gonna put me in a teacup, I think?

634
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,700
Or whatever, we could put you on a rollercoaster.

635
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,000
Yeah, do we have a picture of a rollercoaster?

636
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Wait, why me? Get over here.

637
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,700
Can you use your magic to conjure any kind of amusement park ride?

638
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,500
Yeah, of course.

639
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:14,400
Okay, well do that. Do a really crazy one to put Sullivan in it.

640
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,900
Okay, how about...

641
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,700
What about a teacup that spins in a circle?

642
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:25,480
Well, I like that but what about a teacup that goes fucking nuts and jumps in the air and what did I just say? Yeah

643
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:32,960
Okay, that's pretty good, all right, so I'm back to the opera I think we figured out the rest of the idea

644
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,760
Hold on. Hold on. Okay, you sure?

645
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,280
to teacups

646
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,520
We could and then we could have praised. No, I'm G come out. No, we can't show him. No, no, we can't show him

647
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,520
The one teacup bounces Sullivan from one teacup to the other and he just keeps going back and forth and it's spinning very fast

648
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,200
Okay. Yeah

649
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Two idiots come out and be like check this out, but they'll be stupid about it and then that'll be funny

650
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,400
They'll do like a they'll do like a punch and Judy thing. Wait, yeah

651
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,860
Okay, but I have to play the idiot. So what is a punch?

652
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:15,000
I thought we have idiots with us you do you do you do you good?

653
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:19,600
Punching Judy was a new use of its puppets that chase each other around and hit each other

654
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:28,080
Three it was a fast five

655
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:38,720
Wait what this is you oh my god, that's the that's the orcs that or tank theme song

656
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,500
have to produce this episode and put that song in there. Okay, so yeah you guys are

657
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:55,420
ready to go. You have your insane idea, no proof of sort of revenue or sales or

658
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,520
whatever. What are you talking about? We have a million, but also they don't have to know that.

659
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:05,340
We just say 100% sales. Yeah, we just say a bunch of numbers. Alright. I'm sorry, you're right. The trick is keep

660
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:08,900
them on the offensive. They have to ask the questions, we just answer them. No

661
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:13,760
follow up nothing true so just yeses and no all right all right I think we got

662
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,400
walk out into the arena don't say anything yes walk out to the arena it is

663
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,300
a massive arena you're in the biggest city one of the biggest cities in the

664
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:28,180
terror fire kingdom Gal Gadot city of Gal Gadot massive city you're surrounded by

665
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:33,540
some of the scariest looking fucking monsters and motherfuckers ever and they

666
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,740
all want to fucking eat you guys alive you have five investors in front of you

667
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:43,100
Okay, Ola the Orc. She's one of the foremost businesswomen in the

668
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:48,820
Terrifier Kingdom. Ola the Orc was the first to learn magic, first first Orc to

669
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:54,260
learn magic in a hundred years. With her superior intellect and

670
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:58,420
moderate attention span. She used her magical abilities to make other Orcs

671
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,900
think she had their nose, starting a thriving business where people would buy

672
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,380
their back their nose from her. With revenue skyrocketing she expanded her

673
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:10,920
business by teaching other orcs to cast simple everlasting, in quotes,

674
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:15,460
everlasting flame spells. These orcs would then heat homes for a small fee.

675
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,980
They'd say they'd show up to fix their everlasting flames sometime between 8

676
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,180
a.m. and 5 p.m. and then they'd either show up at 730 a.m. or 6 p.m. and then

677
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,580
they'd leave five minutes if you weren't there for them. Eventually more orcs

678
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,940
learned magic and started their own businesses but Ola was the first one in

679
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:35,780
and Ola's Magic Service, which is the sort of the umbrella company, is the

680
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:41,660
foremost operation in the whole kingdom. It's like the like like Amazon or

681
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:45,740
fucking whatever sort of company. If you're looking for someone who knows how

682
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,340
to expand and has ties to many industries around the kingdom, Ola's your girl.

683
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:55,620
She will likely look for higher stake, grow the business in a sure but steady

684
00:37:55,620 --> 00:37:59,180
rate, and will be a terrific guide and partner for you, but slow and steady

685
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:02,380
doesn't always win the race, and she could be a bit controlling at times.

686
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,780
I'm writing all of this down on Sullivan's back.

687
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,780
Yeah, he's like, "Ahh! Ahh! Ow! Ow!"

688
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:12,080
Next, you have Venni Vitivici, the Mind Drinker.

689
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:20,680
Venni Vitivici, or Venni, is a mind drinker, a vampire that sucks the thoughts and, more importantly, the secrets out of people.

690
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:25,780
As such, he's made his money in the intelligence community by selling the secrets he siphoned.

691
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:31,180
He began his career as a boy, learning who had a crush on whom and selling that information to interested parties.

692
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:35,760
This became a lucrative business as well among adults in the vampire community who sought

693
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,940
Venny's wisdom and insights even when he was just a child.

694
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,780
As he grew older, his powers were sought by many across the land.

695
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,140
They would trek to Venny's castle north of Gal Gadot and offer him riches, lands, titles,

696
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:52,180
as well as secrets of their own for the secrets he held.

697
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,460
With his Berbalang, Winifred, Berbalangs are these sort of like disgusting little winged

698
00:38:56,460 --> 00:39:01,980
freaks, I'll show you guys a picture, who takes to the skies and

699
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:07,260
acts as a spy, so he gathers additional secrets as well as verifying the secrets

700
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:12,180
he's gotten. He's become basically one of the most entrusted and

701
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:17,500
successful venture capitalists. If you want someone who has insider knowledge

702
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:23,060
will just sort of be a capital injection but then kind of be very hands-off, which

703
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:28,860
positives or negatives, you know, open many doors for you, won't open many doors for

704
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:32,420
you, but without, you know, that kind of partnership part would need to be

705
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:43,020
earned. Third, Kevin Rudderkin, aka Mr. Awful. Kevin Rudderkin the Rudderkin is a

706
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,380
disgusting piece of shit, smelly freak, who inherited his wealth from his demon

707
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,940
lord father, Zeltaros, and has turned that into a burgeoning drug-running business.

708
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:57,440
He runs it with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, but no one wishes to anger his father, so he gets away with quite a lot of nonsense.

709
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,440
He's the biggest loser of his family, but became wildly successful thanks to the second mouth that sits in place of his left hand.

710
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,940
[laughter]

711
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,940
Lucky.

712
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:09,440
[laughter]

713
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,940
I think this is our guy.

714
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,940
[laughter]

715
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:19,440
It possesses a sinister intelligence that employs to actually run the illicit business that Kevin has.

716
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:26,940
On occasion, Kevin will go unconscious and his second mouth will handle any of the business concerns that actually need to be handled,

717
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,940
while Kevin just sort of is a bit of a blowhard.

718
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:32,940
The mouth calls itself Mr. Awful.

719
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:36,940
Some say the mouth came from a spell Kevin's father placed on him.

720
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,940
Some say it's a curse placed on him by a witch who he got too handsy with.

721
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Either way, you will have to impress both of them to get their buy-in.

722
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,340
And most importantly never ever address Kevin's mouth while Kevin is still conscious

723
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,100
He will freak the fuck out

724
00:40:52,100 --> 00:41:00,700
Here's the thing he's it's illicit right so what's good about this is very hands-off you guys want to fucking do shit

725
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:04,580
Yeah, he's got one hand. Yeah, he's gonna one hand. You know your hands are off

726
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:11,180
Basically you'll be able to get what you need you'll be able to sort of show up and say what you want to happen when you

727
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,180
want to happen

728
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,940
He'll take a pretty big cut of whatever you guys make

729
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:22,460
But you know again. It's a lot easier when it's just mob run, and you just have to sort of turn the other way

730
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,340
Don't look at it

731
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,340
mob run amusement park

732
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:29,780
But

733
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:34,420
He's gonna call you in for a favor, and if you refuse they will hunt you down like dogs

734
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:40,180
Mm-hmm, so that's sort of the trade-off. They're a lot easier to run it you get something very steady

735
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:45,620
You don't just have to look the other way when all kinds of weird shit is going on your amusement park and then

736
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:48,020
Occasional favorite you'll have to sort of call in

737
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:52,160
Next last two gelatinous Cuban

738
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:04,820
Jelatinous Cuban is a richest entity in the whole kingdom. No one knows how he makes his money

739
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:09,880
It just has a lot of it. He's never invested in anything on the show

740
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:14,880
usually just makes gurgling noises and tries to engulf the contestants by

741
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:24,160
slowly and extremely obviously sliding towards them no one has ever heard him

00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,960
And now the orcs think that the idiots are the investors.

763
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,960
And then us three, yeah, we set the bar really low

764
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,960

765
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,960
notes. And then us three walk out through the crowd. There's no information about

766
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,960

767
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,960
and I go, "Hmm. Impressed yet?"

768
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:57,960
(laughter)

769
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Little walrus goes, "Aaah!"

770
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:03,960
And you see, uh, Veni, Vidi, uh, not Veni, Vidi.

771
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
You see, uh, Kevin.

772
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:06,960
Kevin the Ritterfin.

773
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Before I go any further, I do want to show you guys what these people look like.

774
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,960
Okay.

775
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,960
'Cause I, it's very fun. Hold on, let me, uh, let me pull it up.

776
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,960
Uh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

777
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,960
Oh, which reminds me, there's one other thing I have to tell you guys.

778
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Before I even show you these, just you guys, so for everybody at home as well.

779
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:28,560
The way Orc Tank works, they're all very close to me right now in real life.

780
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:31,960
The way Orc Tank works is once somebody makes an offer,

781
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
you have to defeat them in combat.

782
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,760
What?

783
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,460
If you want to accept the offer.

784
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,960
Okay.

785
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,760
And refuse any offers.

786
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,760
Once you defeat them in combat,

787
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:46,560
you can also have an option to field other offers.

788
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,760
You can take a long rest.

789
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,360
You can take up to two long rests.

790
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:51,360
This can be a multi-day process.

791
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,960
Okay.

792
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:53,460
Alright.

793
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,460
So I wanted to let you guys know.

794
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:57,260
So not only do you get to do the pitch, once you get that,

795
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:59,260
once they make you an offer and you guys accept it,

796
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,760
or you consider it a good offer,

797
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,360
it's fight time.

798
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,060
Alright.

799
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,160
Okay, but let me show you guys what you guys look like.

800
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,060
Gelatinous cube.

801
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,060
This is what Mark,

802
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,560
I mean, gelatinous cuban looks like.

803
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,260
He just looks like a gelatinous cube.

804
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,060
What do we do?

805
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,160
Alright, walrus.

806
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,460
He looks basically how you'd expect him to look.

807
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:20,060
Yeah.

808
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,760
Sort of like a giant walrus.

809
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,460
Mm-hmm.

810
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:24,460
Um, oop, bleh.

811
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,460
Uh, our friend Ola.

812
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:26,960
Oh, okay.

813
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
The orc woman.

814
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,960
Oh my god.

815
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:30,460
Damn.

816
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,460
She's okay?

817
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,460
Yeah, she's pretty fine.

818
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:39,460
And then, uh, let's do our friends the mind drinker, Venni Vidi Vici.

819
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:43,460
Here he is. He's kind of spooky looking. Oh, wait, alright.

820
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:43,960
Okay.

821
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,960
Oh, he's scary.

822
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,960
He's a little scary looking, and then this is what a Berbalang looks like.

823
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:48,960
What's a, what's a Berbalang?

824
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,460
What the hell a Berbalang?

825
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:55,100
You're about to see it once this shit fucking loads. It's gonna be nutty as hell.

826
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:58,460
Um, refresh it. Interesting.

827
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:01,500
Refresh it. I will, I will. I'm doing it. I believe you. Hurry up.

828
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:06,780
Hold on. But I do want to show you also what, um, most important person to show you guys though, honestly,

829
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:09,740
is what a Berbalang looks like. Ooh, a Berbalang. They're pretty cool.

830
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:13,100
He's like a creepy guy with a beard and wings. Yes. For everyone.

831
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:17,820
The most important thing to show you guys though is, is, uh, Kevin.

832
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:23,100
Kevin I think is the best designed of the creatures here. Kevin looks basically like

833
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:31,860
a sort of Cronenbergian flesh monster with a disgusting mouth on his hand.

834
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:36,440
He's a Rutterkin which is a kind of fiend. They're very prideful and they

835
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:42,660
wander the abyss. Oh creepy. So that's Kevin. He got teeth where his wiener

836
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:49,580

Didn't I check your inventory?

850
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:11,140
We're so happy to be here and pitch our idea for...

851
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,140

852
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,140

Idiotland Stupidville.

857
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:26,140
A brand new amusement park staffed entirely by...

858
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,140
These guys. Weren't they funny?

859
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:33,380
funny I mean real quick let's give a round of applause for all our ideas here

860
00:49:33,380 --> 00:49:37,180
in the audience I mean did they not do an amazing job see the idiots and start

861
00:49:37,180 --> 00:49:45,940
just floating towards the sky now come back here basically we're looking for

862
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:54,980
100 trillion dollars for one percent of this beautiful business you see many

863
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:59,980
anybody of each goes, "I do say that is quite a steep offer."

864
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:03,880
Well, you'll have to explain a bit more about your business.

865
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:04,720
That's pretty shocking.

866
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,560
So basically, all right.

867
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,380
No, we don't.

868
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:09,480
What's the number one problem with owning a theme park?

869
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,540
What's the number one problem?

870
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,980
Just you explain it to me.

871
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:17,680
Well, this would be the first amusement park in the land.

872
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,620
So as people for--

873
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,440
Well, don't you wanna be on the ground floor of that?

874
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,220
It's the first amusement park in the land?

875
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:27,340
Alright, alright, and tell me, why has nobody ever built an amusement park before?

876
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:32,940
Yseola says, "Well, we just didn't even know that we were allowed to have fun until a few years ago."

877
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:39,140
Investor says, "What? Oh, you keep getting me! I like this one!"

878
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:41,140
[laughter]

879
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,140
Here's the reason. You gotta pay the employees.

880
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,140
Yeah, that does suck. I don't like that one bit.

881
00:50:49,140 --> 00:50:52,140
Here's a little idea that maybe you never thought of that I have thought of.

882
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:54,020
(laughing)

883
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,900
- What if they were slaves?

884
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:57,740
- Yeah, if you eliminate--

885
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:58,820
- You're an all-nighman tree.

886
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:01,780
- You eliminate paying of the employees,

887
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,380
we are talking incredible margins.

888
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:05,940
We're talking in the 100s, 200s, 300s.

889
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,900
- And here-- - Different percentiles.

890
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,740
- Let me ask you, you might be thinking--

891
00:51:08,740 --> 00:51:11,020
- There's so many percentages, your head's gonna explode.

892
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:12,700
- Sales, 1,000.

893
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:14,020
- You might be thinking, "Well, slaves,

894
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:14,860
"well, that's an interesting number."

895
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:16,500
- Overhead costs, one million.

896
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,500
Those are good, right?

897
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:18,700
- No, no.

898
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,780
- You might be thinking-- - Those are not good.

899
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:20,820
Those are not good.

900
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:22,820
Overhead cost is zero

901
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:27,200
Zero until he explains it

902
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:35,020
What you might be thinking yourself? Well slaves that's interesting, but then also what's what's the biggest issue with slaves?

903
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:41,300
Well from my experience they got it eating shit. Well, listen, here's the actual issue

904
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,900
the two damn smart

905
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:51,240
So what if I told you we have a hundred and fifty of the stupidest damn slaves you ever seen

906
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:57,260
And we're gonna make them fucking spin cotton candy

907
00:51:57,260 --> 00:52:04,660
Press big red. What about King Nardwaur's regulations around slavery? How are you planning on getting around that?

908
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,780
I don't listen. There's no newspapers here so I can tell you this King Nardwaur died

909
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:18,980
He's been he's dead I mean roll deception can they ease with disadvantage why?

910
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:27,020
24 hour news network we just got to get him to say yes, right?

911
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:30,900
Let me see what my deception is hold on

912
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:34,740
Charisma so probably not ideal

913
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:44,160
No, like here's our plan just know that guy's not real. Yeah

914
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:48,220
There's a that's gotta be pretty

Heard there was trouble in the kingdom, but I died of he died of laughter

920
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,780
When you saw these slaves

921
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:14,120
And what are and the guests to the park will not die

922
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,740
We tuned down how funny they are

923
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:26,760
What do you mean by turned it down we used an allen wrench on the on the hole in their back

924
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,760
And we tuned it down

925
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:33,540
Show me the hole in one of their backs. Okay. Okay. Just close your eyes for one second

926
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:40,820
Roll slide A and roll slide A and see how you do it biting a hole out of one of their bags.

927
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,820
(Laughter)

928
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,820
(Laughter)

929
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,820
(Laughter)

930
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:48,820
(Laughter)

931
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,820
(Slide sound)

932
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:52,820
Roll again, roll again, unless it's good.

933
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:54,820
What is it? It's my roll.

934
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,820
Alright, cause I'm a nice guy.

You just very, very clearly

938
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,820
took a bite out of a human's back.

939
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,820
I had to check to make sure it was still there.

940
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:07,820
He took off the lid.

941
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,820
He took the lid off of it.

942
00:54:08,820 --> 00:54:09,820
Ok, roll deception.

943
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,820

00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,820
You can roll again with advantage.

954
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:26,820
Let evil roll again with advantage if he's helping out.

955

But what what what's your what's your return on this?

965
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,900
Yeah, we're not here to sell concrete. I'm telling you

Let me tell you see if any video each you go. I don't want to hear anything about sales

967
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:03,660
I want to know what the vision is. Okay, I can invest in a vision not in sales

Hey wait guys, I think I have an idea

974
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:33,980
my picture this

975
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:39,940
Giant hold on. I got make a second picture of my head now. This isn't so much for you

976
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,740
This isn't so much for you picture this just ought to all the investors a giant cup

977
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:47,260
filled with fish

978
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:51,900
You see, okay

979
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:57,860
Do any of you have any interest in that idea?

980
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,100
(laughter)

981
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:07,300
- So, give me five seconds,

982
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:10,060
'cause I wanna look up what Walrus's intelligence is.

983
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,300
In D&D.

984
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:15,100
- Do you have stats for how much money he has?

985
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:17,240
- He has no money, I'm telling you.

986
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:19,500
(laughter)

987
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:28,540
He's a huge walrus that wandered into the arena.

988
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:37,260
I want to see if it's at least high enough maybe to like perceive any of this to some

989
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,260
extent.

990
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,420
I just want to know.

991
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,700
I'm getting a 2 on intelligence.

992
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,800
That is probably not high enough.

993
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,380
But I'm gonna bump it up.

994
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:53,260
I'm just going to keep in mind that officially he has a 2 on intelligence.

995
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:56,540
Keep in mind, a dolphin I think has 6.

996
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:58,820
So that's what we're working with.

997
00:56:58,820 --> 00:56:59,820
Okay.

998
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:02,240
Roll persuasion with that.

999
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,300
You guys, if you want to give him advantage, you can.

1000
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:05,300
I'm going to give him advantage.

1001
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:08,260
Well, you know, it's going to be limited how many times you can do that in my brain.

1002
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:09,260
Okay, go for it.

1003
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:10,260
I don't need advantage.

1004
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:13,260
Okay, I won't give him an advantage.

1005
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,260
20 with my advantage.

1006
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,260
Okay, dirty 20?

1007
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:17,260
Dirty 20.

1008
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,260
Roll again.

1009
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:21,260
No, I didn't give him an advantage. I told him I cancelled it.

1010
00:57:21,260 --> 00:57:22,260
Dirty 20, okay.

1011
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:25,260
The walrus is like...

1012
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,260
[Growling]

1013
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:27,260
[Laughter]

1014
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:29,260
He's sort of wiggling back and forth.

1015
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:31,260
And seaweed.

1016
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,260
[Growling]

1017
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:40,260
Boy, I'm detecting a lot of excitement about this business from one certain investor.

1018
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,260
I think any other investors who are thinking about making an offer might really need to go in soon.

1019
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:47,260
I think maybe everybody would like to invest in this.

1020
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,100
Okay, you don't want to get left in the dust by a fucking walrus

1021
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:57,480
He's like a little perturbed by that but then gets distracted by the gelatinous cube and he tries to eat it

1022
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:00,860
Cuban is now by the way like halfway to you guys

1023
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:03,860
So he can pivot anytime you want

1024
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:07,500
Pick up some sand off the ground

1025
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,420
Get in your chair right now.

1026
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:19,260
I'm sick of you.

1027
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:23,420
Sort of jiggles a little bit and like sort of like wanders a bit to the left and right

1028
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:25,540
and like doesn't remember where you guys are.

1029
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:29,580
You see all I go now.

1030
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:32,380
What are your what are your supply chains for this?

1031
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,980
How are you supplying all this?

1032
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:36,460
And OK, there's no overhead because they're slaves.

1033
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,980
That's fantastic.

1034
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,980
How investors says what?

1035
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:40,660
God damn it.

1036
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,260
What are your marketing efforts?

1037
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:43,660
Damn it.

1038
00:58:44,380 --> 00:58:45,660
supply chain

1039
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:48,400

1040
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:51,420

you can have some of the runners

1042
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:56,980
i think you said on others what you're talking about let me speak

1043

1047
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:12,620
you see a lot of fun fuck you going

1048
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:15,100
They're like waving his robe down, "Hey, how's it going?"

1049
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:18,380
"Hey, how about this? Make the Yankee Cannonball right now."

1050
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:20,380
"Shit, alright, fuck it."

1051
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:22,380
And then he makes it.

1052
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,380
See?

1053
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:26,380
I mean, look at that. Isn't that the most beautiful,

1054
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,380
the greatest amusement park ride of all time?

1055
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,380
And that only cost 100 million gold coins to do.

1056
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:32,380
Yeah, so basically, we'll have him.

1057
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,380
I know magic!

1058
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,380
Ola Magic Services.

1059
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,380
So then why are you asking stupid questions?

1060
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,380
Because I want to see what your stupid answers are.

1061
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,180
I wanna see what your stupid answers are, okay?

1062
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:44,500
You're getting fresh with me now.

1063
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:45,900
- Hey, who you calling stupid?

1064
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:47,180
- Nobody in particular.

1065
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,180
- Investor says what?

1066
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,620
- You see, if any of you go, look, I've seen enough, okay?

1067
00:59:52,620 --> 00:59:53,460
I think this is--

1068
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:54,280
- Wait, check this out.

1069
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:59,280
And I take my finger and I do like the, like--

1070
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,980
- Separating his finger?

1071
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:02,820
- Yeah, separating the--

1072
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:04,700
- I don't know where your thumb is going,

1073
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,260
but that's besides the point.

1074
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,100
- No, that's my finger.

1075
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:07,940
- Investor says I'm out.

1076
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,900
Investor says I'm out.

1077
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,820
I'm not going to say I'm out.

1078
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:13,100
Okay, just-- Oh, shit.

1079
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,540
(laughing)

1080
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:16,740
It finally worked.

1081
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,700
I'm going to make you a counter offer

1082
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,140
for your offer you've put out.

1083
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,100
Okay.

1084
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:21,980
Okay?

1085
01:00:21,980 --> 01:00:23,460
I like the idea.

1086
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:26,900
I think an amusement park in the location you suggested

1087
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,580
would be huge for people.

1088
01:00:28,580 --> 01:00:31,540
I think there's a lot of opportunity here.

1089
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:36,540
I'm offering you all, okay, 100,000 gold pieces

1090
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:41,520
at 20% but, but,

1091
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,460
- Thousand or trillion?

1092
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:46,120
- A hundred, a hundred thousand trillion.

1093
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:49,540
- There's no way I'm doing a trillion goat pieces.

1094
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:51,420
- Well, you can't change the money amount.

1095
01:00:51,420 --> 01:00:52,260
- Yes.

1096
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:54,540
(laughing)

1097
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:55,820
- That is true.

1098
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:56,660
- That's the rule.

1099
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,300
That's the rules only if there were,

1100
01:00:58,300 --> 01:01:00,020
if there was another version of this show

1101
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,100
that wasn't in a game,

1102
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:03,260
that would be a rule, that's a rule on that version.

1103
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:04,900
- I think in the version of that show,

1104
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,660
it's totally fine to do that.

1105
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:10,140
Now he sounds like fuck you. Okay, hold on.

1106
01:01:10,140 --> 01:01:11,120
Okay.

1107
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,720
Let me find a new voice for him. How about this? This is a good voice. Okay.

1108
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,420
Do Peter Griffin.

1109
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:21,020
Eh, so where... What about a... How do you do Peter Griffin again? Hold on.

1110
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:21,880
Eh...

1111
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,540
Lowish, lowish. Okay, how about this?

1112
01:01:24,540 --> 01:01:27,580
Lowish, how about this? A hundred thousand... Is that short of it?

1113
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,480
That's good enough. That's good enough.

1114
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:31,400
A hundred thousand gold pieces.

1115
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:32,600
At twenty percent.

1116
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,400
This is Peter Griffin.

1117
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,180
Now you're doing Stewie.

1118
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:36,180
*laughter*

1119
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:40,280
But...

1120
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,220
You're also going to get two secrets from me.

1121
01:01:44,220 --> 01:01:48,020
Two valuable secrets. I am a dealer in secrets.

1122
01:01:48,020 --> 01:01:51,300
What, you want me to be your damn boyfriend? You're gonna buy my business.

1123
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,040
Look...

1124
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:56,260
I'm open for boyfriends, but that's not the point.

1125
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:57,940
Two secrets.

1126
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:01,380
You can't change a secret about them.

1127
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,700
*laughter*

1128
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,540
Yeah, that's like the only rule.

1129
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:05,860
Three secrets.

1130
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:07,500
Four secrets.

1131
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:09,220
Five secrets.

1132
01:02:09,220 --> 01:02:10,060
Three secrets.

1133
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,240
One secret.

1134
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,420
(laughing)

1135
01:02:13,420 --> 01:02:14,940
Three secrets, three secrets.

1136
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,700
No, we already said deal, one secret's good.

1137
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,100
Okay, three secrets.

1138
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:19,440
Okay.

1139
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:21,300
Is it one or is it three?

1140
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,580
It's one plus two.

1141
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:25,580
Okay, so we'll write you down for five secrets

1142
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:28,900
and 100 trillion gold coins for 0.5%.

1143
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:31,540
Which is not what I said, no.

1144
01:02:31,540 --> 01:02:32,460
No.

1145
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:37,460
100,000 gold coins, 20% stake, 3% advisory board.

1146
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:39,380
I'm on the advisory board here.

1147
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:41,980
- But listen, you have to do all the work.

1148
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:45,060
- Absolutely not, that's not how I do things.

1149
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,220
- Come on, man.

1150
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:48,100
If you want someone to do all the work,

1151
01:02:48,100 --> 01:02:50,180
you gotta ask me, Kevin.

1152
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:53,180
I got mob guys that do basically fucking everything for you.

1153
01:02:53,180 --> 01:02:55,020
- Wait, I think we, wait guys, I think,

1154
01:02:55,020 --> 01:02:57,220
anybody got a rock?

1155
01:02:57,220 --> 01:03:00,220
- You see Kevin go limp for a second.

1156
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,060
- Oh, nevermind, I don't need it anymore.

1157
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:08,180
You see the mouth go up and goes, "Hey, yeah, so, uh, um, uh, hi, I'm Mr. Awful. I'm Kevin's,

1158
01:03:08,180 --> 01:03:15,140
uh, I'm the guy who actually does everything for Kevin. He's a little slow. Um, uh, we will do

1159
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:19,780
most of the work for you, not all of the work." Sounds good. "Uh, we're just gonna need a favor

1160
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:25,300
from you guys if you go through with it and we are-" What is the favor? "Uh, it's to be determined.

1161
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:29,060
We will also be running-" We have to know the favor. "You have to know the favor." Can the secret

1162
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:32,980
be the favorite what the favor is now we don't need i don't care i'm not

1163
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:37,620

Listen, just tell me the offer that you have for us.

1169
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,940
Yeah, who is your offer?

1170
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:11,940
Alright, you want to know my offer? I don't know what I can...

1171
01:04:11,940 --> 01:04:16,940
I don't know what Kevin's going to agree to, but I can say $200,000, okay?

1172
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:20,940
At 25%, so that's already a better sort of situation for you.

1173
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:23,940
But, again, you're going to have to do a favor for us,

1174
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:28,620
for us and we are gonna run drugs through your amusement park.

1175
01:04:28,620 --> 01:04:29,460
- That's fine with me.

1176
01:04:29,460 --> 01:04:31,980
- I'd rather you did that than not.

1177
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:33,100
- I love drugs.

1178
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:33,940
- All right.

1179
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:36,020
Okay, cool.

1180
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:36,840
So that's--

1181
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,140
- How about this?

1182
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:42,140
We throw in a song from Sullivan.

1183
01:04:42,140 --> 01:04:44,740
- You're gonna give me more stuff?

1184
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,900
(all talking at once)

1185
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:48,220
Okay, we'll knock down--

1186
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:49,900
- You're gonna give me more stuff.

1187
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:50,740
Can the frog sing?

1188
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:52,940
- It's gonna sing for you and it's gonna be beautiful.

1189
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:56,940
I already sang once, kinda sincerely, which is annoying.

1190
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:58,300
I don't know.

1191
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:02,780
It's gonna be Freedom, not Freedom 90, by George Michael.

1192
01:05:02,780 --> 01:05:05,100
Or actually Wham!, not George Michael.

1193
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,740
Well, that's sung by George Michael.

1194
01:05:06,740 --> 01:05:08,300
I don't know that song though!

1195
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:16,020
Listen, can we double it to 400,000 if we throw in a dancing sponge?

1196
01:05:16,020 --> 01:05:18,940
You hear, you're, "God damn it!"

1197
01:05:18,940 --> 01:05:21,300
From way back there.

1198
01:05:21,300 --> 01:05:22,460
What do you mean a dancing sponge?

1199
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,460
like a mascot for the amusements park.

1200
01:05:24,460 --> 01:05:26,460
Like a sponge that dances.

1201
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:32,460
It's a different invention. Actually, why don't we have our spokesperson come up and explain the idea really briefly.

1202
01:05:32,460 --> 01:05:37,460
And just explain the idea and say nothing else in any way.

1203
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:43,460
And actually it's his final wish to do this because he's going to die.

1204
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,460
Because he's going to die. And he's definitely going to die if he says anything else.

1205
01:05:47,460 --> 01:05:49,460
Do you want to run back and grab Ted?

1206
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,460
He can hear me.

1207
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:58,780
okay tip wall up you see for tat like oh my god I can't believe you did this

1208
01:05:58,780 --> 01:06:04,700
again tit and you see tit wander up it's like I'm gonna kill you man do I get a

1209
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:11,660
cut of this at least uh yeah totally yeah yes I know sarcasm I was stuck now a lot

1210
01:06:11,660 --> 01:06:19,740
that's just how I talk yet go I've seen that sketch - from get it all do that do

1211
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,740
Do your thing. Talk about the sponge that dances.

1212
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:23,740
Say the sponge thing or...

1213
01:06:23,740 --> 01:06:25,740
Okay, so, imagine this.

1214
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,740
Okay? You have sponges.

1215
01:06:27,740 --> 01:06:30,740
These are a new thing for us here in Gal Gadot.

1216
01:06:30,740 --> 01:06:32,740
Before this we weren't very clean.

1217
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,740
Now, sponges are great because they clean things and we like that now.

1218
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,740
But you know what? They're kind of fucking boring.

1219
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:42,740
What if all these sponges came enchanted with a dancing spell?

1220
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:47,740
So right before you started cleaning and you're like, "Aww, I don't want to clean. Cleaning sucks."

1221
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,700
They do a little dance. Is that what you want me to pitch?

1222
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,700
Yeah right here's your cut. Off stage. Go. Go. Go.

1223
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:54,700
I got pissed.

1224
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,700
Okay roll an attack roll.

1225
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,700
Kill him?

1226
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:00,700
I'm not sure he deserves to die.

1227
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:02,700
Miss.

1228
01:07:02,700 --> 01:07:04,700
Oh my god! What the hell?

1229
01:07:04,700 --> 01:07:06,700
We will be doing more performances like that.

1230
01:07:06,700 --> 01:07:08,700
We will be putting on shows like that.

1231
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,700
Yeah it's gonna lighten up the show.

1232
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:12,700
Yeah he's gonna swallow a sword.

1233
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,700
I will not be doing that.

1234
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:17,540
Offstage go.

1235
01:07:17,540 --> 01:07:23,940
Okay, he walks offstage. And you see a Ola go, "What was...?"

1236
01:07:23,940 --> 01:07:26,420
That's our second idea.

1237
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:28,940
So what was that? What was that exactly?

1238
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:31,700
It's our other idea.

1239
01:07:31,700 --> 01:07:33,140
What did you just say?

1240
01:07:33,140 --> 01:07:37,620
I will make you an offer as well. Because of how the DM

1241
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:50,540
structured this 300,000 gold pieces I get 40% okay plus I get 5% on the

1242
01:07:50,540 --> 01:08:00,180
advisory board and you're gonna be a part of the Ola magic services family so

1243
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,180
you get a lot of benefits from that you will have to give up relinquish

1244
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:07,340
additional control at least in terms of which vendors you use you're gonna have

1245
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,200
to start with internal companies first,

1246
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:13,260
and then before you move into external ones, okay?

1247
01:08:13,260 --> 01:08:14,340
For any of your needs.

1248
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:16,260
So I don't know what existing relationships you have now,

1249
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,060
but you'll have to sort of renegotiate those.

1250
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,340
- I don't care about this at all.

1251
01:08:19,340 --> 01:08:21,500
- Yeah, does that mean we're just gonna make like less money?

1252
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:22,700
- Let's just go with Mr. Awful.

1253
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,860
- Well, but listen, all right,

1254
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:26,820
we have heard your three offers, okay?

1255
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,100
Gelatinous Cube seems a little...

1256
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:32,220
- He is touching Patrick Giodar right now.

1257
01:08:32,220 --> 01:08:33,700
- I'm not sure we're interested,

1258
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:39,300
Before we officially deliberate, I would like to hear...

1259
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:40,300
AHHHHH!

1260
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:42,300
Now that's what I'm talking about.

1261
01:08:42,300 --> 01:08:43,300
AHHHHH!

1262
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,300
AHHHHH!

1263
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,300
FISH!

1264
01:08:45,300 --> 01:08:46,300
What?

1265
01:08:46,300 --> 01:08:47,300
Brilliant.

1266
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:52,300
Oh my god, I've never heard him say anything.

1267
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,300
Listen, alright.

1268
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,820
You must really love this idea.

1269
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,700
So listen, how about two fish?

1270
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,700
AHHHH!

1271
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,700
Oh!

1272
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,700
The piece of his head is like gonna explode.

1273
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:05,700
Guys, I think...

1274
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,700
Hold on, hold on.

1275
01:09:07,700 --> 01:09:08,700
What about a red fish?

1276
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,700
You see Thorax in the back like, "Stop!"

1277
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,700
Like, "Guys, let's not do this!"

1278
01:09:13,700 --> 01:09:15,700
Guys, I think...

1279
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:16,700
I think we...

1280
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:19,700
I mean, what's entrepreneurship about?

1281
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:20,700
It's about going with your gut.

1282
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,700
That's right.

1283
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:22,700
What's my gut telling me?

1284
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:23,700
Fish.

1285
01:09:23,700 --> 01:09:26,700
This walrus is gonna take care of us, dude.

1286
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:29,700
Yeah

1287
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:39,000
Okay, I don't know so before you move forward the gelatinous cube hasn't offered anything obviously and never will in case you're curious but

1288
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:44,400
If you decide to go with the walrus

1289
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:49,620
You can fight the walrus if you win against the fight you can still feel the other offers

1290
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:53,140
If you lose against the fight you don't get the walrus

1291
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:57,700
Can't feel the other you can still feel the other offers, but they might be a little ticked off

1292
01:09:57,700 --> 01:10:05,560
Obviously you can go with the walrus. I guess he's offering offering to fish or you're offering him to fish

1293
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:07,960
There's no real we can work out the details

1294
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:14,560
It's a legit fight though, but I want to let you know okay, so before we make our decision

1295
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:19,620
I guess we have to we should probably deliberate so I feel like maybe we should leave this stage

1296
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:23,060
and maybe leave you guys to hang out with the all the idiots and to see how funny

1297
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:28,660
they are and we can go talk for maybe 10 20 yeah hey watch this I just like take

1298
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:35,040
out of like my rations at my inventory I pick out like a chicken bone or

1299
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:44,500
something I'm like hey this is $100 and I just throw it into the crowd yeah they

1300
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:49,780
all just like start bumping into each other like... Now imagine that in a cage

1301
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:54,540
wouldn't that be nice to see? All the investors nodding like thoughtfully

1302
01:10:54,540 --> 01:11:00,260
about it and you guys wander off to discuss internally. Yeah what are you

I thought you guys were taking five.

1320
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:22,220
You have five farts in your mouth.

1321
01:12:22,220 --> 01:12:24,220
That's all of it.

1322
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:26,220
They're taking five, you keep talking.

01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:28,220
Okay, well, uh, so
