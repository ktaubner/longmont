2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,640
Exterior, Gun City High School Day.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,200
The camera comes through the clouds and glides over the prestigious Gun City High School

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,280
sponsored by Stakehams Federation of Bodies and Spaces.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,240
The last public school on planet E-Bomb.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,480
We get a full view of the industrial courtyard where students ride their hoverboards,

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,600
bum cigs off of the assistant teacher on suicide watch,

8
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,000
and watch porn on their PSPs at full volume.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,400
We push into the building itself, a massive brutalist structure

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,000
that looks identical to the Shane Dawson maximum security prison on the outside.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The inside of Gun City High School is filled with muted,

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,200
but somewhat colorful, geometric steel plating that covers nearly every inch of the place,

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,400
with massive sterilized classrooms not dissimilar to hollowed out submarines,

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:55,200
all lit harshly by fluorescent lights that may or may not take an average of five years off of a student's life,

15
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,800
according to a pending lawsuit.

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,800
Every student is a number, number one that is, unless you're all the students who aren't number one.

17
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:12,800
In a lot of ways it's like any other high school. You got your straight-A nerds, your popular kids, your goths, your bullies, your theater dorks, your 35 or so Latinos whose names you don't even try to learn,

18
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:18,800
the kid with the wet mouth, a partially AI staff that hasn't threatened the smart house at school in three weeks,

19
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,300
a synthetic lunch meat made entirely of artificial gum exudates,

20
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,000
a wrist communicator that displays your class schedule as an interactable hologram,

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,600
rolly backpacks, Nestle chocolate milk fountains that only cost 10 tokens to use,

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,100
an army recruiter who follows you home every day,

23
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,500
classes on things like systemic racism, inequality, and sex work

24
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,000
taught by some of the most awesome comedians in Brooklyn,

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,700
a white vice principal, all kinds of stuff.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:46,000
Tuition for Gunn City Public High School only costs 100,000 tokens a semester,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,560
though it is subject to change moment to moment as the school continues to invest in speculative markets.

28
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,800
However, luckily for the students, if you can't afford the rapidly changing costs

29
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,960
for enrollment, you automatically go into debt, an incredible service for those who

30
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,640
aren't already in debt and are therefore at risk of being vaporized. Now, today isn't any day at

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,000
just any day at Gun City High. Today is Independence Day. As with every holiday in Gun City, whether

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,560
it's Christmas, Hanukkah, or Dark Christmas, each one is auctioned off at the start of the year,

33
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,600
including New Year's, to the highest bidder. This year, the Bill Murray Foundation of Pranks won

34
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:25,040
the auction, so the celebration is on Groundhogs Day, which in Gun City is on July 4th due to both

35
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,440
the clerical error and the total extinction of groundhogs 50 years prior. Footnote here,

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,480
after the homework riots of 2204, school was all year round in Gun City. The bell rings,

37
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,480
echoing into each student's ear through the cochlear rift implants. The younglings,

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,800
as they're called, file out of their final class for the day. Race science, the science of racing.

39
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
filled with excitement for today's mandatory after-school event, the Independence Day

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,640
Sports Ball Exhibition Match between the Gun City High Lame Frogs and the Bullet Town High Toads.

41
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,120
You could feel the energy in the air due to the leak in the school's TechnoSlam reactor.

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,240
One particular group of students are a bit more special than the rest,

43
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,880
right? With a friendship that is as strong as an ox, which are also extinct. Who are you guys?

44
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,720
My name is Blotus Piss and I'm 14 years old. I'm a freshman here at Gun City High School and I hate

45
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,640
it. I can't wait to graduate and enlist in the army as a general or a sniper or a combat medic

46
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,320
who also gets to snipe. I don't pay attention in any of my classes. None of this stuff they teach

47
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,080
us in gym class or intro to marksmanship will matter at all when I go to boot camp. I wish they

48
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,600
would teach us actually useful stuff like how to go across monkey bars above mud or how to climb

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:46,280
over a wooden wall, or how to point and laugh at the fat recruit who can't climb over the

50
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,800
wooden wall. When I'm not at my desk daydreaming about my civic duty to explode a guy's head

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:56,840
with the awesomest gun ever, you can probably find me hanging out with my three best friends,

52
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:02,220
or "Batallion," which is the army word for "best friends." They're the only reason I

53
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,000
haven't dropped out of school to become a child soldier. I almost did one time when I

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,880
I got a really good offer from a warlord, but that whole

55
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:13,240
Kony 2245 campaign really messed that up for me.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,840
I don't know what the future holds, but I know for certain

57
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,120
I'll end up in the army.

58
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,560
I don't even mind if it's a desk job just as long as I don't

59
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,480
become a detective or archaeologist.

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,720
I have no respect for those professions.

61
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,440
Yeah.

62
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,320
So it's a little blow toss.

63
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:34,760
He's pretty much the same as big blow toss, except he has a

64
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,600
a slingshot, and he's got some cool sticks,

65
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,400
instead of his patented Grinch gun and dual pipes.

66
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,240
He's got a couple of abilities that are familiar to some,

67
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,780
and you'll see them when we start playing.

68
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:52,480
- I will go next.

69
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,320
- Yeah.

70
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,920
- Oh, hey, you're the new kid, right?

71
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,480
I'm Ray, you're the one who transferred,

72
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,000
yeah, from that prep school?

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,080
Oh, what's it called?

74
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,780
Don't tell me oh, yeah, I got prescribed prep down on 4th Street. I hear it's a real bitch

75
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:17,300
You'll have an easy time here though. The teachers are total pushovers. Plus most of them will let you finger them

76
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,500
This is sexual. This is here's my damn box. Mr

77
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:27,740
Diarrhea pretty much all of them will let you go Jeff Dunham down there if you're willing to get an F in their class

78
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,980
That could just be me being awful at fingering though

79
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,940
I keep trying to make my fingers come but I'm almost starting to think it's impossible

80
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,820
so

81
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,820
Anyway, have you ever been fingered?

82
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,220
Well, it would just be nice to have someone to practice on I'm failing almost every class at this point

83
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,900
Maybe you could come over

84
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:55,960
We could put on a movie cuddle up on the couch and then pause the movie and I could start going to work on you

85
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Like you're a rotary telephone

86
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,920
*laughter*

87
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,280
If not, it's okay, but I will hate you.

88
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,280
Anyway, welcome to the school.

89
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,280
*laughter*

90
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:12,840
RayWilliamJohnson is still a demon with a computer on his body.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
Hell yeah, I am.

92
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,200
Um, yeah, he's uh, again, he's also pretty similar.

93
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,720
I removed his sexual grenades for legal reasons.

94
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,000
Um, and uh, yeah, otherwise though, I mean, you're all gonna enjoy.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,400
I actually gave him digital missiles, which I guess takes on two meanings now.

96
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,000
Digital missiles.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah, it's basically a re-skinning of magic missile, but now it's a re-skinning of fingering.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,500
Yeah.

99
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,000
So yeah, it's good to have you here. Now, Mr. Yoda.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:55,480
Oh no! Oh, what time is it? Oh, jeez, I've actually been asleep this whole time in this damn class.

101
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:03,320
Ah shit. Hi, I'm Patrick Yoda. I'm 19 years old. Yeah, I got held back twice. Who gives a shit?

102
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,640
Uh, I don't need school at all because when I'm older I'm gonna be a famous singer. Listen to my singing

103
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:16,440
I'm through standing in line the clubs. I'll never get in. It's like the bottom of the ninth and i'm never gonna win

104
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,960
Life hasn't turned out quite the way I want it to be

105
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,200
Oh god damn, I hate this fucking school so much

106
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,960
I hate my teachers and the principal the most but the janitor is my friend for real

107
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:33,740
He and I will sometimes smoke e-cigarettes in the janitor closet and he'll tell me about his life

108
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:41,780
Real life real experience fuck all this school shit. I'm going to school at hard knocks, but I'm still in this fucking school. Ah

109
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:47,000
Man, I fucking hate it pisses me off how much they lie to us here. Oh

110
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,600
I fucking

111
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,880
They fucking lie to us here while I collect real education like how to do flips and shit on my hoverboard and how the janitor eats

112
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,900
His wife's thing out. God. Damn is class over. I'm so fucking pissed at life

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:09,280
Can it be lunchtime yet? Oh god. I have to go take a massive shit in the bathroom for real, man

114
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,900
I wish something horribly wrong would happen to school like

115
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,520
Terrorist attack

116
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,520
I hate this place.

117
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,520
*laughter*

118
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
So, uh,

119
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,520
Will Patrick Yoda still has

120
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,520
uh, he still has his hoverboard, that's not

121
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
gonna change. Still has his bad attitude

122
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,520
mask, right?

123
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,520
Oh, that.

124
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,520
Instead of his hoagie, he's got a PBJ

125
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,520
with the crust on, as his

126
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
melee weapon. Um,

127
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,520
and he can still shoot lightning out

128
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
of his hands, so, um,

129
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
this is some of the cool stuff. So you mean I don't got my hoagie,

130
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,920
I got it right here in real life.

131
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,620
Patrick Yoda has his hoagie.

132
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:54,520
Now, as we all know, there are these are only three of the four

133
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,820
best friends in gun City High.

134
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Everyone knows these four because they're always together always

135
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,920
hanging out always having the best time together and their

136
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,020
fourth friend is maybe the most beloved of them all.

137
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,920
Colin tell me about yourself.

138
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,820
Good morning.

139
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:10,420
Everyone.

140
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,820
My name is Colin.

141
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:15,460
Despite being a tubby little 14-year-old piggy boy with a lisp,

142
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:17,700
I am incredibly well-adjusted.

143
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,960
My healthy self-perception was forged in the flames of my stable home life and loving parents.

144
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,500
Oh boy, do I have so much to live for!

145
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,940
When I'm not warming the hearts of the coldest bullies by wiggling my little tail adorably,

146
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:33,220
putting an apple in my mouth and laying on my stomach deliciously,

147
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,660
or hearing the poor meanies out compassionately,

148
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:39,820
my favorite activities are playing in the cyber park or at the futuristic beach,

149
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:43,980
Practicarmi Espanol and playing the Robot Style Recorder.

150
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:50,340
Above all though, I love to hang out with my best friends in the whole world.

151
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,660
Blotoss Piss, Patrick Yoda, and Ray William Johnson.

152
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,180
I love them so much!

153
00:09:56,180 --> 00:10:01,860
Yep, little Colin, the beloved little piggy.

154
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,780
Is he in student council, Colin?

155
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,780
Are you in student council?

156
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,780
Or no?

157
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,700
I am the vice president of student council.

158
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,900
Okay, yeah.

159
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
He's beloved.

160
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:14,620
He somehow captured the hearts of these three delinquents who just love hanging out with

161
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,960
him and he loves them.

162
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:20,540
And it's a beautiful friendship that will probably just go on and on and on.

163
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,500
And we'll see more of it throughout the time, their time in gun city together.

164
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:29,540
But yeah, you guys just filed out a class.

165
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,860
You're sort of in the hallway.

166
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,540
It's the last class of the day.

167
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,820
So everyone's getting ready to go to see sports ball.

168
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,820
What are you guys up to?

169
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,820
What are you guys thinking?

170
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:45,820
Oh, I fucking I can't believe they assigned us more homework for this stupid class shit

171
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:51,660
Or can help you learn more about the world around us. How about you do my homework Colin?

172
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:57,220
Okay, that sounds like a great idea because I will learn more than oh god. You're my best friend

173
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,220
So awesome do my homework - man. Come on. What kind of friend are you?

174
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,020
I'm well adjusted so I have to establish boundaries at a certain point

175
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:11,140
I think that I won't have enough time to pursue other interests in my life. I just too much ah

176
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,180
You are so cool. I hope you

177
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,940
live forever oh

178
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:23,620
Man oh you guys make the day easier

179
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:29,060
We're all fawning over Colin principal Barney walks up to you guys

180
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:37,180
Well, I hope you guys are getting ready to go to the sports ball game. It's gonna be great. I hope you eat my shit

181
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,820
Oh Patrick Yoda, you're always with the quick, you know telling me to eat poop

182
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,540
Oh, you're a principal Barney when I go to the army, they're gonna give me a license to kill

183
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:54,880
Don't finish that sentence or I'm gonna have to do something

184
00:11:56,300 --> 00:12:03,860
Well, you know as we all know a century ago gun city belonged to Transylvania a country of vampires that ruled over everyone

185
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:10,660
Similar to the movie Daybreakers have any of you kids seen Daybreakers man. Shut your bitch old ass up

186
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,860
sit on these

187
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:19,980
Well, I will not be doing that though. I thank you for offering me the finger finger me as you've offered every single

188
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,740
Faculty member so far. How about these I give the left hand

189
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:29,240
I find film fascinating, but my parents don't let me watch that much stuff, actually.

190
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Oh, Colin, you don't have to worry about anything forever.

191
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Thanks! And then Colin leans down and smells the nearest flower and smiles really big.

192
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:52,240
You go to lean down and it's a school and there's metal everywhere, but for some reason, as you lean down, a flower wills itself from the ground to meet your snout because it's so pure.

193
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:52,740
Yeah.

194
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,740
Well, I'm gonna head to the sports ball game.

195
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,440
I hope to see you all there.

196
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,040
I'm Barty!

197
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,540
And he just sort of, uh, runs off to the sports ball game.

198
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,740
God, I hate that freaking guy so much!

199
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:10,240
If he was dead, there would probably be joy to the world!

200
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Yeah.

201
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Also, like, this is the future. Why is there a dinosaur here?

202
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:21,740
I actually don't like him either, but I need to be polite to everyone.

203
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:28,620
that's true you're ah man you just know how to defuse every situation man god you're perfect

204
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:35,820
so uh yeah do you guys want to go to the sports ball game you guys ready to go yeah you want to

208
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,100
Okay.

209
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,460
Yeah.

210
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,860
Um, you see a kid go on that, that like in between each punch.

211
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:59,280
That's my, that's, uh, that's my, uh, that's not this fricking locker.

212
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,400
Won't they never gave me my combination.

213
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
They hate me here.

214
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,620
That's my, that's my locker.

215
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:05,300
Shut up.

216
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:10,480
Uh, do you, do you want something inside of it or, um, maybe actually, yeah.

217
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,660
Can you tell me my combination for my locker?

218
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,580
I don't know your combination for your locker.

219
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:15,860
Wait.

220
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,860
So why do I keep punching this one?

221
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:23,700
The combination is in the locker like on a piece of paper in there. No, I will help them get it out

222
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:32,960
Okay, and so he goes to unlock the locker which it's all it's retinal scan and then rectal scan and then he types

223
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,060
in a few buttons and

224
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:38,580
He opens it up. He's like I have some homework in here

225
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,580
Ah fuck that shit, this ain't my locker

226
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,580

227
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,580

228
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:51,580

00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,140

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,740
i'm uh... i'm gonna go to the sports ball game i'll see you guys later

237
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,540
And this kid wanders off to the sports ball game.

238
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,540
Can somebody tell me where my locker is?

239
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
I've been in this school for a year now!

240
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,540
[Laughter]

241
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,040
It's probably...

242
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,740
It's probably somewhere around there.

243
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,240
Do you want to do an investigation check?

244
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,240
See if you can find your locker?

245
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,240
With disadvantage.

246
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Oh yeah.

247
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
You've made yourself forget where it is.

248
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:34,740
Four.

249
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,240
Okay.

250
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,240
You know what? It's perfect.

251
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
[Laughter]

252
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,240
You like, smash a few lockers.

253
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,740
Like, just...

254
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:44,380
yelling in the each time you smash one

255
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,980
and it's just not working

256
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,620
you're not finding it

257
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,160

258
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,860
god this school hates me so freaking much

259
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,940
yeah yeah

260
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,580
and

261
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,180
and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and

262
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:04,100
uh...

263
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,580
it ever see you every day makes it better colin

264
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:12,320
I love you guys more than you'll ever know.

265
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
We love you too, Colin.

266
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:17,120
Yeah, so you wanna go to the sports ball game now?

267
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Let's all go!

268
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,320
Yeah, so you guys head to the sports ball game.

269
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Uh...

270
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,960
I'm wearing a giant foam finger.

271
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Can we pass my locker on the way?

272
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,200
It's got like a big sign.

273
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,920
Don't forget, Patrick, this is your locker.

274
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:37,920
Patrick's covered in like memento tattoos until we're in the circus.

275
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,420
You try to just scrub it off, "Ah, I got this fucking stain on my arm!"

276
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,920
"I hate this rash that I keep getting!"

277
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Uh, yeah, you guys head to the sports ball game, um, uh, you're at the Stakehams Arena Junior.

278
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Um, where sports ball is played. It's a game spawned from the blood of athletes, and fine-tuned through the science of competition.

279
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,720
It's brilliant, brutal, and perfect.

280
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,120
When Gun City gained its independence from their vampire overlords in Transylvania, they

281
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,420
did it through genius guerrilla warfare fully inspired by "The Ingenious Game," as Sports

282
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,840
Ball is often called.

283
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:20,000
The rules are elegant and simple, but iterative and elastic, designed to evolve play and generate

284
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,960
new ideas and strategies sometimes within a hair's breadth of the last innovation.

285
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,800
The official rules of Sports Ball are thus.

286
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:35,280
So in sports ball, some inescapable ritualistic gathering occurs where people line up to watch

287
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,720
men in tight clothes run around and play a game.

288
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
Okay.

289
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,420
You have your ball and it for some reason has seams on it.

290
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,460
And like it was so sloppily sewed together or something.

291
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,800
Or maybe it's made of pigskin.

292
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,800
Uh, weird.

293
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:49,800
Especially for Colin.

294
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
That's what the sports ball says.

295
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
Yeah.

296
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:55,120
And it's shaped like a foot.

297
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
Is that even a ball?

298
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
Okay.

299
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:02,160
Also it has these little bumps on them and sometimes it's black and white and has pentagons all over it, okay?

300
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Uh, well anyway, all these guys, and it's always only men,

301
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,440
are running around on this field that's painted, like the grass is painted,

302
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,640
and when one of them puts the sports ball in a hole or a basket or something, they all say "Ole", like in another language.

303
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,440
"Huh?"

304
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,240
And that's when they hit a home run, I guess.

305
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,360
And where you run around a bunch of pillows in the dirt and hope no one touches you, it just sort of goes on like that.

306
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,360
It's just completely insufferable.

307
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,360
It's very hard to parse what the rules are.

308
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:38,800
And so the goal, you'll start to get the sense of what it is when the announcer

309
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,820
tries to give you guys a play by play.

310
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:46,520
But yeah, it's this, there's in the stands, like in the arena,

311
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,460
everyone's forced to stand every minute by an electrical buzzer

312
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,420
because the wellness division of the Stakehams Corporation

313
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,760
We're upset about all the sitting that goes on.

314
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:00,160
You have like hot dog vendors, but they say things like get

315
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,660
your meat tubes here your meat tubes with a weird starch bond

316
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:08,460
to hold them and put packets of goop on top of it and ice-cold

317
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,060
alcoholic beverages that we serve to increase your willingness

318
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,160
to spend on our food products here.

319
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,660
And so they all just like do that all over the place.

320
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,460
But yeah, so you guys where you guys are you guys in the

321
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:26,460
and

322
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
It's for the faculty only

323
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Want to go try to find a way to sneak some of that beer whoa

324
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,780
Appropriate level of bad boy

325
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:43,980
We've been able to find common ground through a number of different ways

326
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:50,460
But he's not sexually deviant

327
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
*laughter*

328
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
*laughter*

329
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
*laughter*

330
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
*laughter*

331
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,460
*laughter*

332
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
*laughter*

333
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,460
*laughter*

334
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
*laughter*

335
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,460
*laughter*

336
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
*laughter*

337
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
*laughter*

338
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,460
*laughter*

339
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,460
*laughter*

340
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:18,460
*laughter*

341
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:38,260
a

342
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,860
like to be doing kind of like a Winnie the Pooh style thing just where it's like I'm wearing

343
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:48,020
just like a dorky like um you know polo shirt that's yellow and no pants but it's fine.

344
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,660
Yeah of course it's fine yeah you're smooth down there.

345
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:56,660
Oh yeah I've got the Jankos on I've got like a big like uh DC shoes hockey jersey

346
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,380
and a backwards Fred Durst hat.

347
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,420
Hell yeah.

348
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,140
Yes dude.

349
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:05,060
That's how I'm looking. I got Osiris D3s on too. I've got this outfit out.

350
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,860
Like 10 wallet chains.

351
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:23,860
Yeah, you're gonna have disadvantages to help you just change. So yeah, there's the obviously you guys can see that there's the, you know, alcoholic beverage vendor walking around.

352
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:32,860
And you can see him going back to where he supplies it so that might be a place you can go or you can try to nab it off of him. What are you thinking, what's the plan here.

353
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:36,260
here. I'm going to go talk to him. Yeah, let's go talk to him.

354
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,160
And then if that doesn't work, we can just take it. Yeah, let's

355
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,160
let's go. Yeah, yeah, right. You guys walk over to the alcoholic

356
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,560
beverage vendor as he's sort of passing his drinks to the

357
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,960
faculty. Hey there, buddy.

358
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,560
Hi there.

359
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,260
How you doing? I'm good.

360
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,860
I'm 50, you know how it is.

361
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,060
Can I get a beer? We're brothers.

362
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
We went to we have we live in the same house.

363
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,800
Alright Colin, you're making this really complicated.

364
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,760
It's as simple as this, I'm 50 years old.

365
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,960
Hi there, I'm their dad.

366
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,840
I've been the only kid that hasn't seen me in 50 years.

367
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,400
No, there's this 50...

368
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,240
Wait, dad?

369
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,040
Wait.

370
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,200
[laughter]

371
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,920
We're cousins too, we're cousins and brothers.

372
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,920
Dad, I haven't seen you in so long.

373
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:22,840
And that Yoda over there is our family enemy.

374
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,080
Yeah, so okay.

375
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,040
What are you talking, hey!

376
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,400
He's our, listen, shut up.

377
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,280
He's our family enemy and he hates beer.

378
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,960
So if you care at all...

379
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,360
While I'm doing that, while you're saying that, I'm like looking through the trash to find like half full beers.

380
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:47,280
So he hates beer and so basically we need to, we make our enemy very mad by you giving us some beer.

381
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,640
Yeah I would hate it if they got beer and they got me one too.

382
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,280
And he's a real asshole too.

383
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,040
Fuck you!

384
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,760
I'd stop talking and start doing a cute little piggy dance.

385
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,940
Which is my role performance.

386
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,440
Okay.

387
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,440
Oh my God, he got 21.

388
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
Okay, it's a very...

389
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
I wiggle my little spiral tail.

390
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,440
You know.

391
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,440
He's like, "That is really cute."

392
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,440
There's more where that came from

393
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
if you give us a beer.

394
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
That's right.

395
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
The one you're calling your family enemy

396
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
is the most obviously teenage boy

397
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
I've ever seen. I'm 19, bitch!

398
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Yeah, he is.

399
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,440
I can still be an enemy.

400
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Yeah, he is our enemy. He is. Now listen, that guy is 19.

401
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,120
We're all in our 50s to 100, but

402
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:37,100
Even if they weren't in their 50s, I'm their father so I could give them permission. I might also be their uncle

403
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:42,140
I don't understand what the situation is here. Boy. You're illegal drinking age is 19

404
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:47,320
I think that one sounds like he's about to cock-a-doodle-do. I'm gonna let you guys sort of

405
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:54,000
Pitter patter amongst yourselves. I got to give beer to some real adults. Very cute dance though. You think I'm fake?

406
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:05,880
a

407
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,920
good job persuading. I think we were a little bit disorganized.

408
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:14,280
Okay, you're right. Who's the best at stealing and being sneaky? It's not me.

409
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:20,760
It might be me. I'm seeing a number four in my head.

410
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:27,000
Okay. Yeah. Well, then what I'd like to do is I'd like to say a little poem on

411
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:32,520
you to do Colin's cute inspiration. Um where I say, would you kiss a fish?

412
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:37,320
Would you eat a dish? Would you make a wish? This is Colin's poem for this.

413
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:44,120
And now you can add an additional 1d6 to any check.

414
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,120
[Laughter]

415
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Fuck yeah.

416
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:56,620
Yeah, you can. So, yeah, you saw that guy. He's obviously a little wary of you all because of the insane story, family drama you told.

417
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,120
I was really interested. I wanted to hear more about this.

418
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,960
Yeah, I'd like to do a one-off about that instead of this, if that's okay.

419
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,560
Yeah, we can just sort of pivot.

420
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:10,080
Hold on, let me delete all my files on the computer.

421
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,280
No, Patches, don't!

422
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,040
No, that's a bad idea!

423
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,240
Stop!

424
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,600
Ohhhh!

425
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,720
Do it!

426
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,360
Um, and you also see Lil Gary C. Enterprise runs his own sort of lemonade stand

427
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,600
at the, uh, at the, uh, by the bleachers where you see Haseki Tsune, it leads a cheerleading

428
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,480
group. I should, I forgot to mention all the people you go to high school with. Um, yeah,

429
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:39,080
Pennsylvania gym is the star of the sports ball team. Of course. Um, uh, yeah, you have

430
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:43,720
Haseki Tsune, Gary C enterprise. Uh, you'll see Sullivan later. You all know who Sullivan

431
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,600
is. He's the senior who tries to hang out with you guys.

432
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,960
All these people at this, at this sports ball game, I feel like either we're going to meet

433
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:59,200
them again when we grow up or our parents already did based on what the timelines

434
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,280
that we're not sure we're in at the moment. One thing I'm for certain of is

435
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:10,280
that Colin will interact with all of them in the far future. Yes, I'm excited to make

436
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:17,960
friends with everyone in the world! You will, Colin. I believe in you. I want to ride a hot

437
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,640
air balloon. I want to travel to Spain. I want to go to grad school and discover a cure for something.

438
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:33,160
And you will, Colin. Absolutely. You will, Colin. I want to be an astronaut. God, he's so beautiful.

439
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,660
He's so gorgeous.

440
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
His light shines so bright!

441
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:38,360
Thank you guys.

442
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,360
And then, uh, thanks.

443
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:39,860
You guys are-

444
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,360
You guys are my best friends.

445
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,660
You too, Colin.

446
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:47,060
Why are you crying?

447
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,860
Why are you crying?

448
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,360
That-

449
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:48,860
You just-

450
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,360
You have such a spark.

451
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,660
Thanks.

452
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,960
Yeah, hopefully that spark never goes out.

453
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,860
A flame that will never die.

454
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,960
I am the phoenix.

455
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:00,960
I am eternal.

456
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
That's right.

457
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,960
That's right.

458
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:11,460
So do you guys want to try to steal

459
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,460
the beer? Yeah.

460
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,460
Yeah, you guys are trying to steal it.

461
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,360
So yeah, you do have a you do have a bardic

462
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,360
inspiration. So if you roll poorly, I'm just I'm

463
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,460
looking it up real quick.

464
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,460
I want to make sure that I told you the right

465
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,960
die that you can add to it.

466
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,260
Ah, it's level 5. Okay.

467
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,860
Yeah, it's just 1d6.

468
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:31,460
Okay. So yeah, I'm going to roll a stealth here.

469
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:37,380
try it. I'm going to, should I sneak to where the supply is or should I just try and steal

470
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,660
it from this guy? I feel like supply. Yeah, I'm going to sneak into the supply place.

471
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,740
Yeah. Yeah. So the supply place, just before you roll, I want to give you some of the picture of

472
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,220
it. So supply place is just a little bit off the side of where the bleachers are, right? It's like

473
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:58,580
sort of like with a catering hall where you have stuff in the back out of sight. So it's just sort

474
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,620
of like a refrigerated storage unit basically just sitting in the back there. So you can go there

475
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,460
and when the door opens would be like maybe a good time to go in unless you want to try to like

476
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:11,940
figure out the passcode or hack in or something. I'm just I'm gonna I'm gonna wait what were you

477
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:16,660
saying? Oh I just wanted to ask if I could try and do something with Gary C enterprise.

478
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:22,260
Yeah you could do anything with Gary. Okay I'll wait. Let Cameron's thing play out and then yeah

479
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:27,780
yeah yeah for sure we'll come back to that. Okay I'm gonna yeah I'll try and sneak in when the door

480
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:32,260
doors open. Okay, cool. Yeah, I would say yeah, roll just roll

481
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,780
stealth and then that should be enough. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The

482
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:42,580
D six. That's a fourteen plus. Four so eighteen that's good.

483
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,700
Yeah. I mean that's very good. So yeah, you managed to get

484
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,940
there and you see the door open slightly and you sort of just

485
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:55,460
slink your way in there and the door closes behind you and you

486
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,400
You can see it's a treasure trove of just the shittiest, wateriest beer.

487
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,920
It's everything you could dream of and more.

488
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:07,040
The only issue will be trying to get out.

489
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,520
But yeah, you can take as much as you want.

490
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:14,960
Okay, I'll take as much as I can carry.

491
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:15,960
In the ghillie suit you have?

492
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I'm going to take it all, everything.

493
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,080
I'd say you can get like six beers.

494
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,760
I'd say grab a six pack.

495
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:26,320
I'm grabbing a six pack and then I'm going to try to sneak back out.

496
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,040
OK, cool, so I mean you you can sort of look around.

497
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:34,280
You feel a little bit of a draft coming from like behind some of the boxes,

498
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:38,120
so there might be a way out there or you can wait for the guy to come back.

499
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,640
Sort of like, you know, go open open with the door and then slink.

500
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,160
Kind of see what's going on with the draft from the back.

501
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,440
OK, is there any way that I can see that this is happening

502
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,720
and try to try to distract someone?

503
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,520
I'm trying to think. So I mean, obviously the beer guy, the beer guy is still doing his thing.

504
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:01,800
He's back in the stands now. So he's not going to be back there for a little bit. So you

505
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,440
can get him maybe to go over there. But as far as distracting people, there aren't too

506
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,280
many people around there. There's a couple of guys on their smoke break. But if you want

507
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:12,640
to distract them just in case, I would totally recommend it.

508
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:18,560
I guess I'll go up and I'll just go up in front of those guys and I'm just going to start

509
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:24,240
doing another little dance without talking. I like chop my little hooves.

510
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,080
You know, it's not actually really much of a dance.

511
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Okay, that's an amazing performance. Holy crap. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, they're like,

512
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,920
you see two guys in a smoke break and they when they see you and they're like, Hey,

513
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:46,920
All right.

514
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,920
Yeah.

515
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:48,920
Oh, yeah.

516
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,920
It's like yelling.

517
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,920
I'm just so happy.

518
00:30:50,920 --> 00:31:10,480
Yeah, I would say, Cam, you have free reign to get out of there.

519
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,000
Roll a stealth check, but it's not gonna be too high of a DC.

520
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,000
16.

521
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,700
Yeah, you're good. You sort of sneak out of there.

522
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:19,800
You're like crap your bring your arm out.

523
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,900
You see the end like you see just his arm first column while you're dancing with the six packs on it.

524
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:27,700
It's like yeah, so you see the rest of them come out of the little little space there.

525
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,400
Yeah. Yeah. No. Yeah, way to go pig.

526
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,900
All right. Yeah. Yeah, cool.

527
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:38,300
And I just I kind of like clumsily stop and then just sort of walk away.

528
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:44,500
All right, take it easy. Let's just go back to smoking cigarettes.

529
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,800
So yeah, you guys, you guys got the beer.

530
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,700
I guess both of us you're hiding it in your ghillie suit or something.

531
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,000
And so you're trotting back to the stands to give it to your friends.

532
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,300
Patrick, what's going on?

533
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,700
Well, while that was happening, like the stealth thing, I was like,

534
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:00,700
man, there's no way he's going to get that friggin beer.

535
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,000
No way he's getting that fucking beer.

536
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
And then I go over to Gary C.

537
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,200
Enterprise and with his lemonade stand and I start talking to him.

538
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:08,900
Hey there, Patrick.

539
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,700
How's it going?

540
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,600
Hey, shut up.

541
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,900
Listen to me real quick.

542
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,200
All right, called this called yeast.

543
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,200
Alright, we're gonna put this in the lemonade and we're gonna let it ferment and in a little bit we're gonna have beer.

544
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,700
*snort*

545
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,700
Uh, okay, yeah, that's gonna take a really long time.

546
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,200
*laughs*

547
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,700
What do you mean it's gonna take a long- what the fuck are you talking about?

548
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:32,700
Oh, just- just, the like the time that- look, I've done the calculations on this and it's just the overhead, it's just way too much.

549
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,700
I don't think we're gonna make a profit that way, pal.

550
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,200
Ah, bullshit. What are you talking- we can make beer right now out of lemonade and yeast.

551
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,700
Okay, you know what-

552
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,200
At least kombucha.

553
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,700
*laughs*

554
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,900
Okay, you know what that gives me an idea here. I'm gonna portion off about 15% of my lemonade, okay?

555
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,180
Yeah, give that to you

556
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:58,620
You put your yeast inside if in an hour that yields kombucha we can sell that will split the profits if it doesn't I'm gonna have

557
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,500
To take that amount back from you, right?

558
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,300
So you're gonna sort of put down on some money you're gonna take a little bit of that back about math

559
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,620
I'm not here to do homework

560
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:12,460
All right. Well just take the lemonade see if you can make kombucha out of it at least. Okay? Yeah, well shit

561
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:16,380
I thought we had something I thought we had a better business plan

562
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:19,500
Hey business, I

563
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:26,700
Love business, I guess you hate business. He looks at you and it's like death is behind his eyes. I didn't mean that

564
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:30,780
Is this I didn't mean what I said? Anyway, I'm

565
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,900
I'm gonna go and as soon as I say I'm gonna go Cameron's like already

566
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,500
Cool yes, you guys bring the beer back

567
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:45,860
Yeah, you're what he goes you guys gonna start drinking the beers hanging out. So hell yeah

568
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:53,220
Yeah, I'm too focused on my on my beer that I'm trying to make that I'm just drinking active dry yeast

569
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,340
Okay roll a constitution saving throw

570
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,820
You just vomit like it's disgusting

571
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:11,180
Years, you're so wasted

572
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:18,940
You're so wasted right now you're vomiting all over the

573
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:25,340
I'm still looking scared

574

00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,620
Yeah, I would say Constitution saving throw on that for sure.

577
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,620
See how you can handle your liquor.

578
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,620
Oh no, it's six.

579
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,240
Colin, you're gonna get a little tummy ache from this, I think.

580
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,240
Oh, this hurts!

581
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,960
We need to pump his stomach, not a tummy ache.

582
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,960
My tummy seriously hurts, guys.

583
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,460
Colin, are you with me?

584
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,880
Look, don't go into the light.

585
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,880
Okay, I won't.

586
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,540
I'm gonna call the cops!

587
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,540
*laughing*

588
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,540
I don't know what to do!

589
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,540
You guys are my best friends!

590
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,540
Yeah, you see Hasekitsune look over and he's like

591
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,540
"Those guys are such weirdos."

592
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,540
They're always trying to pump their pig friend's stomach.

593
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:19,540
*laughing*

594
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,540
I get into some weird stuff sometimes.

595
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:23,540
You're just saying that

596
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:25,540
while your friends are pumping it.

597
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,540
*laughing*

598
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,540
I drink one of the beers

599
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,540
and I go, "Wow, I can't wait

600
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,540
to like, I'm in the army and then I get

601
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:37,540
get back and drink 36 of these at night while I'm recording calls from my wife.

602
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:46,820
So yeah, now it's the crowds are now sort of, you hear they announce her over like the thing.

603
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:54,900
Ladies and gentlemen and V-folks, it's time for sports ball and you hear like, you know,

604
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:59,700
whatever fucking fanfare music is playing. You see like the crowds are going crazy,

605
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:02,420
starting to gather. You guys are drinking, you're getting freaking hammered.

606
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,060
You're having a good time.

607
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:09,060
While that's happening, I've mixed a beer with that lemonade and yeast.

608
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,060
*laughter*

609
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,060
I was like, "This'll do it!"

610
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:18,060
You see, like, as soon as you finish pouring the beer into that, like, concoction of lemonade, it just has a face.

611
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:22,060
*laughter*

612
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:26,060
With no expression on it, it's just looking, like, at you.

613
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,060
*laughter*

614
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:33,860
Colin's gonna try to drink more beer after getting a tummy ache.

615
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,040
Oh hell yes he is.

616
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,860
We'll do a constitution saving throw on that too with this advantage.

617
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,540
Gonna keep trying.

618
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,540
Okay yeah.

619
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:43,540
Oh baby.

620
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,380
Yeah you can hold it down.

621
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:50,060
It only takes one for Colin and then he's got it.

622
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,460
Colin gets it right away.

623
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,460
He just immediately knows how to be cool.

624
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,460
This is sick.

625
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:55,460
The announcer's like uh.

626
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:56,460
I wanna spray paint the school.

627
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:59,020
I want to spray paint the school.

628
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:00,020
Whoa!

629
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,020
Colin, you're crazy!

630
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,020
Calm down, Colin.

631
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:11,300
I want to spray paint the school with a picture of an A+ on a homework assignment.

632
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Oh, you are so damn adorable.

633
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,300
That's just a mural!

634
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,300
Oh my...

635
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:21,300
You hear people around you after college, they go "Yoooooo!"

636
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:24,300
Bring that tummy over here and let me jiggle it.

637
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,300
Okay, I'll do that.

638
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:33,300

00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:06,220
Yeah, and so the announcer goes now for the gun City National Anthem this year sponsored by Halliburton in accordance with the Bill Murray Foundation of pranks as sung by Sullivan the frog.

660
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:11,620
you see solving the frog who's just still in the outfit that looks like him with the microphone

661
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:29,620
and

662
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:38,420
problem with the vampires and he just goes on to talk about vampires why they're scary how to kill

663
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:44,740
them where's the best place to shop for wooden steaks and garlic and all these things what the

664
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:55,220
i think i'm tripping from the beer he's tripping and i'm not talking about colin i'm talking about

665
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,660
Sullivan. And as Sullivan finishes the song, the

666
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:03,620
announcer goes, "Arm, play ball!" And it begins.

667
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:07,140
I try to drink my face lemonade.

668
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,140
As it's getting closer to you, you hear like a very low hum,

669
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:20,940
like as you bring it closer to your role constitution I would say yeah wisdom to

670
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:26,260
see if you become afraid of it 22 yeah you're just like I know this face it's

671
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:33,140
fine I throw my beer can at Sullivan nice

672
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,940
second go tripping on beer I as soon as I start drinking I have like a full like

673
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,940
like yellow submarine like acid.

674
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,940
[Laughter]

675
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,940
Overlays, I can't see anything.

676
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,940
I just see colors and shit.

677
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,940
You see as Blotas

678
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,940
throws the beer, you see it turn into like a bird

679
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,940
and fly towards Sullivan's

680
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
head and Blotas, make a range

681
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:56,940
attack.

682
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,940
So just do your

683
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,940
slingshot basically.

684
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,940
Oh my god!

685
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,940
[Laughter]

686
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Can I describe this?

687
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:11,820
describe this. Yeah, it looks like it looks like it misses

688
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,180
Sullivan, but that it flies past him and it bounces off the

689
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,980
helmets of one of the like the the away team's helmets and it

690
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:23,180
flies back and it flies into the briefing hole and Sullivan's

691
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:28,620
mascot costume goes into his mouth. It gets the it goes into

692
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,860
two mouths. Yeah. Yeah. Ray William Johnson. You're just

693
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:36,140
seeing like a bird fly past Sullivan and like Kareem off

694
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:41,140
the head of a dinosaur and then like fly back into Sullivan's mouth.

695
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,740
Oh, boo boo boo boo.

696
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:49,440
Like you're going like into the mouth now, like you're following

697
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,040
it through.

698
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,140
Yeah, you just hear you just hear cuz Sullivan still has like

699
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,140
the bike up with him.

700
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:54,540
You just hear.

701
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:02,740
I turn to Colin which is like the the wisest way ever and I

702
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,340
just look at him as a you're going to die.

703
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,340
*laughter*

704
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:10,340
Can I roll like a wisdom saver or something?

705
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,340
Yes, of course, yeah.

706
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:14,340
Oh my god, he got a crit!

707
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,340
I just look back and go,

708
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,340
"Yes, we all die one day."

709
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,340
*laughter*

710
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,340
But I am Colin, I am the Phoenix, I am eternal.

711
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:28,340
And then I kind of like shake my head and go, "Beer's weird."

712
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,340
*laughter*

713
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:34,340
And so, yeah, the game is ongoing.

714
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:42,340
The announcers like and the two teams line up on the painted lines all crouched down in the squatting position staring at one another.

715
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:46,340
One guy starts yelling a seemingly random string of phrases and numbers.

716
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:50,340
Hopefully someone could decode them after the game and he throws the ball between his legs.

717
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,340
Everyone is ramming into one another.

718
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:56,340
Hopefully they let each other pass, but they seem fairly determined to do this.

719
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,340
One guy has the balls now bouncing it over again again.

720
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,340
So all the ball changes over and over.

721
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:04,580
So it's a football, then it's a basketball and he's bouncing it.

722
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:08,520
Then he throws it to some guy who hits it like a baseball bat, who then heads it into

723
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,620
a hole, like into a golf hole on the other side of the field.

724
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,940
Like sports ball is just all those things together.

725
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:18,500
I look down at the cup and see that the face in the cup has been saying this the whole

726
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,500
time.

727
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,180
And I just look at it and go, "Okay."

728
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:29,260
He's been saying it like in the exact same, like at the same time as the announcer, just

729
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,260
like an octave lower.

730
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:40,260
He's like, this is a very trippy episode, folks.

731
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,960
Yeah, and so yeah, he starts describing it and then eventually it's the

732
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,860
scores tied up.

733
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:49,860
It's halftime whenever the lame frog score the husky tuning the

734
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:52,760
cheerleaders come out and do a full choreography to did it did it by

735
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,160
black pink the K-pop group.

736
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,960
Nobody knows them.

737
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:56,460
They're good.

738
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,660
And then look, I like K-pop.

739
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:08,380
So, um, half time show begins with the marching band coming out again and they're playing, um, uh, ants go marching.

740
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:12,140
Uh, and Sullivan is of course singing, uh, ants go marching.

741
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:18,140
(Sings)

742
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,140
He still has the beer can in his mouth.

743
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:22,140
He couldn't get it out.

744
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,140
His arms don't reach in the costume.

745
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:29,580
Yeah, so as it's approaching the chorus, uh, the marching band makes a target symbol.

746
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,980
to symbolize how Gun City always hits its mark.

747
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,620
And Sullivan goes like, "Tenayersk, baa!"

748
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:41,260
And then like, it's like you hear him like try to cough up the beer bottle.

749
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:45,900
And at first you don't hear anything though.

750
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:48,140
Sound is a lot slower than light, you see.

751
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,060
So you're always going to see something,

752
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:54,060
like 500 adamantium coffins roaring through the sky before you hear it.

753
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:58,380
They don't catch wind as they fall or blast sirens to warn you that they're coming.

754
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:03,100
they just plummet from some mysterious floating castle, as massive as a small town.

755
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:07,440
When the castle, of which you could only see the bottom, vanishes into a black vapor, whisked

756
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:11,940
away by what must be a supernatural wind, the careening hunks of metal death one by one

757
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:17,900
appear as dark imperfections punctuating the sky until they become an epic, malignant shadow.

758
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:22,660
The shade it provides is so brief that only a few can react in time.

759
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:27,140
One of them, thankfully, is the ever vigilant, ever anxious Solvin the Frog.

760
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,140
His eyes lift towards the sky as he hits that high note.

761
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,140
And when he realizes what is happening, he's the one with the microphone in hand.

762
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:38,140
So he's like, "ANYWAY HOLY SHIT VAMPIRES!"

763
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,140
And just...

764
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
DUNK DUNK DUNK DUNK

765
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:45,140
The coffin smash onto the field, shattering the thick earth beneath them,

766
00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:48,140
aiming for the perfect target formation the marching band for.

767
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,140
Some of the students get flattened immediately, their limbs are sticking out

768
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:54,140
while their body is in the ground.

769
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:57,640
mushed in a pre-made grave with a pre-assigned coffin.

770
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,640
Other coffins shoot through the stands,

771
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:03,640
crushing cheerleaders who still grip onto their pom-poms to the very end.

772
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,640
Some of the coffins are hovering in the air,

773
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,140
like shooting lasers outside of the sides of them.

774
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,640
People are screaming and running.

775
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:13,640
Methods of transportation just being obliterated.

776
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:17,140
Many of the metallic coffins that land on the edge of the school grounds,

777
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,140
and they have these little antennas shoot out that

778
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,140
generating this massive red force field that blocks out everything.

779
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:32,140
After they land, that's when the Transylvanian menaces emerge, armed to the teeth and to the teeth with their cyberknight blades and bloodblasters.

780
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:38,140
The feast begins. You see them going, grabbing students, biting them, faculty.

781
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:41,140
You see all of them going crazy, everyone's running around.

782
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:46,140
In the Pandemonium in Chaos, you're able to spot what must be the leaders of this invasion.

783
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:52,520
One, a thick-lunked, nude, impossibly muscled, scan-a-scaly grey, almost gargoyle-like, with

784
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,220
massive bat wings and a horrible monster's face.

785
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:59,760
The largest vampire by far, this behemoth begins to carve up as many students and faculty as

786
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:04,020
he can find, ripping a few in two and drinking the blood as it pours from their severed halves.

787
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,320
Another, a gorgeous womanly vampire, buxom and hypersexual.

788
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:13,380
One wave of her hand, of her silk-gloved hand and a sway of her silk gown, men and gay women

789
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:19,100
turn on their own, beating their brethren to death in the name of some form of dark possession.

790
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,340
She weaves her hands to and fro, casting a spell, and the possessed follows suit, forming

791
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:27,820
a carriage around her out of their bodies, and then wheeling her at a remarkable speed

792
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:28,820
toward the school.

793
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:34,460
Third, you see a nasty rodent-faced man, thin, bald, and poshly dressed, with a chrome cloak

794
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:39,220
that covers his new Victorian guard, with cyborg eyes that glow a harsh red.

795
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:43,220
From his cloak he produces a wave of small vampiric rodents, with eyes matching his, that

796
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:47,380
swarm the field, crawling up the legs of the unsuspecting, gnawing at their face, moving

797
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:50,860
swiftly to the next victim with unfeeling robotic precision.

798
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,020
As quickly as the rodent-faced man unleashes his vermin plague, you see him turn into a

799
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:59,380
bat that appears to be part V-Folk, and fly towards the school, phasing through the wall.

800
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:04,540
Finally, emerging from the sole coffin that's been unopened, upon which sits a raised, upside-down

801
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:12,620
cross made of obsidian, is a handsome vampire of repute. His full Yoji Yamato outfit in Vantablack,

802
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:16,860
the ruby heart that sits upon his outfit above his own, slicked back silver hair,

803
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:21,820
striking golden eyes, a feared commander in the Transylvanian army. While his lieutenants may

804
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:26,780
be unknown to you, this is a man whose face is plastered all across gun city propaganda channels.

805
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,900
Not since Vlad the Inhaler has someone struck fear into so many hearts. Hearts whose blood he wants

806
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:38,140
to suck. Count Loveyalots, he looks to the four of you and gives a curt nod to that big brutish

807
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:44,140
vampire who has just finished supping from a math teacher's skull. The big vampire sort of like

808
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:49,020
turns you all drooling in blood, just drooling blood coming out of his mouth, and while Loveyalots

809
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:55,580
turns into a pink sparkly mist and vanishes. Principal Barney, with his like arm bleeding,

810
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,580
Runs up to the four of you.

811
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:58,180
*panting*

812
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:58,860
PLEASE!

813
00:48:58,860 --> 00:49:00,580
YOU HAVE TO HELP US!

814
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:01,460
PLEASE!

815
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,460
You're the adult here!

816
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,620
We're- we're useless! We're cowards!

817
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:06,900
Again, dude, you're a-

818
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,860
you're a dinosaur!

819
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,380
Just fuckin' bite 'em, dude!

820
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,940
What the fuck are you doing, man?

821
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,860
You're huge!

822
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:13,380
Man, look at me, Greg!

823
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,500
I'm made of felt!

824
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,500
I really regret saying I wish there was a terrorist attack earlier.

825
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,700
I just wanna say, straight up,

826
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,860
this is not my fault.

827
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,540
Oh, well, if wishes were fishes-

828
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,060
OW!

829
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,060
He's just, like, gripping his arm.

830
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:29,940
Please, please, I'll do anything. I'll even bring back summer vacation. Just please help.

831
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,140
Okay, I'll help.

832
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,140
No, we're in.

833
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:34,140
Summer vacation?

834
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:37,140
Yes, just get rid of the vampires, please.

835
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,140
Got it.

836
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:40,140
That's easy for a guy like me.

837
00:49:40,140 --> 00:49:42,140
And I start army crawling.

838
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:45,140
In no direction in particular.

839
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:47,140
Army crawling around.

840
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:53,140
So yeah, you see the big, gray, scaly vampire. He's kind of walking towards you guys.

841
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:59,040
And he sort of looks to the four of you and he says my master has deemed you worthy

842
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,740
My name is Gary vampire

843
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:06,660
I'm gonna kill you. Hey Gary

844
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:10,320
What what's up? You suck?

845
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:17,820
Pretty good. I'm gonna save you for last

846
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,340
Delicious - hey, don't say that to my friend

847
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:28,340
and

848
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:31,140
I have stared into the pulsing veins of fate earlier today.

849
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:34,440
Did it went well?

850
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:37,540
I was very confused by what I saw in 14.

851
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,540
Well, you're not going to be confused by by this.

852
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:43,940
Everyone roll initiative.

853
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:46,180
Yeah. Roll initiative. You guys are 19.

854
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:49,940
Yeah. So first up is going to be you actually, Patrick Yoda.

855
00:50:49,940 --> 00:50:53,400
So where are you guys?

856
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:57,180
Are you guys on the stands still like the principal Barney run up to you guys

857
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:01,260
the stand. Yeah. Alright, cool. So, you're sort of like, like,

858
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:04,300
you know, probably like 25-ish feet away from him. He's sort

859
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,700
of down below looking up at you all ready to sort of pounce. So,

860
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:12,700
that's where you are though. Okay. So, Patrick, what are you

861
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:19,900
thinking? I'm gonna throw the drink at him. Uh you're gonna

862
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:24,620
throw the **** up face drink? Yeah. Okay, cool. Alright. Yeah.

863
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,860
Can it be like some kind of like persona like?

864
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:31,820
Let's let's talk it out. No, because we because I've committed to this. So let's figure it out.

865
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,060
Like what's like as soon as I throw it out of the cup, it turns into like a full person.

866
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:36,220
Yeah.

867
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,940
Stand.

868
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:45,740
Yeah, it's like, yeah, I fuck with that heavy. Yeah.

869
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,340
Okay. So what would I roll for that?

870
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:52,220
I mean, if you're basically just summoning him, so that's just like an action you can do.

871
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:54,820
Unless you mean you want to throw it at him so it can grab him.

872
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,020
No, I'm throwing it as a summon now.

873
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,020
Okay, yes, that's just your action.

874
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,020
Yeah.

875
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,020
Alright, yeah, so you... he looks sort of like...

876
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,020
Do you guys know...

877
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:08,020
Shit, have you guys ever seen Bobabo?

878
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,020
You know, the jelly guy?

879
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,020
The jelly man guy?

880
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:15,020
He's like blue and he has this super serious human face.

881
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:20,020
He sort of looks like that except he's yellow.

882
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,540
Um, and he just makes no expression on his face.

883
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,540
Oh, yeah.

884
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,540
Okay.

885
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,540
Yeah.

886
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,540
Yeah.

887
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:28,540
That's like, I do remember this guy.

888
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,540
Yes.

889
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:30,540
That's what he looks like.

890
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:31,540
What are you naming your lemonade guy?

891
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:34,340
Uh, his name is Lemon Party.

892
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:37,020
Mr. Lemon Party.

893
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,020
Okay.

894
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,020
Yeah.

895
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,420
You, you summon him and he has that like stone cold face and he turns to you, Patrick Yoda,

896
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:45,900
and he like gives you like a thumbs up.

897
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,460
Like, like, yo.

898
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,460
Yeah.

899
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:56,220
Yeah, he like nods curtly and turns to face the guy. So I will say that like he has an action now

900
00:52:56,220 --> 00:53:02,860
and you can use not this turn, but next turn you can use your action. You can instead do his,

901
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:07,420
it could be his action and you could have him do something. So he's just sort of like standing guard

902
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:14,140
this lemon party guy who I will give some stats now and it'll make him just like a summon you can

903
00:53:14,140 --> 00:53:16,140
I just made it so hard.

904
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:18,140
It's so sick, dude.

905
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:22,140
You're better at science than you thought, Patrick Yoda.

906
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,140
Oh shit, maybe I actually learned some cool shit at this fucking school.

907
00:53:26,140 --> 00:53:32,140
I'm giving him some stats.

908
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:34,140
Okay, very quick.

909
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:38,140
And then let's give him a close-up attack.

910
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,140
It'll be pretty strong. And a ranged attack.

911
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:42,140
Okay, cool.

912
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:50,140
Something very simple. Okay, cool. Yeah, we can trick about another time. I fuck with him. No, Mr. Lemon party. So yeah, okay you summon him it is now

913
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:55,140
Ray William Johnson's turn

914
00:53:55,140 --> 00:54:02,820
I'm going to you. I'm going to use my my matrix beam on fuck. Yeah, dude on this odd, man

915
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:07,300
Okay, cool roll for them. But I also am still kind of tripping. So I

916
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:11,140
He just looks like a normal guy to me. I'm not aware. He's a vampire

917
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:20,180
there. Okay, cool. You actually he's got pretty high AC so you actually miss that. So you

918
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:26,260
just shoot this beam at him. And he puts like his wings around him. And as it sort of like

919
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:32,940
you sort of like takes the blow kind of you just see a guy you just see a guy. What do

920
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:39,500
you see this guy do it's a guy just like put up his hand like Neo.

921
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:48,220
I'm like, holy **** that's okay. Cool. Yeah, that's your turn.

922
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:54,300
Uh uh and now it is um uh this guy's turn um uh uh Gary

923
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:59,020
Vampire's turn. So uh Gary Vampire is going to fly up

924
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:03,180
towards you, Colin, because you said he sucks.

925
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:04,740
- Wait, as a reaction, I'd like to tell you

926
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:06,640
that you said you'd save me for last.

927
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,060
(laughing)

928
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:12,300
- What?

929
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,140
- Managing memory on Colin.

930
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,580
- Yeah, you said you were gonna save him for last.

931
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,380
- Yeah, you'd break a promise to him.

932
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:19,900
- Are you not a man of your word?

933
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,700
- Look at his little tail.

934
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,140
- I think I found your weakness.

935
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:25,540
It's not being kind.

936
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:26,380
- It's honesty.

937
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:29,220
It's integrity!

938
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,460
It's all those things!

939
00:55:31,460 --> 00:55:34,740
You see him like, frozen in the air with his claw out,

940
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:38,340
and he just sort of like, frozen pivots over towards...

941
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:43,060
Blotas, and uh, he does an attack roll.

942
00:55:43,060 --> 00:55:45,000
Sorry.

943
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,220
And uh, oops, he got a crit.

944
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,820
That's okay, Colin, I get it!

945
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:51,460
He got a crit, so it was probably for the best.

946
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:53,460
Uh... oh boy.

947
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:56,140
Yeah, that's 20 damage, Blotas.

948
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,820
he just fucking claws you.

949
00:55:58,820 --> 00:55:59,820
Oh my god.

950
00:55:59,820 --> 00:56:00,820
God.

951
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:01,820
He just did?

952
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,220
I have 12 HP left.

953
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,220
Oh my god.

954
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,220
Yeah.

955
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:09,540
So he just like stops in the middle and turns to you and just claws you.

956
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:12,220
Just fucks you up.

957
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:16,900
And as he's fucking you up he turns to you, Colin, and he goes, "This is what's gonna

958
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:18,500
happen to you."

959
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,380
Probably not.

960
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,500
And it is now, Blotas, it's your turn while this guy, while you get clawed up by this guy.

961
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,740
Wait, can I use my reaction when he hits me?

962
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:33,020
I have the "this is war" ability.

963
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:35,820
Oh yes, I'll give you that.

964
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:37,180
It's basically hellish rebuke.

965
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,180
Do it.

966
00:56:38,180 --> 00:56:39,180
Yeah.

967
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:40,180
So explain it.

968
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:45,300
When somebody damages me, I can use this on the person that damaged me and deal damage

969
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,300
back to them.

970
00:56:46,300 --> 00:56:47,300
Okay, cool.

971
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,920
Yeah, so it's a dexterity saving throw.

972
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,900
So let's see how he does.

973
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:54,940
Okay, what's his dex?

974
00:56:54,940 --> 00:57:01,220
Okay, he does manage to save, but he still takes half his half damage.

975
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,220
So roll.

976
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:03,220
Yeah.

977
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:06,420
He takes more damage.

978
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,420
Yeah.

979
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:10,300
So you declare war on how do you got how do you declare war?

980
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:14,660
How do you like do this on this guy?

981
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,960
I I don't know.

982
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:23,540
Something about about me is that I I'm really into the army, but I don't really know anything

983
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,740
about the army beyond boot camp.

984
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:29,940
So so I just I you're you know,

985
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:33,340
you're kind of like an evil drill sergeant and this time I'm

986
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:36,540
going to make you drop and give me for four damage.

987
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:42,840
That is yeah, and it's just like a fire like reverberates

988
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:48,740
from your you say for damage for his chest.

989
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:50,240
Yeah, he gets burned from that though.

990
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,040
And it is now your turn, Colin.

991
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,320
OK, oh, it's sorry.

992
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,200
No, it's sorry.

993
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,720
It's what's up with the reaction.

994
00:57:57,720 --> 00:58:00,120
I'm so sorry. That's right.

995
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,960
And then I'm going to I'm going to see neck right next to me. Yeah.

996
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:08,440
Hmm. OK, I'm going to hit him with my cool sticks,

997
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,040
which are there.

998
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:13,280
They're devil sticks, but I lost the yo-yo part like a year ago.

999
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:16,320
So yeah, do it. Do it. Do it.

1000
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:19,400
OK, that's a six.

1001
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,080
Yeah, you just whiff. You're just like swiping at the air.

1002
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:25,080
Yeah. Oh, I do have an additional attack though. I'm

1003
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:29,080
gonna do it again. Go for it. That's a nine. You continue to

1004
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:36,760
whiff. Uh yeah, you're up, Colin. Okay, well, first, I'm

1005
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:45,720
going to do Colin's insight. Um. Perfect, yes. So, it's

1006
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:47,560
Basically, fairy fire.

1007
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:52,040
But what Colin does is he's able to use his ability

1008
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,440
to just discern things.

1009
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,680
He's a very bright little piggy

1010
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:58,120
to help give advantage to his friends.

1011
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:00,120
So we're gonna have our guy roll a dexterity saving throw

1012
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:01,320
against your spell save.

1013
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,840
You're gonna have a guy roll your next damn round

1014
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:04,680
'cause you're a spell save.

1015
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,000
- My spell save is 13.

1016
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,360
- Yeah, he fails.

1017
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,200
So what do you do?

1018
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,040
What do you figure out about this guy?

1019
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,400
- So I go, I have identified his insecurities.

1020
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:15,240
It wasn't honesty or being mean or integrity.

1021
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:22,240
it's kinda commercial

1022
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:24,720
uh...

1023
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,240
this is a great

1024
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,680
we see a little

1025
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,600
and i think it's here to roll down his i'd

1026
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,680
no

1027
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,840
that i'm going to have a good turn to ray william johnson and i'm gonna go to the

1028
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,240
politics action

1029
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:41,400
which means i'm saying out loud

1030
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:48,320
I'm gonna say I can dance all day. I can prance and say Heidi Heidi. Hey, that's what Colin say

1031
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:51,280
Do a

1032
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,300
Colin's pig spiration on you so you now have an additional d6 on your next okay?

1033
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,980
Dad some just my mouth open just drool

1034
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:07,120
You don't have to use it on your next thing you can you can save that for like I think 10 in game

1035
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:11,140
in minutes. Yeah, what is my buff?

1036
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:15,580
So it's you roll a D six and add it to any attack roll or ability

1037
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:16,540
check, basically.

1038
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:19,080
Cool. You don't need to use it now.

1039
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,740
Mm hmm. So yeah, that's a great.

1040
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,420
That's a fantastic turn.

1041
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:27,180
So you now you now all have advantage on this guy

1042
01:00:27,180 --> 01:00:30,380
because you guys have located his puppy nips.

1043
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:34,220
OK, he's just like, no.

1044
01:00:34,220 --> 01:00:37,220
How he's like been naked this whole time.

1045
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,480
(laughter)

1046
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:42,340
- Amazing, okay cool.

1047
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:43,820
We're back to the top of the order.

1048
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:45,820
Patrick Yoda, what's going on?

1049
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,380
- I'm just staring at his man boobs, I'm going,

1050
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,640
(groaning)

1051
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:54,620
- Yeah, you lose a turd.

1052
01:00:54,620 --> 01:00:55,460
- And then, yeah.

1053
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:58,260
(laughter)

1054
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:03,020
No, but my summon,

1055
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,740
he's gonna attack the,

1056
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:08,340
I tell him to attack the boobs.

1057
01:01:08,340 --> 01:01:09,840
Yeah, okay.

1058
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,340
Cool slap that man's titties.

1059
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:14,240
You see him face you and go.

1060
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:18,440
He just like exactly what you said.

1061
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,240
Yeah, and he goes to attack this guy's titties.

1062
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,840
So let's roll with advantage.

1063
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,040
What does he use?

1064
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,340
What do you what does he use?

1065
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:26,940
You tell me.

1066
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,140
Force lightning ability.

1067
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:29,640
I think because he's lemon.

1068
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:33,540
He has a he has you want to give him the lemon.

1069
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:34,840
You want to give our force lightning?

1070
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:35,340
Okay.

1071
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:35,840
Spark.

1072
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:36,340
[Laughter]

1073
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:36,840
The lemon.

1074
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:39,340
Because he's lemon, he has the lemon spark.

1075
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,340
Yeah, yeah, it's called the, it's called the zest.

1076
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,340
The attack of zest.

1077
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:44,340
Oh yeah, that's good.

1078
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:49,340
Alright, so, um, if we'll give him force lightning, we'll say it takes from your techno slime to do that.

1079
01:01:49,340 --> 01:01:51,340
Um, if you want to do that.

1080
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:52,340
Okay.

1081
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,340
Okay, cool.

1082
01:01:53,340 --> 01:02:00,340
So that'll be minus five on your techno slime, um, and then roll the force lightning, um, in your chat.

1083
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:01,340
Twenty.

1084
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,340
Roll again to see if you get crit.

1085
01:02:03,340 --> 01:02:04,340
Twenty-three.

1086
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,780
OK, roll for damage.

1087
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:06,540
OK, cool.

1088
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:07,740
It's at 5 and 9.

1089
01:02:07,740 --> 01:02:09,500
Nice, yes, you do 14 damage.

1090
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,900
So he just like just used to see the

1091
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:13,500
electricity like coursing through his

1092
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:15,540
like lemon body and just like shoot

1093
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:17,540
out of his fingertips at this guy.

1094
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:18,860
And this kid, the vampire.

1095
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:20,620
He wasn't here before the fuck.

1096
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,500
It's just like just like getting

1097
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,020
electrocuted as a less good.

1098
01:02:24,020 --> 01:02:25,540
I'm just like shooting lightning

1099
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:26,660
out of his hands.

1100
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,780
Yeah, he's not looking too hot though.

1101
01:02:28,780 --> 01:02:30,740
After that it is your turn Ray.

1102
01:02:30,740 --> 01:02:32,180
You're going to have to

1103
01:02:32,180 --> 01:02:34,180
It is your turn, Ray.

1104
01:02:34,180 --> 01:02:40,060
Okay, I will I'm gonna use my

1105
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:44,000
My homing missiles

1106
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:50,660
I have two of them. I'm gonna shoot them directly at his tits. Yeah, your digital missiles. Yeah, I'm gonna lock them in

1107
01:02:50,660 --> 01:02:57,260
Yeah, those those hit automatically. You always get your target. Really? Yeah, dude. It is the best thing ever

1108
01:02:57,260 --> 01:03:00,220
So you can do like I feel like we're doing too much too early

1109
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:02,220
I feel like we should wait on some things.

1110
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:02,720
No.

1111
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:05,720
No, I think we gotta use it all right away.

1112
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:06,220
Yeah.

1113
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:09,720
Our, not only our school, but our country is in danger.

1114
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,720
This is true.

1115
01:03:10,720 --> 01:03:11,220
That's a good point.

1116
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:12,720
It's Independence Day.

1117
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,220
Okay.

1118
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,220
So I just let them fly.

1119
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:16,220
Okay, cool.

1120
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:17,720
And so I would, yeah.

1121
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:19,220
So you just take, so that's three.

1122
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,220
You have three you can send.

1123
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,720
So send, you can send two more.

1124
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,720
Okay, I send two more.

1125
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:25,220
Yeah.

1126
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,220
Um, okay.

1127
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:29,720
Uh, uh, describe your kill on this.

1128
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,060
Oh my God.

1129
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:37,560
He I'm still so fucking high on beer

1130
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,980
that as soon as he looked like a normal guy until somebody said

1131
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:43,900
that he had tits and then he just turned into two giant tits

1132
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,320
in my in my view.

1133
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:50,040
And then they they exploded like balloons.

1134
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:53,580
What's my my missiles hit it and then

1135
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:56,720
like a pinata candy flew everywhere.

1136
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:01,460
Yeah, fuck and I I'm like somebody give me another beer

1137
01:04:01,460 --> 01:04:04,820
This is awesome

1138
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:11,260
No, well, you'll never defeat our other lieutenants that are inside the school somewhere. Oh

1139
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:18,860
Wait, where are they? Oh nice try. Hey crap. He dies. I'll bring you back to life

1140
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:23,820
You see him like he's like eyes closed for the real

1141
01:04:23,820 --> 01:04:24,820
Yes.

1142
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:25,820
He dies, yeah.

1143
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:26,820
No!

1144
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:33,340
Don't worry guys, I'm an army man, I learn to track.

1145
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:35,540
I can track their footprints.

1146
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:40,580
And I start following the footprints where I was army crawling earlier.

1147
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:42,220
Blotoss, Blotoss, stop.

1148
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:44,340
Hold on one second.

1149
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,940
While the lieutenants are inside and we're out in this field where presumably nothing

1150
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:52,660
is really happening since we killed Gary, I think that we should take ten minutes to

1151
01:04:52,660 --> 01:04:57,780
just take a breather and I can do my Colin song of rest where you can heal some

1152
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,440
you can heal some points. I will say there is definitely like vampires killing

1153
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:10,100
people out here. You can 100% ignore that and just don't care. Let's go hide where we stole the beer from.

1154
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:16,540
Yeah cool all right take 10 minutes in your 10 minutes short rests and recover

1155
01:05:16,540 --> 01:05:19,440
some of your HP yeah yeah Colin go tell me about it.

1156
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,440
What's your song?

1157
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:23,440
Can I recover techno slime in this?

1158
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,440
Ok, well, actually instead of a song, actually I'll do a song.

1159
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:34,440
I love you more than God, I love you when I'm thawed, I am your awesome friend, my name is Colin.

1160
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:38,440
Alright, and so yeah, what happens?

1161
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:48,440
Well, so, I mean it's, it's, it's, technically, beginning it, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest.

1162
01:05:48,440 --> 01:05:51,040
If you or any friendly creature who can hear your performance regain hit points at the

1163
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:53,800
end of the short rest by spending one or more hit dice, each of those creatures regain an

1164
01:05:53,800 --> 01:05:55,280
extra 1d6 hit points.

1165
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,280
Nice.

1166
01:05:56,280 --> 01:06:01,440
So if you guys use, which I guess this would in this case really be mostly for blow toss,

1167
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,640
if you want to start using those short rest hit dice, you can.

1168
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:07,680
Can I use them one at a time to see?

1169
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:08,680
Yes, absolutely.

1170
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:09,680
All right.

1171
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:15,880
Wow, and after the song is done, there's just like a single tear running down my cheek.

1172
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:20,120
lemon guy lemon party also like goes back into the vat that you have and you just see his face

1173
01:06:20,120 --> 01:06:27,560
just sticking out of it that guy thinks cool he looks at you call and you see him like

1174
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:32,200
just like for the first time make an expression on his face and it's just like it's one of like

1175
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:38,760
sort of like profound pity as he looks directly at you colin i just smile back

1176
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,840
Cameron you get to roll an extra d6. Okay. Yeah, that's cool

1177
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:47,400
um

1178
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:50,040
Um, but

1179
01:06:50,040 --> 01:06:53,880
Sorry, I have the ability to heal too, but I feel like this whole thing will

1180
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:59,160
Probably won't be able to actually just go to sleep and go all the way back. So i'm trying to sort of yeah

1181
01:06:59,160 --> 01:07:02,040
You know, that's that's okay you

1182
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,280
You're perfect

1183
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:10,120
You're absolutely perfect. Also patrick yodar also has four skin still too. Yeah

1184
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:15,200
I should have gotten rid of that one too. I guess you're 19. Okay, thank God.

1185
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,200
They're children, so I don't want to use that.

1186
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:24,200
Alright, it doesn't do... He has this ability and it does not do what it does.

1187
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:26,200
But it does heal them.

1188
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:32,200
Okay. That's the rule. I use my hit dice to get back to 31 out of 32 HP, so I'm all set.

1189
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:34,200
How about this? How about this?

1190
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,200
What?

1191
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:43,700
A byproduct of the VAT thing gave me like a little bag that I could put over their heads and that's how the foreskin works.

1192
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:48,500
Or it's the VAT guy, he pops out and he gives everyone like-

1193
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,700
And his foreskin.

1194
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:50,700
[Laughter]

1195
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:52,700
He's a kid, so it's fine.

1196
01:07:52,700 --> 01:07:54,200
[Laughter]

1197
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,700
Yeah, we figured it out.

1198
01:07:55,700 --> 01:08:03,200
I'm gonna teach that little guy to make an experiment that will make another Patrick Yoda with a foreskin.

1199
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,200
[Laughter]

1200
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:09,520
So he just like he just gives you all bro hugs and you heal for the amount

1201
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:15,200
What's up? And it's like you like it's just like very chill hugs. Well, you have an idea

1202
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,200
He goes up and he says I'm proud of you

1203
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:23,760
Cool okay. So yeah you guys did your little short rest

1204
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,800
You're outside the school

1205
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:32,360
Which looks like the you know, it basically looks like a prison you hear pandemonium and chaos still going on outside

1206
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:37,480
You see the giant red dome over you, you know, it's it's it's it's gonna be tough

1207
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:39,640
But you think you could probably fight your way through the school

1208
01:08:39,640 --> 01:08:46,120
Obviously you can go through the front door. There's other entrances in the school. You can do whatever you want. What do you guys think it?

1209
01:08:46,120 --> 01:08:48,840
Well, toss you are the most tactical

1210
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:55,400
Do you think of you know any alternative doors other than the front door? That would be most tactical

1211
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,800
well

1212
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:05,400
One tactical move is going through the window, but I don't know if we can reach the window from down here. Here's the thing. I

1213
01:09:05,400 --> 01:09:07,440
like

1214
01:09:07,440 --> 01:09:12,940
Boys with the janitor. He gave me his keys dude. I can get in any fucking room

1215
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:19,040
Listen if they're expecting us what's what I mean

1216
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:25,680
What's more obvious than going through a window or a secret door or something? Shouldn't we just walk through the front door though?

1217
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:29,200
They won't expect it. What if we just stay outside?

1218
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:33,640
Yeah, and we use the loading dock to go in

1219
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:37,320
Hey patches. Do I have any equivalent of a disguise kit?

1220
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:43,320
Oh, yeah, I was gonna say yeah, I guess you do. Yes

1221
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,560
All right

1222
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:51,040
I think that it would be a great idea for me to use my clever piggy disguise kit to fashion a little a little

1223
01:09:51,040 --> 01:09:55,080
Adorable vampire outfit for myself see if I can trick them

1224
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:57,480
I really want to see that.

1225
01:09:57,480 --> 01:09:59,720
Can we take pictures too?

1226
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:01,440
I just want to remember it.

1227
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:02,440
For no reason.

1228
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:05,360
I mean, it's not like we're ever going to have to remember you.

1229
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,360
Hey, listening.

1230
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:10,480
Listen, building memories with your best friends in the world is great.

1231
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:12,920
And sometimes you just need to take pictures.

1232
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:14,680
I point at Colin and say, "This guy's..."

1233
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:17,320
Hey, how about this guy's my best friend in the whole damn world.

1234
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:19,200
Love his little damn thing.

1235
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:20,200
What are you saying?

1236
01:10:20,200 --> 01:10:21,200
Are you saying this guy's?

1237
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:24,360
Did you say this guy or this guy's?

1238
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:28,360
This guy over here is my best pig friend and I love him.

1239
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:29,860
I don't know what you're saying.

1240
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,360
What does that have to do with this?

1241
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,360
I hate this guy and I hate this guy.

1242
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:34,360
That point of view.

1243
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,860
But I love this guy.

1244
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:36,860
Thanks.

1245
01:10:36,860 --> 01:10:38,860
You guys, I love all of you.

1246
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:41,360
Can I put on my little outfit now?

1247
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,360
Yeah, you put on your outfit. Sorry.

1248
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,360
Should I roll performance to see how...

1249
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:45,860
Yes.

1250
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:46,360
Okay.

1251
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:49,860
Yes.

1252
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:50,360
Got a crit, baby.

1253
01:10:51,860 --> 01:10:54,400
I'm looking like an adorable little vampire.

1254
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:57,060
- You look exactly like a vampire pig.

1255
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,260
You look amazing.

1256
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,020
- To the point where we all get scared.

1257
01:11:00,020 --> 01:11:00,860
- Yeah.

1258
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:01,700
- Yeah.

1259
01:11:01,700 --> 01:11:03,220
- I'm gonna, well, I'm still cute.

But I'm gonna, I'm just gonna be like,

1261
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,220
I'm gonna just explain to them

1262
01:11:10,220 --> 01:11:14,100
that I'm one of the new hired generals of vampirism

1263
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:16,260
or whatever is going on here.

1264
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,260
- Okay, cool.

1265
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:20,740
So yeah, I mean, there are like, by the front door,

1266
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:25,660
there are two vampires who are like sort of standing guard right now

1267
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,940
so what's the uh... what's it's what do you think

1268
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:31,780

1269
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:34,800

uh... and uh...

1274
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,160
I'm taking them to the head guy, Mr. Kiss-a-lot.

1275
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:51,160
[laughter]

1276
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:53,160
Um...

1277
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:55,160
So, just let me through.

1278
01:11:55,160 --> 01:11:59,320
Roll persuasion, uh, with advantage, obviously.

1279
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,320
Oh my god!

1280
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,320
God, a crit, god damn.

1281
01:12:03,320 --> 01:12:05,320
Damn, they just go,

1282
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,600
"Well, as you know, his name is Mr. Loves-a-lot, but that's okay."

1283
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,600
[laughter]

1284
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,480
I'm so important that I don't pay attention to that.

1285
01:12:13,480 --> 01:12:16,960
Right this way, sir. And they just sort of open the door for you.

1286
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:20,280
And yeah, I mean, you could see what's going on inside now.

1287
01:12:20,280 --> 01:12:25,960
There are vampires, like, you know, attacking students and teachers cowering behind the students.

1288
01:12:25,960 --> 01:12:33,800
And you see sort of that, I mean, like, if you want to know where they're going, I mean, I'm sure they can tell you.

1289
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:39,560
So he's in the gym. The Mr. Count Lovey-Lots is in the gym.

1290
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:54,600
the

1291
01:12:54,600 --> 01:13:00,200
sad about it. Oh, oh, no. Oh, oh, wait.

1292
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,440
Well, that's good. That's fine.

1293
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:10,280
Thank you. Thanks. Where would you say who's who's like the second from the lowest tier

1294
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:18,840
of in our ranks here? Third, then? Yes. Let's we think. Oh, oh, oh, I need. Thanks for probably

1295
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:23,160
Probably I've I'd never came up with a name for her

1296
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:26,600
Madam boobs

1297
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:42,040
On me that would be so scary

1298
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:54,760
Yeah, the other ones all have like either a low effort name or a pun, but her I just made madam boobs. Okay, uh

1299
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,460
Yeah, so she's in the auditorium. They would tell you so

1300
01:13:58,460 --> 01:14:01,080
You could head over there if you'd like

1301
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,720
Okay, yes, of course

1302
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:07,360
And yeah, you guys

1303
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:12,720
Say you guys walk over we because of that disguise and because of your story like yeah

1304
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:15,680
Like you guys walk over there with very little interference

1305
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,940
I can I say I when we're walking there

1306
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:23,040
the one of the school

1307
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:28,160
Army recruiters like run by he's being chased by a vampire

1308
01:14:28,160 --> 01:14:33,920
I see him and I'm like, oh this this guy right here is my best friend. Wait guys

1309
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:39,060
I have to show my push-ups and he just he just he just runs and runs back towards the vampire

1310
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:46,040
Yeah in the school where army recruiters follow every student home

1311
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:52,640
They all hate blow to us about joining the army.

1312
01:14:52,640 --> 01:14:55,340
Yeah, okay.

1313
01:14:55,340 --> 01:15:09,740
So you get to the auditorium, you know, it's a big lavish auditorium, but as lavish as the arts are deemed to be in gun city and you see center stage that beautiful vampire woman.

1314
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:16,240
And you see her weaving her hands as all these men and gay women are doing a performance

1315
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:17,240
for her.

1316
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:19,020
And she's like, "No, no, no!

1317
01:15:19,020 --> 01:15:20,020
It's all wrong!

1318
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,340
It has to be like this!"

1319
01:15:21,340 --> 01:15:27,860
And she's trying to perform and show them how to act and do all these things.

1320
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:32,220
She hears you guys sort of come in and she looks at you and says, "Ah!

1321
01:15:32,220 --> 01:15:35,180
Who is this and what have you brought to me?"

1322
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:39,380
I am Colin the pig-pire.

1323
01:15:39,380 --> 01:15:43,180
And the vampi- I'm Colin-

1324
01:15:43,180 --> 01:15:45,180
Say- hey, say- say "ham-pire."

1325
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,180
Say "ham-pire."

1326
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:50,680
Um, I like- I- I am Colin the ham-pire.

1327
01:15:50,680 --> 01:15:52,180
YAAAAY!

1328
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:56,180
I've brought you some delicious things.

1329
01:15:56,180 --> 01:16:00,680
Also, I must say, you're very beautiful, but I- I am asexual.

1330
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:04,180
Um, so just don't-

1331
01:16:04,180 --> 01:16:09,540
I understand the effect I have on people and I just, you know, before anything happens,

1332
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:15,300
I'm an asexual kind of character here.

1333
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:21,700
So I'm being presumptuous, but it isn't due to...

1334
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,380
I don't recognize you.

1335
01:16:24,380 --> 01:16:25,940
You don't recognize me?

1336
01:16:25,940 --> 01:16:26,940
Really?

1337
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:29,860
I don't recognize you.

1338
01:16:29,860 --> 01:16:35,740
Mr. Loves-a-Lot hired me to specifically go through each of his admirables, admirable

1339
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:41,740
admirals, and um, to discover how admirable the admirals are.

1340
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:44,340
Okay, roll, roll persuasion.

1341
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,580
Alright, um, uh oh.

1342
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,540
Okay yeah.

1343
01:16:49,540 --> 01:16:54,220
She looks at you and she says, and she looks at you and glares at you, and she snaps her

1344
01:16:54,220 --> 01:17:02,860
fingers and like the door shut and a spotlight goes on her and she says I

1345
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:09,340
used to live in gun city you know I was an actress a real one too in Hollyweird

1346
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:14,180
not like those whores in the clubs at Raytheon Square I was starring in

1347
01:17:14,180 --> 01:17:18,040
pictures holographic VR I was even in the first movie ever to be shot in the

1348
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:23,720
Matrix 2, but I was getting old. At 19, I knew the wonderful men who run

1349
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,600
Hollyweird would find some other hot young thing soon. I was worried. We still

1350
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,240
belonged to Transylvania at the time, so I had my agent pull some strings and I

1351
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:37,120
got myself turned into a vampire. I thought once you see some of the some of

1352
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:42,280
the men and gay women she's a possessed or like crying at the sad story like

1353
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:47,680
like very dramatically. I thought once I became a vampire I'd be the talk of the

1354
01:17:47,680 --> 01:17:51,720
town. Young and glamorous forever, mother wouldn't be able to say a word to me

1355
01:17:51,720 --> 01:17:57,840
about my flabby arms or my crow's feet or my forehead being too weird. But no one

1356
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:01,480
in gun city wanted to see a vampire, they all hated them, and when I tried to act

1357
01:18:01,480 --> 01:18:08,440
in Transylvania, everyone was a fucking vampire! My career was over. Naturally I

1358
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:15,160
joined the military, but no. On this stage where hundreds of children have

1359
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,880
perform the pajama game and bye-bye birdie I will play my greatest role yet

1360
01:18:19,880 --> 01:18:24,680
woman who kills teenagers and um...

1361
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:27,080
after she finishes her whole uh spiel

1362
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:27,580
yeah yeah yeah

1363
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:31,840
I like very quickly throw a pencil on the ground in front of her and I'm like

1364
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:35,340
"let's uh I think you dropped something you might want to pick it up"

1365
01:18:35,340 --> 01:18:38,800
"I want to bend over and pick up that there pencil"

1366
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:42,400
"yeah I'm actually asexual too yeah asexual ass motherfucker"

1367
01:18:42,400 --> 01:18:45,400
(laughter)

1368
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:47,400
Show me what you workin' with.

1369
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:49,400
(laughter)

1370
01:18:49,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Oh man, roll for initiative.

1371
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,400
(laughter)

1372
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,400
I thought you'd die.

1373
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,400
Yeah, me too.

1374
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,400
Dude, that pencil's a wooden stake.

1375
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,400
You better keep that in mind.

1376
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,400
Actually, pick it up and put it in your boobs real quick.

1377
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,400
(laughter)

1378
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:06,400
Okay, cool.

1379
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:08,400
Okay, Ray, you're gonna go first.

1380
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:10,400
So you see her, just sort of start to weave her hand.

1381
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,840
and you see the men around her, all the people who are in

1382
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:17,520
fat with her just run, you know, start to start to get

1383
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,360
themselves ready to fight. They're all like, you know,

1384
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,640
basically NPCs so you can do there. I mean they'll try to

1385
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,240
hurt you but and she's sort of getting herself ready. What do

1386
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:32,560
you want to do though? I will use I will use my matrix beam

1387
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:38,560
hell. Yeah directly at her. Yeah so hard. Ah **** zero one.

1388
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,080
Yeah, yeah, you try to do the.

1389
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,360
How do you hold this damn thing?

1390
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:48,680
You're just like using you're like looking at your hands.

1391
01:19:48,680 --> 01:19:50,360
How do you hold this damn thing?

1392
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:55,000
You're just still tripping instead of like coat ones and zeros that are coming out.

1393
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:59,880
It's like ABC just letters are coming out and it just like washes over her.

1394
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:00,840
It doesn't do anything.

1395
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:03,000
Okay, cool.

1396
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:05,000
It is now mad.

1397
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:08,040
No, it's actually Patrick Yoda's turn first.

1398
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:10,920
You know what? I'm gonna try and do a hoverboard.

1399
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:13,480
Hoverboard. Boomerang?

1400
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,920
Boomerang, yeah. Yeah, for sure.

1401
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:21,160
So I like look at her and I like pull the hoverboard out. I'm like,

1402
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,960
"I know you ain't rocking with this!"

1403
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:28,360
I hit the hoverboard and I get a crit one.

1404
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:34,360
Oh no! You're all totally transfixed by her beauty.

1405
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:43,800
Yeah, you just like I mean you just fall on your ass like you just try to do it do anything with the hoverboard and it's like butter in your hands.

1406
01:20:43,800 --> 01:20:58,800
It's like if you were holding butter and now it is Madam boobs turn and she turns to you all boobily and she opens her mouth opens her mouth.

1407
01:20:58,800 --> 01:21:01,900
Oh, go on and reaches.

1408
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:09,200
And I need you all to roll a wisdom saving throw 14.

1409
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:10,600
I got a fort.

1410
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,000
I got it.

1411
01:21:11,000 --> 01:21:11,700
I got a 10.

1412
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:12,600
Mm-Hmm.

1413
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:13,900
That's not good.

1414
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,300
Oh, Colin is too wise.

1415
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:17,000
Yes.

1416
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:18,500
Okay.

1417
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,000
Yeah.

1418
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:26,300
So yeah, you all managed to save as this screech sort of reverberates

1419
01:21:26,300 --> 01:21:27,500
through Patrick Yoda.

1420
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,180
I guess you forget to put your hands over your ears, maybe.

1421
01:21:30,180 --> 01:21:32,260
My ears are too big.

1422
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,260
I'm a Yoda.

1423
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:35,940
Yeah, your hands are too little and you're too big.

1424
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:39,180
So you're going to take some damage and then you're going to be stunned.

1425
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:44,580
Yeah, it's a big problem these days.

1426
01:21:44,580 --> 01:21:50,680
Okay, yeah, you take seven damage and you are stunned for one round.

1427
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:58,120
you're not going to be able to move or a few other things. I want to make sure I get stunned

1428
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:02,080
in 5e right. It's a little different than paralyzed and it's a little different than the other

1429
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:09,960
ones. I don't get stunned so you don't have to look that up. No. That's easier. It's taking

1430
01:22:09,960 --> 01:22:14,400
way too long so we just shouldn't do that. It shouldn't happen. We just get the fight

1431
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,400
- It's too much. - It's a sun creature.

1432
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:17,900
- Yes, now. - A sun...

1433
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:21,200
You just let me finish. A sun creature is incapacitated.

1434
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:22,700
- Oh, it's another condition. - This is too much.

1435
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:25,800
But you can't move and you can speak only falteringly,

1436
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,100
automatically fail strength and dex rolls.

1437
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:30,400
- Right. - I can't move and I can't speak?

1438
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,100
- Yeah. - You can speak falteringly.

1439
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:36,300
- Yeah. - Moving and speaking.

1440
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:39,600
Hey, Patrick, speak falteringly if you're gay.

1441
01:22:39,600 --> 01:22:44,800
*weird noises*

1442
01:22:44,800 --> 01:22:45,800
That's what I thought.

1443
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,800
Love that interpretation of Falteringly.

1444
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:50,800
*laughter*

1445
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:55,200
You know, Falteringly, when you sound like a Galaxy Quest character.

1446
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:56,600
*laughter*

1447
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,800
Uh, okay, cool. So, that happens.

1448
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:00,800
*weird noises*

1449
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:04,200
I'm still trying to prove I'm not gay.

1450
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:06,200
*weird noises*

1451
01:23:06,200 --> 01:23:07,200
*weird noises*

1452
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,200
Yeah, you're doing a great job, buddy. Keep it up.

1453
01:23:09,200 --> 01:23:11,200
*laughing*

1454
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,200
*laughing*

1455
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:15,200
You're just breaking up in real life.

1456
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,200
Um, you are up now

1457
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,200
uh, uh, Colin.

1458
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:21,200
You wanna yell at me and my

1459
01:23:21,200 --> 01:23:23,200
friends? You wanna yell at

1460
01:23:23,200 --> 01:23:25,200
me and my friends?

1461
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:27,200
Oh, that makes me so mad!

1462
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:29,200
*laughing* Yeah, we just heard you.

1463
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,200
Colin, scream!

1464
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,200
Oh, yeah.

1465
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:35,200
Wee!

1466
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,200
Wee!

1467
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:41,000
OK, Colin uses shatter his version of shatter.

1468
01:23:41,000 --> 01:23:44,240
So which means he could basically choose

1469
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:46,160
where he wants this loud noise to be.

1470
01:23:46,160 --> 01:23:47,040
She's going to use it on her,

1471
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,520
so she has to roll against it.

1472
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,520
That's pretty good.

1473
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:52,120
What is her con?

1474
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:52,640
I don't think it's.

1475
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:54,840
I like that we all have like shit that we do

1476
01:23:54,840 --> 01:23:57,840
and then Colin has like moves with his name in them.

1477
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:01,240
He knows that he can do.

1478
01:24:01,240 --> 01:24:04,280
He practices it.

1479
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,620
along with Espanol.

1480
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:13,360
Oh wow, she got a high.

1481
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:14,360
She got a high save.

1482
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,960
She still takes half damage.

1483
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,960
She still takes half.

1484
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,760
Oh, God damn.

1485
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,000
Pretty good still.

1486
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,160
OK, he's so good at this,

1487
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:25,460
so he got a 23,

1488
01:24:25,460 --> 01:24:27,040
which is literally one less

1489
01:24:27,040 --> 01:24:28,740
than the Max he could have gotten.

1490
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:30,280
So that is going to.

1491
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:33,480
We're going to round that bad girl up to 12.

1492
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:36,720
So that's nuts.

1493
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:39,040
Okay, so she takes 12 damage.

1494
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,840
So you scream at her and you hear,

1495
01:24:40,840 --> 01:24:42,400
she puts her hands on her ears like,

1496
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:45,240
oh, this disgusting pig.

1497
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:46,400
Ah, and she's like,

1498
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:48,240
what did you say about our friend?

1499
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:50,480
(laughing)

1500
01:24:50,480 --> 01:24:57,240
And that gay one.

1501
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,480
(laughing)

1502
01:25:04,360 --> 01:25:10,800
So, uh, cool. Yeah. Great turd. Call it. Um, okay. It is now a blow toss. It's your, your

1503
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:16,320
up man. Yeah. Um, I'm going to, I'm going to go for it with my slingshot. I'm going

1504
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:24,000
to shoot at her with my slingshot. I have a scope on my slingshot. That's an 18. Yeah.

1505
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:29,520
That fucking hits brother. Okay. Five damage. Nice. Yeah. You just shoot that and you just

1506
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:33,560
like get her right as she's like holding her head and screaming and moving about. You managed

1507
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:45,060
like

1508
01:25:45,060 --> 01:25:54,540
another. I'm doing a slingshot again. Do it. This is 17. Yeah, it's 6 damage. Nice. Yeah.

1509
01:25:54,540 --> 01:25:59,940
Oh man, you just get it in the same spot. Dig that in deeper, making her forehead weirder.

1510
01:25:59,940 --> 01:26:06,860
Okay, cool. Yeah, she is not looking good. You guys did some serious damage this round.

1511
01:26:06,860 --> 01:26:14,420
So we're back to the top of the order and you are up Mr. Johnson. All right, I turn

1512
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:19,780
the matrix beam around so that it's facing towards her this time and then I use it again

1513
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:25,220
and aimed directly at her forehead. Hold on though because matrix beam costs

1514
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:33,380
seven technoslime points. No. So you're at, I technically missed it last time so you really

1515
01:26:33,380 --> 01:26:38,180
should be at zero but you're at three technoslime points right now. And I go up and I punch her in

1516
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:53,180
in

1517
01:26:53,180 --> 01:26:57,500
I think. Yeah. Oh, okay. I'll add that one d6 to this attack.

1518
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:01,500
Yeah, go for it. This thing's dog **** Alright, let's see.

1519
01:27:01,500 --> 01:27:04,700
And it continues to be dog **** Yeah. Eleven. That eleven.

1520
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,500
Yeah, you run up to her with the dong blade and you try to

1521
01:27:07,500 --> 01:27:10,700
swing it at her and she waves her hand and one of the guys

1522
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:13,100
just goes, no, he just jumps in front of it and takes the

1523
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:17,260
blow. Um uh yeah, I'm still like I'm smiling because I

1524
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:18,260
killed someone.

1525
01:27:18,260 --> 01:27:19,260
Job well done.

1526
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,260
Cool, cool.

1527
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:25,320
Alright, you are up, Patrick Yoda.

1528
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:31,260
You can't take any actions or anything this round.

1529
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:34,140
So you're just sort of incapacitated and just faltering.

1530
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:40,380
We could just sort of...

1531
01:27:40,380 --> 01:27:46,500
It is now her turn.

1532
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:54,240
going to point her her finger at you Ray William Johnson and I need you to roll a

1533
01:27:54,240 --> 01:28:04,380
charisma saving throw. Seven. She says to you you're a big strong man aren't you?

1534
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,380
I'm a kid.

1535
01:28:06,380 --> 01:28:08,380
[Laughter]

1536
01:28:08,380 --> 01:28:10,380
Shut up, shut up.

1537
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,380
It's the spell.

1538
01:28:12,380 --> 01:28:14,380
You're instantly charmed by her.

1539
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:16,380
And so,

1540
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,380
you will not attack her.

1541
01:28:18,380 --> 01:28:20,380
And you will

1542
01:28:20,380 --> 01:28:22,380
actually follow her command

1543
01:28:22,380 --> 01:28:24,380
when she says to you

1544
01:28:24,380 --> 01:28:26,380
to go

1545
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:28,380
get me that piggy.

1546
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,380
And you go run up and attack

1547
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:32,380
the pig. It's just basically what you

1548
01:28:32,380 --> 01:28:35,380
you are now except you're listening to her.

1549
01:28:35,380 --> 01:28:40,380
Um, yeah, I'm gonna attack Colin or I have to get him.

1550
01:28:40,380 --> 01:28:42,380
Oh, you're gonna you're gonna grapple him.

1551
01:28:42,380 --> 01:28:43,380
Yeah, you're gonna try to grab.

1552
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:47,380
Okay, so roll guys do a strength contest against one another.

1553
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:48,380
Okay.

1554
01:28:48,380 --> 01:28:54,380
Hey, Colin, get over here you big son of a bitch.

1555
01:28:54,380 --> 01:28:57,380
I've been hitting the gym lately.

1556
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,380
Yeah.

1557
01:28:58,380 --> 01:29:01,380
Oh, he's so sneakily strong.

1558
01:29:01,380 --> 01:29:06,300
Colin, you're just able to like bat him away and crawl through his legs.

1559
01:29:06,300 --> 01:29:09,620
I was also like, I'm a little bit oiled up from a sheen of sweat.

1560
01:29:09,620 --> 01:29:11,620
*laughter*

1561
01:29:11,620 --> 01:29:12,620
You're just a cute little piggy.

1562
01:29:12,620 --> 01:29:14,620
Yeah, I squirm out.

1563
01:29:14,620 --> 01:29:16,620
Aw yeah, so cute.

1564
01:29:16,620 --> 01:29:18,620
Okay, yeah.

1565
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:20,620
Nothing cuter than an oily pig.

1566
01:29:20,620 --> 01:29:22,620
Yeah, I don't know if that's cute. I'm like covered in oily sweat right now.

1567
01:29:22,620 --> 01:29:24,620
Just squirming around.

1568
01:29:24,620 --> 01:29:26,620
I like little pigs.

1569
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:28,620
Oh, Jesus Christ.

1570
01:29:28,620 --> 01:29:30,620
Whatever, man.

1571
01:29:30,620 --> 01:29:34,260
next turn. Yeah, you'll be trying for the rest of the round just for this round. So next

1572
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:39,620
turn you'll still yeah. And so that's what she does. And now we're back to the we're

1573
01:29:39,620 --> 01:29:44,660
back into your guys's turn. It's Colin you're up.

1574
01:29:44,660 --> 01:29:49,940
I'm going to try to you to think hard about what her voice sounds like. And in my own

1575
01:29:49,940 --> 01:29:54,620
piggy brain, try to like age that voice a little bit to try to sound like a mother and

1576
01:29:54,620 --> 01:30:01,020
Use minor illusion to be like those crows feet will get deep and you'll be ugly with your weird

1577
01:30:01,020 --> 01:30:06,460
Forehead and look at what you've done you actually that's colin's ways. Look at what you've done

1578
01:30:06,460 --> 01:30:14,780
Oh, you got your weird forehead even weirder and now none of the producers are going to want to kiss you for a role

1579
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,180
Oh

1580
01:30:17,180 --> 01:30:20,300
Darling, look at what you've done to yourself. So ugly

1581
01:30:20,300 --> 01:30:24,140
Okay. Yeah, uh, I guess you'll roll against that. Um

1582
01:30:24,140 --> 01:30:39,220
the

1583
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:43,300
is what that was is an investigation check against the Spellsave DC.

1584
01:30:43,300 --> 01:30:44,300
Okay cool.

1585
01:30:44,300 --> 01:30:45,300
Which is 13.

1586
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:48,100
Okay, so let's see how she does on that.

1587
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:52,020
Her investigation is not anything special.

1588
01:30:52,020 --> 01:30:57,540
Oh yeah, she beats it and she says "My mother doesn't talk to me anymore!"

1589
01:30:57,540 --> 01:31:09,100
Okay, then I'm gonna gasp and as a bonus action, turn to I guess, Blowtoss, and say "Remember

1590
01:31:09,100 --> 01:31:12,700
Remember that time at Sarah's house party when you were afraid to ask Rebecca to the future

1591
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:17,020
style dance and then you did and she said no but you took it like a champ?

1592
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:18,020
You are brave.

1593
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:19,020
So remember that.

1594
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:20,020
Um, so, uh, I'm ironically inspired.

1595
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:21,020
Yeah, you're inspired.

1596
01:31:21,020 --> 01:31:22,020
You got these six years and you're up.

1597
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,020
Um, yeah, I'm so inspired.

1598
01:31:23,020 --> 01:31:24,020
I'm so inspired.

1599
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,020
I'm thinking of the girl, this girl who rejected me.

1600
01:31:25,020 --> 01:31:26,020
I'm looking down the scope of my weapon at a time when I'm not.

1601
01:31:26,020 --> 01:31:27,020
I'm like, I'm so inspired.

1602
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:28,020
I'm so inspired.

1603
01:31:28,020 --> 01:31:29,020
I'm thinking of the girl, this girl who rejected me.

1604
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,020
I'm looking down the scope of my weapon at a time when I'm not.

1605
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:31,020
I'm like, I'm so inspired.

1606
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:32,020
I'm so inspired.

1607
01:31:32,020 --> 01:31:36,340
I'm so inspired, I'm thinking of this girl who rejected me, I'm looking down the scope

1608
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:38,780
of my weapon at a new woman.

1609
01:31:38,780 --> 01:31:48,900
I take aim and fire my slingshot at the same spot again.

1610
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:49,900
That's a 19.

1611
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:50,900
That's 7 damage.

1612
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:55,780
Let me see her, where's her health at?

1613
01:31:55,780 --> 01:31:56,780
Oh it's not good.

1614
01:31:56,780 --> 01:31:58,180
Okay yeah, she's looking pretty bad.

1615
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:01,140
I'm just doing it immediately, just doing it again.

1616
01:32:01,140 --> 01:32:03,140
Yeah, I'm, yeah, I'm...

1617
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:05,140
*laughter*

1618
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:07,140
That's a crit.

1619
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:09,140
I mean, you're gonna have to describe your kill and

1620
01:32:09,140 --> 01:32:11,140
whatever else you want to describe,

1621
01:32:11,140 --> 01:32:13,140
I'm absolving myself.

1622
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:15,140
*laughter*

1623
01:32:15,140 --> 01:32:17,140
Um, I, yeah, I just start, I just

1624
01:32:17,140 --> 01:32:19,140
start rapid firing the slingshot,

1625
01:32:19,140 --> 01:32:21,140
just like pulling it, but like, like shooting it like a

1626
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:23,140
machine, at a machine gun rate.

1627
01:32:23,140 --> 01:32:25,140
Um, and then, yeah,

1628
01:32:25,140 --> 01:32:27,140
and then I see the, I see the pencil

1629
01:32:27,140 --> 01:32:31,060
that that um Ray William Johnson dropped on the ground earlier and I'm like

1630
01:32:31,060 --> 01:32:35,300
that's it and I pick up the pencil and I launched it out of the slingshot it's

1631
01:32:35,300 --> 01:32:40,140
the final shot and it goes right through her damn heart oh and guess what she's

1632
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:48,340
heartbroken now yeah she's like oh no oh she's very dramatically dying just like

1633
01:32:48,340 --> 01:32:53,860
yeah like and you watch as she she falls to the ground dead her hair splayed out

1634
01:32:53,860 --> 01:32:58,860
out and she's like looking very like pristine and and and

1635
01:32:58,860 --> 01:33:01,560
then you watch all the guys around her who were just like

1636
01:33:01,560 --> 01:33:04,660
like there's some of them were still like some of them were

1637
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:06,460
still in the shape of a wheel because they look like a

1638
01:33:06,460 --> 01:33:09,560
carriage earlier and they just like sort of like fall like

1639
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:12,260
what am I what's going on here?

1640
01:33:12,260 --> 01:33:15,560
Damn, she's dead.

1641
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:18,060
Yeah.

1642
01:33:18,060 --> 01:33:19,560
Yeah, you guys get her.

1643
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,960
Thank you so much calling for inspiring me.

1644
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:25,080
You stirred some deep-seated emotions within me,

1645
01:33:25,080 --> 01:33:27,240
and I think I better understand the reasons

1646
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:29,000
I want to join the army now.

1647
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,320
(laughing)

1648
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,720
- I'm happy that I could be of help.

1649
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:35,560
Just dry those eyes and let's keep on truckin'.

1650
01:33:35,560 --> 01:33:36,480
- That's right.

1651
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:41,140
- So you guys defeated one of the second lieutenant.

1652
01:33:41,140 --> 01:33:43,920
Now there's one other.

1653
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:44,960
- Am I fine now?

1654
01:33:44,960 --> 01:33:46,120
- Another guy, yeah.

1655
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:48,920
Oh, you're stunned for the rest of the day.

1656
01:33:48,920 --> 01:33:49,760
Yeah, you're fine now.

1657
01:33:49,760 --> 01:33:51,080
(imitating gunfire)

1658
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:53,080
I'M NOT FUCKING GAY!

1659
01:33:53,080 --> 01:33:55,080
*laughter*

1660
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:57,080
A little late on that one.

1661
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:59,080
Yeah, all these people who are just no longer possessed are like

1662
01:33:59,080 --> 01:34:01,080
"alright, alright"

1663
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:04,080
They're just like clocking that and just trying to ignore it.

1664
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,080
Um, do you wanna do...

1665
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,080
BUT I WAS STUNNED!

1666
01:34:07,080 --> 01:34:09,080
SHE HAD A- SHE USED POWERS AND SHIT!

1667
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:11,080
I- GOD DAMMIT! THIS SUCKS!

1668
01:34:11,080 --> 01:34:15,080
I'm saying like everything that I was saying.

1669
01:34:15,080 --> 01:34:17,080
I've just been repeating myself on and on.

1670
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,080
*laughter*

1671
01:34:19,080 --> 01:34:22,080
I just want to reiterate, I love you guys so much.

1672
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,080
I love Colin!

1673
01:34:23,080 --> 01:34:26,080
I can't stop screaming right now, I'm so mad!

1674
01:34:26,080 --> 01:34:30,580
You're pretty much our best friend in the entire world, and I know we're gonna-

1675
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:34,580
After this is over, we're gonna have probably thousands of adventures together.

1676
01:34:34,580 --> 01:34:39,080
It's gonna be the four of us together forever, going on missions and adventures.

1677
01:34:39,080 --> 01:34:40,080
I- I clap.

1678
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:48,580
Before we go to the next lieutenant, I wanna- I wanna smoke some damn techno slime in the school auditorium.

1679
01:34:48,580 --> 01:34:50,580
I can't lie. Yes, brother.

1680
01:34:50,580 --> 01:34:52,180
I'll light up. Fuck.

1681
01:34:52,180 --> 01:34:55,260
Wait, I got a question about these.

1682
01:34:55,260 --> 01:34:57,220
Since I'm doing spell slots

1683
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:00,100
and I have something called techno slime refills, am I able to?

1684
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:05,060
Yeah. If you Colin can only will smoke techno slime if he wants to.

1685
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:07,980
I don't want Colin. Colin can do whatever he wants with.

1686
01:35:07,980 --> 01:35:10,660
Does it? Will I get spell slots back?

1687
01:35:10,660 --> 01:35:13,300
Is that? Yeah, I think let's do that that way.

1688
01:35:13,300 --> 01:35:15,900
I think Colin is just absolved from the addiction system.

1689
01:35:15,900 --> 01:35:18,380
Yeah, I think that Colin is like Colin.

1690
01:35:18,380 --> 01:35:21,820
Yeah, Colin exists in like a different magic system

1691
01:35:21,820 --> 01:35:23,380
that every other character in the game.

1692
01:35:23,380 --> 01:35:26,740
He's the only person in the entire universe who has spell slots.

1693
01:35:26,740 --> 01:35:28,580
He's the only one.

1694
01:35:28,580 --> 01:35:30,220
Magic is real.

1695
01:35:30,220 --> 01:35:31,580
[LAUGHTER]

1696
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,660
Sure it is, Colin.

1697
01:35:33,660 --> 01:35:34,580
Magic is real.

1698
01:35:34,580 --> 01:35:36,700
I've seen the face of the old ones.

1699
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:39,420
All right, sweetie pie.

1700
01:35:39,420 --> 01:35:42,220
Man, I'll have what he's smoking.

1701
01:35:42,220 --> 01:35:44,460
How many spell slots do I get back?

1702
01:35:44,460 --> 01:35:46,060
I would say you get once.

1703
01:35:46,060 --> 01:35:49,180
Well, let's say two slots per techno slime.

1704
01:35:49,180 --> 01:35:52,900
So one level two or oh shit.

1705
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:56,100
One level two or or one like or yeah,

1706
01:35:56,100 --> 01:36:01,340
or like two level ones and that's for each techno slime refill.

1707
01:36:01,340 --> 01:36:04,180
Yeah, that's not much probably.

1708
01:36:04,180 --> 01:36:05,100
Yeah, five.

1709
01:36:05,100 --> 01:36:08,300
Yeah, let's just do like.

1710
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:10,460
Maybe just one slot per one.

1711
01:36:10,460 --> 01:36:11,940
I think that's OK, cool.

1712
01:36:11,940 --> 01:36:14,880
And then would you be okay with me finding a way

1713
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:19,400
to use TechnoSlime to rejuvenate Bardic Inspiration at all?

1714
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,700
- Yeah, I think that's totally fair to do that.

1715
01:36:21,700 --> 01:36:25,060
We can just do that one for one as well.

1716
01:36:25,060 --> 01:36:27,580
Just like maintain it that way.

1717
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,680
- Yeah, I'm gonna pull out, instead of TechnoSlime,

1718
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:32,940
Colin's just gonna pull out a very old looking book

1719
01:36:32,940 --> 01:36:35,780
and like his eyes are going to go a little bit blank

1720
01:36:35,780 --> 01:36:37,820
as he stares at it.

1721
01:36:37,820 --> 01:36:39,020
And if you guys look at it,

1722
01:36:39,020 --> 01:36:41,140
there's just no writing on the pages.

1723
01:36:41,140 --> 01:36:47,540
*laughter*

1724
01:36:47,540 --> 01:36:49,940
Go Khaled! Go Khaled!

1725
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:53,540
My father gave this to me, and my father's father gave it to him!

1726
01:36:53,540 --> 01:36:56,540
*laughter*

1727
01:36:56,540 --> 01:36:59,040
Okay!

1728
01:36:59,040 --> 01:37:04,040
My father cryogenically froze me from Whoville! Either that or he's me!

1729
01:37:04,040 --> 01:37:06,040
I'm not- I'm not sure!

1730
01:37:06,040 --> 01:37:09,540
*laughter*

1731
01:37:09,540 --> 01:37:10,700
Um, okay, cool.

1732
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:13,180
How many techno slime points do we recover from a refill?

1733
01:37:13,180 --> 01:37:13,740
Is that full?

1734
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:15,740
No, you get five, five.

1735
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:16,740
Oh, perfect one.

1736
01:37:16,740 --> 01:37:17,620
So you got to get them out.

1737
01:37:17,620 --> 01:37:20,160
So do I, do I smoke it too?

1738
01:37:20,160 --> 01:37:21,420
Yeah.

1739
01:37:21,420 --> 01:37:21,620
Yeah.

1740
01:37:21,620 --> 01:37:23,780
I mean, techno slime is a drug you can take anyway.

1741
01:37:23,780 --> 01:37:24,620
Okay.

1742
01:37:24,620 --> 01:37:26,500
Then I guess 10.

1743
01:37:26,500 --> 01:37:27,180
Techno.

1744
01:37:27,180 --> 01:37:27,420
Yeah.

1745
01:37:27,420 --> 01:37:28,780
You can take a shit too.

1746
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:30,020
My shit.

1747
01:37:30,020 --> 01:37:30,780
Yeah.

1748
01:37:30,780 --> 01:37:34,820
And so when you do, as we all know, you got to roll the constitution

1749
01:37:34,820 --> 01:37:38,180
saving throw, which just, it's just going to be against a DC of 11

1750
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:39,680
plus your proficiency bonus.

1751
01:37:39,680 --> 01:37:43,080
So 13 to see if you suffer from addiction.

1752
01:37:43,080 --> 01:37:44,380
Okay, I got one.

1753
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:45,480
You're going to roll a wisdom save.

1754
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:48,180
Okay, I think we all well.

1755
01:37:48,180 --> 01:37:48,980
Uh-oh.

1756
01:37:48,980 --> 01:37:50,380
Uh-oh.

1757
01:37:50,380 --> 01:37:51,680
Okay, all lost.

1758
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:55,080
Yeah, older than time older than time as yellow as the aged

1759
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,180
pages of this book.

1760
01:37:56,180 --> 01:37:59,280
Mountain escaping as far as the eye can see.

1761
01:37:59,280 --> 01:38:05,380
So you only get three points back and you have disadvantage

1762
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,480
on Dex rolls of any kind.

1763
01:38:07,480 --> 01:38:09,840
So, uh, like saving throws,

1764
01:38:09,840 --> 01:38:13,400
dexterity checks for the next in game 10 minutes.

1765
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,880
So it's not too bad.

1766
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:16,040
That's just the first level.

1767
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:20,880
Um, so yeah, you're just kind of fiending a little bit, um, scratching maybe.

1768
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:24,440
Um, but that's, it gets normal for the children in this universe.

1769
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,120
Um, okay.

1770
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,100
I, I, I didn't really get what I wanted out of that.

1771
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:30,800
So I'm like, fuck it.

1772
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:31,720
Let's hit it again.

1773
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,600
I'll rip it again, dude.

1774
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:34,200
All right.

1775
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:35,720
Roll another constitution saving throw.

1776
01:38:35,720 --> 01:38:37,280
There's no way this one will go bad.

1777
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:41,360
Oh, it didn't. Okay, great. So you just just have the first

1778
01:38:41,360 --> 01:38:45,440
uh failure effect still and I get five for that one and

1779
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:48,720
you'll get five for that one. Yeah, you get the full five.

1780
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:53,200
**** that beer **** That **** too hard, man.

1781
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:56,480
Cool. Yeah. So you guys are just sort of lighting up in the

1782
01:38:56,480 --> 01:39:02,880
auditorium. Um it's the dead vampire on the ground um and

1783
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:06,240
Yeah, so you can try to find the next lieutenant.

1784
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:11,340
Can I can I roll investigation to see if I can find anything cool

1785
01:39:11,340 --> 01:39:12,800
on the corpse of a vampire?

1786
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:14,640
Oh yeah, me too.

1787
01:39:14,640 --> 01:39:16,480
Me too.

1788
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,400
We're all going to do it.

1789
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,980
We'll just have one.

1790
01:39:19,980 --> 01:39:22,240
We should all probably investigate her body.

1791
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,740
Of one check that 16.

1792
01:39:25,740 --> 01:39:26,700
Yeah. All right.

1793
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:28,140
Cool. That's 16.

1794
01:39:28,140 --> 01:39:29,640
That's pretty good.

1795
01:39:29,640 --> 01:39:34,200
Before we reveal what he got from her,

1796
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,760
Ray William Johnson, what's a crit

1797
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,240
wanted being a female body investigator?

1798
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:42,040
A dead female body investigator.

1799
01:39:42,040 --> 01:39:44,880
Yeah, I closed my eyes and I'm like,

1800
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,520
I'm like rubbing the like her like heels.

1801
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,640
I'm like, these boobs are humongous.

1802
01:39:50,640 --> 01:39:53,400
Oh my God, she's so hot.

1803
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:55,200
Even then she's dead.

1804
01:39:55,200 --> 01:39:58,800
Oh fuck, I'm gonna bust dude.

1805
01:39:58,800 --> 01:40:05,800
And then I opened my eyes, I'm like, I'll stay doing this.

1806
01:40:05,800 --> 01:40:11,800
I'd like to close her eyelids and then whisper something that no one else can hear into her

1807
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:12,800
ear.

1808
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:13,800
Yeah, you do that.

1809
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,800
You do that.

1810
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:22,440
And yeah, Colin, with that 16 you find a pendant that was on her neck, you know that you're

1811
01:40:22,440 --> 01:40:27,320
able to sort of like, look at and sort of get the sense that there's something a little

1812
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:29,640
bit more special about it than just being a pendant.

1813
01:40:29,640 --> 01:40:33,960
Wow, Colin, you should hold on to that and you could pass that down to your

1814
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:37,400
children and they could pass it down to their children's children and they could

1815
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:41,880
all pass it down through your very long family line. It's extremely prosperous.

1816
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:46,840
The Colin name will live on forever. Exactly, I'm an only child so it really drives my penis up.

1817
01:40:46,840 --> 01:40:53,320
And after your parents of course, you know, your father got his

1818
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:57,200
vasectomy and your mother's sort of at that age now so it really is just

1819
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:00,720
you. They didn't need any other kids. You were perfect. A

1820
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:07,360
culmination of eons. I'm just thinking about how all your

1821
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:11,120
your hundreds of ancestors way back thousands of years how they

1822
01:41:11,120 --> 01:41:15,040
all came together to create you and it's just so beautiful. I

1823
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:20,640
smile and not go many into one. I'm a little bit weird now

1824
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,840
after the thing with the book.

1825
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:38,760
the

1826
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:50,740
sure. Okay. 12. Yeah, I mean, he has like civilian clothes on. I put on his shirt. Gross. It's

1827
01:41:50,740 --> 01:41:57,320
like bloodstained, but go on. I put it on and then I realize how bloody it is. It's

1828
01:41:57,320 --> 01:42:03,080
also big on you. Yeah. He's like a full-size human. And I take off the shirt. I was like,

1829
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:06,520
I thought that shit was gonna look tight, but it didn't.

1830
01:42:06,520 --> 01:42:07,020
*laughter*

1831
01:42:07,020 --> 01:42:12,880
Patrick Yoda, you have all kinds of bling. Do you want to wear this cool pendant that I found?

1832
01:42:12,880 --> 01:42:16,480
Oh my god, Colin, thank you so much!

1833
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,840
This will look great with the rest of your bling!

1834
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:24,280
Oh man, and it's a perfect 26 inch chain on me 'cause I'm so small!

1835
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:25,320
*laughter*

1836
01:42:25,320 --> 01:42:27,880
Yeah, exactly, here you go!

1837
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,280
Oh!

1838
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:30,480
Yeah, Patrick Yoda.

1839
01:42:30,480 --> 01:42:31,560
This is the best day ever!

1840
01:42:31,560 --> 01:42:35,560
As you put the pendant on, it starts to glow a little bit.

1841
01:42:35,560 --> 01:42:40,680
And you hear, you hear, um, uh, Madam Boobs.

1842
01:42:40,680 --> 01:42:41,480
Madam Boobs.

1843
01:42:41,480 --> 01:42:43,720
Come in, Madam Boobs.

1844
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:47,000
This is, this is, this is Klaus.

1845
01:42:47,000 --> 01:42:48,200
This is Klaus Kloekske.

1846
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:50,360
I'm in the basement.

1847
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:51,720
How's the auditorium going?

1848
01:42:51,720 --> 01:42:52,040
Over.

1849
01:42:52,040 --> 01:42:53,640
Hey.

1850
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,720
Hey, baby.

1851
01:42:55,720 --> 01:42:59,000
Hey, girlfriend.

1852
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,000
*everyone saying hi*

1853
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:03,000
*everyone saying hi*

1854
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:05,000
*everyone saying hi*

1855
01:43:05,000 --> 01:43:07,000
*everyone saying hi*

1856
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:09,000
*everyone saying hi*

1857
01:43:09,000 --> 01:43:11,000
*everyone saying hi*

1858
01:43:11,000 --> 01:43:13,000
*everyone saying hi*

1859
01:43:13,000 --> 01:43:15,000
*everyone saying hi*

1860
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:17,000
*everyone saying hi*

1861
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:19,000
*everyone saying hi*

1862
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,000
*everyone saying hi*

1863
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:23,000
*everyone saying hi*

1864
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:25,000
*everyone saying hi*

1865
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,000
*everyone saying hi*

1866
01:43:27,000 --> 01:43:29,000
I think we did it.

1867
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:31,000
Hey! Hey!

1868
01:43:31,000 --> 01:43:33,000
Perfect display.

1869
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,000
I don't realize that it turned off and I'm still just doing the "Hey".

1870
01:43:35,000 --> 01:43:37,000
Hey!

1871
01:43:37,000 --> 01:43:41,000
I will cherish these memories for the rest of my life.

1872
01:43:41,000 --> 01:43:44,000
So yeah, you guys can go to the basement.

1873
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:48,000
Now imagine Patrick Yoda, if you're friends with the janitor, he can actually show you how to get there.

1874
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:50,000
Yeah. Do I still have his keys?

1875
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Yeah, you have his fucking keys.

1876
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:55,000
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

1877
01:43:55,000 --> 01:44:00,360
So yeah, you guys walked down the hallway and you find sort of the door to one of the sort

1878
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:01,360
of where you would go.

1879
01:44:01,360 --> 01:44:03,800
I say, "Hold on.

1880
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:06,100
Let me just check something real quick."

1881
01:44:06,100 --> 01:44:10,000
And I open up the janitor's closet and he's dead inside.

1882
01:44:10,000 --> 01:44:15,000
He's dead inside not because of a vampire, but because he hung himself.

1883
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:17,000
Oh, shit!

1884
01:44:17,000 --> 01:44:18,000
No!

1885
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:19,000
No!

1886
01:44:19,000 --> 01:44:25,000
Man, I told him if he was gonna jack off like this, he had to tell me!

1887
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:30,800
Shit, man, this is worse than any death that happened on this school today.

1888
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:36,880
You have such a special relationship with that adult.

1889
01:44:36,880 --> 01:44:38,360
I wish I could have one of those one day.

1890
01:44:38,360 --> 01:44:39,360
I probably will.

1891
01:44:39,360 --> 01:44:43,360
Man, I wish you could have met him, Colin.

1892
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:45,240
You probably, honestly, you actually probably did.

1893
01:44:45,240 --> 01:44:47,240
We both go to the same school together.

1894
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:51,240
Yeah, I was sort of friends with him too, but not as much as you.

1895
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,240
Oh man.

1896
01:44:53,240 --> 01:44:55,240
He helped me with my espanol.

1897
01:44:55,240 --> 01:45:03,240
I'm gonna miss this fricking old piece of shit so much.

1898
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:08,240
I think I need to investigate his body.

1899
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:12,240
Yeah, you can do that.

1900
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:15,640
Okay, I roll an investigation check.

1901
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:16,640
20.

1902
01:45:16,640 --> 01:45:18,360
Yeah, hell yeah, dude.

1903
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:21,440
You find a letter he wrote.

1904
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,440
It's entirely in Spanish.

1905
01:45:22,440 --> 01:45:23,440
You see a lot of...

1906
01:45:23,440 --> 01:45:24,440
Yo, Colin, I need you to read this for me real quick.

1907
01:45:24,440 --> 01:45:28,960
This one's in cursive.

1908
01:45:28,960 --> 01:45:29,960
Somebody take this.

1909
01:45:29,960 --> 01:45:36,600
Yeah, it's a lot of Te Amo and things of that nature.

1910
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:39,200
It's clearly a goodbye letter to somebody.

1911
01:45:39,200 --> 01:45:41,200
Why does he keep saying my name is?

1912
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:47,140
Wait, oh my god, I read this mentioning I'm like, oh my god. He was secretly a vampire

1913
01:45:47,140 --> 01:45:56,400
I'm learning star and s so I still don't I don't exactly know what this means, but i'm still learning

1914
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,960
Yeah, um, yeah. Yeah

1915
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,520
and him, uh, um

1916
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:04,640
Whoa

1917
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:33,640
I

1918
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:41,240
is the tallest closet of all time. He used to shoot me how to smoke cigarettes in here

1919
01:46:41,240 --> 01:46:50,840
and throw rope over that pipe. And he used to tell me everyday if I was going to kill

1920
01:46:50,840 --> 01:46:57,680
myself it would be here on a day of the vampires attack. Man I just don't know why he did this.

1921
01:46:57,680 --> 01:46:59,680
Does he have any cigarettes around?

1922
01:46:59,680 --> 01:47:01,680
Yeah, there's some cigarettes.

1923
01:47:01,680 --> 01:47:03,680
Yeah, he's got a lot.

1924
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:05,680
I want to try one.

1925
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:07,680
Yeah, for sure, you can go for it.

1926
01:47:07,680 --> 01:47:09,680
Do you guys have a light?

1927
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:11,680
I have fire abilities.

1928
01:47:11,680 --> 01:47:13,680
He has a light, come on. Yeah, he's got a light on him.

1929
01:47:13,680 --> 01:47:15,680
You take his light, you want to try one, Colin?

1930
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:17,680
Yeah, I have a lot of time

1931
01:47:17,680 --> 01:47:19,680
to learn about the consequences

1932
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,680
of my actions. Now is really the time to make mistakes.

1933
01:47:21,680 --> 01:47:23,680
Yeah, go for it, Colin.

1934
01:47:23,680 --> 01:47:25,680
You smoke a cigarette.

1935
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:26,680
cigarette.

1936
01:47:26,680 --> 01:47:27,680
Nah man, you inhaled.

1937
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,680
You're not supposed to inhale cigarettes.

1938
01:47:28,680 --> 01:47:29,680
Carla, you might, you might, be careful, you might develop lung cancer later in life.

1939
01:47:29,680 --> 01:47:30,680
Please.

1940
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:31,680
Yeah, now you can really take some years off your life way far down the line.

1941
01:47:31,680 --> 01:47:32,680
Yeah, I think that I'll, I've learned from this and going forward for my long life of

1942
01:47:32,680 --> 01:47:33,680
healthy, healthy living so that I can live long and enjoy my family and my kids.

1943
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:34,680
I, uh, I think that I've learned a lot from this.

1944
01:47:34,680 --> 01:47:35,680
I think that I've learned a lot from this.

1945
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:36,680
I think that I've learned a lot from this.

1946
01:47:36,680 --> 01:47:37,680
I think that I've learned a lot from this.

1947
01:47:37,680 --> 01:47:38,680
I think that I've learned a lot from this.

1948
01:47:38,680 --> 01:47:39,680
I think that I've learned a lot from this.

1949
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:40,680
I think that I've learned a lot from this.

1950
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:41,680
Please.

1951
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:46,160
Yeah, now you can really take some years off your life way far down the line.

1952
01:47:46,160 --> 01:47:51,560
Yeah, I think that I've learned from this and going forward for my long life of healthy

1953
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,760
living so that I can live long and enjoy my family and my kids.

1954
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:58,560
I think that I'm not going to do this anymore, so I put it out.

1955
01:47:58,560 --> 01:47:59,560
Wait, no, no, put it out.

1956
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:00,560
Give it to me.

1957
01:48:00,560 --> 01:48:04,200
Okay, I blow on it a little bit to re-spark it.

1958
01:48:04,200 --> 01:48:05,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1959
01:48:05,200 --> 01:48:06,200
I hand it to...

1960
01:48:06,200 --> 01:48:07,760
How do you know how to do that, Colin?

1961
01:48:07,760 --> 01:48:10,520
I thought that was your first cigarette.

1962
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,520
My uncle's kind of weird.

1963
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:38,520
So yeah, you guys, I guess, see this dead body and then you walk towards a you go down a few a couple of flights of stairs. You find the basement, the door to the basement so you can have the keys you can go in and you see that like it seems like it's just you know basement has like a generator has, you know, a couple other sort of a classic sort of accoutrements and basements of schools.

1964
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:44,520
and beyond see like a vampire anywhere or like anything like that.

1965
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,720
And this is as low as the school goes.

1966
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,020
You're pretty sure wait guys.

1967
01:48:49,020 --> 01:48:52,020
I see ancient Spanish hieroglyphics on this door.

1968
01:48:52,020 --> 01:48:55,620
What does it say as for 10 see ya?

1969
01:48:55,620 --> 01:48:58,220
Oh, that means warning.

1970
01:48:58,220 --> 01:49:05,620
Yes, there is a more of it says warning on it and you can try to use

1971
01:49:05,620 --> 01:49:13,720
one of your keys there, Patrick Yoda. Yeah, there's 50 keys on this ring. Okay. You try

1972
01:49:13,720 --> 01:49:20,740
all of them and roll 50 d20s. Yeah, none of them seem to work on this door. There might

1973
01:49:20,740 --> 01:49:26,320
be another way to get in it though. Don't worry, guys, I learned about this in the army

1974
01:49:26,320 --> 01:49:33,620
and I run into the door head first. Okay. You do? Yeah, you do. You bang on the door

1975
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:40,820
And you hear it sort of reverberate around you and you hear sort of like that behind it, it's a lot

1976
01:49:40,820 --> 01:49:44,580
bigger, whatever's going on behind there. You sort of get this sense that there's sort of a much

1977
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:48,260
larger room behind there. And as you sort of get the sense of also where you are and everything

1978
01:49:48,260 --> 01:49:53,780
gets around, you see like little, there's obviously like tons of like little hideaways and little

1979
01:49:53,780 --> 01:49:57,460
vents, little corners. You guys could probably start figuring out sort of another way to get

1980
01:49:57,460 --> 01:50:04,060
get through that door or at least like another way to get into that door.

1981
01:50:04,060 --> 01:50:06,940
I'd recommend just start snooping around.

1982
01:50:06,940 --> 01:50:08,940
I start snooping around.

1983
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:09,940
Me too.

1984
01:50:09,940 --> 01:50:10,940
Okay, cool.

1985
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:17,940
Can I go with the 50d20 roll instead of the 11 that I got?

1986
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:19,300
I got a 25 in this.

1987
01:50:19,300 --> 01:50:20,980
I got a 9.

1988
01:50:20,980 --> 01:50:21,980
I got 11.

1989
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:31,660
Ray, you sort of look around you and you sort of are still kind of tripping a little bit on beer,

1990
01:50:31,660 --> 01:50:36,700
and it gives you sort of a clarity in terms of the environment around you. And you see like a

1991
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:41,020
little vent and you see like two pairs of eyes poking out of it. And when you see them and they

1992
01:50:41,020 --> 01:50:46,460
see you, it just poofs away or runs away. I don't see anything. That was weird.

1993
01:50:48,220 --> 01:50:55,180
What was weird? I think I've come to a realization in my beer trip. I think that we are all one

1994
01:50:55,180 --> 01:51:03,340
one beer. Evangelion moment over here. And also there's some eyes in that door.

1995
01:51:03,340 --> 01:51:09,580
Yeah, you see the van, you see the eyes pop out again. And you see like, I immediately fucking

1996
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:17,700
three stooges of and you realize it's it's a little Michael the crawler who's

1997
01:51:17,700 --> 01:51:27,740
crawled into the vents hey Michael you need to buy some oh no I'm good right

1998
01:51:27,740 --> 01:51:32,580
now man okay what are you guys doing down here what's going on do you know

1999
01:51:32,580 --> 01:51:36,020
what's going on no I've been in the vents all day it's where I'm always at

2000
01:51:36,020 --> 01:51:42,000
Oh shit, man. There's a bunch of vampires and like everyone's mad at each other and they keep fighting what?

2001
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:44,840
Everyone's mad at each other

2002
01:51:44,840 --> 01:51:52,200
Yeah, it's pretty much nailed it. Oh my god. I hate that. I hate that. Oh, that's awful

2003
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,940
Do you guys have my vent?

2004
01:51:54,940 --> 01:51:56,620
Yes

2005
01:51:56,620 --> 01:52:00,100
Okay, you see he's he's smaller and as a kid

2006
01:52:00,100 --> 01:52:03,540
So it's just like a face and two feet and a flat hat on his head

2007
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:06,740
He sort of waddles over and opens the the vent.

2008
01:52:06,740 --> 01:52:06,940
Great.

2009
01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:07,940
He's like, come on.

2010
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:11,440
I know some cool places you can go and he sort of lead you guys

2011
01:52:11,440 --> 01:52:11,940
in the vent.

2012
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:15,640
He's flopping around and he makes a right and then it opens

2013
01:52:15,640 --> 01:52:17,340
up to his like, this is a really cool.

2014
01:52:17,340 --> 01:52:21,040
Oh and he looks down and this was like a big sort of area

2015
01:52:21,040 --> 01:52:23,640
behind that door where he usually goes to hang out.

2016
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:26,540
But now he sees all this fucking shit.

2017
01:52:26,540 --> 01:52:28,840
They're like tons of like inexplicably.

2018
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:31,440
There are like lab tables there.

2019
01:52:32,940 --> 01:52:38,620
You see skeletons of students who got lost down there before, lost homework sheets and notebooks.

2020
01:52:38,620 --> 01:52:44,140
You see a full class field trip that goes to underneath the school world.

2021
01:52:44,140 --> 01:52:51,900
And they're just all dead in the school bus. And in that cavern, you see tables, beakers,

2022
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:57,180
test tubes. You see a MIDI organ far to the back that keeps playing Bacata's box,

2023
01:52:57,180 --> 01:53:00,180
staccato in fugue in D minor type beat.

2024
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:02,580
Like it's just playing that over and over again.

2025
01:53:02,580 --> 01:53:07,460
And to the right of this organ, you see that nasty rodent looking vampire.

2026
01:53:07,460 --> 01:53:10,420
The one that you assume was on the pendant call before.

2027
01:53:10,420 --> 01:53:14,340
And he seems to be like working on some sort of cylindrical contraption that has several

2028
01:53:14,340 --> 01:53:17,160
hard plastic tubes jutting out of it.

2029
01:53:17,160 --> 01:53:19,900
And they're flush against the walls of this cavern.

2030
01:53:19,900 --> 01:53:24,460
And each of them are linked to different glass incubation pods that hold humanoid looking

2031
01:53:24,460 --> 01:53:29,500
figures that appear to be a bit vampiric like he's growing vampires and even recognize faculty

2032
01:53:29,500 --> 01:53:33,500
and students in the tubes and some of them are losers but some of them are really popular

2033
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:34,500
too.

2034
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:38,620
He has several of his vampire rats stalking the grounds caverns.

2035
01:53:38,620 --> 01:53:41,020
None of them have seen the notice you yet because of where you are coming through the

2036
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:44,980
vent but they're looking around and like sniffing around and stuff.

2037
01:53:44,980 --> 01:53:49,780
Michael the crawler's like this is not yeah I usually go here and I just do dip but this

2038
01:53:49,780 --> 01:53:50,780
is awful.

2039
01:53:50,780 --> 01:53:51,780
Oh crap.

2040
01:53:51,780 --> 01:53:53,780
*everyone laughing*

2041
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:55,780
*everyone laughing*

2042
01:53:55,780 --> 01:53:57,780
*everyone laughing*

2043
01:53:57,780 --> 01:53:59,780
*everyone laughing*

2044
01:53:59,780 --> 01:54:01,780
*everyone laughing*

2045
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,780
*everyone laughing*

2046
01:54:03,780 --> 01:54:05,780
*everyone laughing*

2047
01:54:05,780 --> 01:54:07,780
*everyone laughing*

2048
01:54:07,780 --> 01:54:09,780
*everyone laughing*

2049
01:54:09,780 --> 01:54:11,780
*everyone laughing*

2050
01:54:11,780 --> 01:54:13,780
*everyone laughing*

2051
01:54:13,780 --> 01:54:15,780
*everyone laughing*

2052
01:54:15,780 --> 01:54:17,780
*everyone laughing*

2053
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:19,780
*everyone laughing*

2054
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:25,460
We have guests bring them to me rats. You see the rats as they're coming towards you guys. What do you guys want to do?

2055
01:54:25,460 --> 01:54:36,660
The rats don't seem to react to that

2056
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:40,420
As they're bringing you dragging you down

2057
01:54:40,420 --> 01:54:47,940
He's like you fools. Don't you see this is the perfect breeding ground for the vampire army? No one cares about public schools

2058
01:54:48,280 --> 01:54:55,320
No one in your stupid city will notice that right beneath their upturned snouts a menace grows bigger by the day

2059
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:58,620
A vampiric threat that will threaten their existence

2060
01:54:58,620 --> 01:55:03,080
Soon, I'll be able to infect not just mortals, but computers. That's right

2061
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:07,980
Vampire computers. Wiggity wiggity what now? You computer demon!

2062
01:55:07,980 --> 01:55:12,120
Why don't you volunteer? You could be my first vampire computer

2063
01:55:12,120 --> 01:55:17,600
Imagine an immortal computer that sucks data from any source in the galaxy

2064
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:30,040
the

2065
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:32,040
right now you're a pedophile.

2066
01:55:32,040 --> 01:55:34,040
That's not even how that would work.

2067
01:55:34,040 --> 01:55:36,040
If you don't kill yourself,

2068
01:55:36,040 --> 01:55:38,040
then you're a pedophile. I'm sorry.

2069
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:40,040
That's just how it works.

2070
01:55:40,040 --> 01:55:42,040
Unfortunately, this is true. I'm a ham-farter by the way.

2071
01:55:42,040 --> 01:55:44,040
And I have to say,

2072
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:48,040
as Mr. Lovesalot,

2073
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:50,040
I'm Mr. Lovesalot's second in command,

2074
01:55:50,040 --> 01:55:52,040
you know? I'm his secret second in command,

2075
01:55:52,040 --> 01:55:54,040
his second hand command.

2076
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:56,040
Second ham.

2077
01:55:56,040 --> 01:55:58,040
I'm familiar with the parlance.

2078
01:55:58,040 --> 01:56:13,040
the

2079
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:16,560
grow the army and then all of Transylvania's might will invade.

2080
01:56:16,560 --> 01:56:19,760
No, I understand that but why are you playing around with kids?

2081
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:23,360
It's not all children! Some of them are faculty!

2082
01:56:23,360 --> 01:56:25,920
And what if the rat's under your control if you're a pedophile?

2083
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:29,920
I'm not playing with them! I don't control them, we have an agreement!

2084
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:34,160
It's not all kids is a very weak argument for what you're doing here.

2085
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:38,400
That's a good point.

2086
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:42,400
*laughter*

2087
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:44,400
Your honor, it wasn't just kids.

2088
01:56:44,400 --> 01:56:49,400
Yeah, aren't you saying it's better because you're mixing adults and kids together? Is that-

2089
01:56:49,400 --> 01:56:56,400
Yeah, just, you know, I said it once. I'll say it again, if you don't kill yourself right now, you're a bad boss.

2090
01:56:56,400 --> 01:57:00,400
Honestly, I'm prone to agreeing with the guy. I think, you know, uh-

2091
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,400
Which guy?

2092
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,400
Patrick Yoda, this-this guy.

2093
01:57:04,400 --> 01:57:05,400
Okay.

2094
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:11,280
Oh, yeah, no, I'm agreeing with my prisoner here, which I'm not prone to do cuz I'm a pride

2095
01:57:11,280 --> 01:57:15,000
Don't believe you you came in through the vents

2096
01:57:15,000 --> 01:57:22,420
You don't even know about being sneaky like a vampire

2097
01:57:22,420 --> 01:57:29,520
Are you even of your pedophile and probably not even a vampire? I am a vampire. How dare you?

2098
01:57:29,520 --> 01:57:32,640
Say that say that I'm not a vampire

2099
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:37,800
His eyes are looking back and forth like he might not be a vampire.

2100
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:38,800
Wait a second.

2101
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:39,800
I'm leaving!

2102
01:57:39,800 --> 01:57:40,800
You're fired!

2103
01:57:40,800 --> 01:57:42,800
I saw you fade through the wall earlier.

2104
01:57:42,800 --> 01:57:43,800
You're fired.

2105
01:57:43,800 --> 01:57:44,800
You can leave.

2106
01:57:44,800 --> 01:57:46,800
On behalf of Mr. Lovesalot, you're dismissed.

2107
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,800
Go diddle kid somewhere else.

2108
01:57:48,800 --> 01:57:49,800
Even if...

2109
01:57:49,800 --> 01:57:51,800
[laughter]

2110
01:57:51,800 --> 01:57:55,800
Even if I'm dismissed, I will make the vampire computer.

2111
01:57:55,800 --> 01:57:58,800
Rats, seize that demon!

2112
01:57:58,800 --> 01:58:00,800
And yeah, roll for initiative, guys.

2113
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:02,800
Oh, dude, now I'm...

2114
01:58:02,800 --> 01:58:05,840
like the star or something is sucks.

2115
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:11,100
Oh, I'm like the famous one in this episode.

2116
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:14,780
This sucks.

2117
01:58:14,780 --> 01:58:16,280
That's got nine.

2118
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:18,000
I got an 18, baby.

2119
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:18,800
There you go.

2120
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:20,140
That's some big money moves, right?

2121
01:58:20,140 --> 01:58:22,500
I'm going to get some some guaranteed crits.

2122
01:58:22,500 --> 01:58:25,740
That's not come on.

2123
01:58:25,740 --> 01:58:27,240
What does that mean?

2124
01:58:27,240 --> 01:58:27,980
It's not going to happen.

2125
01:58:27,980 --> 01:58:28,700
Come on.

2126
01:58:28,700 --> 01:58:30,480
I have the assassinate ability.

2127
01:58:30,480 --> 01:58:31,100
Oh, right.

2128
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:34,420
I have the assassinate ability!

2129
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:37,580
That's my fault that you have to say that, so...

2130
01:58:37,580 --> 01:58:38,580
Okay...

2131
01:58:38,580 --> 01:58:39,580
YES!

2132
01:58:39,580 --> 01:58:41,580
Okay, Blowtoss, you're up.

2133
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:47,620
Okay, um, without missing a beat, you know, slingshot right away with advantage.

2134
01:58:47,620 --> 01:58:51,780
It's a crit already, it was gonna be a guaranteed crit anyway.

2135
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:52,780
That's 12 damage.

2136
01:58:52,780 --> 01:58:54,020
Fuck yeah, dude.

2137
01:58:54,020 --> 01:58:59,300
I'm going again, I'm... do I get... can spells have crits?

2138
01:58:59,300 --> 01:59:00,300
Yeah!

2139
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:06,620
Okay, I'm yeah, I'm gonna use my oh wait is that right kind? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What am I saying? Yeah

2140
01:59:06,620 --> 01:59:11,180
I'm gonna use my my second there the poppy chucos bad kid firecracker

2141
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:19,940
Which is I hurl a firecracker at him if and if it hits he takes fire damage and

2142
01:59:19,940 --> 01:59:24,380
Flammable objects ignite so I'm thinking maybe you know

2143
01:59:24,380 --> 01:59:29,920
maybe he has some like rats on him that I could set on fire and and and do

2144
01:59:29,920 --> 01:59:36,420
something cool with that or something you know what let's see that's 20

2145
01:59:36,420 --> 01:59:42,000
with advantage that hits okay so it's a guaranteed crit - so that's - I just do

2146
01:59:42,000 --> 01:59:48,300
yeah 10 damage take 10 and then 10 12 yeah I mean you fuck this guy up really

2147
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:53,980
badly I gotta not give you that ability you just fucking just fuck him up you

2148
01:59:53,980 --> 01:59:56,780
He's like, he's like, get them my rap.

2149
01:59:56,780 --> 02:00:01,660
He's just like you just shoot like two like fucking slingshots in his throat and then you

2150
02:00:01,660 --> 02:00:07,060
just like throw a firecracker down there to light it and you see some of his record squirting

2151
02:00:07,060 --> 02:00:10,660
around on fire just like going nuts.

2152
02:00:10,660 --> 02:00:17,100
If there's anything that the army hates more than foreign countries, it's pedophiles.

2153
02:00:17,100 --> 02:00:21,780
Yeah, he does not look good.

2154
02:00:21,780 --> 02:00:22,780
At all.

2155
02:00:22,780 --> 02:00:47,780
his

2156
02:00:47,780 --> 02:00:52,660
roll on you. Don't touch me I'm a child!

2157
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:57,540
You guys are so mean to the cat. That's not gonna stop him.

2158
02:00:57,540 --> 02:01:02,340
Yeah you're giving him advantage. What's your AC Colin?

2159
02:01:02,340 --> 02:01:08,980
Uh 10. Yeah he bites in and he's gonna suck at your blood. It

2160
02:01:08,980 --> 02:01:13,540
tastes delicious by the way. Yeah it's so good and he

2161
02:01:13,540 --> 02:01:17,340
eats. He eats 10 damage off of you.

2162
02:01:17,340 --> 02:01:24,140
He just sucks your blood and you see him like sort of his

2163
02:01:24,140 --> 02:01:28,040
wound start to heal up a little bit after that.

2164
02:01:28,040 --> 02:01:32,740
So and then it's going to be your turn Ray.

2165
02:01:32,740 --> 02:01:33,640
Okay.

2166
02:01:33,640 --> 02:01:37,340
I think I have enough for my Matrix beam now.

2167
02:01:37,340 --> 02:01:41,240
So I will be using my my beautiful beam do it on this on

2168
02:01:41,240 --> 02:01:42,940
this perverted pedophile.

2169
02:01:42,940 --> 02:01:44,940
*laughter*

2170
02:01:44,940 --> 02:01:46,940
*laughter*

2171
02:01:46,940 --> 02:01:51,440
I don't know, yeah you just have literally the worst luck of today.

2172
02:01:51,440 --> 02:01:54,440
Yeah, you just, yeah, I mean it's just like-

2173
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:55,940
I just throw my gun on the ground.

2174
02:01:55,940 --> 02:01:58,440
You know what dude, I don't fucking even want this thing anymore.

2175
02:01:58,440 --> 02:02:02,940
Dude, just fucking, whatever, turn me into a vampire, I don't give a shit anymore.

2176
02:02:02,940 --> 02:02:05,940
I just don't want to have to roll anything ever again.

2177
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,940
Whatever man.

2178
02:02:07,940 --> 02:02:12,940
Yeah, amazing. Okay, it is your turn.

2179
02:02:12,940 --> 02:02:14,940
Colin.

2180
02:02:14,940 --> 02:02:25,940
Okay, um, as I'm getting the blood sucked from me, I'm like, Hmm, I wonder if I should use a power to distract you by making a child appear over there.

2181
02:02:25,940 --> 02:02:31,940
But I say that out loud to him and then I go, haha, just kidding. And then I just go.

2182
02:02:31,940 --> 02:02:33,940
*laughter*

2183
02:02:33,940 --> 02:02:35,940
*laughter*

2184
02:02:35,940 --> 02:02:37,940
Okay, yeah, he's gonna roll against that.

2185
02:02:37,940 --> 02:02:39,940
Oh, got him.

2186
02:02:39,940 --> 02:02:41,940
Oh, and that was so tactical! You totally got him off balance

2187
02:02:41,940 --> 02:02:43,940
by distracting him by explaining one strategy

2188
02:02:43,940 --> 02:02:45,940
and then using another!

2189
02:02:45,940 --> 02:02:47,940
That's a classic army technique!

2190
02:02:47,940 --> 02:02:49,940
Thank you! I appreciate that!

2191
02:02:49,940 --> 02:02:51,940
He got a crit

2192
02:02:51,940 --> 02:02:53,940
resisting that.

2193
02:02:53,940 --> 02:02:55,940
Does that mean that he takes none?

2194
02:02:55,940 --> 02:02:57,940
No, I think he still takes half.

2195
02:02:57,940 --> 02:02:59,940
I haven't heard of that rule, but...

2196
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:03,780
I don't think so. Cool. Okay. Yeah. So yeah, shatter is still, I mean,

2197
02:03:03,780 --> 02:03:07,700
I think you're, I think you're still going to kill him. Okay. Yeah.

2198
02:03:07,700 --> 02:03:12,180
I, um, do I kill him? Yeah. Roll three D eight. Did you roll for the,

2199
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:16,380
Oh yeah. It's 13. It's not, it's a low roll unfortunately. Oh, okay.

2200
02:03:16,380 --> 02:03:22,100
Um, does that kill him though? No, it gets very close though. Uh, yeah.

2201
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:24,580
You just screech at him and you see the bat like,

2202
02:03:24,580 --> 02:03:27,140
so he's like to flap his wings like, ah, fuck. Like he's just like,

2203
02:03:27,140 --> 02:03:28,140
or flying way worse.

2204
02:03:28,140 --> 02:03:31,980
And it's super effective and deals double damage because of echolocation.

2205
02:03:31,980 --> 02:03:32,980
Bats have very sensitive ears.

2206
02:03:32,980 --> 02:03:37,900
Okay, well at the very least he's blind now because it ruined his senses because it was

2207
02:03:37,900 --> 02:03:40,020
a loud noise that ruined his echolocation.

2208
02:03:40,020 --> 02:03:45,860
I would say yes, as long as he remains in bat form for one round he's probably in trouble.

2209
02:03:45,860 --> 02:03:46,860
Yes!

2210
02:03:46,860 --> 02:03:50,260
Okay, and now it is your turn Patrick.

2211
02:03:50,260 --> 02:03:52,020
I'm just gonna throw the hoverboard.

2212
02:03:52,020 --> 02:03:53,380
Sometimes you gotta.

2213
02:03:53,380 --> 02:03:54,380
Yeah, describe your kill.

2214
02:03:54,380 --> 02:03:55,820
You don't even have to roll for damage.

2215
02:03:55,820 --> 02:04:03,820
I'm like, just trying to think, like, what else can I say to make this guy admit he's a pedophile?

2216
02:04:03,820 --> 02:04:10,820
And I just kick the tail down because I'm thinking too hard and it spins around and hits him in the head.

2217
02:04:10,820 --> 02:04:17,820
Yeah, yeah, he's like, "OW! FUCK! SHIT!" and he just like, crashes into the machine, which blows up,

2218
02:04:17,820 --> 02:04:22,220
And it's fucking all the tubes break out all these like vampire like, uh,

2219
02:04:22,220 --> 02:04:25,540
court, like half vampire people like slide out of the tubes.

2220
02:04:25,540 --> 02:04:30,060
You see the rats all just like flop over on their backs and just like

2221
02:04:30,060 --> 02:04:34,780
deactivate almost. Uh, yeah, you guys killed him. I mean, that was so fast.

2222
02:04:34,780 --> 02:04:37,860
Yeah, he's just dead.

2223
02:04:37,860 --> 02:04:42,340
I live with you on our team. We kill, we defeat all our enemies so easily.

2224
02:04:42,340 --> 02:04:44,220
I know that this is good.

2225
02:04:44,220 --> 02:04:47,620
This is the beginning of a long and fruitful partnership in combat.

2226
02:04:47,620 --> 02:04:51,700
yes I agree we've been friends for so long but who knew that we could kill

2227
02:04:51,700 --> 02:04:59,500
together as well first the janitor and now this bad guy I mean how often do you

2228
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:06,000
kill two pedophiles in one day this is beautiful

2229
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:20,720
Just on another level today. I do I do a little cute dance for you guys

2230
02:05:20,720 --> 02:05:30,480
So as staff of the machine explodes the debris sort of falls away you see an elevator to gym

2231
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:33,660
Is right there. So if you want to take that

2232
02:05:33,660 --> 02:05:38,200
Jim I want to look around for anything in this sciencey place

2233
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:45,420
It looks like it will make me feel more healthy like heal me. Yeah role investigation. Yeah, I'll say that you find

2234
02:05:45,420 --> 02:05:52,600
a healing potion or equivalent so but I would say instead of 2d 4 plus 2 it's 1

2235
02:05:52,600 --> 02:05:56,700
d 4 plus 2 a sort of a weaker healing potion

2236
02:05:58,060 --> 02:06:02,620
Oh, damn Collins luck. Um, so six

2237
02:06:02,620 --> 02:06:05,260
um

2238
02:06:05,260 --> 02:06:07,260
and then um

2239
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:10,780
I know what eight plus six is that's fucking easy for me

2240
02:06:10,780 --> 02:06:22,460
Um, yeah, and then is it okay if we just take a breather here for a sec, I I just i'm I i'm

2241
02:06:22,460 --> 02:06:26,940
remembering things about my my weird uncle that this guy kind of

2242
02:06:26,940 --> 02:06:44,940
of

2243
02:06:44,940 --> 02:06:56,860
the

2244
02:06:56,860 --> 02:06:58,660
ability to

2245
02:06:58,660 --> 02:07:05,280
Work through problems in my head. I have completely come to terms with what's happened in my life, and I'm fully mentally healed

2246
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:09,980
Thank you guys for bringing that to a conclusion now. I can go on with the rest of my life

2247
02:07:09,980 --> 02:07:12,540
That will be long and prosperous

2248
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:17,780
Without any unneeded trauma lingering at the back of my head. You're gonna live forever Colin

2249
02:07:17,780 --> 02:07:23,900
That's my game

2250
02:07:23,900 --> 02:07:25,900
*laughter*

2251
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:27,900
*laughter*

2252
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:29,900
*laughter*

2253
02:07:29,900 --> 02:07:31,900
You see uh, the vampire

2254
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:33,900
that he just killed, uh, Klaus Kloosky

2255
02:07:33,900 --> 02:07:35,900
on the ground

2256
02:07:35,900 --> 02:07:37,900
and he says

2257
02:07:37,900 --> 02:07:39,900
"You gun city vermin

2258
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:41,900
we will rule you

2259
02:07:41,900 --> 02:07:43,900
again!"

2260
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:45,900
*laughter*

2261
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,900
You think you guys are getting away with this

2262
02:07:47,900 --> 02:07:49,900
this terrorist attack?

2263
02:07:49,900 --> 02:07:51,900
After the gun city military

2264
02:07:51,900 --> 02:07:55,380
out about this we're gonna fly over your country we're gonna bomb the shit out of

2265
02:07:55,380 --> 02:08:14,660
the vampire State Building Transylvania station - and you're a pedophile bitch

2266
02:08:18,220 --> 02:08:21,580
So yeah, what do you guys want to do? You can go right up to the gym.

2267
02:08:21,580 --> 02:08:23,580
You gotta get to the gym, dude.

2268
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:25,580
The elevator's right there, yeah.

2269
02:08:25,580 --> 02:08:26,580
We gotta fuck this guy up.

2270
02:08:26,580 --> 02:08:28,580
Yeah, you guys go out in the elevator,

2271
02:08:28,580 --> 02:08:32,580
leaving all the like half vampire half people,

2272
02:08:32,580 --> 02:08:37,580
like corpses just like in this basement area.

2273
02:08:37,580 --> 02:08:44,580
You see Michael the crawler just like holding back vomit as he tries to clean up the little place he likes to hang out in.

2274
02:08:44,580 --> 02:08:51,880
And you guys go up the elevator to the, and you see that it opens up where like, it looks

2275
02:08:51,880 --> 02:08:56,100
like lockers would be, but it's just painted over and it's just an elevator door.

2276
02:08:56,100 --> 02:09:00,460
And you walk out in the hallway and you see the gym and you see that the gym had these

2277
02:09:00,460 --> 02:09:02,020
like three locks on them.

2278
02:09:02,020 --> 02:09:06,180
Then you see that they're open now from killing the lieutenants.

2279
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:09,860
And yeah, you guys can just walk right in there.

2280
02:09:09,860 --> 02:09:19,860
And when you do, you see in progress sort of like a sports ball game happening, but it's

2281
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:29,100
a scrimmage with Count Love-ya-Lot's vampires are going up against each other.

2282
02:09:29,100 --> 02:09:37,860
And he's watching this game go down and he sees you all come in and he sort of immediately

2283
02:09:37,860 --> 02:09:43,300
stands at attention all his vampires stand up around him and he goes "sports

2284
02:09:43,300 --> 02:09:49,220
ball is a delicious game you know they say you non-vampires were able to become

2285
02:09:49,220 --> 02:09:54,500
free because of the ingenious games reliance on the type of tactics that

2286
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:58,700
echo those of guerrilla warfare you've done an admiral job defeating my

2287
02:09:58,700 --> 02:10:03,740
lieutenant" and he like flicks his hair back and like and like all the like all

2288
02:10:03,740 --> 02:10:05,740
the vampires go "Huuuh" like Psy.

2289
02:10:05,740 --> 02:10:07,740
Uh, um...

2290
02:10:07,740 --> 02:10:09,740
Why? Why do you defy us?

2291
02:10:09,740 --> 02:10:11,740
You could join us.

2292
02:10:11,740 --> 02:10:13,740
Take over Gunn's city.

2293
02:10:13,740 --> 02:10:15,740
Make it your own. We'll

2294
02:10:15,740 --> 02:10:17,740
install you as leaders of the colony here.

2295
02:10:17,740 --> 02:10:19,740
I don't want a stupid

2296
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:21,740
widow's peak!

2297
02:10:21,740 --> 02:10:23,740
How about I install you into

2298
02:10:23,740 --> 02:10:25,740
my asshole?

2299
02:10:25,740 --> 02:10:27,740
How about that?

2300
02:10:27,740 --> 02:10:29,740
I look to everyone and go like,

2301
02:10:29,740 --> 02:10:31,740
"Pretend I didn't say this."

2302
02:10:31,740 --> 02:10:33,740
Hey, you suck.

2303
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:35,740
(laughter)

2304
02:10:35,740 --> 02:10:37,740
Oh, Garland!

2305
02:10:37,740 --> 02:10:39,740
All the vampires are like, "Yoooo!"

2306
02:10:39,740 --> 02:10:41,740
(laughter)

2307
02:10:41,740 --> 02:10:43,740
You gotta chill, Garland.

2308
02:10:43,740 --> 02:10:45,740
I see. I'm hyper.

2309
02:10:45,740 --> 02:10:47,740
(laughter)

2310
02:10:47,740 --> 02:10:49,740
You made your choice.

2311
02:10:49,740 --> 02:10:51,740
We'll play sports ball to the death then.

2312
02:10:51,740 --> 02:10:53,740
And, uh, yeah.

2313
02:10:53,740 --> 02:10:55,740
So, you guys are suddenly a peer

2314
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:57,740
lined up on one side

2315
02:10:57,740 --> 02:10:59,740
of the sports ball arena,

2316
02:10:59,740 --> 02:11:13,740
and

2317
02:11:13,740 --> 02:11:34,740
that

2318
02:11:34,740 --> 02:11:51,940
up and it's solvent he's holding it by his head and he pulls up another frog

2319
02:11:51,940 --> 02:11:53,940
And it's just a real frog

2320
02:11:53,940 --> 02:11:58,260
That's pretty good actually much cooler

2321
02:11:58,260 --> 02:12:09,100
Yeah, he's just like in the field and like eventually you guys figure out how to usher him off

2322
02:12:09,100 --> 02:12:13,340
He's like, okay

2323
02:12:13,340 --> 02:12:20,800
ready set arm play ball and yeah roll roll who's gonna be like the

2324
02:12:21,380 --> 02:12:26,860
Quarterback who's like so there's four be like I'll be the quarter. Yeah, there's like basically four four roles here

2325
02:12:26,860 --> 02:12:29,760
There's somebody who dribbles the ball and throws it

2326
02:12:29,760 --> 02:12:32,380
There's somebody who hits the ball with the bat

2327
02:12:32,380 --> 02:12:35,220
And then there's somebody who has to head the ball in the goal

2328
02:12:35,220 --> 02:12:41,480
And then the fourth person would be whoever is like helping defend everyone. That's kind of how I want to break this out in this

2329
02:12:41,480 --> 02:12:48,020
I'll play defense because I have Warren so I can't maybe I'll be the guy who hits the hits the ball with the stick cuz

2330
02:12:48,020 --> 02:12:50,900
I got my cool sticks like Colin quarterback, dude. Yeah

2331
02:12:50,900 --> 02:12:54,220
Okay, and Pat

2332
02:12:54,220 --> 02:13:00,600
Patrick Yoda, you're gonna you're gonna head the try to head the ball into the golf golf hole at the other end of the gym

2333
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:04,060
Yeah, he's got the putter. All right

2334
02:13:04,060 --> 02:13:11,800
Okay, so we'll start with first athletics check will be Colin quarterback. Okay, the 20 fucking baby

2335
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:15,580
Just inexplicably so fucking good at this

2336
02:13:16,220 --> 02:13:20,200
Yeah, it's as perfect your dribble the ball around and like do some like fucking

2337
02:13:20,200 --> 02:13:23,760
Like Globetrotter ass shit on these guys

2338
02:13:23,760 --> 02:13:27,420
Ray William Johnson roll athletics to see how well you defend them -

2339
02:13:27,420 --> 02:13:40,260
Yeah, okay, we'll resolve that then we'll resolve your thing right, okay, yeah, so I'm going to

2340
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:43,180
look at Ray and say

2341
02:13:44,180 --> 02:13:46,180
Ray ray ray, okay

2342
02:13:46,180 --> 02:13:56,360
Come up with this shit I feel amazing right now. Okay. Yeah rolled d6 added these next ray I think to this

2343
02:13:56,360 --> 02:14:01,300
Thirteen

2344
02:14:01,300 --> 02:14:04,900
Hell yeah, baby a very a very a very respectable

2345
02:14:04,900 --> 02:14:11,860
Blocking job you do you you're able to sort of help sort of like get some of the guys off of Collins back as he's dribbling

2346
02:14:12,200 --> 02:14:17,960
And Colin your smooth moves just help clinch it you get to all you why didn't you try out for the team Colin?

2347
02:14:17,960 --> 02:14:19,960
You're incredible

2348
02:14:19,960 --> 02:14:23,480
But I only have so much time and so many things to do like

2349
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:27,180
Espanol hang out at the cyber beach with my friends

2350
02:14:27,180 --> 02:14:30,120
Have the best summer of our lives

2351
02:14:30,120 --> 02:14:33,880
But time

2352
02:14:33,880 --> 02:14:41,480
Yeah, so you uh, yeah and your smooth moves just like put you in the best position to

2353
02:14:42,080 --> 02:14:48,480
toss the ball to blow toss. So you're going to toss that with advantage to blow toss and

2354
02:14:48,480 --> 02:14:57,520
another athletics check on. Nice 16 is a pretty decent toss. So blow toss the way that this part

2355
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:02,880
works is it's you and another vampire are fighting to see who's going to get to hit the ball. So

2356
02:15:02,880 --> 02:15:08,800
I also I still have a bardic inspiration leftover that I didn't use. I just want

2357
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:14,320
Hell yeah. Okay, cool. So if you want to, you can either hit the ball or try to do something to him

2358
02:15:14,320 --> 02:15:20,560
or whatever. I think you have a moment beforehand where this was happening before he threw the ball.

2359
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:25,360
You know what I mean? Yeah. I think I'm just going to slug it. I'm going to do my best to-

2360
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:26,400
Yeah. Go for it.

2361
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:36,000
No fancy stuff. That's a 13. I might as well add the DSA. Can I wait to see what the other guy's

2362
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:40,160
result is before I add it. Okay, I'm going to go ahead and add it might as well. That's a three.

2363
02:15:40,160 --> 02:15:46,880
So 16. Nice. Okay. Yeah. And let's see how the other guy does. Yeah, no, you just edge him out.

2364
02:15:46,880 --> 02:15:53,440
You guys are both going for it. But your stance is just far superior. You got that real classic

2365
02:15:53,440 --> 02:16:00,080
Mike Piazza stance. I got the army stance. Yeah. And you slug it. And now as you slug it, it's

2366
02:16:00,080 --> 02:16:05,520
going to go towards a group of different vampires and Patrick Yoda, as you are all going to try to

2367
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:22,520
of

2368
02:16:22,520 --> 02:16:27,080
uh, the sort of basically all successes that have happened so far.

2369
02:16:27,080 --> 02:16:29,800
Um, so you're going to clinch this for everyone.

2370
02:16:29,800 --> 02:16:32,800
What's your, what are you going to do?

2371
02:16:32,800 --> 02:16:35,960
It's a, it's a soccer ball that you're, yeah, yeah.

2372
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:37,280
I thought it was a golf ball.

2373
02:16:37,280 --> 02:16:40,600
No, it turns into a golf ball when it goes towards the hole.

2374
02:16:40,600 --> 02:16:41,600
Okay.

2375
02:16:41,600 --> 02:16:42,600
That's the final ball.

2376
02:16:42,600 --> 02:16:47,000
Then I, I, I still have the putter.

2377
02:16:47,000 --> 02:16:48,000
Okay.

2378
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:49,000
Yeah.

2379
02:16:49,000 --> 02:16:52,280
So all the vampires are using their feet, but I just have a putter.

2380
02:16:52,280 --> 02:16:53,280
[laughter]

2381
02:16:53,280 --> 02:16:54,280
Okay, cool.

2382
02:16:54,280 --> 02:16:58,400
And I'm swinging, I swing the putter at the ball in midair.

2383
02:16:58,400 --> 02:17:00,400
Yeah, roll with advantage.

2384
02:17:00,400 --> 02:17:01,400
12.

2385
02:17:01,400 --> 02:17:03,720
God, okay, cool.

2386
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:07,520
So yeah, you hit that, and let's see how they do.

2387
02:17:07,520 --> 02:17:10,320
They do beat you out, so they manage to get the ball first.

2388
02:17:10,320 --> 02:17:13,280
And it's going towards the hole.

2389
02:17:13,280 --> 02:17:14,280
So what-

2390
02:17:14,280 --> 02:17:15,880
Can I get in front of it?

2391
02:17:15,880 --> 02:17:21,080
Yeah, I'll say you can you I'd say you can kind of think of it like this. All of you guys can nominate

2392
02:17:21,080 --> 02:17:26,600
one person to try to redirect it. And that's sort of like your chance to redirect it before it goes

2393
02:17:26,600 --> 02:17:35,560
towards a whole athletics role. Right? What's everybody's athletics? I don't want to minus four,

2394
02:17:35,560 --> 02:17:40,760
- five yo big demon that's right mm-hmm

2395
02:17:40,760 --> 02:17:48,560
This is I I wish oh my god

2396
02:17:48,560 --> 02:17:54,560
It's like something right it's like you got a guy a weird fucked up bug in your computer, man

2397
02:17:54,560 --> 02:17:58,080
Yeah

2398
02:17:58,080 --> 02:18:04,920
You just I mean you Lucy in the football it like the ball like asks you to come kick it and then it pulls itself

2399
02:18:04,920 --> 02:18:11,880
away from you. And you just fall on your ass. Yeah, I was so beaten down by these rolls

2400
02:18:11,880 --> 02:18:16,920
at this point. I don't even get up. I just yeah, as it rolls towards the hole and the

2401
02:18:16,920 --> 02:18:26,040
vampire score point and they're like, ha ha, that's one point for the vampires. Okay, okay,

2402
02:18:26,040 --> 02:18:31,860
we're gonna play. It's two or three best two out of three. And if you lose, you forgot

2403
02:18:31,860 --> 02:18:35,960
To mention that if you lose you die, but yeah, that's what happens. What is beat you up and we lose

2404
02:18:35,960 --> 02:18:37,960
It's not a big deal. No

2405
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:44,980
Take a look at these guys and see how tough I think they are if we were to just like

2406
02:18:44,980 --> 02:18:48,340
Pretend like we were about to play and then instead just try to kill them. Yeah

2407
02:18:48,340 --> 02:18:51,900
What should I roll inside? I guess yeah inside inside

2408
02:18:51,900 --> 02:18:59,180
Yeah, uh, the vampires are not the toughest. He's pretty tough the other guy

2409
02:19:00,100 --> 02:19:05,060
You could probably take them in a fight, but you think could we get a surprise attack in?

2410
02:19:05,060 --> 02:19:09,280
Yeah, I think so if you like break his rules

2411
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:14,580
I believe in I believe that there's no way that I get another

2412
02:19:14,580 --> 02:19:17,340
correct one roll

2413
02:19:17,340 --> 02:19:24,120
So I think we should we should rely on our athletic ability here and not yeah to violence just yet

2414
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:26,420
Okay, okay

2415
02:19:26,420 --> 02:19:31,260
How about if one of us fucks up really bad one more time, we just instantly break out

2416
02:19:31,260 --> 02:19:32,260
into violence.

2417
02:19:32,260 --> 02:19:33,260
You're beautiful.

2418
02:19:33,260 --> 02:19:35,380
You're saying this in your huddle.

2419
02:19:35,380 --> 02:19:36,380
Yeah.

2420
02:19:36,380 --> 02:19:37,380
Yeah.

2421
02:19:37,380 --> 02:19:39,380
Yeah, it's amazing, coach.

2422
02:19:39,380 --> 02:19:40,380
Okay, cool.

2423
02:19:40,380 --> 02:19:41,380
Break.

2424
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:44,740
So, alright, you're all gathering up again.

2425
02:19:44,740 --> 02:19:52,420
Also, I'd like to bardically inspire Ray William Johnson and, again, and just be like, it's

2426
02:19:52,420 --> 02:19:55,100
impossible for you to mess up again.

2427
02:19:55,100 --> 02:19:56,100
You got this.

2428
02:19:56,100 --> 02:20:02,100
You're so strong and smart and honestly I can't wait until we're best friends and we're old men together

2429
02:20:02,100 --> 02:20:04,740
and we have a beer and remember the good old days and

2430
02:20:04,740 --> 02:20:09,980
And then I our wives are friends too. So I guess it's more

2431
02:20:09,980 --> 02:20:12,780
We're friends. We're all friends

2432
02:20:12,780 --> 02:20:15,700
So beautiful Collins

2433
02:20:15,700 --> 02:20:22,380
That it was amazing it's turned over obviously is a turnover back to you guys

2434
02:20:22,380 --> 02:20:26,540
So you guys actually get control of again so we can do all that again. So Colin you first

2435
02:20:26,540 --> 02:20:29,180
Okay, pretty good

2436
02:20:29,180 --> 02:20:31,860
Okay, Ray William Johnson start blocking. Oh

02:21:24,820 --> 02:21:30,820
right and it just perfectly falls into the hole. It turns in midair, goes, turns into

2444
02:21:30,820 --> 02:21:49,300
to

2445
02:21:49,300 --> 02:21:51,300
That was really funny, Blowtooth!

2446
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:54,700
[Laughter]

2447
02:21:54,700 --> 02:21:59,300
Thanks, Colin! You always know how to make me feel like the best guy in the world!

2448
02:21:59,300 --> 02:22:00,800
That's because you are.

2449
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:02,000
- One. - Whoa!

2450
02:22:02,000 --> 02:22:03,900
Hey, but what about me, Colin?

2451
02:22:03,900 --> 02:22:06,300
I think that you're also the best guy in the world.

2452
02:22:06,300 --> 02:22:11,100
I can't believe that four best guys in the world all got to be friends at the same time.

2453
02:22:11,100 --> 02:22:12,700
And forever, too.

2454
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:16,700
- It's so beautiful. - One more point.

2455
02:22:16,700 --> 02:22:28,180
and

2456
02:22:28,180 --> 02:22:46,180

2457
02:22:46,180 --> 02:22:50,580

2460
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:57,900
i mean they're not the vampires not going to be able to beat that

2461
02:22:57,900 --> 02:22:59,400
and now patrick yoda

2462
02:22:59,400 --> 02:23:00,700
it's all up to you

2463
02:23:00,700 --> 02:23:01,780
fifteen

2464
02:23:01,780 --> 02:23:03,260
alright they're gonna roll against that

2465
02:23:03,260 --> 02:23:06,300
let's see how they do

2466
02:23:06,300 --> 02:23:07,540
i'm watching this happen

2467
02:23:07,540 --> 02:23:11,580
biting my fingernails and they're just flying all over the place

2468
02:23:11,580 --> 02:23:15,580
as he connects with it, blow toss perfectly connects it

2469
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:17,280
right in that sweet spot in the bat.

2470
02:23:17,280 --> 02:23:19,060
It flies in the air,

2471
02:23:19,060 --> 02:23:21,480
go vroom, turns into a soccer ball.

2472
02:23:21,480 --> 02:23:23,260
And you just see this crowd,

2473
02:23:23,260 --> 02:23:25,180
like in slow motion of vampires all going around.

2474
02:23:25,180 --> 02:23:26,580
And Patrick Yoda's so small,

2475
02:23:26,580 --> 02:23:30,460
like you could kind of see him sticking out from the top.

2476
02:23:30,460 --> 02:23:33,700
And Patrick Yoda, you sling your arm up in the air

2477
02:23:33,700 --> 02:23:35,620
and as the putter's going up in slow motion,

2478
02:23:35,620 --> 02:23:37,940
just dunk, like just fucking like breaks

2479
02:23:37,940 --> 02:23:40,780
one of the vampire's jaws, like breaks another one.

2480
02:23:40,780 --> 02:23:43,340
And like with the blood on the putter,

2481
02:23:44,580 --> 02:23:47,820
you get it perfectly it falls towards the hole

2482
02:23:47,820 --> 02:23:54,820
you guys with it

2483
02:23:54,820 --> 02:23:56,260
outlawed you lots

2484
02:23:56,260 --> 02:23:58,620
he shrivels up in his big coat

2485
02:23:58,620 --> 02:24:00,460
uh... no

2486
02:24:00,460 --> 02:24:01,460
no

2487
02:24:01,460 --> 02:24:02,820
if you lost

2488
02:24:02,820 --> 02:24:06,940
the pride it's straight of the nation of god city

2489
02:24:06,940 --> 02:24:09,820
yeah i'm dying a little bit of a little

2490
02:24:09,820 --> 02:24:10,820
No!

2491
02:24:10,820 --> 02:24:15,980
In celebration, I grab what I think is like a cooler full of Gatorade and dump it on Colin,

2492
02:24:15,980 --> 02:24:16,980
but it's just blood.

2493
02:24:16,980 --> 02:24:19,980
It just gets carried.

2494
02:24:19,980 --> 02:24:26,060
Yeah, um, actually, it's not blood.

2495
02:24:26,060 --> 02:24:29,060
It's boiling hot oil.

2496
02:24:29,060 --> 02:24:30,060
What?

2497
02:24:30,060 --> 02:24:33,060
I don't know.

2498
02:24:33,060 --> 02:24:35,060
I screamed.

2499
02:24:36,060 --> 02:24:43,060
what

2500
02:24:43,060 --> 02:24:44,780
newt ginger

2501
02:24:44,780 --> 02:24:46,780
it

2502
02:24:46,780 --> 02:24:53,780
it

2503
02:24:53,780 --> 02:24:56,580
you see these vampires right over with those

2504
02:24:56,580 --> 02:25:00,460
with a big giant buckets they can't they just stick it through you call it

2505
02:25:00,460 --> 02:25:02,460
They put you on a rotisserie

2506
02:25:02,460 --> 02:25:04,460
starts spinning around.

2507
02:25:04,460 --> 02:25:06,460
Oh my god!

2508
02:25:06,460 --> 02:25:08,460
Oh my god!

2509
02:25:08,460 --> 02:25:10,460
What the fuck, man?

2510
02:25:10,460 --> 02:25:12,460
Wait, what?

2511
02:25:12,460 --> 02:25:14,460
This is a-

2512
02:25:14,460 --> 02:25:16,460
Oh my god, they're running to Syrinia

2513
02:25:16,460 --> 02:25:18,460
but they're also- his guts are coming out!

2514
02:25:18,460 --> 02:25:20,460
This is the most violent death

2515
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:22,460
I've ever seen in my life!

2516
02:25:22,460 --> 02:25:24,460
His eyeballs are hanging out

2517
02:25:24,460 --> 02:25:26,460
on his brain!

2518
02:25:26,460 --> 02:25:28,460
Oh my god!

2519
02:25:28,460 --> 02:25:30,460
Colin's still kind of alive, and just

2520
02:25:30,460 --> 02:25:35,740
Call me says I can sit on a bed. I can draw the color red. I can pat my own head

2521
02:25:35,740 --> 02:25:43,500
Uh, i'm just a complete shock

2522
02:25:43,500 --> 02:25:48,620
Like when the brother in hereditary knocks his sisters

2523
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:58,300
Yeah, we all just stand there for a minute and I turn we will never speak about this ever again

2524
02:25:58,300 --> 02:26:06,300
*crying*

2525
02:26:06,300 --> 02:26:08,300
Colin, do you have any last words?

2526
02:26:08,300 --> 02:26:10,300
Um, hmm...

2527
02:26:10,300 --> 02:26:12,300
Hmm...

2528
02:26:12,300 --> 02:26:14,300
Nah, I just shriek again.

2529
02:26:14,300 --> 02:26:16,300
*laughing*

2530
02:26:16,300 --> 02:26:18,300
*screaming*

2531
02:26:18,300 --> 02:26:20,300
*laughing*

2532
02:26:20,300 --> 02:26:22,300
I hope this summer never ends!

2533
02:26:22,300 --> 02:26:24,300
*laughing*

2534
02:26:24,300 --> 02:26:26,300
It won't, Colin, I promise!

2535
02:26:26,300 --> 02:26:33,300
He's gonna be spending time at beach in heaven, at the beach in heaven!

2536
02:26:33,300 --> 02:26:40,300
I hope they speak espanol up there!

2537
02:26:40,300 --> 02:26:52,300
As the vampires die, and the coffins fly up back, and the force field goes down, and an

2538
02:26:52,300 --> 02:26:57,180
One easy but welcome quiet washes over the blood-soaked grounds of Gunn City Public High

2539
02:26:57,180 --> 02:26:58,180
School.

2540
02:26:58,180 --> 02:27:02,900
The survivors of the invasion slowly start to pick themselves up and dust themselves off

2541
02:27:02,900 --> 02:27:07,500
while you're all watching this horrible sight of Colin dying.

2542
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:13,020
Sullivan the Frog, who besides being in this void behind his back, was also hiding in the

2543
02:27:13,020 --> 02:27:18,580
bleachers, crawls towards the center of the Stakehams Arena past the corpses of his peers

2544
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:21,700
and the vampiric dust that litters their gushing wounds.

2545
02:27:21,700 --> 02:27:24,500
He spots the microphone among the carnage.

2546
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:29,200
He gently picks it up, wipes off some viscera stuck to the head of the thing, swallows back

2547
02:27:29,200 --> 02:27:33,140
some vomit, and then goes "Hello?"

2548
02:27:33,140 --> 02:27:34,260
And there's no response.

2549
02:27:34,260 --> 02:27:37,380
People are still cowering, they're awaiting their heroes.

2550
02:27:37,380 --> 02:27:39,140
He goes like "Hello?"

2551
02:27:39,140 --> 02:27:41,180
And then nothing still.

2552
02:27:41,180 --> 02:27:42,620
People are still afraid and scared.

2553
02:27:42,620 --> 02:27:43,620
And then he finally...

2554
02:27:43,620 --> 02:27:44,620
*clears throat*

2555
02:27:44,620 --> 02:27:49,620
Gunn City, brrrah-p-p-pah!

2556
02:27:49,620 --> 02:27:53,620
Gunn City, brrrah-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka!

2557
02:27:53,620 --> 02:27:54,620
Halliburton-

2558
02:27:54,620 --> 02:27:56,620
He starts to sing the national anthem,

2559
02:27:56,620 --> 02:27:59,620
and slowly everyone comes out and starts singing it together,

2560
02:27:59,620 --> 02:28:03,620
and as the Gunn City flag superimposes itself

2561
02:28:03,620 --> 02:28:06,620
on the image of all the other images you're seeing,

2562
02:28:06,620 --> 02:28:10,620
as the three of you walk out, carrying Colin,

2563
02:28:10,620 --> 02:28:12,620
He looks delicious.

2564
02:28:12,620 --> 02:28:14,620
I have an apple in my mouth at this point.

2565
02:28:14,620 --> 02:28:16,620
Yeah, you do.

2566
02:28:16,620 --> 02:28:18,620
And you guys saved your school

2567
02:28:18,620 --> 02:28:20,620
on this wonderful Independence Day

2568
02:28:20,620 --> 02:28:22,620
freeing it from the vampire menace.

2569
02:28:22,620 --> 02:28:24,620
Epilogue, though.

2570
02:28:24,620 --> 02:28:26,620
Somewhere on the planet of Suckafuckabob,

2571
02:28:26,620 --> 02:28:28,620
an old Yoda senses a stirring in the air.

2572
02:28:28,620 --> 02:28:30,620
He feels the rise of a new age.

2573
02:28:30,620 --> 02:28:32,620
He's a young man,

2574
02:28:32,620 --> 02:28:34,620
but he's a man of his word.

2575
02:28:34,620 --> 02:28:36,620
He's a man of his word.

2576
02:28:36,620 --> 02:28:38,620
He's a man of his word.

2577
02:28:38,620 --> 02:28:44,700
He feels the rise of a hero of his own, but something dreadful looming over the horizon.

2578
02:28:44,700 --> 02:28:49,660
Seized by narrative import, he drops his hot cocoa he was drinking, burning his nephew's

2579
02:28:49,660 --> 02:28:54,020
foot, and stares past himself and the world around him.

2580
02:28:54,020 --> 02:28:56,820
The shroud of weird guys has fallen.

2581
02:28:56,820 --> 02:28:59,740
Begun the Vampire Wars half.

2582
02:28:59,740 --> 02:29:04,460
Happy 4th of July everyone.

2583
02:29:04,460 --> 02:29:05,460
Happy Halloween!

2584
02:29:05,460 --> 02:29:07,460
Happy Halloween!

2585
02:29:07,460 --> 02:29:11,460
This is gonna be the best fucking Christmas of our lives!

2586
02:29:11,460 --> 02:29:12,460
Woo!

2587
02:29:12,460 --> 02:29:15,460
It'd be funny if Kai died like right after this game.

2588
02:29:15,460 --> 02:29:17,460
[Laughter]

2589
02:29:17,460 --> 02:29:19,460
I get hit by a truck.

2590
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:22,460
Or one of my friends, of course, with my leg.

2591
02:29:22,460 --> 02:29:24,460
[Laughter]

2592
02:29:24,460 --> 02:29:46,460
[Music]
