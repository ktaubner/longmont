1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,120
- You look nice today.

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,800
You look all dressed up for Christmas.

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,120
- I am all dressed up for Christmas.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:15,700
- You have your green.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,560
- I wore a big Christmas outfit.

7
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,340
- You have a green hat part on.

8
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:20,180
You have a red jacket on.

9
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:21,440
- I look like Mr. Rogers.

10
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,440
- You do, you have a button up shirt on.

11
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:26,640
I haven't seen you wear a button up shirt that many times.

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,240
- I haven't seen the episode right now.

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,560
This is a bad start.

14
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:33,160
what talking about your outfit? No, I think I did the thing where I drink too

15
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:35,920
much caffeine that it makes me tired. Do you know that? You know, when you do

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,560
that happens to me. Yeah. What is that about? I don't know. Why is it not

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,220
linear? You know what it was? I'm trying to write the perfect Christmas song for

18
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,320
Christmas and it's I know you've been ignoring me. We don't have to worry

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,420
about how much about you don't know make any excuses for the badness when we

20
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,360
haven't even started yet. That's true.

21
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:58,560
It's very quiet. Most quiet. Boom. Quiet. Most quiet ever made. God damn it.

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,460
That's a bomb that could kill nobody. That's an ant bomb. That was somebody

23
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,500
breathing in their sleep. That's what the electrician that's been in my apartment

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,420
sounds like when he breathes. Really? Have you told him about a CPAP machine?

25
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,620
Dude, I haven't even fucking called that guy back. You haven't talked about him

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,700
in a long time. I haven't talked about him in a long time. It's been a pretty

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,660
good string of episodes. No, I've heard a boyfriend hearing about him. But

28
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:22,620
remember how long ago it was since I last talked about him, right? Uh huh.

29
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:26,820
You talked about him yesterday. This was a job. Oh yeah, you did. But I think

30
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,540
You and me both just kind of ignored it as he was talking about it so that we

31
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,180
could just get he's supposed to install five outlets in my apartment.

32
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,860
We really can't do this. I swear.

33
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,740
We can't talk about this. I haven't talked about it on the show.

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,960
He's supposed to install five outlets in my apartment.

35
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,980
He almost died of COVID cause he's like 400 pounds and 69 years old

36
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:50,940
and he can't install it without bending over and doing this.

37
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,660
When he's in my apartment, it sounds like this.

38
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,660
- Nothing. - It's silence.

39
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,700
- You hear-- - Dead silence.

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,820
- You hear like a drill going into the wall.

41
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,700
(imitates drill)

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,540
From his body.

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,540
- That's one breath he makes?

44
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,380
- Yeah. - That's an exploding--

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,900
- And then his son is watching TikToks

46
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,460
on our front stoop.

47
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,900
- I know. - And he gets paid.

48
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:11,740
- I know.

49
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,580
- And he gets paid.

50
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,620
- And that's the electrician's corner.

51
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,540
- Guys, I've made a terrible mistake.

52
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,360
- What happened?

53
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,740
- Maybe a marriage destroying mistake.

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,860
- Oh no. - Yeah, last night.

55
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,700
- What happened?

56
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,100
- Me and my wife have decided to start doing

57
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:29,800
a budget right to do it's that season man. It's that season on the budget,

58
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:32,920
too, and it's been ruining my not good dude. It's not

59
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,620
not good. The moment you realize how much money you actually yeah and your

60
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:41,620
wife makes you've actually double the amount of money. It's still not that

61
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,140
much money,

62
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:48,720
and then and then she's like is this really how much money you make and I go

63
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,440
yeah, but we have an office

64
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,240
I actually seeing the exact number of money I'm putting into savings every

65
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:56,780
month. Yes,

66
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,500
sorry, more than two digits sometimes

67
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,840
only sometime yeah, but I last night we did we went over this budget spent

68
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,520
hours doing this yeah. We set up a joint bank account took us weeks. We

69
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:13,780
finally got it. We're doing got a man together had to go to had to go to Bank

70
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,500
of America, set up the joint bank account, had to do it took days. I'm

71
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,060
going to need your advice on this, because we have no idea how to do. He

72
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,260
said that this is marriage ending. I don't think you need his advice. I know

73
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:26,320
he's getting he's working up to the mistake making them. I made the mistake

74
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,640
okay, so last night, so we set up the entire thing right and then and and in

75
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,200
my checking account, not that much money, but we agreed that like our joint

76
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,920
checking account is going to be groceries and yeah like yeah, stuff that

77
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,520
will both do right so last night

78
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:49,200
she goes to bed and I stay up so I can do the dishes like a good guy right yeah

79
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,880
And I'm sitting there and I'm watching YouTube videos and I get this ad, man.

80
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:59,880
I get this ad for something called Alpine Butcher that sells A5--

81
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,880
Oh, no.

82
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
Oh, wait, no, I know.

83
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,880
Yes, you were saying you were going to buy it last night after the gym.

84
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,880
Oh, my God.

85
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,680
Did you put it on the fucking joint bank account?

86
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,280
I accidentally bought it with the joint bank account card, A5, marbling score 12, Wagyu,

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,880
New York Street Steak.

88
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,380
is a hundred and thirty dollars

89
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,840
and for one

90
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,500
you go to fucking Costco, go anywhere,

91
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,400
go anywhere, but buying a

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,440
line. There's butcher shops all over. How the fuck are you buying

93
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,600
something off a YouTube ad? What I'm

94
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,720
with you?

95
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,160
That's that's a dude that's like swiping up on an Instagram ad and by

96
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,200
sweat pants. What are you talking about? It's a built in that it's a

97
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,600
built in a

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:51,440
for that's in the video of the creator that I like. Oh, it's the one where he

99
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,520
says he says click the link in the description. You butter yeah, and I

100
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,840
use by it off a Guga

101
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,180
did you get Warby Parker to

102
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,340
maybe

103
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:06,840
maybe anyway, if you get five percent off, I have not told her and I'm not

104
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,220
going to until she takes one bite of the

105
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,520
as the stake is in her mouth, I'm going to say you better not fuck it up dude.

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,780
I'm going to be the rarest. I'm going to be the medium. Well, you got to cook

107
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:23,160
that shit rare as hell. That's going to be the juiciest medium. Well, fuck you

108
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,380
and

109
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,860
well and slow fuck brother. I'm going to send you this put in the tray, this

110
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:35,200
steak in a manila envelope. Yeah, you're going to get it. It's going to be a

111
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:39,320
five wag you media. I don't know. I'm going to leave you right. I immediately

112
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,760
even an email. It was like I'd like to cancel my order and they were like we

113
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,820
don't cancel orders because we we process them immediately. All right,

114
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:51,320
well, you got got yeah. Well, sometimes you make ginormous mistakes and

115
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,200
hopefully she by the time this comes out, she probably will have already

116
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,440
eaten and will have already forgiven me. So it's not here's the thing you don't

117
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,360
even it's not even that she has to forgive you or eat and be convinced that

118
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,420
it's great. If she eats it, it's a joint expense. Yeah, exactly that's exactly

119
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:08,800
the truth before she sees the bill exactly where she sees the statement for

120
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:12,900
the account. Yeah, it'd be so funny in one or two bites of you say, Oh, well, I

121
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,900
knew you were both going to eat it and was it more for both was it about seventeen

122
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:22,860
percent of our monthly entire food budget on one single steak? Yeah, that

123
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,140
would be so funny if you get the call, like right in the middle of this

124
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,100
fucking episode that I have to go pick it up.

125
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,140
Hey, I was looking through the joint bank account. I was looking through the

126
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:36,700
Bank of America app. I saw one hundred and thirty dollars on state. You know

127
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:42,440
I'd probably do man. I probably lie blame it on a say say that you were on a

128
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,740
website. I would probably say

129
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,500
jacking on probably say was a dent. We put my credit card. It was a cam web

130
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,220
right yeah. She would probably how many how many servings is this day? This is

131
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:57,320
literally this is one meal. This is half a meal for each of us. It's one eleven

132
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,060
ounce steak.

133
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:01,980
It's not even a pound of meat. You fucking

134
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,260
what's wrong with you.

135
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,260
I told you like how many butcher shops there are in this neighborhood.

136
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,260
It still would have been an absurd expense.

137
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,260
You can go to Costco and buy A5 Wagyu there.

138
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,260
I mean, it's not like the best, but I wanted the best, man.

139
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,260
Even then you go there, you get a fucking Costco membership out of that.

140
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,260
This is why, you know what, man, these women need to stay the fuck out of my money.

141
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Yeah, it's that simple.

142
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:34,260
If I want to spend all my money on Valorant skins, how much is it at Costco?

143
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,860
that's a lot. Well, that's twelve pounds. That's twelve pounds and that's nine

144
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:42,740
hundred dollars. Yeah. And it comes with a big yellow pepper.

145
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,360
That's good. Nothing goes better with a five wagyu than a big, raw, yellow bell

146
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:49,900
pepper.

147
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,900
That's the craziest garnish they could have.

148
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,100
That's it's Costco, man.

149
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,320
Whatever.

150
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,020
It looks good. It looks

151
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:03,880
vegetable.

152
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:10,500
I don't understand what's going on. I mean, he's right that you would never

153
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,740
eat a bell pepper.

154
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:16,060
What would you choose?

155
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,260
The least attractive bell pepper, too. Not even a green one.

156
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,860
You just put a carrot next to it.

157
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:30,060
A carrot would have made a little... I mean, really, any vegetable, one carrot.

158
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,020
Why did they even need to put the vegetable next to the...

159
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,060
It's a garnish, man. It makes it look like it's a part of a kitchen.

160
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,780
Was it for scale? Maybe that makes a little sense.

161
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,780
I guess it's for scale, yeah.

162
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,780
But bell peppers vary widely.

163
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,780
They should have put someone's hand to that.

164
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,780
Yeah, exactly.

165
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
But then you definitely say...

166
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
The butcher's hand with a knife.

167
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,780
Oh, that's smart.

168
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
Uh-huh.

169
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
Yeah.

170
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,100
See, fucking Costco hire me for your fucking photo shoot.

171
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,700
You look like you work at Costco to be fair.

172
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Yeah, I know.

173
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,700
Like a Costco manager.

174
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,900
I'm wearing... This is a... If you can see right there, I don't know, that's the jacket.

175
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,580
Hi, my name is Ivan. I could see that.

176
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:07,580
Hi, my name is Eduardo.

177
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,580
Whatever company, I haven't been able to get this sticker off of it.

178
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
I couldn't read it.

179
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,580
You've always reminded me of Eduardo from Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.

180
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,580
That's crazy because that's...

181
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,580
And I can't tell if you're real or not.

182
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,580
That's what my sister said that too.

183
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,580
What if he was you and me's joint imaginary friend?

184
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,580
That would be great for the IRS, you could claim that.

185
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,580
You can't be worse for us. That would be good for me. Where the hell would our money be going?

186
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:35,580
You can just tell the IRS that I'm an imaginary friend and that they don't have to...

187
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,580
That'd be a dependent. They don't have to make me pay any more taxes.

188
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,580
That'd be amazing. That'd be smart. You can't make me pay taxes.

189
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,580
I'm an imaginary friend. You wouldn't have been paying taxes to begin with because you wouldn't be real.

190
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,580
You don't exist. You wouldn't have existed. There would be no concept of what's good or bad for you.

191
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,580
You don't know about the bank of imagination. You wouldn't appear in the world.

192
00:09:55,580 --> 00:10:04,500
take a USD. They take ISD. Imaginary State Dollars. Did you guys have imaginary friends

193
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:14,340
growing up? Yes I did. Who? I had a lot just because man I don't even remember. I don't

194
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:20,140
remember the name of my imaginary friend or what his power was, but I had an imaginary

195
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:25,040
friend who had a power who is pretty much the same as like blue or whatever from

196
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,740
Foster's home a blue guy a bullet he might have been blue but talk about it

197
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:34,240
might have been blue but red he was a bullet no he was a teardrop bullet blue

198
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,100
was a fucking bullet he was a teardrop because of how sad that makes for not

199
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:43,520
having real friends oh that's actually sad yeah my imaginary friend was a big

200
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:49,300
hand and then my brother's was a guy who lived on Mars but he had it way long yet

201
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,780
got it into like ten eleven years old. Okay, he was saying I'm going to go to

202
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:58,100
Mars today and they started my way. His imaginary friend was Mars. His imaginary

203
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,900
friend lived on Mars. I don't remember his name and his he his mom would drive

204
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,780
drop him off in a red Corvette from Mars and my grandma thought for some years

205
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,580
that my younger brother was demonically possessed because

206
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,660
imaginary friend is weird. I never had an imaginary friend. I was I had an active

207
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,260
imagination as a child. I never had an imaginary friend. I guess I imagined

208
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,960
that I was a monster.

209
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:26,580
You were the imaginary friend. I became the creature. I used to ride the vacuum

210
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,540
and say that I was a superhero named Oak Man. Used to ride the vacuum? When I

211
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,740
was a little boy. Used to ride that shit? You know the vacuums that have the...

212
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,740
You ride enough of that shit, bro? They have the... Face hitting the vacuum?

213
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,020
They have the thing right there, like the big part of it that goes to the

214
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,060
wall, and then they have like the thing right there. The big cord? You know

215
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,540
what I'm talking about? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's the vacuum that's

216
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,580
there's two parts, right? There's like the thing with the tank and then

217
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,240
there's the suction thing that's like the cord that goes up. The hose?

218
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,820
Okay. The hose, yes. That's the word you're... The thing that goes to the

219
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:58,340
wall? The thing that goes to the wall is the cord, but I'm not talking

220
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:01,460
about a one piece vacuum, I'm talking about a two piece vacuum. I know

221
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,500
these are old. Yes, I used to sit on that and I would hold the thing on

222
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,820
my back and I said that I was moat man. I don't know what moat was.

223
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,580
Moat of dust. Moat of dust.

224
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:18,140
Maybe that's what the word means. My grandma had a, have you guys ever encountered this?

225
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,660
A central vacuum? Yes. Where it's in the wall. We had one of those and then my parents shut

226
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,260
it off. It's literally a hole in the wall and you plug a tube into it. That's crazy.

227
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,780
Isn't that crazy? And it all goes to like some place in your house. I want that. It

228
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:34,780
was amazing. We had one in our house. That must be the one that's the best to fuck. It

229
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,700
was like a big thing in the 80s and 90s. It's definitely the best to fuck. I put an action

230
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:42,660
figure in that silly you and I lost your action figure. Yeah, I think my old

231
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,700
brother definitely put his nutsack on it. Yeah, I you guys had that my

232
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,140
grandma. Yeah, I want to have that. We had one in our house, but it didn't

233
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,980
work. They shut it off when I worked at the liquor store. I do use one of

234
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,060
those really old commercial ones where it's got the big like cloth bag like

235
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:02,900
a full like nineteen fifties. Yeah, I haven't ever used one of those. That's

236
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,220
the one way we have an oric in our house. We used to have that as

237
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:10,980
glass shop that I worked at. Clean up all the glass man. And it would cut holes in the bag.

238
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:15,140
Yeah, that's what happened. And then it would fly out and it would kill every single person

239
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,420
in the whole building. No, that didn't happen. I witnessed a crime today. I saw a lady get

240
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:24,820
hit by a car. Oh, that kind of trumps my thing. I think she passed away. Sorry, continue. I didn't

241
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:30,340
say anything. What crime did you see? I was at the lot less over by on Fresh Pond. I know it.

242
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:36,340
and there was a guy stealing what looked like a bunch of hair gel in his jacket.

243
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Did he look like Elvis?

244
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,340
No, I wish.

245
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:44,340
But he had like four or five things and then the owner...

246
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,340
I heard like a scuffle start. I heard like a scuffle happen.

247
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,340
The sound of a scuffle starting.

248
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,340
A sound of a scuffle.

249
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,340
And then I heard, "Leave me alone."

250
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
"Alright, here we go!"

251
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,340
"And it's time to start!"

252
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,340
"Here we go!"

253
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
The fists winding up.

254
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,440
you

255
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,800
somebody doing a giant falcon

256
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,080
charging it up,

257
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,080
but the manager I could hear them like rest like rustling around and then like

258
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,420
one of the things falls out. It's like either hair Joe's either hair gel or

259
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:19,960
skin cream or something. I don't know what, but he was stealing a fuck ton of

260
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:25,440
it and the manager of the store like is like he was like grabbing him like I

261
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,780
I don't think that he should have been hitting him as much as he was. I think

262
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:33,780
that like... He's got his hair gel. I think that he broke the barrier between

263
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:38,320
like subduing... Managers always do. Yeah, but then I hear him go like, like

264
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,660
they're, like the guy's just like, "I'll drop everything if you just let me go.

265
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,300
You don't have to call the police," which I was like, "Yeah, that's fair if I

266
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,420
can let him do that," and then, you know, I chimed in.

267
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:53,020
Well, that's... Yeah, sorry. I'd like to say... That seems fair.

268
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,120
talking up well

269
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,980
sir. I mean he said he's going to put it down. We just let him go. I just

270
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,420
don't need to involve the police here yeah, but then so then that happens and

271
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,700
then the guy is like moving him around and everything and he's the I hear the

272
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:10,700
manager go. He's just like you broke my arm. You just broke my arm, but I look

273
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,780
and the guys already has the cast of

274
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,700
that's true

275
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,420
He already had a fucking sign.

276
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
He had a cast on.

277
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,420
Yeah, you know he had signatures.

278
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,420
He had a baby.

279
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,420
He was like, "Where are my other three?"

280
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,420
And everybody here signed my cast because they support me and not you.

281
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:32,180
Everybody saw you break my arm and I put the cast on so fast.

282
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,020
That is a pretty, that's a layup for the cops when the cops get there.

283
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,780
You say, "Well, he broke my arm, obviously."

284
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,660
So then I'm waiting outside and the guy's like gone.

285
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,180
I was waiting for my girlfriend to leave because she like went to the back of the store for

286
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,180
some reason.

287
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,860
Probably to steal something else.

288
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:46,860
Probably, yeah.

289
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:52,300
probably going to fucking steal some makeup, too. And this old woman did

290
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:55,440
exactly what I was joking about doing, where she looked at the guy and went,

291
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,680
"You shouldn't have done that. When the police come, they're going to arrest

292
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:58,900
you."

293
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:06,940
It was, like, so fucking crazy. This little old Polish woman going, "Uh-uh,

294
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,180
you should not have done that. You should not have hit him." If you're a

295
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,620
manager, though, if you're a manager, you got to risk it for the biscuit, man.

296
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:19,060
do there. You know, do this is a lot less. This is where, like products go to die.

297
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,020
This is like they have a

298
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,300
going to get fucking

299
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,500
promotion shit there that you didn't think would exist like they have like

300
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,780
this guy, he has to be an action figures, US Army branded, no under

301
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,700
every every single, you know, under guitar, so every every manager at a

302
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:40,060
place like that is their entire existence. Is there have boiling evil

303
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:43,180
rage? Oh yeah surface, they're just they dude his

304
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,260
every day you can only you can only vent so much amount of steam on your

305
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:51,800
employees. You can only get you can only get out so much by like yelling at

306
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,680
your employees to go rearrange the shelves so that when someone picks up a

307
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,820
thing of hair gel and walks out by accident, you're ready to just voles

308
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:02,260
over the counter. Teen things of air yeah, see that's a felony like yeah. It

309
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,420
was like a lot of people shoplift because they're starving, they're

310
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:09,980
hungry and they need it. This guy probably had a family of fifteen babies

311
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,520
to care

312
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,800
giant that he needed to style so they could get jobs as child models, but he

313
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,660
is not easy to survive. That's true. It was so crazy. It's pretty much the only

314
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:23,520
way out. Oh, absolutely, but he like grabbed the guy, the guy spun around

315
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,640
because he was trying to get out the door and then like as he dropped one,

316
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,500
he's like that's all of it and the guy was like I know you have more and then

317
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,020
he like spun and then

318
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,380
it's so funny for one to fall like that's all of it. I expect to be like

319
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:36,920
Okay,

320
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,580
bye dude. It was like Sonic's rings like

321
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,860
that the fucking every single time that the manager hit him another thing of

322
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,120
hair

323
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:52,180
jacket that he was wearing. That's awesome man. Dude, you know that, you

324
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:55,660
know that man, all these poor teenagers who work at that store about to get so

325
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,460
old women. Oh really? Yeah. So like the old women were like pushing customers

326
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:04,380
away so that they could fight and like the old women were kind of like,

327
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,020
like I don't even know it was like they were like Praetorian guards like

328
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:09,420
they were

329
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,460
standing there.

330
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,220
They were full. Like blocking?

331
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,500
Like blocking. Yeah, like they had a...

332
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,780
You should have ran them over, man.

333
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:21,020
Dude, it was like a... It's like they set up a fucking boxing ring to

334
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,340
like keep everybody, like keep all the customers watching this guy get the

335
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,860
shit kicked out of him. It was insane. I think that more... I'm so pro

336
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:32,100
fighting like that. I think that that should happen. Anytime that... If you

337
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,940
have a disagreement with somebody who works at a place or they have a

338
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:37,640
disagreement with you. They should do that. They should be fighting. Yeah,

339
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,800
especially at that lot less. You shouldn't be complaining, sending a survey

340
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,840
and all this shit. Fuck that, man. Kill each other. Yeah. The weirdest part

341
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:51,980
was all the old... Everyone gathered around, right? And all the older women

342
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:57,480
who shop there, they're buying weird Mitsubishi toothpaste or whatever.

343
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,600
They're all

344
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:03,760
excited to watch this. It's the most amazing thing I've ever had. They don't

345
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,260
I have anything to Chris. So like there's like the one the one old woman who is

346
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:12,280
saying like you should have done that you're going to go to jail to and then

347
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,120
like these other women like I would have done way worse.

348
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:19,920
I would have fucking killed the guy respect to them. I scared a guy this

349
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,120
morning. I just oh yeah, you popped out of your apartment and jumped on him. No,

350
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,240
that's a lie. I was walking. I went to the grocery store and I was walking back

351
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,600
and I was holding on my groceries. It's just a straight line walk back. I don't

352
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,780
turn or anything. So I was walking. I just walking behind a guy. I was just

353
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:39,420
walking in front of me for like many blocks. I was walking behind him and

354
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:39,660
then

355
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,180
when I we cross the street, cross the street and then knows we cross the

356
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,680
street. He turned around. He like kind of like like I could see he was doing

357
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,940
the thing where he's trying to look over his shoulder a little bit without

358
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,120
looking and then he did turn around like all the way to look and he started to

359
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:54,960
turn back and then he went like

360
00:19:55,780 --> 00:20:00,820
full like double take job. He got scared. He's got scared of me and then it may

361
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:05,280
be made me like because you immediately after he did that I'd turn the other way

362
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,060
and he kept walking. So it's like he noticed me and I was like Oh,

363
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,640
I gotta go.

364
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,460
I can feel you in his wind bro. Yeah, I guess so. I guess I was kind of your

365
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:22,260
aura was too strong. Sometimes I do I do try and send messages to the people I'm

366
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:25,540
walking behind. I think I walk by and so on for a while and I just think like

367
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:28,240
nothing for a block. I just think I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill

368
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,660
you. I'm going to

369
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:33,560
turn around, see if they clock it, start walking, fellas, every many people

370
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,820
not sensitive to this time. I must have accidentally sent something out. I was

371
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,620
probably thinking something like can't wait to get these groceries home. Yeah,

372
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,420
he may be he thought he thought he was a

373
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:46,540
head. Yeah, oh my God, is there a grocery here? I can't wait to blow up

374
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:50,620
his home. Yeah, yeah, there's a can't wait to take this gross man home.

375
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:57,520
Yeah, that's I'm like a really, really fast Walker too, which is like my

376
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,640
girlfriend hates it. It's a full brag. No, it's also not true.

377
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,340
One of the slowest walkers I've ever watched.

378
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:08,280
Insanely slow walker. Okay, I'm faster than my girlfriend and I'm usually...

379
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,660
Congrats, she's three feet tall. My girlfriend's not three feet tall. One

380
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,380
time we were talking about how long it takes to walk somewhere. And she's

381
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,800
young too. One time we were talking, I remember this. Here's my evidence I'll

382
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:22,200
represent twenty she's twenty one man. She's just turned nineteen.

383
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,140
We're talking about how long it took to walk somewhere and he was looking at

384
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:28,880
the Google Maps time and he said it would take him longer than the Google

385
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,260
Maps time to walk somewhere. What are you talking about? When was that? I

386
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,320
don't remember when it was. I remember it happening. Okay, well, I'm faster

387
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:40,560
than my girlfriend because girls walk slow man. Yeah, I was literally the

388
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,700
girl walk time yeah, but sometimes I'm like two or three blocks ahead of not

389
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:49,900
blocks. What's your bad boyfriend walking three blocks?

390
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:58,800
I mean, for some reason in my head, I thought that for a split second here, I

391
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:04,160
thought that blocks meant like, like a Minecraft block. Yes, yes. And you know,

392
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:09,000
on the sidewalk where it divides, right? Right. The sidewalk tiles, the sidewalk

393
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,120
tiles. Yeah, I'll be like three tiles of a head of her. How far is it? I don't

394
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,920
you know it's pretty close about four hundred and fifty blocks that way.

395
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:22,020
Yeah, the thing is I have I have the thing to where I've walked pretty fast.

396
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,520
If I'm on but and I all but I also if I'm walking behind somebody, I have to

397
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,300
pass them. I can't be walking behind people and this today was a day where

398
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,140
I'm still like you know I'm recovering from my illness and I carry a bunch of

399
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,160
groceries. So I was like you know what I you normally would pass this guy, but

400
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,920
I'll let it ride today. I'll walk behind him for a while and look what happened.

401
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:42,480
I ruined his day. No, I always scared his the daylights out of because of how

402
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:48,040
because of how like you like we probably walk around the same speed. Nope, but I

403
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:54,360
mean we are both we are both in the upper the upper percentile of walkers, the

404
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,080
upper half, keep reaching buddy, because you're both you're five foot five. Yeah,

405
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,200
yeah, I am five foot five. I don't I'm not ashamed of that.

406
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,280
Look it up. I'm five foot five, five foot five inches tall. So when I stand

407
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,520
up, when I stand up, it's not going to be much different than this. You get

408
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,240
disorder. When you yeah, look, you're in a booster chair.

409
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:21,120
That's it. That's how tall I am, but we're like like we walk behind people

410
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,540
and people always look behind because we are weird and walking way too fast.

411
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,540
Yeah, we're walking faster than a normal person. I'm walking with it when I walk

412
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,080
behind someone when I'm walking within twelve inches of them. Yeah,

413
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,300
dude, it's the worst at night. It's like an old woman who keeps turning around

414
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,220
and chasing her way. Yeah, I have a big butcher's knife. That's because I'm

415
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,420
going home. I just watched Babish. I want to make a you just got it in the

416
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,760
from adventure brothers or whatever,

417
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,340
and I just got this big cleaver in the man. I'm heading home to cook bitch.

418
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,680
I'm looking behind you like I'm going to kill you. I might kill you because

419
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,100
you're annoying me. You know what I'm doing like little like I'm walking fast

420
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,260
and I'm doing little jogging style workout. What I do in that situation if

421
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,580
I'm walking down if I'm yeah walking home from the train and it's dead of

422
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,420
night, you know, middle of the night and there's nobody on the street. It's just

423
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:11,760
me and there's a woman walking in front of me. I I'm on the ground like a

424
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,600
spider. I'm not going to cross the street because I need to be on one side

425
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,600
of the street for efficiency, because if I turn to turn right and be on the

426
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,180
right side of the street, I'm not going to cross over and cross back. That's

427
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,340
I'm going to barrel through. So what I do yeah is I just want to start walking

428
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:23,680
away.

429
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,420
Dude, I'm on which usually I think makes people really uncomfortable. He's just

430
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,200
a speed up all for his backwards style, like this walking towards her. Usually

431
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,920
I crank my head all the way around. What you have to do what you got actually got

432
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:43,060
you got on your left and that voice exactly yes, you have to do that yeah,

433
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,860
then I think you got a little bit of thing is to yeah. I'm not so bad. I'm

434
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,800
not so invest. I'm sorry that you're an untrusting person, but I'm going to blow

435
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,440
by you and you're going to hole. There's nothing. Are you supposed to walk behind

436
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,420
or pass? I'm going to run so fast that there's just going to be a right behind

437
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:02,480
my clothes. There's gonna be a cloud. I'm gonna be nude running home. Are you

438
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,220
supposed to pass by them like just kind of speed up and overtake them, which can

439
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:09,120
be very scary, because it's like you're chasing them down or are you supposed to

440
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,200
more courteously just walk directly behind them for eight to ten blocks and

441
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,620
then realize you forget you forgot where you're going. Sometimes get confused

442
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,020
think maybe you're walking with someone you know for a couple of blocks. Yeah,

443
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:24,060
yeah, well, it's directly yeah yeah, here's what I do man. You got to get

444
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,460
right up to them because it's it's the middle of the night. You don't want to

445
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:30,300
make a scene or be loud to be alarming, so you get right behind them and then

446
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:34,140
you get really close to their ear and go, "On your left." And then you pass.

447
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,940
Then you do the Hannibal Lecter.

448
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,940
"I'm right here. I'm behind you. I'm here."

449
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:38,940
Hannibal Lecter.

450
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:43,780
Yeah, because the gum's falling out of my mouth. I'm trying to get it back in.

451
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:49,780
I had an experience one time where, I think I might have talked about it, but I was the

452
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:54,660
guy who kept looking behind because I think I was going to meet you guys at a restaurant

453
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,260
and I ended up, there's like that cemetery near Stanhope and there's this old Indian man

454
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:04,220
man who creeped up behind me, tap me on the shoulder and made me take my air

455
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:08,100
pods out to tell me that my air pods are giving me radiation poison. Oh yeah,

456
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:13,740
stop listening to music. He's right man. Oh fuck him. I need my tunes tunes. I

457
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:17,740
mean I need tunes every single day. Have fun enjoying tunes when you're on

458
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,140
chemotherapy. I would rather that's probably the only thing you can enjoy on

459
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,980
can imagine how amazing music sounds when you're on chemotherapy. Actually,

460
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,820
you can't eat any food brain being stimulated by radiation, evolve into a

461
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,580
form of music-based consciousness.

462
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,420
Just listening to Pink Floyd in the fucking bed.

463
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,860
What's that Josh Brobin song?

464
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
The "Horty Volare"

465
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
Dude, I would just get super into like...

466
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,860
From Step Brothers actually?

467
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,860
I would just get super into noise and Mers-Bow and stuff

468
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,860
so that when I got put in the MRI

469
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,860
I'd feel like I was at a concert.

470
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Zone out.

471
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
A new type of enjoyment.

472
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,860
Take some Molly, man.

473
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,860
Take some Molly for the MRI.

474
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,860
Dude, that sounds great.

475
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Sounds fun as fuck.

476
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,860
That'd be so scary.

477
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:02,560
just yeah to have cancer yeah, no to be in an M. R. I machine on molly just

478
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,600
like how you'd be feeling the most fun time as long as you get a glass of

479
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:12,720
water. I feel like I would just feel the iron in my body moving, bro having

480
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,320
sex in the M. R. I. Oh, my people have done that man. They do that, but

481
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,040
they're not allowed to thrust it all. They have to just sit there. Mormon

482
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,120
style just soaking in there. I just said that, but you seem to know a fact who's

483
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,960
having sex in an M. R. When they do have like M. R. I sex things like when they

484
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:33,240
they M. R. I sex, they have they they they took an M. R. I of two people

485
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:38,760
having sex, but it wasn't sex. It was literally science. Why they do this to

486
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,960
see to see what it would be like to see what I feel like they should have all

487
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,280
the stuff like that. They should have gotten that done back in like one thousand

488
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,480
and ten. Well, they didn't have any more. How many more questions we need to

489
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,400
answer of like what is the X ray look like of a guy's penis? Yeah, what is the

490
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,520
extra different now? No, they're not. Yeah, penis cocks have changed. No, not

491
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,040
since 19.

492
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:03,360
I've changed their last hairy because we have made

493
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:09,280
expert. That's true. Yeah, you do seem like an expert. I'm 1910. The hair

494
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,320
grows up all the way at my shaft.

495
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,480
Yeah, I guess I'm on search. I get straight. No, I get stray hairs that go

496
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:20,240
all the way up to the border. Yeah, yeah, right where the meat meets the tip.

497
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,200
Yeah, that's where I get it. There's a way the rubber meets the road man.

498
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
That's like Frank Zappa down there. Yeah,

499
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:31,720
yeah, I've had I've had ingrown hairs on my shaft. Oh, that's the worst. You

500
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:35,480
think you got herpes or something and then you're like, wait a minute. I don't

501
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,200
I don't fuck around. Yeah,

502
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,640
wait, I'm a virgin. I'm fifteen.

503
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,960
I guess I'll just pop this into my mouth.

504
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:46,040
One hundred percent. I told you guys about this, but I had an ingrown hair on

505
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,080
my balls, thought that I had cancer and have my dad look at it. Really? Yeah,

506
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,480
Give a little have your doctor look at it because I was asking my dad to take me

507
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,080
to the hospital.

508
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,760
His dad is a doctor.

509
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,960
I begged his dad to look at it.

510
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,120
I begged my dad to take me to the hospital and he said, I bet it's not

511
00:28:59,120 --> 00:28:59,600
cancer.

512
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,880
I bet it's an ingrown hair.

513
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,960
And I said, well, I don't know what that looks like.

514
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,400
Don't tell me he reached his fingers out and went.

515
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,120
No, he didn't touch it, but he did look at it.

516
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,680
He looked with a jealous look.

517
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,360
He got down on his knees and looked at it.

518
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,360
Are you for real?

519
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:17,920
Your dad got down on his knees in front of you and unzipped your pants and

520
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,840
looked at your balls?

521
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,640
I had my balls out over the top like it was like I was holding like you did the

522
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,840
reverse. You know when you put the dick underneath the balls? That's funny.

523
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,640
Yeah, I did that to show my... 'cause I didn't want my dad to see my penis,

524
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,120
obviously. How old were you? I was 16 years old. Okay. And I showed my father

525
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,400
my nutsack through my jeans and he

526
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,080
kneeled down.

527
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,120
That is gross, man. That's not a right thing to do. And he said,

528
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,040
once he looked at it, he went, "Oh, come the fuck on," and left the

529
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,520
bathroom.

530
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,020
really that's how bad of a hypo.

531
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:53,020
He went into the bathroom.

532
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,560
The funniest thing is something like that. You guys both know that this is

533
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:01,200
not right to do. This is not okay, so you have to go into a smaller room.

534
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,160
This is not something that can be in an open air. This is even in a bedroom.

535
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,240
What did you see? Did you lock the door? No,

536
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,760
also like most of my family was in the kitchen. Anyway, I came back home, so

537
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,680
you couldn't have done anything.

538
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,520
and I was I was that's how I mean you guys met me like just God, just the

539
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,320
knowledge of like

540
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:27,180
we need to do this in a in a little light room. Yeah, this can't. This is a

541
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:30,740
medical procedure. Yeah, this needs to be in the room where I where I shit. I

542
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,640
can't do this in the room where I sleep and have dreams. We're getting out of

543
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:37,400
the the love suite. We have to leave the the hot tub. The I should have done in

544
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,220
the basement. Yeah, that would have been good, but you guys you guys knew like

545
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,960
when when you first met me just how bad of a hypochondriac I was and just like

546
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:49,180
like COVID changed my whole life. It made me realize I don't care.

547
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,680
It made you lose your twenties. You lost your twenties to COVID. Yeah. And your girlfriend

548
00:30:54,680 --> 00:31:01,460
lost her teen years. Oh, because your girlfriend's like 15 or 16. My girlfriend's not 15. She's

549
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:06,380
24 years old or 25. She just turned 25 on Thanksgiving. That's none of my business,

550
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,500
man. Why are you boring me? I told you my girlfriend turned 25 on Thanksgiving. Shut

551
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:14,020
up, dude. I'm going to look at this snow. Don't look at the snow. Oh, I could have.

552
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,860
I probably got the worst tree of all time.

553
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,700
- Yeah, you did.

554
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,520
- 'Cause it's just, it's--

555
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,100
- I told, dude, we should have went to Home Depot

556
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,260
and got the mouse.

557
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,420
- The mouse would have been an amazing mouse.

558
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,260
- The mouse would have been so--

559
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,100
- I still don't even know what the mouse is.

560
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,140
- There's still time.

561
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,980
- You haven't seen the mouse?

562
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,800
- There's one of those--

563
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,060
- I'll show you later.

564
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,540
- You got a photo on your phone of it.

565
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,820
You could show that.

566
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:30,660
- I'll find it.

567
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:33,380
- Actually, Julio, look up Home Depot Christmas Mouse.

568
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
- That's not gonna come up, I promise.

569
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,220
- It'll come up immediately.

570
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,620
- It'll probably come up immediately.

571
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,580
- There's basically no world where that comes up.

572
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,700
- Christmas Mouse.

573
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,000
Oh, there is. Yeah, that's him.

574
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:48,300
There he is right there. What is his name again? He had an amazing name.

575
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:52,160
Oh, he's called customers also viewed. Oh, man. Wait, is he sold? No,

576
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,500
30 inch Christmas mouse. 30 inch Christmas mouse. Look at him.

577
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,840
He has got some cookies and he's got a candle. He's so cute. He's standing

578
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,600
on a cookie, too. And he also lives on a cookie. He lives on a

579
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,420
cookie and he's as small as a mouse. He's got his tail draped around his

580
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,520
foot in kind of a weird way that I don't like. It looks like poop,

581
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,860
man. Yeah, it actually looks like a white poop. I want to say his name was like

582
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:17,020
cherish or something. Click the product details. He's so adorable and he's

584
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,060

00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:25,660
Makes me made my day. I absolutely love my new Christmas rodent.

586
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,780
Whoa!

587
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,620
LED's did not last two weeks. Well, it doesn't matter. You still have a little

588
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,740
mouse. Say hello to my little friend. My little friend works well and not pricey.

589
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:36,440
Love the size and the coloration. Me too. My grandchildren love them.

590
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,360
Love Our Mouse. Scroll up to the product details real quick. Love My Christmas

591
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,360

592
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,360
Rodent. Love My Christmas Rodent. It's an episode name. Yeah, it is. Whoa!

593
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,360
Oh, it's... Oh, my God. What? What are you talking about? Oh, there's all these

594
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,360
cubes. Oh, that's what you were surprised by? Yes. You were amazed at? Yes.

595
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,360
Yeah, I don't remember what the exact name of it is. Did you guys as families

596
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:06,360
ever do Christmas decorations outside grandmas? No. No. No. No. No. No. No.

597
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:11,400
decorations outside growing up? Yeah. Like did you guys go crazy? I mean, you've seen

598
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,880
you've seen like a wreath on the door. My child's decorated inside. Do you do lights?

599
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:20,800
Not like I did some lights outside, but probably just to read. I mean, if we did, that was

600
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,400
definitely over early in childhood. I feel like we never did any inflatables or anything

601
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,200
like that. I could see my son definitely had a bunch of shit like that. And my my family

602
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,360
kind of hated it. I think I love lights on the back porch. But that was it. Like we couldn't

603
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,560
I mean, I don't know we had like

604
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,940
well, you're going to have a front yeah. We had like no roof access and like

605
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,980
like you weren't allowed to like we couldn't put like like lights and shit

606
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:45,500
on the roof.

607
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:49,600
I think that I could see myself getting older and being one of the

608
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,300
Christmas lights, Christmas lights, peoples that's the may freak me out. I

609
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,600
can't think I like the the Halloween ones. There's somebody in ones are

610
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:00,200
better than the Christmas. There's one near our near our know the place where

611
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,640
you take the dog that is like they go all out for every fucking holiday. They do

612
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,300
go all out for Thanksgiving, Halloween, Christmas and now Halloween. They had a

613
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:12,960
big banner that said the Ridgewood Coven, and when you walked by, they had it,

614
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,760
they had like a screen that was built into the window and like a big pot, a

615
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,560
boiling pot with like fog, and you would walk by and a witch would go.

616
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,060
That's got to be a business. I don't know. No, no, no, it's a bunch of fat

617
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,020
ladies. Oh,

618
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,240
There's a house near my mom's old house where they had a for Halloween one year.

619
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,240
They put up a skeleton with like a carriage like a skeleton with a skeleton

620
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:41,340
horse and a carrot and a carriage and then they just left it up forever and

621
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,540
now every holiday.

622
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,740
They just decorate the skeleton in the carriage with whatever the different

623
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:46,040
holiday.

624
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:46,840
That's cool.

625
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:47,640
Isn't that fun?

626
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,140
They put like that's what I'm saying as an idea like that's maybe that's a fun

627
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:52,940
year-round thing like for when it was September.

628
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,540
They put like back to school stuff.

629
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,840
My mom's neighbors.

630
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,640
Yeah, my mom's neighbor had

631
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,600
actually my mom's neighbor had a skeleton.

632
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:03,240
There's a sign that says I died.

633
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:09,040
No, they were my mom's neighbor has a skeleton where they do that. It's

634
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,240
Halloween skeleton that sits on the front porch on the on the bench and then

635
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,040
at Christmas they put us and put a Santa yeah, yeah, it's that simple man.

636
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,840
That's like

637
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,540
yeah, that was like I thought that was a sign of pure redneckness because of

638
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,440
that Gretchen Wilson song redneck woman.

639
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,340
The chorus says something about leaving her Christmas lights.

640
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:30,040
No, it's "We'll have Halloween on Christmas," Blink-182.

641
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:33,040
No, I'm thinking of the "Country and Females" song.

642
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,040
"We'll have Halloween on Christmas."

643
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,040
Why do you want double Halloween, you sick fuck?

644
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,040
"We'll have Halloween on Christmas."

645
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,040
It's because they're gothic.

646
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,040
Blink-182 is the most goth band I've ever heard.

647
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,040
That's their only gothic song.

648
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,040
Their whole discography is goth.

649
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,040
It's not gothic, it's more skater-pump type.

650
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
No, it's not as goth as fuck. Adam's Song.

651
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
Adam's Song is not goth.

652
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,040
(singing)

653
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,160
the songs are goth. They're not goth. You guys don't know. Damn it. It's a swear.

654
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:02,320
Damn it. I'm too god. We went to the coffin club and you guys weren't even

655
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,000
educated on gothic behavior. I know everything about goth stuff because I've

656
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,880
been a joiner since my life. A joiner? You've been a joiner, Lucas. Been a

657
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:14,440
member since my life. Oh, no, wait. But what do members do? They join. So I've

658
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,520
been a joiner. You joined your member with a guy. Yeah. That'd be fine in

659
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:21,360
goth culture. Goth culture... No, it wouldn't, my friend. Yeah, goth...

660
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,160
We actually, in the goth world, we actually celebrate homosexuality.

661
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:27,720
For some reason in the 80s, it's like ancient Rome.

662
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:33,840
Good chunk of the goths also kind of like fascist, like Nazi types.

663
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:34,840
It's industrial.

664
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,840
It's the spikes, man.

665
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:36,840
It must be the spikes.

666
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,840
It's the industrial stuff, right?

667
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,840
Isn't it, I feel like?

668
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
I think so.

669
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,780
As all the industrial people, there was like, what if we made music that sounded like a

670
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,320
toaster and we dressed as if we were Nazis?

671
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:48,160
Well, it's also like, what was that guy, Death in June?

672
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,400
That's a Nazi guy that made...

673
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,960
death in June is Nazi status. Yeah, not so you didn't know that I don't even

674
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,840
really know what that is. I never listen. I don't even really know all I know

675
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:02,440
about death and do is that it's Nazi status. Yeah, I heard one song and I

676
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,160
like sure it's good. I heard

677
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,880
I liked it. I made a man. I think about these Nazis and they make amazing

678
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,880
music. Some Nazis do. I hate to say it. I'm Kanye West.

679
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,880
Burzum, I never listened to Burzum. It doesn't seem like I don't care about

680
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:20,240
Burzum, but some of the other bands that he was in those ones are good mayhem.

681
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,160
Mmm, him's good. I fuck with mayhem. See I'd rather just listen to

682
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:32,200
Especially this time of year frankly Christmas music frankly Sinatra frankly Sinatra who has been you know

683
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:37,760
Kind of what happened him when did he die? He died in the 1990

684
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:45,040
Really, I think look that he was around forever. Yeah. Yeah, it's rumored that he is one of those guys. He thought would be around forever

685
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,040
forever.

686
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,040
It's a rumor. It's a rumor that he's Eddie Murphy's father.

687
00:37:52,040 --> 00:38:00,360
Yeah, I think I remember him at the beginning of Raw when he's doing the flashback to him

688
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
as a kid.

689
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,080
Yeah, it's Frank Sinatra sitting on the chair.

690
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,080
Yeah.

691
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Watching Little Eddie.

692
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,760
Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy that that's his father.

693
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,200
Who do you guys think, do you guys think that you, it's possible you have a celebrity father

694
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:15,680
are long lost out there. Sometimes I look at my dad and I'm like, there's no way I'm related

695
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:20,480
to you. My mom told me that I look exactly like my father. He told me a few times that

696
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,360
Evan Dando from the Lemonheads, you know, that is. Oh yeah. He followed him. He followed

697
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:30,820
her around at a party in high school that could leave her alone. Lemonheads is it's

698
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:36,120
a shame about Ray. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Fire as a part bit part of your life. That's a good

699
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:40,720
good song. Good fucking there. Yeah, I think they really only have one Boston

700
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,120
baby album. Yeah, their other stuff has a like a few good songs. Yeah, they did

701
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:48,640
they were they did they were punk. They had one album there. They had a few

702
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,280
stuff where they were punk first and they changed to be indie rock and their

703
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:54,320
indie rock stuff is way better. But there are a few good songs from anyway. It

704
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,760
doesn't matter. They went crud. They went crunk went indie unfortunately, but it

705
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,480
is it's good as Punk went into streets hip hop, but that's crank man. They're

706
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:07,780
Massachusetts status, but yeah and that's all we like that's all. I like

707
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:11,620
here a podcast about my mom dated a football player that passed away

708
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:16,320
jealous. I think my mom went on a date with Roger Clemens or she won a dinner

709
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,760
with him.

710
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:21,320
Really one a dinner was the inspiration for friend.

711
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:25,120
What

712
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:30,320
was the friend? Wait, what do you mean? What's the who's Roger Clemens is Roger

713
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,260
Clemens? Roger Clemens is a Red Sox picture. I thought Roger Clemens, the guy

714
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,720
wrote a frindle. Oh no, and then I believed it because he said it. No,

715
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,560
the guy wrote frindle. I don't know. Roger Clemens was on the Red Sox, then

716
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,920
he got traded to the Yankees. My mom, I wish that was I wish you'd most said

717
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,440
that your mom did the guy wrote frindle. That's fully what I thought.

718
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,440
He said that crazy. I think she won like a dinner date with him, but it

719
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,040
wasn't a date because I think she was with my dad at the time, but there's

720
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,760
like photos of my mom with Roger Clemens, and when I was a kid, I thought

721
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:06,600
I thought that she bragged about it to me because Roger Clemens, I think, was still on the Red

722
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
Sox at the time.

723
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:12,200
And then I was like, "Well, what if he's actually my father and I'm actually destined for baseball

724
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,200
greatness?"

725
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,180
Oh, and it would be like, maybe you would have lived your whole life and then you get

726
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
onto the field.

727
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:21,180
Yeah.

728
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,180
And it just clicks Henry Rowan.

729
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,680
And you just feel like you've lived part of your life.

730
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
Yeah, not like 85 or 90 years old.

731
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Yeah, but maybe like 28.

732
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,680
Yeah.

733
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:29,680
So some part of your life.

734
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,400
your life. Just part fully you never know when you'll die. I didn't really mean

735
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,400
all of your life. My mom dated Joe Coy for about twenty five years.

736
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,840
Yeah,

737
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:44,200
so it could be my dad man straight up. I could see that

738
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,280
why

739
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,760
because I'm Vietnamese, your name, what he's not Vietnamese, he's Philippine

740
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,880
because I'm Filipino. You're you were going to be or no, I'm not I'm being to

741
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:57,800
me. You were going to be named Joseph. I was going to be Joseph like his stand up

742
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:03,300
especially yeah. I am Caleb with all the fill guys. I oh yes, it's always a

743
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,440
Caleb yeah. That was a really bad shot Caleb. I got

744
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:11,480
who's Caleb. I want to kill this guy. He's you thought it was someone else. I

745
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,240
thought he was talking to somebody else, but it turns out I was the one. He was

746
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,580
really the praise. No, he's a bad shot. Oh bad. I thought he said good. No, it's

747
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,860
this guy Frankie. He's a really good pool player. Oh Frankie was good. Frankie

748
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,660
was really, really good. He had like he had like ten kids in the grand Philippines

749
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:31,300
Frankie Cosgrave. You were playing pool with Frankie Cosgrave and you thought he was a Filipino

750
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,820
guy because of his outfit. And because of his last name.

751
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:42,020
Who did you get Frankie Grande down here? We could get Frankie Grande on here. I was

752
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:46,180
talking to somebody, I think I was talking to Eric the other day about, I was like, I

753
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,700
really want to get celebrities on the show. That's his whole podcast thing. No, no, no,

754
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:55,580
I was like we need I want to get like a booker to get like oh yeah, we were and

755
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,940
me and him were talking about what would be our podcast dream celebrity guests

756
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:02,660
and I don't know because I think it would need to be somebody that is just

757
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:07,420
so it needs to be completely out. I mean, I don't want to do the be list.

758
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:11,740
This I've said this to you guys before. I think that it has to be somebody who

759
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:16,980
is so completely out of reach and out of sphere that it is not even fun or

760
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,980
interesting to have them on because there's nothing in common. There's no

761
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:23,440
so they don't they don't want to be here. They don't like us at all.

762
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:27,620
There's not they're not promoting it to any no, we don't pay ourselves for one

763
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,980
month. Like I fall behind on rent and like and we get every one of my

764
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:37,120
papers, a fee for like like Dacre Montgomery from Stranger Things. Who's

765
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:42,120
that? The older brother in one season? I don't know who that is. Yeah, he was

766
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:45,600
also in the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie. He played the Red Ranger.

767
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,940
Okay, maybe this isn't a big enough celebrity to you guys. Sounds like a

768
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,080
I'm all so I like a celebrity for kids to my face. I like Finn Wolfhard or

769
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:54,560
then, but they sell them or no

770
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:57,720
we can get no snap. No,

771
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,520
no snap doing yeah, and that's all the old dude. He's busy. He's busy man.

772
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,160
He's enlisted. That's true. He's fighting the idea for Israel one sticker

773
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:10,360
at a time, man. We can get Finn Wolfhard. I had him on super mega some

774
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:14,000
years ago. Oh, they did. Yeah, we can get him to Finn Wolfhard. If you're

775
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,560
listening to the show, Finn Wolfhard's too old.

776
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,960
What age do we want to go for celebrities?

777
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,960
Finn Wolfhard, once you get young again,

778
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
we're rocking with you, man.

779
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
You can come on the show.

780
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
We respect you as an artist.

781
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
We respect you as...

782
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I like everything you've ever done, dude.

783
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
Pretty much. Stranger Things, love that.

784
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
It was fire.

785
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
It was fire.

786
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,960
Part 2 was okay, too, but you weren't fully in that as you were on the first one.

787
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
Yeah, but you were in that stuff.

788
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
Oh, you were in a Pup music video?

789
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,360
that don't like that song so much, but like some of their other side, I think

790
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:55,960
he was on yeah, but still or I think him and Brandon just hung out. All right, I

791
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,520
think we're not so interested anymore.

792
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,000
Then seems like you're kind of ran through when it comes to

793
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:07,080
yeah, if you're so low that you're doing Brandon's podcast, then we don't

794
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:09,480
really have any interest man. You seem desperate bro straight up

795
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,720
Leonardo DiCaprio. I do that. That

796
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:15,240
I would do that.

797
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,040
extremely and just put them right now. Dude, we got just not even talking.

798
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,200
Well, the idea we want to do sitting right there. I remember in the old

799
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,560
studio what we wanted to do because it's such a shitty basement space and we

800
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:30,320
didn't have much room at the table. We wanted to get a big guest and then have

801
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,320
a separate camera that was pointed at them and they had a really tiny chair.

802
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,200
They have they're like really like a chair. I can still do that. We can do

803
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:41,400
that in a better way and we just have to cut to them, but this is like them use

804
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,200
my computer. This is like a somewhat nice space. It'd be it wouldn't fit in

805
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,800
that well to have that nice of space. It is not that nice. It's better than the

806
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,440
old one, but it's this is a nice space. Are you crazy? This was supposed to be

807
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,040
nice. I don't know if the state of it is so

808
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,680
over there, but it was a lot funnier when there were pipes, exposed pipes

809
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:04,320
over and there was always a flood and put them in the corner with the

810
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,760
collapsing ceiling. Yeah, we could do that.

811
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:12,200
This space was supposed to be our landlord's son's Disney perfume business

812
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,360
headquarter. Oh yeah, he's going to resell Disney perfume right

813
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:22,600
like souvenir novel, funny business that could have been in anywhere could

814
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:28,100
have been a poop. Rest Disney Disney perfume resale. Speaking of spaces,

815
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:31,880
bringing up of spaces and basements, I had an idea when I was walking here.

816
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:37,240
This was today. I don't you know when you have a basement apartment and you

817
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
get the windows that are kind of just out onto the sidewalk.

818
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,380
yeah, you know, yeah, I think that the instead of having those types of

819
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:47,360
windows on basement apartments, they should extend the basement out to be

820
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,360
under the sidewalk and they should have skylights that are like plexiglass that

821
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:55,600
people walk over and you look up and the show and you just see people, you see

822
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:59,560
the sky. First of all, yeah, and you can see people walk. Oh, that would this

823
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,640
would be an up skirt

824
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:05,840
yeah, this would be an up skirters paradise. This is a night at the

825
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,680
box, but you could style up kill. So sure you could do up kilton people and people

826
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,160
so you first of all you probably have to go through a background check to get the

827
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,960
apartment to make sure you wouldn't do that. Yeah, but I have no eyes and you're

828
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,840
blind, so you could have the apartment if you're just a kind guy who doesn't do

829
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:19,400
that kind of thing.

830
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,400
But you know if you look up at somebody, they don't like it, then they can put

831
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:27,400
they can pour shit on your window. Do you think that there's like a part of the

832
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:33,080
public sidewalk, a gay Scottish ups kilt fan? Yeah, for sure there has to be

833
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:36,080
that probably was one of the first fetishes developed in the

834
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,320
eleven hundred. What was public transportation?

835
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:42,320
They got a mirror underneath the guy. Yeah, man, mirrors are old.

836
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:45,920
They have a big easel on their arm and they're trying to paint

837
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,320
whatever the guy's balls look like. Yeah, they've got watercolors. A quill?

838
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:58,820
No, no, no. Back then, back then, man, well, upskirters, upskirters back in

839
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:02,320
the olden days, they lived in the moment. They didn't need to

840
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,080
cheapen it with pictures

841
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:09,020
jack off right then and there, then kill the girl and dumper in the woods. It

842
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,940
was that simple.

843
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:12,920
That fucking simple you didn't have to have all this

844
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:16,000
my Nokia phone,

845
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,880
none of that shit existed. Yeah, you just fucking kill somebody. Yeah, you

846
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,280
don't have to you don't have to worry about what you're getting under them to

847
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:28,000
look up the skirt. You just grab them and you just say that they're a witch or

848
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:32,360
something. This is how it was back in the sixteen hundred. That's how it was,

849
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:36,080
and it was sad man. It was terrible. Things are better now. Things are way

850
00:47:36,080 --> 00:47:39,880
much, much better now. We have this now. We have a big mouth Billy Bass.

851
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:44,040
You wouldn't have... If you saw a big mouth Billy Bass in the 1600s, if you

852
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:48,360
showed this to somebody in the 1600s, they would think that you have done some

853
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:52,640
Evil Dead 2 type of Necronomicon shit to it. True. Yeah. And you have... That

854
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:57,400
would be a holy item. That item would make you king. Oh yeah. I have a

855
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,240
talking fish.

856
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:04,160
you would be the advisor to the king. I'll be like pretty. What does the fish

857
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:07,780
say about the movements of my rock and around the

858
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:13,460
here? What's he? What's he say?

859
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:24,440
He's casting a spell. I can't stop this feeling that he that means we're going

860
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:28,320
to have a good harvest. That'd be amazing to oh my God, I'm a

861
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,720
cute my queen. Yes,

862
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,480
yeah,

863
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:39,920
that's actually an amazing idea for the best movie ever. Yeah, kind of a time

864
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,760
to hear that's a pretty funny. Yes, I know sketch you know, no, no, no, no,

865
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,400
this is a feature. This is a feature army of darkness reboot. You've where he

866
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:51,680
has a big in the fully for the first part of the movie. It's primer. It's a

867
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,200
very weird kind of kind of you're thinking it's scientifically accurate

868
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,140
version of time travel right. It's like two guys building this thing for a long

869
00:48:59,140 --> 00:49:04,500
time and then they test it and they're like well, let's throw just anything in

870
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,320
there. They throw in a big mouth billy bass right yeah and then they're like

871
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,200
okay, well it's gone. So it has to be the thing and then they get in that shit and

872
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,700
then they go back to wherever what time I mean actually it'd be maybe that you

873
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:22,640
ever see the gods must be crazy. Yes, yeah, we watch that at Neil's house and

874
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,880
we watch it on mute for like most of it. Oh, I think I remember yeah and then

875
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:31,200
and somebody was saying it was the most racist movie ever made or something

876
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,600
yeah, it's about I mean I couldn't really tell because it was muted. Yeah,

877
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,360
I don't I mean I guess I saw it as a kid. My dad showed it to me, so I

878
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:41,520
don't I don't it's a doc. It's a my I feel like it's pretty pretty racist.

879
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,520
It's a mockumentary about a bunch of like a bunch of bottle falls out of the

880
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,520
guy from a plane and an African tribe and tribes and they believe that it's

881
00:49:49,560 --> 00:49:54,760
sent from the gods. So they go to return it to civilization. That's cool thing.

882
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:59,560
They showed, but it's a social studies. I showed me that in sixth grade. I think

883
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:02,760
there's two of them. I think there's a sequel. I just saw the first one. I

884
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:05,960
watched both of them. I think my dad showed me both. I don't remember much

885
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,400
about it. It reminds me of the magic conch, but anyway, it reminds me of that.

886
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,320
That's what your idea reminds me of. This is kind of like an update to take

887
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:17,960
out, to turn it from an African tribe to maybe a bunch of white, a bunch of

888
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:22,760
Nordic yeah, who are and we really are overcompensating and we make them

889
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:27,800
really, really stupid. Yeah, yeah, and big mouth Billy Bass has a lot of

890
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,700
people can be stupid too. We'll say that I'm a big

891
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:37,000
it's a great name. That is a good name. And the big mouth Billy Bass will just

892
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,560
say he has a lot of soul, if you know what I mean.

893
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:43,480
What does that mean? He's gonna be the, 'cause it's the movie about how the

894
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:46,560
white people are stupid, the big mouth Billy Bass is smarter, but he's also

895
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:50,600
so it's a machine. He's also got a smart. He's a battery. He's got a very

896
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,140
deep voice that he's singing in, which reminds you of what kind of for your

897
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:55,740
reasons.

898
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:02,140
Okay, yeah, I think this is an amazing movie and I think this is going to get

899
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:04,180
sold instantly sold

900
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,140
to the movie. We get

901
00:51:06,140 --> 00:51:12,820
you know we should do. We should have an auction where people come and they

902
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:16,340
raise their hand and they stand up and they just say an idea. Everyone bids

903
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:22,320
sold to the movies sold as a book. That's what the blacklist is for a song. We

904
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,520
should do, but it should go for everywhere. Okay, not just for me. I've

905
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,720
been wanting to make a movie or a TV show for years. Yeah, and it's so hard

906
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:33,200
because nobody likes us and we are not very good at it. He is and our agents

907
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:38,480
don't talk to us, but what if we tried to what if we sold a movie to like the

908
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,600
like Ben Shapiro's thing that he's doing daily wire. So we could do that so

909
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,880
fucking easily. Oh my God, we would just trick them into thinking that it's

910
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:50,140
like a movie of a gender critical movie. Yeah, we just make that. I think that's

911
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:54,700
not a problem. That's what s Craig's allard does. I think he's the he made

912
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:59,680
bone tomahawk and and and brawn cell blocks ninety nine and all that stuff. I

913
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:03,300
think that he gets his money from these guys into thinking the movie is gonna

914
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:07,600
be like, oh, people are weird. He could be an evil guy. I don't think he's maybe

915
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:11,040
seem like he could have hold some evil beliefs, but I do think that he

916
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:14,640
leverages it, but daily wire. Let's just make a movie. I think one of his

917
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,460
movies might be daily wire. Let's make a movie about a gay basketball and yeah

918
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:23,800
and it's in it's stuck in the sports section of a Dick sporting goods, but

919
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,280
it's called a no Dick sporting a chop your Dick's off sporting goods. Yeah

920
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,720
right and the best good and bad. The basketball is gay and a big strong white

921
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:33,040
guy comes in and blows it up and it's

922
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:42,040
and baseball them's it's no baseball them's sure yeah and well okay, we got to

923
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:45,440
I think that you got what about okay? What about it's a it's an anti woke

924
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:50,640
version of that Seth Rogan sex hot dog movie okay, okay, called buns out that

925
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:55,840
one anti woke already. No, it was an anti food was anti or was pro food. It

926
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,520
was telling the message. It was the story. It wasn't a doing. I didn't ever

927
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,680
saw that movie, but I remember it came out and I was like why does all the food

928
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:05,360
rape each other a hundred times? Yeah,

929
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:11,680
it gives a fuck of a hot dog. It's not the food. It's not the food raping.

930
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:18,720
It's a douche bag that is raping food. What? It's Nick Kroll as a douche bag,

931
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:22,840
like an enema. Oh, he's raping food.

932
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:28,720
One of the best ideas ever, man. Yeah, I'm glad that those animators were

933
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,800
starved. Yeah, that's good, man. I'm glad they're working 80,000 hours a week

934
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:34,040
to...

935
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:39,120
No time off. That's right. That's right. Nick Kroll raping food as a bag.

936
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,120
That's good.

937
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:47,300
Thank God that thank God nowadays to those animators hit crunch and they

938
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:51,200
got to work twenty six hours a day. There can do it in service of Spider

939
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:53,920
Man. Thank you. Thank you for giving me my hero.

940
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:59,920
I love Spider Man. I need more. It's all worth it when they see the looks

941
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:03,680
on those kids faces. Yeah, like this. Yeah, because they're all make a wish

942
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,400
kids coming to the animation studio and they're dead. Dad, I want to watch

943
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,320
SpongeBob instead. I want to watch another movie on my iPad while this movie is

944
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,280
going. Yeah.

945
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:13,520
Steward, you've been destroyed, children.

946
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,440
Children, you've been fucking destroyed.

947
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,040
Children, never come for us again.

948
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:20,080
Uh-huh. Don't even--

949
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:20,960
Let that be a reminder.

950
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:21,920
Uh-uh. This is a message--

951
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,600
Don't play with adults. We'll fuck you up. We're smarter.

952
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:30,720
This is a message to my niece and my nephews, okay? I'm not poopy, okay? You're

953
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:35,280
the only three children that I know that I can direct them-- actually, to all

954
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,240
all children. You are poopy man. None of us are poopy. We're not poopy and hey,

955
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:39,480
my

956
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,280
but my niece and nephews, I'm never going to get your names right. So stop

957
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,240
having your parents send me texts about what they're going to give me for

958
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:54,080
Christmas and my to my to my nephew learn how to spell turd. I heard what

959
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:59,720
happened. He said t e r d. He spelled t r d t r d. My sister sent me a voice

960
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:06,160
demo of him trying to spell turd and it was a minute long of him saying TRD and

961
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:09,960
she said no and then it was him going turd. You can't blame him though

962
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:14,160
phonetically that makes the most way that a kid learns letters. You could

963
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:17,360
understand that. It was a minute long of him saying TRD.

964
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:22,960
Turd. Why would you add "oo" into that?

965
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:23,460
exactly

966
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:30,960
tired tired to our road. Yeah, all right. We need another movie idea

967
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:37,060
daily wire wire for so okay, so they're going they want doing what they're

968
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:37,460
doing that

969
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:43,660
every single thing that comes out of daily wire is they're trying to make

970
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:49,560
some like right now they're focusing on so that their only projects have been

971
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:54,360
school shooter movie. Yeah, movie about trans people, TV show about trans people

972
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,520
inadvertently, TV show about a woodshop teacher who hates trans people. What

973
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:02,640
have we not done? What have they not done? Just a normal family... Illegal

974
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,040
immigrant. We haven't done a legal immigrant. That's true. Well, hold on.

975
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:07,080
We can do a Mumble Corps movie called Juno.

976
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:16,640
Juno Diaz? Juno. Juno. Juno. But they have not done just a family program,

977
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:21,320
right? They have got where we are going to make the daily wires Barney

978
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:26,440
because you want to target the kids directly. They're already well,

979
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:30,200
they're already complaining that every single program, Sesame Street and

980
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:33,940
everything is all be there. They're pushing their agenda. Yes. So we make

981
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:38,280
the most anti woke children's performer. And it's in a bar. It's in a

982
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:43,040
bar. It's called army. It's called army. He's an army guy. He's a played

983
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:46,080
by army hammer. Yes, who was canceled by the

984
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,640
unrightly for being a liar, six foot tall,

985
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:55,200
black hair, blue eyed army soldier yeah and we never say what army he's a part

986
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,140
of no, no, no, we don't specifically say that he's in the US or you know what

987
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:06,040
maybe maybe it's just because it was in my direct line of vision. What if the

988
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:09,800
thing is a Christmas tree? What if the character is a Christmas tree because

989
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,560
they're trying to get Christmas out of school? I don't think that been what's

990
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:18,920
his name and like that. Okay, then it's a okay and start. Well, Patrick committed

991
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:19,080
a

992
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:24,580
it will be funny when it cuts. The cut is just a

993
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:28,340
can you cut right before what he says

994
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:34,060
so you can hear all the lead up to it. So don't beep it out.

995
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:40,600
The beeps makes it seem way worse. Yeah, it does anyway. I just think that we

996
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:46,260
to be there's so many opportunities and we've just been looking at the old school Hollywood

997
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:47,260
avenues.

998
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:50,940
Can I tell you guys this is kind of outside of Daily Wire. I had an idea for a character.

999
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:56,860
I was thinking about well so there was a crossword clue about a cartoon character who sucks his

1000
00:57:56,860 --> 00:58:01,300
thumb and I just realized I haven't heard about anybody sucking their thumb in quite

1001
00:58:01,300 --> 00:58:02,300
a long time.

1002
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:03,300
That's facts.

1003
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,500
So I thought maybe a character who's an adult who still sucks his thumb could be funny.

1004
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,500
Well that could be.

1005
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,980
When he gets stressed out he starts sucking his thumb.

1006
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:14,680
he could be an SJW yeah, I mean yeah, but he could be, but just the idea to me, I

1007
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,200
guess it's kind of funny of maybe a guy who you he's at work, he's in his he's

1008
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:22,680
in his polo shirt, he's like he's working on the spreadsheet. His boss comes in

1009
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:25,940
and says, you know, I need that by two o'clock right and the guy's like two

1010
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,600
o'clock. I thought you said next week, the boss says no two o'clock, he's like

1011
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:29,440
all right, I'll get to work.

1012
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:36,380
He doesn't smoke cigarettes or anything like that. He goes outside. Can I take a

1013
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:39,980
thumb break, you know, stuff like that. It's interesting that you haven't thought about

1014
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:46,140
that considering we some of our most listened to episodes are the diaper forums, right?

1015
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:50,540
Well, people don't really talk about sucking their thumbs when they well, here's a new

1016
00:58:50,540 --> 00:58:54,940
thing that we can look up next time. We do a diaper talk. I'm so stuck in thumb war.

1017
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:00,500
Yeah, I do feel like I'm sucker for thumb war. One, two, three, four. I declare it.

1018
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:04,660
No more. What you didn't dance your finger around Pat. Wait, he has the most amazing

1019
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:12,380
strategy I've ever seen. Whoa, he has a fucking cobra of a thumb. That's why they call me the

1020
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,340
cobra. That was a dirty match. You tried to coach me. You guys should have put your hands

1021
00:59:15,340 --> 00:59:24,580
out on the table. Okay, you know what, Cameron? Still quiet, man. That was a good one. You

1022
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:31,900
stopped it. Yeah, you are so technologically illiterate, man. I'm not technologically illiterate.

1023
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,720
my watch to the right time because I accidentally set it to the wrong time

1024
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,120
yesterday. It's a stopwatch right now.

1025
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:40,880
You didn't set it to anything. You set it to stopwatch.

1026
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:46,080
Is it 3.13 right now? No, it's not. Yeah, it is. Oh, hey, my watch is fixed.

1027
00:59:46,080 --> 00:59:48,280
Oh, it is 3.13. Wait, I'm a genius.

1028
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:52,640
Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1029
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,320
What the fuck else is going on, guys?

1030
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:59,840
I have to give my cat a bunch of gabapentin because he kept trying to bite the...

1031
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,540
I had a dream last night. I had a dream last night that I had to go to the

1032
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,520
bathroom and there was an I was in. I was in a house that had two bathrooms

1033
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,860
and one of the bathrooms that I went to was the one bathroom was normal. I

1034
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,420
didn't go to it, but I knew in my head it was normal for some reason. I chose

1035
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:16,080
to go to this other bathroom. I dream, which is it was like off from the

1036
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:20,240
living room and it was like down a few steps so that it was on. It was directly

1037
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,440
and at the corner of the house and on street level and that was to wall to

1038
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,680
wall windows, but with a really like thin sheer curtains. I could see

1039
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:34,480
everybody walking by and but I was like I was there's like Oh God damn it and

1040
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:39,560
then I really had to go to the bathroom, but there was two kids that were

1041
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:43,880
walking by. I was like I can't start being while these kids can see through

1042
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:44,040
this.

1043
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:47,800
I started trying to scare them.

1044
01:00:47,800 --> 01:00:57,480
Did it work? Did they leave? Oh my God

1045
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,180
I wasn't working and I was like

1046
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:04,880
I'm just remember this. I don't know my dream. I was like I was like what am I

1047
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:10,720
doing in the bath to scare these kids and my cover probably hears me yelling

1048
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:16,140
I'm yelling and banging on

1049
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:24,380
oh my God, that's crazy. That really glad I don't have that bathroom yeah. I

1050
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:28,860
I think now we have an idea for a movie. That's an amazing idea for a movie.

1051
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:33,740
Kind of like a buried... It's called Glass House. It's like buried or 127 hours.

1052
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:38,700
Glass House and the only thing, the only real conflict in the movie is the bathroom.

1053
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,940
But all the scaring is doing is attracting more kids. Right.

1054
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:46,100
Oh, what's this? Kids like being scared. This is more of a Black Mirror episode.

1055
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,820
What? This is more of a Black Mirror episode. This is not really a movie.

1056
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:53,580
So that's what movies go to die is black mirror episodes. Those telephones

1057
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:56,380
it's a smart glass.

1058
01:01:56,380 --> 01:02:00,660
That might work, but then the kids wouldn't be real and the kids are

1059
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:03,780
tapping. You have to pee so bad, but the kids are tapping. You're stuck in

1060
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:08,140
an iPad as the background. I'm talking Ben. Yeah, you're talking about. You

1061
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:09,140
have to piss so bad.

1062
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:13,900
Get away from me! That's a great idea. That's a great idea. Talking Ben.

1063
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:17,820
Talking Ben. Talking Ben. Oh my God. Do you remember back in the day,

1064
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:21,660
people would say that like talking Tom, I was watching the other screen. I

1065
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:25,060
were a web that would also be a good black mirror. Episode is that already a

1066
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,540
black mirror episode? I don't know. I never watched a single episode of

1067
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:31,100
everything a single up. I saw the one where they were the Star Trek one. That

1068
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,380
one's cool. I think I was really, really high when I watched. What is that one

1069
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,620
about? It's they're about start so basically the plot that as I remember it

1070
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:43,420
was a Jesse Plemons. Yeah, Jesse Plemons plays a fat guy. He's in Star Trek and

1071
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:48,600
it turns out that all along the women were his slaves. He basically uploaded

1072
01:02:48,600 --> 01:02:53,300
his friends or his employees that he thought were hot into Star Trek, so that

1073
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:58,820
he could finger. So get this he was creating Star Trek yeah all along, so it

1074
01:02:58,820 --> 01:03:02,760
was so the whole episode is that he basically played the Sims. It's like

1075
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:03,420
imagine

1076
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:07,620
you were he basically it's a guy from Star Trek. Yeah, he works at an office

1077
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,380
Jesse Plymouth and all and he looked around one day and he said all these

1078
01:03:10,460 --> 01:03:14,860
fucking people I work with are such NPCs bro and I also he created them I'm

1079
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:20,360
gonna make them a litter on PCs in a video he did like face scan yeah

1080
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:28,860
like a beetle, Stephen Hawking beetle.

1081
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:31,320
- Black Mirror voice that I'm starting to do.

1082
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:32,720
- Why do you have a Stephen Hawking mouth?

1083
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:33,560
- I don't have Stephen Hawking.

1084
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,240
- Why don't you just be retracted now?

1085
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:38,200
- I don't have Stephen Hawking mouth.

1086
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:39,280
- He didn't talk with his mouth.

1087
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:41,880
- I don't, I don't want to go to Stephen Hawking right now.

1088
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,020
- Why are you looking,

1089
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,400
this is the most offensive he's ever been today.

1090
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:46,600
You are going crazy.

1091
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:47,960
- What, he's a pedophile.

1092
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,560
What am I, you can make fun of him.

1093
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,400
- Stephen Hawking wasn't a pedophile.

1094
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:52,480
- He went on Epstein's Island.

1095
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:53,320
- Yeah.

1096
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,960
- You can make fun of him all you want now.

1097
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:59,220
I think you are an island with adults, though. I think he was on there to fuck

1098
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:00,020
a wheelchair.

1099
01:04:00,020 --> 01:04:03,500
You wouldn't need to go to an island to do that.

1100
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:08,760
You gotta go to an island to do that. I don't want to watch that. I've ever

1101
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:11,900
being disabled just because he did that. I'm not making fun of him for being

1102
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:15,700
disabled. I'm making fun of his computer for having a funny voice. You think

1103
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:19,060
that you think they could have his computer could have had a better voice.

1104
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:21,540
You're gonna make fun of Chris Tucker for being black because he went to

1105
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:28,040
the island. It's okay. He went to the Epstein Island. No, no, but you know I

1106
01:04:28,040 --> 01:04:32,140
see the error of my ways. Thank you, man. Why am I all of a sudden the SJW of the

1107
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:35,720
show? Now he's just running off the leash. I don't know the hell's wrong

1108
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:40,200
with you, man. I hate being a woky SJW. You know me. I hate this crap, but

1109
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:42,660
somebody's going to put you in line. Somebody's got to put me in line. I

1110
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:47,660
was going to speak truth to power. You resurface. What did I just say? Oh, my

1111
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:47,900
God,

1112
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,100
you're tired of me punching down. Is that what you're saying? Straight up,

1113
01:04:51,140 --> 01:04:56,500
dude, yes. Here's a snowflake for you. This is me. This is me. I'm that. I'm a

1114
01:04:56,500 --> 01:05:01,140
snowflake. That is you. Oh my God. The snowflake dust is rubbing off of you from

1115
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:04,100
the Christmas tree. That's what it is. I'm covered in snowflake dust. All right.

1116
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,340
I'm going to go get a shower, clean myself up. All right. We don't have

1117
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:11,900
anything to plug, I think. Bye, bitches. Except for... Well, this is the Patreon,

1118
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:15,020
and the YouTube is probably... I mean, hopefully, if everything went well, we

1119
01:05:15,020 --> 01:05:17,340
have 10K subscribers. Bye. Bye.

1120
01:05:17,340 --> 01:05:26,460
This is also from a little one.

1121
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,460
Oh, okay.

1122
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,380
Yeah, aw, how sweet is that?

1123
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:33,020
It seems like we've taken a lot of these from kids.

1124
01:05:33,020 --> 01:05:35,940
Yeah, it's weird that we didn't get that many adults in our literature.

1125
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:36,940
It's kind of weird, right?

1126
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,460
Yeah, I feel like mostly kids.

1127
01:05:38,460 --> 01:05:42,420
I guess it makes sense.

1128
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,740
This is from Little Ben.

1129
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:52,260
Hello Santa. This year, the only thing I want for Christmas is world peace.

1130
01:05:52,260 --> 01:05:53,260
Aww, little Ben.

1131
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:55,700
Oh my god, that's so cute.

1132
01:05:55,700 --> 01:06:01,580
War, disease, social disorder. How could I sit here and wish for big red fire trucks

1133
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:06,260
or super powered action figures when some people are struggling just to afford basic human

1134
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:09,020
needs? What a smart little kid.

1135
01:06:09,020 --> 01:06:14,660
It would just be selfish. And that's the problem with this world. Selfishness. Selfish

1136
01:06:14,660 --> 01:06:19,700
corporate CEOs and money hungry politicians hogging all the wealth up top and leaving the

1137
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:20,700
little guy with nothing.

1138
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:21,700
Little Ben?

1139
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:22,700
All the way at the bottom.

1140
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:23,700
He's probably referring to himself.

1141
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:24,700
Yeah.

1142
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,700
Or his family as well at least.

1143
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:27,500
Is he related to Big Ben?

1144
01:06:27,500 --> 01:06:30,300
He could be a clock.

1145
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:31,300
All the way at the bottom.

1146
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,120
I just wish I could do something about it.

1147
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,420
You know what Santa?

1148
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:36,940
I finally decided what I want for Christmas.

1149
01:06:36,940 --> 01:06:39,460
I want a voice.

1150
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:44,740
I want a say in what direction the winds of change blow.

1151
01:06:44,740 --> 01:06:47,700
A say in the future that I'm inheriting.

1152
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:50,860
When I grow up, I'm going to run for president.

1153
01:06:50,860 --> 01:06:59,340
And I'll make sure that never again does another immigrant enter this country illegally to impregnate

1154
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,340
a white woman.

1155
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:01,340
Little Ben!

1156
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:02,340
Little Ben!

1157
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:04,840
Little Ben, what the hell are you saying?

1158
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:09,300
Right now I'm 31, so I should be able to run for president by 2028.

1159
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:13,220
And when I'm president, every border of this country will be protected by nuclear bombs

1160
01:07:13,220 --> 01:07:17,920
and big red fire trucks to put an end to you illegally flying over the border. Go back

1161
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:22,640
to your igloo, you disgusting red snow pig. Holy shit. Little Ben, what the fuck? I thought

1162
01:07:22,640 --> 01:07:27,100
you were a little ass kid. What a turn little Ben has made. I didn't know you were a grown

1163
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:32,040
man going by little Ben. I mean, his first name could be little, I guess. Little John.

1164
01:07:32,040 --> 01:07:37,380
Little John. Little Richard. Little Wayne. Actually, there might be more little men than

1165
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,120
- Yeah, a little hole in her heart.

1166
01:07:39,120 --> 01:07:41,700
(upbeat music)
