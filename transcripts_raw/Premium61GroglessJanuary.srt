42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:41,440
we were looking for women throwing them into unmarked vans. This is true. Attention DC there are unmarked vans

43
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,760
driving around throwing milfs into the back that's right made a milf disappear

44
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:53,880

45
00:02:53,880 --> 00:03:01,760
bad skin who they're just like she's a total milf we're grabbing her but yeah

46
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,720
we're back from there I should have drank some coffee before this I'm

47
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:09,040
drinking some cold coffee ice you're drinking you're drinking that out of

48
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
your little glove hand I have a goal I sustained an injury while whilst

49
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,820
golfing what was your injury his injury was he put his fist in his ass no no I

50
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,420
was reached for a ball in an alligator that'd be cooler that would actually be

51
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,800
cool if that is so sick I would not be like here right now I'd be like chubs I'd

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:37,120
be like Chuck from the show yeah you would wear it you'd be a secret agent who

53
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,900
wears Converse yeah not yeah that's the coolest thing yeah the Converse secret

54
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,580
agent kind of okay he kind of was just like they put Jim from the office and in

55
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:53,940
a CIA situation yeah but if they did that Jim or Chuck Taylor's oh yeah they did

56
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:02,140
that too yeah casual Jim yeah Chuck Jim is short for Chuck it is short Chuck

57
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:08,280
roast so what was your injury damn check I'm so bad at golfing or I have I guess

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,180
I have really poor depth perception. So every single time that I hit the ball, I

59
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:20,460
just hit the ground. Yeah. And like I hit the ground like a full eight inches

60
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,360
before the ball and my club would just get stuck and I would probably do that

61
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,940
four times before I ever hit the ball. So I just was putting it like... So like worse

62
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,280
than a divot like you were trying to like... Way... Yeah, no I was just like hitting

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:38,000
like it wasn't... the ball wasn't moving. Yeah. So I... and the way I swing because of

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,560
how strong I am. I'm probably putting like 500,000 pounds of power behind that and

65
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,480
all that is going directly into my right hand, my back swing hand is what I

66
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:56,000
call it. So yeah, my beautiful Swedish golf coach, she told me that

67
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,320
I shouldn't do that. And so she told you to put bandages on your hands?

68
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:04,640
What's your golf coach's name? Her name's Fiona. Fiona? Fiona.

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,040

71
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,240

73
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,920

79
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,160
be our guest I don't know about girly little kid bullshit like that so I just

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,860
know about actually you're not really adult yeah actually Josh Gad was in the

81
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:10,400
live-action movie so you know would you call him would you call him a manchild

82
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,460
would you call him an adult kid no you'd call him a man man he's a man's man yeah

83
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:21,000
you call him savage yeah his boyfriends oh that's what yeah his character was

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,680
gay he danced with a man for a second in oh that's actually he played did he play

85
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:31,080
Gaston's little gay guy yeah okay that makes sense yeah and they made Gaston

86
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,880
dude they made him for that role do you remember that they made him gay by

87
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,520
having him dance with a man for exactly one second I did not see that movie or

88
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,640
anything about it I did I did see that of like oh he's gay cuz he danced with

89
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:48,280
him for one second if you watch the movie he's gay the whole movie yeah he

90
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:54,500
act super gay the entire time. That's just Josh Gad. Oh well yeah maybe you're right

91
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,500
maybe he was doing method acting though for that one moment where he touches that man. Patrick just broke his own neck.

92
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:06,780
Yeah I know. Damn doing fatalities to yourself that's so sick. Patrick just turned his head like a normal speed and just looked at like

93
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:12,420
look to the side and then went ah. Yeah he made a whip crack sound too. Dude it did make a sound.

94
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:18,140
it picked up because I'm looking at my audacity and there's a huge spike.

95
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,140
The spike is probably you going "Ahhhh".

96
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
No, it's not it.

97
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,140
Hold on, let's pause the episode so I can go back and listen to it.

00:10:58,780 --> 00:10:59,600
- We gotta--

160
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
- Well, hold on, I never--

161
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,260
- Wait, can I figure out--

162
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,220
- The news right now.

163
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:03,060
- Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of like--

164
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,940
- I told you about my dentist appointment.

165
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,260
- Oh yeah, well, okay, go ahead.

166
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,660
Say the rest of your dentist appointment stuff.

167
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,520
- I know there's some stuff going on in the news

168
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,360
or whatever, but I mean--

169
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,140
- No, go ahead, say the dentist appointment.

170
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,980
- I had a crazy experience at the dentist.

171
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,860
- We'll push that, we'll do that next episode.

172
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,660
Just talk about the dentist.

173
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,260
- Okay.

174
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,420
So they put an antibiotic in my gums

175
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,700
and I have to use a special toothpaste

176
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,780
that has calcium in it.

177
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,620
It has like milk,

178
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,180
Cassian or whatever it's called.

179
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,100
- Casein.

180
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:30,920
- Casein.

181
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,180
I have to put milk casein on my teeth

182
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,980
and I have to use this mouthwash.

183
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:41,260
And they told me I can't floss my back teeth for a week.

184
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,840
It's like, how do you think I got here?

185
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,380
Huh?

186
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,200
What do you think of that?

187
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,460
(laughing)

188
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,700
(laughing)

189
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,540
- Should I?

190
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,760
- It's pretty good, dude.

191
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,840
- You're just doing like,

192
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,840
like you didn't just stand up to us.

193
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,840
(laughing)

194
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,580
- What do you think?

195
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,900
Do you think some open mics in Brooklyn are open?

196
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,740
'Cause I wanna go to...

197
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,980
(laughing)

198
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,620
- No, let's just all do like,

199
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,220
kinda like stand up style spiels

200
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:19,420
about what we've been up to, right?

201
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,660
- So, like, 'cause I've been building a lot of furniture,

202
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,500
right? - Yeah, yeah, okay.

203
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,180
- 'Cause I've been moving,

204
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,180
and I'm building all these furniture kits, right?

205
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,580
And it turns out I really don't like building furniture,

206
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,960
and I'm really not good at it,

207
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,220
which, you know, it's, the thing about building furniture,

208
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,940
the thing about building furniture is that it's one

209
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,220
of the easiest things in the world,

210
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,260
because it's like, think about this, right?

211
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,380
- Okay. - You know Legos?

212
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,300
Legos is a kid's toy. It's a toy for kids and they have like 3,000 pieces.

213
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:57,260
And building furniture is like the same thing as Legos except instead of like thousands of pieces,

214
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,900
it only has like five pieces.

215
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:04,940
Yeah, so true. That's so true.

216
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,140
Do you guys think that would be good?

217
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:12,140
Yeah, we could do a show. Oh, what if you did a show in a restaurant?

218
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,140
And you could do that there.

219
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,020
- Yeah, okay. - Right?

220
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:17,300
- I could be like, I could say something,

221
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,140
I could be like,

222
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,820
every time I build a piece of furniture,

223
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:24,420
I always mess it up

224
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,580
'cause I don't look at the steps close enough.

225
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,300
Like I always put on a part backwards or something.

226
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,660
But the thing about building, the thing about it,

227
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,760
that's just like an aside,

228
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,900
that's a really good line to use

229
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:35,860
if you're trying to do standup.

230
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,340
- Definitely, yeah. - Yeah, it's the thing about--

231
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,740
- Take notes, hey, amateurs.

232
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,380
These are some professionals that work here.

233
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,540
- The thing about messing up when you're building furniture

234
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,460
is that the lesson you take away from it

235
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:48,600
isn't that you should look at the instructions closer it's that you just

236
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,000
shouldn't build furniture anymore you don't like yeah and everybody's gonna

237
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,140
laugh they'll they'll feel that you know yeah I everybody's had to do it here let

238
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:05,820
me do my turn okay Legos well that reminds me of Legos are from some

239
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:11,940
fucking blonde caveman country so that reminds me of my my golf instructor

240
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:17,340
Fiorna right and she's up there she's wearing a bikini and she's showing me how

241
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:22,580
to how to use at a stroke right and I'm like hey babe could you would you mind

242
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:28,580
demonstrating yeah on my penis okay see that that works because it has kind of

243
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,740
like this punch of like I'm gonna I'm gonna be sexually inappropriate with this

244
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,340
woman yeah yeah you know it has that like yeah like yeah I mean that's

245
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,420
classic stand-up being sexually inappropriate with a woman yeah exactly

246
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,980
that's what I mean and then yeah all right Pat now you can go yeah okay and I

247
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,660
mean see that you could actually use that for your dentist story if I had to give

248
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,420
like a punch-up advice yeah right you could be like should I should I sexually

249
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,500
inappropriate to my dentist wait you'd be like a dentist lady I assume it's a

250
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:01,360
woman you'd be like it's three women it's three women who have to work on my

251

teeth I think I think I just coat that's hot I think I have a I think I have like

252
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,660

253
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:15,600
that's the only way to fill it I think it was okay I think it would work better if

254
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:31,060
it was a boob your boob needs to be but boobs in their mouth babies a baby kid

255

262
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,000
guys seriously are wearing diapers. Okay. And it's kind of like the... These guys are

263
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,280
acting like me when I don't get my diaper change. You know what else you can do? I know how I act when I don't get my

264
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:22,000
diaper change because I'm a baby. If it's a newborn, if it's a newborn who's

265
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,120
under two weeks old, right? Uh-huh. You could be, they could be like... It's a preemie.

266
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,960
Yeah, they could be like, "Hey, have you seen this crap on the news recently?"

267
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:40,840
yeah it's crazy my TV's everything's upside down his baby see upside down for

268
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:46,120
a couple weeks is that true someone told me that I don't think that's real I

269
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,160
think babies okay see upside down for a little bit

270
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,960
because they sit in your stomach upside down they get their head first oh yeah

271
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:02,160
this is a pre this is a fall I have to like come come back well I mean your

272
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,720
- Your eyes are like mirrors, so they reflect,

273
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,600
your vision is upside down, I think,

274
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,440
and you get used to it.

275
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,480
Like, if you put on glasses that reflect your vision,

276
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,640
it'd be upside down.

277
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,320
After like some length of time, you just get used to it.

278
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,160
And you just see normal.

279
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,720
- So maybe they're not used to it yet.

280
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,600
- Yeah.

281
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,800
- Oh, okay.

282
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:20,640
- So let's make a baby face,

283
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,460
so we can work it into material.

284
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,500
- Oh, that's why you never put glasses on a baby.

285
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,720
- Okay, so this-- - Exactly.

286
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,960
- Well, this would kill with like pediatricians, though.

287
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,480
- Yeah, okay, so we go, so here's the plan, all right?

288
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,640
we walk into the hospital. Yeah, we gotta find the funniest baby contest at the hospital.

289
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:42,160
And we say and we get a baby to say, "Hey listen, here's a fact about babies. We,

290
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:49,920
the first time we take a poop it's green and it's called meconium. And you know even that green poop

291
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:59,440
isn't as green as this newcomer to politics Alexia Alcacio-Cortesian." That's so true.

292
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,200
She's so green.

293
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Well, okay, we gotta find...

294
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,200
We do have to hold the funniest...

295
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,200
Hospital's Funniest Baby Contest.

296
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,200
I forgot her first name for a minute there.

297
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,200
We can get Simon Cowell.

298
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,200
We can get Simon Cowell for the hospital's funniest baby.

299
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,200
And then we have the funniest baby...

300
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,200
You're a baby.

301
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
We have the funniest baby in the hospital tell these jokes.

302
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,200
Yes.

303
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Well, let's just get the 2003 American Idol crew.

304
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Let's get Randy Savage or whatever.

let's get it. Randy Rainbow. They call him Randy Savage. They call Randy Jackson Randy Savage

308
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,480

310
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
like Alton Brown maybe. Yeah. Ryan Seacrest is busy now. He's on SiriusXM.

311
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,360
He could do the character that he does on Cutthroat Kitchen so like

00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,300
that you're saying Alton Brown on cutthroat kitchen I don't want to do

316
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:16,640
that because he uses actual S&M gear for the cutthroat kitchen challenges yeah and

Arthur Chu CHEW okay like a baby would do yeah so and it's a different guy

328
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:07,600

329
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,080
season okay so first season we find the winner of the the winner yeah second

330
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,720
season we find a baby what it's a baby yeah yeah I mean it's still a winner

331
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,600
Actually, you know what, I mean, we could throw a ringer in.

332
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,600
We could throw a ringer into the contest.

333
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,920
A very talented baby?

334
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,160
I thought we were looking for the talented baby.

335
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,200
No, just like a guy that looks like a baby.

336
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,880
No, like a guy who's really funny,

337
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,760
like dressed as a baby.

338
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,440
Like we could have like John Mulaney

339
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,960
once he's out of his, you know,

340
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
whatever the hell he's doing right now.

341
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,080
Well, he's already in a hospital,

342
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,920
so we could just go to that hospital.

343
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,720
I realize what the end goal of this is.

344
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,560
What?

345
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,680
Okay, so, the first season,

346
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,440
we find a baby that's the funniest

347
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,180
and the best at cooking, right?

348
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,860
the most charismatic chef.

349
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:53,480
Then we spend the next like five years

350
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,160
giving them like Juilliard acting training, right?

351
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,740
So in six years, when they're six years old,

352
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:05,520
we do a sequel to Chef called Chef Junior

353
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:09,800
about a very funny baby who's married to a big bimbo

354
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,240
and loves Cuban food.

355
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,160
- Okay. - What do you think?

356
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:15,000
- Well, where's the standup comedy?

357
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,720
- 'Cause we're like kind of making, were you--

358
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,120
the stand-up comedy will come in with John Leguizamo.

359
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,520
Exactly, we're creating like he can play both John Leguizamo, he can play both

360
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,880
Johns, Favreau Leguizamo. Yeah right but he's playing John Leguizamo in the pest.

361
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:34,120
He's not playing... He's playing John Leguizamo in Ice Age. That's right.

362
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:39,840
Which one is he in Ice Age? Slid. He, that's, oh my god. He slides on the ice.

363
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:43,000
You don't realize that? No. That's like one of the most distinctive, that was like one of the first

364
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,800
voices I never knew that was John Leguizamo. I never knew that was John Leguizamo. I never knew that was John Leguizamo.

365
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,480
I never knew who a cartoon character was. When you were a kid you were like damn

366
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,680
that's John Leguizamo. That's the first like that that voice you'd hear him you'd hear

367
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,800
that voice you go oh I know that's Sid the Sloth. Like that's if I saw him in a

368
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,080
movie. Well that's just because. Well the first movie I saw him in was The Pest.

369
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,960
Yeah well the first movie I ever saw was The Pest. No. For me it was Mario Brothers. No no no. I thought Leguizamo was an Italian.

370
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,560
I thought that was an Italian last name for a really long time because I didn't see the best show last year

371
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,520
I've never seen I've only seen the shower scene from the page. Oh, that's what I mean. I've only seen that

372
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,440
Can we get back on track for our baby show? Yeah, so what's it gonna be called?

373
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:31,560
It's called the honest baby. Anyway, okay, which which one which babe?

00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
the world's

379
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440

382
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,680
Yeah, yeah, no cuz for a competition show you you want it to surprise like X Factor American Idol

383
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:04,160
You wanted to surprise in the most let's say let's call it like the oldest

384
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:13,480
cook ever hunt and it's not a contest and nobody and there's no winners and no

387
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,640
much did this cost yeah sixty trillion dollars we can call it the worst show

388
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,240
the worst show of all time and then people watch the bar is low exactly

389
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:36,760
that's a really good point yeah we could get the guy who played

390
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,000
floop to what if we may and then we could do a show called the best show of all

391
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,920
time and it's the worst one mm-hmm and that's where we put that that's when we

00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,380
He was insanely rich and he walked in,

412
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,500
everything was gold and shit.

413
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,140

417
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,920
And he gave us a bottle of moonshine

418
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,420

00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,380

- Come here, let me pinch those cheeks.

426
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,580
- I was like, oh swag, this is gonna be awesome.

427
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:45,500
'Cause usually you get paid, you get tipped like 20 bucks

428
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,020
maybe, but I got home and took one sip

429
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:49,740
and just poured it out, it was horrible.

430
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,260
It was like the worst thing I've ever had.

431
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:53,180
I like moonshine.

432
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,020
I was just like--

433
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,060
If it tastes like apple pie.

434
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,740
No, see that, you've had apple,

435
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,540
you've had those like moonshine in a can that they sell.

436
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,580
This was one of those like done in like a--

437
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,500
Like real.

438
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,700
Like done in the mountains by like a guy.

439
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,540
Oh right, yeah, you were in the south.

440
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,500
Yeah, like a cartoon shack that's like

441
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,860
on the side of a mountain, like horizontal.

442
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,700
Yeah, and it's made--

443
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,740
Or vertical.

444
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,060
The steel is made out of like car parts.

445
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,900
Yeah.

446
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,860
That's your problem, you didn't mix it with anything.

447
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,340
You just took a sip of it.

448
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,540
What am I supposed to mix it with?

449
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,900
Apple pie, is that what you're saying?

450
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,520
No, you're supposed to mix it with whiskey.

451
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,340
That would only make it worse.

452
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,780
You're just, you're inventing cocktails.

453
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,220
Okay, I've got a cocktail for you.

454
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,540

00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:47,700
threat oh yeah that's really good that's what I get for it for being mean to you

486
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,260
about Patrick's delight mm-hmm yeah here's my cocktail it's it's a it's a

487
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:59,260
tab of rat poison we're like from dumb and dumber right yeah and then just a

488
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:06,780
a bunch of my pee and it's called Caleb's invisibility potion.

489
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:16,260
And it actually will make you invisible if you try it out. So I'm serious, go try that

490
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:20,960
out. You'll have to get some pee out of me by jerking me off. So there's a challenge

491
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,960
for the listener.

492
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,760
Okay, six ounces aromatic bitters.

493
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,320
Okay.

494
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,160
Two ounces gin.

495
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,000

00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:43,400
And that's called the Patrick's Tahitian Treat.

498
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:47,160
How about 16 ounces of Coors Banquet and a smile?

499
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,400
(laughing)

500
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,640
(laughing)

501
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:54,560
That's a good cocktail.

502
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,320
That's a damn good cocktail.

503
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,280
- What about, whatever happened to water?

504
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,160
Come on, Cameron.

505
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,160
- Yeah, how about one part A, Cameron.

506
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,920
- Cameron, I'm-- - Two parts O.

507
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,800
- I'm being sober this month,

508
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,640
I have to think about alcohol.

509
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,280
- Really, do you just drink it in your brain

510
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,440
before you go to sleep?

511
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,840
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah?

512
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,640
I have two 9 ABV beers waiting for me on February 1st.

513
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,760
It would be funny to like go like knock on Pat's door.

514
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:29,120
We should you and me go surprise him and we open up the door and he has like a sim.

515
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:34,720
He has like a thought cloud above his head that just has a beer on it the entire time.

516
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
Do you want any beer Pat?

517
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
No, no I'm sober.

518
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,040
We go over to hang out with Patrick and he's just sitting there holding his hand in the

519
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:44,320
shape of a beer can just walking around and it's every once in a while just

520
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,600
moving his hand up to his mouth. Between every sip he goes "Kh!"

521
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:55,600
So it's a new beer every time.

522
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:00,560
I think one of the first times we ever hung out it was that

523
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:06,280
what was it after like the comedy special thing or whatever and I drank

524
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:11,040
We bought like a 30 of beer and I drank most of them.

525
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,980
And it was supposed to be for like 13 people.

526
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,560
Yeah, I mean this guy loves beer.

527
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,840
Make no mistake.

528
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,360
He this morning, Patrick Doren, beer he does enjoy.

529
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,800
It's normal to do that.

530
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,520
It's normal to drink at least 13 beers.

531
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,360
You would have been such a good like,

532
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,520

547
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:37,520
did remember that time when I bought a 30 rack of grog and then we're supposed to split it with the whole crew

548
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:43,360
god that was so annoying. That cost like three pieces of eight too that's so fucked up. So many shillings

549
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,360
my shillings. Well once we find once we find that treasure I mean

550
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:53,600
yeah and what are you gonna do? It's all gonna be worth it. You're stuck in a brig drinking grog

551
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,880
What do you do?

552
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
What?

553
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,880
Are you doing no grog January?

554
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Yeah.

555
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Yeah?

556
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,680
I've been doing no grog this month.

557
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,280
Dude, the grogless samurai.

558
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,360
Do you remember that bar rescue episode?

559
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:10,800
It's the pirate themed bar and they make a drink called grog that is literally just like

560
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:16,640
- it's what - it's - I gotta look up the fucking recipe because it's one of the funniest - it's

561
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,800
like blue carousel - is that how you say it?

562
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,800
Caracal?

563
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,800
I don't fucking know.

564
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,800
I have no - I've never -

565
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,800
And just like -

566
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,800
I know what you're talking about but I don't know how to say it.

567
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:31,520
Vodka, that's what grog is dude. Let me look this a bar rescue grog is named after a guy named grog

568
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,160
Do you think we could make a movie where there's one samurai on a pirate ship?

569
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:41,760
I was thinking about that since you said the grog less samurai. Yeah and call it the grog less samurai

570
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,040
Yeah, that would be such a good Jackie Chan movie. Honestly

571
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:49,020
That would have been the fucking coolest Jackie Chan movie

572
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:56,500
Just like him like a like a karate master on a on a pirate ship like who goes back in time basically just Shanghai noon

573
00:33:56,500 --> 00:34:03,080
But instead of the Western its pirates. Yeah, right and he would he could do karate to the Kraken

574
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:08,440
That would be a chop clean. That would be a cool. Oh, man, dude a karate pirate

575
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:13,820
Yeah, the karate pirate would be so fucking amazing or if they'd done Jackie Chan instead of

576
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,040
Jack Sparrow Jack Sparrow. Yeah. Yeah, Jackie Sparrow Jackie. Yeah. Yeah, exactly or captain Jack Chan

577
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,000
That's good

578
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,120
Captain Jack Chan would

579
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:31,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah they could go to like

580
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:34,800
They can visit like Taiwan, right?

581
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,080
Yeah, good and Jackie Chan could keep being like, oh, we're going to China right now. This is China

582
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:46,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah exactly everybody's like this is he's like it's China. I'm the president of the ship. We're going to China

583
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,720
Be some good shit, dude. I

584
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:58,040
Can't find that recipe for grog. Here's the recipe for you. How about you spend time with your two friends instead of studying drinks?

585
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:04,160
I was I wanted to drink this with you guys. We can't drink it for over three weeks

586
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:07,340
You're doing no wrong January planning

587
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,340
I'm playing it. But send me that recipe because I'm gonna send you a video of me drinking grog tonight.

588
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,620
All right, then I gotta find it.

589
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,720
Joyful grog. The only way for me to find it is to watch that bar rescue episode.

590
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,720
So maybe I could share my screen with you guys so we could just watch the episode. No, you're gonna be jealous of my grog tonight though.

591
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:26,660
Yeah? Yeah. Your penis?

592
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,100
Not my penis. Can we stop talking about penises? That doesn't even make any sense.

593
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:35,900
For just- Like with grog. You make everything so dirty all the time. You make everything about grog all the time.

594
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,820
You got grog, you're grog obsessed dude.

595
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,460
I hate hanging out with this fucking guy, he won't shut up about grog.

596
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,140
Complete grog hound.

597
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,380
Complete grog hound.

598
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,380
He's not going out unless he gets his grog.

599
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:51,140
Just walking up to just a guy, a guy walking the party and just everyone going oh my god

600
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:55,700
just hide the grog.

601
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,660
Pat just walking down like the French Quarter in New Orleans, just walking to every bar,

602
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,660

603
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:01,660
No.

604
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,860
And just going to the next one just over and over again.

605
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:08,900
That's the next Jollibee documentary.

606
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,100
We're gonna take you to that bar where they made Grog.

607
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,500
- Oh no, it's closed down.

608
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,500
They closed down because they wouldn't

609
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,060
accept John Taffer's help.

610
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,500
- We're gonna reopen it with the money

611
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,140
from all our shows and movies.

612
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:19,980
- That's true, yeah.

613
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:22,000

620
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,220
- You did that last time that I said that word

621
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:39,780
I haven't said it since. You said, Caleb, I remember you saying that we had to watch

622
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,860
Succession so we'd understand an impression that you could do. So I want

623

00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,660
I can't remember an issue on it in months. I don't remember what they sound like even

646
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:46,340
they basically were gonna cast me in Master of Disguise, but I didn't want to because

647
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:52,660
of some of the offensive things in that movie. Okay, do the Turtle Club, then. Am I a turtle?

He's not tiny. He's a normal turtle. Yeah. He's pretty big when it comes to turtles

655
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:25,060
Do you remember the look in that movie where the bad bullshit bad the bad guy keeps a lot doing his evil laugh

656
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:30,460
But he has any farms. That's that's uh, that's Brent Spiner. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's

657
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:35,340
So many times to me too. This guy played dead. What if the life he's my dad

671
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:48,500
the funny devil post damn my teeth are looking whiter we should become comedy

673
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:57,300
in such a sick job did so it's just like one of like like it's like it's

674
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:01,340
impressive to find a way to be lamer than like a journalist you know what I

675
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:05,500
mean yeah and a comedian taking the worst of both and which are two yeah -

676

being a comedy journalist it's like you get the bad part of both it's like an

681
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,460
inverse play all comedy journalists are like blade yeah like Wesley Snipes mm-hmm

682
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,060
cuz yeah their taxes they get like the like sensibility of a journalist and

683
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:42,340
like the sexual like paraphilia of being a comedian. Yeah exactly. Yeah. So they're just

684
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:48,100
like sitting. Yeah they get the they get the sense of humor of a journalist and then like

685
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:54,900
the the ability to to share information well of a comedian. Yeah. They just sit watching like

686
00:41:54,900 --> 00:42:01,860
Talladega Nights and like this is overrated. I wish I was raping someone right now. If only.

687
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,780
Yeah, that's a bad job, dude.

688
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,780
[Laughter]

689
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:08,580
Yeah.

690
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:10,580
It's a very tough job.

Someone's going to cut that.

692
00:42:12,580 --> 00:42:13,080
No!

693
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:15,080
And post it out of context.

694
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:18,580
A podcast about list clips is going to post that without context.

695
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,580
I'm not doing my own voice.

696
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,580
It says, "Caleb's a confession."

697
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
There you go. You got a clip right there for you.

698
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,580
I've got this.

699
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,580

That's it that's them trying comedy and then later this is and then later they're writing about Freddy got fingered

711
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,220

Jeff's daughter is the founder of awkward zombies an ongoing video game webcomic in a comedic fashion

737
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:21,500
Damn, I'm just looking at this at this uh

738
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:27,300
This website. We should get into doing webcomic nerdy webcomics. Dude, Jeff Tudor is 5'6"

739
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,860
Yes! Yo!

740
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:36,540
Welcome to the club. Birthplace Rockaway, New Jersey. God chose his profession dude. Rockstar

741
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:46,760
are. Exactly. Yeah, rock away young Teej Rich. Rock away indeed. Damn. Yeah, we should definitely

742
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,780
get into nerdy pop culture web comics. I think that would be next in our media empire maybe.

743
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:58,700
Yeah, web comics is a good place to expand. We could do like, it would be called like

744
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:04,520
um... Something that's in between XKCD and CTRL ALT DELETE. Yeah, something that's like

745
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:10,680
informative in a very kind of sly way. What was XKCD even? What was that?

746
00:47:10,680 --> 00:47:14,680
XKCD is like a comic for like programmers and nerds and science.

747
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:19,160
Yeah, it's kind of a genius comic, right? So I'm sure you've seen comics like,

748
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:26,760
like you probably love Nightcrawler, Garfield and X-Men, Dilbert. Those are probably your kind of

749
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:33,640
things. For me and Cam growing up, it was all about like numbers, XKCD, like, you know.

750
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,400
And they're stick figures?

751
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,360
Um, yeah, because art isn't really that important.

752
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:39,360
It's more about the message.

753
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,520
Well, is it supposed to be like binary numbers?

754
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,040
Science and math is more important than art.

755
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,500
Yeah, so it's stickmen because the arms and legs are ones and then the head is a zero,

756
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,280
so it's kind of a binary joke.

757
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:52,480
So, so, I did understand that.

758
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,520
No, see, that's, no, you're definitely too stupid for something like XKCD.

759
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,840
You probably should read like Batman or like Super Hero Man or some bullshit like that.

760
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,940
- I've been doing that.

761
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:07,720
- I mean, yeah, me and Caleb would read like,

762
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:09,560
you know, stuff like Akewood,

763
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,040
that's like kind of hard to understand

764
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:13,040
and like intellectual, or like that one,

765
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,560
what's it, like, sad something pictures

766
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,880
about for something children, depressed,

767
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:21,600
something, the one that's about depression.

768
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,940
- Oh, we should make a webcomic about depression.

769
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,240
- Yeah, see, I'm into depression and stuff like that,

770
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,520
and like websites like the--

771
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,040
- Pictures for sad children.

772
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,000
- I like the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows.

773
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,640
I kind of go on there and I press random

774
00:48:33,640 --> 00:48:35,800
and I hit one and I say, yeah, I've felt that.

775
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,000
- Yeah. - You know?

776
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,280
I'm kinda that guy.

777
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,680
- Yeah, I basically, I have like this room in my house

778
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,420
that's filled with like various tinctures

779
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,320
that are kind of like different like mental instabilities

780
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,380
and like different like spirits that are trapped

781
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,720
in like jars and test tubes and I like open them up

782
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:52,780
and it like kind of puffs out and I can kind of like tell

783
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:54,720
what kind of sickness or like brain disease it is

784
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,880
and I've basically, I like recognize them.

785
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,720
- That's really scary and I appreciate it.

786
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,200
- Are you like me, like you're an empath?

787
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,000
- No, no, I'm not an empath, I'm a--

following somebody in a Skyrim quest. Yeah when I see when I see a woman I

800
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:17,020
immediately go into VATS. A fempath is when you can... I'm identifying the percentage of every point of her body and the

801
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:25,440
likelihood that I could touch it. Yeah it's all zero. Zero zero zero and then I just

802
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:33,040
escape the vet system. Yeah scientists gave uh gave the first guy fem path powers

803
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:36,880
today the ability to detect women's emotions the second they installed the

804
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,280
chip into him he had a seizure because the nurse was in the room. Whoa. Or he

805
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,400
killed himself. Yeah or like it was kind of like an alternate punchline. Yeah or

806
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:49,840
if or wait let me if it's if we're doing punchlines let's go funny ready? All

807
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:53,600
right yeah that's what I usually say when I'm writing jokes. If we're doing

808
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,000
punchlines let's make it funny. Let's think of a funny one. Okay listen he's a

809
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,240
fempath right so there's this guy he's a fempath the scientist game of fempath

810
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:06,800
disease he's the number one guy in the world to have this thing. Standing on stage describing what a fempath is.

811
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,160
So there's this thing called a fempath that I invented with my friends when we were doing a

812
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,700
podcast so basically there's a guy who can feel all the different things that a

813
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:14,760
girl can feel and I think that he could see things that when he goes into a VAT

814
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:18,920
system he sees girls penises and then you keep press him but then he gets the

815
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:23,720
ability to feel a girl and then he has a any shits his pants you shits his damn

816
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:27,600
pants there's a girl in the room so a little something like that ladies and

817
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:34,160
gentlemen thank you right yeah that's and that's your five minutes and that's

818
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:39,760
my five minutes dude yeah I mean the tricks the trick and that's you know if

819
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,160
you're a really good comedian you don't need five minutes exactly just need one

820
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:46,080
one second for one facial tick.

821
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,080
Yeah, for one noise.

822
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,080
Yeah, just be like...

823
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,640
Just go upstairs, upstairs, upstairs, shriek.

824
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:52,640
Just go upstairs and shriek.

825
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,800
Well, it is upstairs.

826
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,440
It's up a couple of steps usually.

827
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,440
Yeah.

828
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,520
I mean, okay, here's an idea for a gimmick, a stage gimmick, right?

829
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:03,520
When it's your turn to perform, you go upstairs, you go to the floor above and they have to

830
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,600
listen to you perform like through the ceiling.

831
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,880
So it's really muffled.

832
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:11,880
And you know that nobody's on their phones because they have to be giving their full attention

833
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:12,880
to even hear what you're saying.

834
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,880
Yeah.

835
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,280
It'd be like a good alt comic kind of like thing.

836
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,840
That'd be a funny ass alt comedy bit, dude.

837
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,840
Yeah.

838
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:19,840
Yeah.

839
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,840
What about an alt comedy bit where you talk into your shoe like a phone?

840
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:23,840
Uh-huh.

841
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:24,840
Right?

842
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:25,840
Yeah, hey, hey, alt comedy?

843
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:26,840
No thanks.

844
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:30,040
I'm into salt comedy, which is what white people think is seasoning.

845
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,040
That's right.

846
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,040
I'm into gestalt comedy.

847
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,040
Yay!

848
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:34,040
That's right.

849
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,040
Yay!

850
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,040

856
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:49,560
I can't wait till Stan Oaks back so I can try out all my new ideas. Yeah, all my new ideas

857
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:54,600
like what if a dick could fart. Yeah. I'm gonna go dress like a prince. Hey guys, you

858
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,360
might have heard of a little thing called alt comedy. It's kind of like when comedy

859
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,200
is weird if you haven't heard of it but you can just like look it up. But you might have

860
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:05,200
heard of a little thing called alt comedy and I think that stuff sucks so bad and listen

861
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:09,080
if you're in the audience and you did that before that's your fault comedy. That's right.

862
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,800
Yeah, I'm more of an intellectual comedian.

863
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,960
I'm kind of a, I like wordplay and puns.

864
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,800
I kind of, I'm like almost a poet,

865
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,080
so you might call me a thought comedian,

866
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:22,680
like you'll have a thought while you hear me do my set.

867
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:23,880
You might have a couple of thoughts.

868
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:25,720
I'm pretty thought-provoking, actually.

869
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,960
I'm kind of like the Jonas Salk of comedy.

870
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,240
Yeah.

871
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,800
'Cause I can't sit down.

872
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,440
Yeah, alt comedy.

873
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,920
I'm making sure people aren't sitting down.

874
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,080
Hey, yeah, alt comedy, when I listen to something like that,

875
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,760
it makes me want it it makes me want to yell help comedy that's right

876
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:47,200
that's like a moron comedian yeah mm-hmm you're like a ball comedian I'm a 50s

877
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:53,480
comedian that do a lot of Polish jokes that is true actually yeah yeah I have

878
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:58,000
to go pee pee see that'd be part of my bit yeah yeah I go up dress as a prince

879
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,960
and I'd say I have to go pee pee the prince of pee pee Prince of no pee well

880
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,920
they I would walk up and they'd say okay it's a prince of comedy he has to be

881
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,040
he's doing comedy and he's dressed as a prince. A prince wouldn't do something

882
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,320
that he's not the best at but then it would subvert the expectation by me

883
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:19,120
going "I have to go pee pee!" and they go "oh he's a prince of pee"

884
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:26,000
"oh wrong prince I had the wrong prince in my mental" yeah it's not a bad idea

885
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:31,280
pretty good. What do you guys think? I mean any of the things we mentioned in this episode

886
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:37,440
are fair game for anyone who's you know getting into stand-up. You can you could

887
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,740
just say like stuff from the show if you want. Yeah I don't care. People already do

888
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:45,900
that in real life. That's true. Yeah you know that people tomorrow at the office

889
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:53,540
gonna be like hey Jim you have a grog. It is funny like I know like there's people

890
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:58,240
are always like oh like people always repeat like Chapo bits or come town bits

891
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,180
to their friends to seem funny. It's so funny to imagine someone trying to do

892
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,960
that with this podcast. It's like going up to the friends be like, "Hey man, I just

893
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:09,120
ate a huge poop in line at McDonald's."

894
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:19,040
Yeah, I told them I'm gonna eat a dog's... Hey, hey, Bottoms Green Day, am I right?

896
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,560
Yeah, what do you think about that?

897
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,560
Nobody ate my pitbull, it tastes like cheese.

898
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:32,560
Pitbull tastes like a bratty old pussy bitch.

899
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,560
Yeah, doing vats, I'm a girl,

900
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:36,560
I'm a pussy.

901
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,560
I break old man's hymen.

902
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:40,560

Can I break your hymen?

906
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,560
Yeah, have you been listening to that

907
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,560
podcast that is impossible

908
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,560
to google again?

909
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:56,900
Yeah, just be like oh, it's called podcast about list and they're like I'm googling it and getting zero results

910
00:55:56,900 --> 00:56:00,400
I don't know. I don't think this exists. I think my son is

911
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:16,560
Doesn't make any damn sense I googled that I get top 10 podcasts and the top one is cereal. Yeah

912
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:19,420
You get a cereal. I don't think Sarah Koenig would say that

913
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,440
But imagine if she did it would sound a little like this

914
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:31,420
I ate a dog's pussy. I was eating a dog's pussy

915
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:34,840
Yeah, I have

916
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:37,360
ten father-in-laws

917
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,920
They got good music for that show cereal well they yeah

918
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:48,040
It's just like like a song that a kid invents when they sit at a piano for the first time

919
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:55,840
Mm-hmm. That's uh, it's the same succession is the same kind of thing really they stole they stole the they stole the theme song from it's

920
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,000
Just the epic Rick and Morty and Morty. It's just the music

921
00:56:59,000 --> 00:56:59,860
It's just the one you know

922
00:56:59,860 --> 00:57:04,720
the song and Rick and Morty when the evil guy comes and he goes like and it goes like and it's like the piano music

923
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,520
Starts playing. No that one the guy with the eye patch the evil Morty one dad

924
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:14,080
Yeah, dad. Yeah, dad. That's what I mean. Yeah, but they play like this epic music. I

925
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,960
I haven't heard that epic music.

926
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,480
Oh, you guys aren't really intellectual.

927
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,760
Yeah, it's like the Nathan For You theme song is used in car commercials all the time.

928
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,360
Or it was.

929
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:28,640
Yeah, and it's like the Dat 70s theme songs on my dad's iPod.

930
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,280
Yeah.

931
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,440
It's kind of like how they put Yoda in Soulcalibur.

932
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:35,200
Yeah, yeah. And they put Mario on the TV.

933
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,240
And Smash Brothers.

934
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,520
Did you know that that, I found out like two, three years ago,

935
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,600
that Dat 70s show theme song was an actual song?

936
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:49,240
yeah you couldn't tell no I don't here's the rule if they don't say the name of

937
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:54,760
the show yeah it's and it's just a song they picked not well yeah if they don't

938
00:57:54,760 --> 00:58:01,060
say the theme song the taxi 70 show then that's a song the taxi wasn't I think it

939
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:05,120
was written for taxi but they said they say they say this that we were watching

940
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:10,360
taxi and it's true and they say let's go taxi with the piano with the electric

941
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,760
piano that's true yeah if you if you read all that because if they play the

942
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,920
t-note the a note the X note and the I note yeah yeah also it was it was written

943
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:23,320
in a taxi so there's a lot of ways that you're wrong here Patrick yeah we don't

944
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:29,520
have to go there's something is called Angela and Angela is Spanish for taxi I

945
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,520
don't think that's true Patrick I think Angela Spanish for angel then I'm

946
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:40,920
thinking of a different language what language is taxi there's Angela a taxi

947
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:53,440
it's Chinese maybe it's Chinese Mandarin speaking Chinese reacting in a Chinese

948
00:58:53,440 --> 00:59:00,360
way just a very very different way to talk

949
00:59:01,640 --> 00:59:05,800
Chinese is a different way to talk?

950
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,160
What's different about it?

951
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,160
Yeah, what's so different?

952
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,640
Can you pinpoint some of the key differences?

953
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:14,400
Well, I mean, come on, it's a different language.

954
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,160
They speak Chinese, and that's different.

955
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,400
And Chinese is a language.

956
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
It is.

957
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
Is it?

958
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Yes.

959
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Okay, wait.

960
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
What?

961
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
What?

962
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:32,200
No, because I thought that like Chinese wasn't a language and it's Mandarin or Cantonese.

963
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:34,400
You thought they were just making noises?

964
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:35,400
No.

965
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:38,400
I didn't think Chinese people were just making noises.

966
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:39,400
Come on, dude.

967
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,720
I thought they weren't speaking a language.

968
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,520
I thought they were, I didn't think they were making noises, I thought they were making

969
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,520
words.

970
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:48,960
I think, actually, you might, I think Chinese, I think it's Mandarin, Chinese, and Cantonese,

971
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:49,960
right?

972
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:53,720
But it's, it's, the, the, both of them are technically Chinese language.

973
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:54,720
Yeah.

974
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:56,160
- If you said-- - That's what I meant.

975
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,880
That's what I meant, but I'm not smart enough

976
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,720
to fucking say that. - If you said someone

977
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,240
was speaking Chinese, somebody wouldn't be like,

978
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,040
"That's wrong, that's not true."

979
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,720
- Maybe a Chinese person. - It's just different types,

980
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,240
right, I mean, well, yeah, but they wouldn't,

981
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,480
they would say it in a way you couldn't understand anyway.

982
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:09,000
- One thing that is cool about China

983
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,200
is that there's so many different weird dialects

984
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,600
that sometimes-- - That are normal to them.

985
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,320
- People in China, well, no, 'cause if you're

986
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:17,760
from one part of China, you go to another part of China,

987
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:19,800
they're speaking a version of Chinese

988
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:22,240
that you just sometimes can't even understand.

989
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,440
So it's like if you went to--

990
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:24,280
I mean, it's like--

991
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:26,400
- If you went to California and they started talking

992
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:29,140
and you were like, "You might as well be speaking

993
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:30,840
"Chinese to me, brother."

994
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,720
- It's like if you go to the bayou.

995
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,360
I mean, not to get back to the Cajun stuff.

996
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:36,320
I think that's the closest thing.

997
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,240
- The closest thing we have to Chinese is Cajun.

998
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:40,400
(laughing)

999
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:43,060
- But you still know when you're in the bayou that they're,

1000
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:45,400
I mean, you can just guess that they're asking for like

1001
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,160
shrimp or to go to sleep.

1002
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,400
Like it doesn't matter what they're saying,

1003
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,240
you're like, "I get it."

1004
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:52,720
- Those are the two things on end

1005
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:59,360
either you're in shrimp, you're you're you're you want shrimp, you are in jail or you're

1006
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,700
sleeping or you're casting a spell. It's one of those four things and I can tell based

1007
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:09,140
on your facial features which one it is. Yeah I can tell I can tell based on whether you're

1008
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:17,760
like wearing a skull over your head or not. Yeah exactly. All right boys it's been a lovely

1009
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:23,720
It's been a lovely afternoon. Patrick's waking up right now. I am. I've been up

1010
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:29,200
since like... I got up a couple hours ago but I'm still tired. It happens. Maybe you have

1011
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,080
the coronavirus. Don't... don't do that to me. Don't say that. I think you have it dude.

1012
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:37,920
You should go get checked. Don't say that to me. Don't say that to Patrick. I'm just saying.

1013
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,080
That's like abuse. That's like friend abuse. All right. Pat, you're clear. No matter what

1014
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:47,440
symptoms you may exhibit, you don't have it. Okay. That's better. You think that Patrick

1015
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:52,640
being tired is a symptom you don't think it's because he stayed up till now

1016
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:58,880
Wikipedia that's all his fault all right bye bye bye
