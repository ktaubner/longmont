still being punished

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Caleb is still punished

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
yeah

16
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,800
We need everybody to sign our petition.

17
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
- I forget where I found that video.

18
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,800
- It's a really funny--

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,800
- Or that picture.

20
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
- It's so funny, just people holding up signs that say,

21
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,800
"Please shorten Caleb's punishment."

22
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,800
- Yeah.

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,800
(laughing)

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,800
- Yeah, I'm really curious.

25
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,800
I wonder, 'cause I feel like if it was about something serious

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
they wouldn't say, like, "Shorten his punishment."

27
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,800
They would say, like, "Get him out of jail."

28
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,800
- Yeah.

29
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
- Or like, "Shorter sentence."

30
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,380
- I think it was something like,

31
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:08,140
oh, it was like, oh, my brother got grounded,

32
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,180
my grandparents are standing outside

33
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,500
protesting his punishment.

34
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,780
(laughing)

35
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,700
- Dude, what awful grandparents.

36
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,720
Can you imagine if your grandparents protested

37
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,320
to your parents when you got grounded?

38
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,420
- Right, every time.

39
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:26,500
- Yeah, they cut off contact.

40
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:32,980

41
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,780

Ah, that is not true.

That's completely true.

99
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Um.

100
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,700
False.

Yeah, I just took like a long nap before this, so now I'm drinking a Red Bull.

102
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:18,860
Yeah I wish I'd had something.

103
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:24,420
Well we had $20 in Grubhub credit because they fucked up an order.

104
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,420
Oh nice.

105
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,420

106
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:32,860
So I got, yeah, yeah, for Black Friday baby, we got a, yeah we just paid for the order

107
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,260
that we got today for lunch.

108
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,460
We didn't pay, like, we paid $3 for the delivery.

109
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,460
Nice.

110
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,460
So that was good.

111
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:41,460
What'd you get?

112
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,380
and I did not tip them.

113
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:48,260
- Yeah, I tipped them on the $3.

114
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,940
I gave them six cents.

115
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,780
Or no, 60 cents.

116
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,080
- I think they made enough today.

117
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,920
- Yeah.

118
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,100
(laughing)

119
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,600
- On Black Friday.

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,800
- Yeah, come on.

121
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,000
- Right, you're already making way too much.

122
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,960
- Yeah, an Uber Eats driver should be making

123
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,460
maximum $10 a day.

124
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,460
After that, they just get greedy.

125
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:11,220
They try to take on too many orders

126
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,940
And it's like you're wearing yourself out.

127
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,340
Go home and go to sleep.

128
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,580
You should be doing one ride a day.

129
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,900
Yeah, you shouldn't do any rides at all.

130
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,340
Yeah, because you're making too much money.

131
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,340
Yeah.

132
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,340
You're taking away all the money from me.

133
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,580
I write articles for Vice.

134
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:35,860
And everybody knows that if one person makes money, the other person can't make money.

135
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,860
That's true.

136
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,900
And this situation just happens to be Uber Eats and Vice.

137
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,220
They're linked somehow.

138
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
I don't know.

139
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:44,100
They have the same, they both use Employee Co.

140
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,900
Yeah, well I stopped doing that with the microphone.

141
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,260
I'm trying to figure out the most comfortable position.

142
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,260
I can hear it getting louder and quieter when you do that.

143
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,980
Is this the perfect volume right here?

144
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,980
This is fine, yeah.

145
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,100
I mean, it depends, I guess it's really on your end that it matters, I suppose.

146
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,020
Yeah, that's true.

147
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,700
I don't know, I can't wait until we're done with the fucking internet recording.

148
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,300
Yeah, dude, it fucking blows.

149
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:20,940
this

150
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:40,660
a

151
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,660
Absolutely.

152
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,660
That's a good idea.

153
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,820
That's what we should do and it wouldn't backfire at all.

154
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,660
It would not backfire and no one would complain about...

155
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,220
And they would all be good quality.

156
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,820
Yeah, no one would complain about like the audio quality, no one would complain about

157
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,820
episode quality.

158
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:00,540
I don't know that anyone's ever complained about any of those things just because we

159
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,540
don't have...

160
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,860
Yeah, I don't think anyone has but like I don't know...

161
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,540
I know it's not good.

162
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,020
Yeah, oh I know it's not good.

163
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,020
Yeah.

164
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:14,260
I know that like the past like whole like the whole time I've been recording from this microphone

165
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:18,740
I know that my audio has sounded like shit and I'm taking this time to apologize to the

166
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,740
fans.

167
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,780
Yeah and I'm taking this time to uh revert Pat's apology and say fuck you instead.

168
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,660
Don't oh my don't revert my apology.

169
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,260
I just reversed it I flipped it on its head and now instead of I'm sorry you're saying

170
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,180
sorry I'm and that doesn't even make any sense.

171
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,180
Oh my god.

172
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,740
Okay but back to the eat you alive music video.

173
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,520
oh yeah uh...

174
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,840

175
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,980
fred durst being super horny

176
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,180

like that

179
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,500
and the chorus is him screaming

i'd eat you alive over and over again and the music video is the band is

181

and they have

183
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,920
thora birch uh... tied to a chair

184
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,780

185
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,300
out a megaphone

186
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,020
and screams directly into her face

187
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,020
like how hot she is and it's like the funniest thing ever is the image of

188
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,860
how old was she then

189
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,260

those two times she was born in ninety two

194
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,660
okay

195
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,740

she was way too young to be in it

203
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,440
now that uh... i wouldn't watch the video for the if that were the case

204
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,340

205
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,700

yeah i want to watch the original it looks like it shouldn't have failed

242
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,800
hit one with one worst picture at the stinkers bad movie or it's swept the

243
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,960
unknown it was nominated

244
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,840
well it sounds like it was leading to our bad movies

245
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:09,260
sounds like uh...

246
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:12,200
was the other one the golden raspberries yeah

247
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,320
so they're going to have a bad movie there's the golden turkey

248
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,880
there's the uh... the but that's a no that's a

249
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,880
there's the pattern to have a record or book

250
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,560
is the patrick award

251
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,600
that they were not a war in the movie with the of the latest

252
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,900

00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,320
I think it might be Maltese.

327
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,720
Um, I don't know anything about Malta.

328
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
Hmm.

329
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Yeah, that's my-

330
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
My mom just shared this picture.

331
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,220
It's a picture of baby Yoda.

332
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:31,720
And it says, "10 year old me looking at all the Lego sets I can't afford."

333
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,240
and then it's a picture of old Yoda and it says "25 year old me looking at the

334
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:43,920
Lego sets I still can't afford." Oh, so your mom's a Lego fan. No, she has never

335
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:53,160
played with Legos once. I don't know why she posted that. Yeah, Baby Yoda is pretty

336
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,780
ingenious like marketing. Like, yeah, my girlfriend who doesn't, who isn't

337
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:02,940
into Star Wars, loves Baby Yoda.

338
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:08,500
And I just, yeah, like, it's a very,

339
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,080
it's a good way to grab the girl base for Star Wars.

340
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:17,300
Make some, get some girls into the mix.

341
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,660
- Into the Star Wars.

342
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,700
- Into Star Wars, yeah.

343
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:23,620
Boys like Darth Vader and Luke Skying, Skye, Skywalker.

344
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,460
- Skye and Walker.

345
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,380
- Skye and Walker.

346
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:29,260
And girls like Baby Yoda and Princess Peach.

347
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:32,260
That's some true shit right there.

348
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:37,260
What if it turned out that Mario and Princess Peach were siblings?

349
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,260
That would be fucked up.

350
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,260
And then it turns out Bowser was the good guy all along trying to prevent incest.

351
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,260
I'm looking at my Facebook suggested pages right now.

352
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,260
It's just all omelette, chicken gizzards,

353
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,900
This is a good one.

354
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,980
Chicken gizzards and hot sauce.

355
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,780
I got recommended, I got suggested a page.

356
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Scrambled egg.

357
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,700
This is awesome.

358
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:16,340
I got suggested a page this morning that was called like P-Bay and it was a website for

359
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,540
auctioning off racing pigeons.

360
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,940
Oh, okay.

361
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,220
So it's for Pigeon Bay.

362
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,620
like ebay but they sell pigeons.

363
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
Pigeon bay?

364
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:27,620
It's like the pirate bay?

365
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,900
You get illegal pigeons?

366
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,900
Yeah.

367
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,860
You can torrent pigeons.

368
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:37,180
So the way torrenting pigeons works is everyone has one tiny piece of a pigeon and they all

369
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,260
come together and put it together and it's not alive but it looks kind of like a pigeon.

370
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,260
Yeah.

371
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,260
Yeah.

372
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,900
That's some good shit.

373
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:52,260
like the marvel the marvel action figures they used to have where they would sell you like

374
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,220
you get like nightcrawler and then nightcrawler has like the arm of the blob yeah that's kind

375
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:03,580
of like pbay they did that was that on purpose or uh yeah yeah so you'd have to buy all of

376
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:11,340
them to make oh i get it that's cool that's a cool idea good page ham and cheese and tomato

377
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:21,660
croissant. Do you just only like food pages on Facebook? I think so. I guess I do now.

378
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:29,420
Tootsie Roll? There we go. The Rick Moranis Fan Club? Okay. Yeah, this all checks out so

379
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:35,660
far. Dill Pickle Chips. Yeah. When are you going to make Chips App? Oh, Chips App, god

380
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,660
What are you going to get down to?

381
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:44,940
That would be really funny if I did get really into making chips app.

382
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,860
That would be really funny.

383
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,660
I think you should do it.

384
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:53,340
I think when you graduate...

385
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,740
Instead of doing like...

386
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,740
Anything.

387
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,980
Yeah, anything close to what my major is.

388
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,980
Just develop an app.

389
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,260
Called chips app.

390
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:19,940
to

391
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,660
this group is for pro-smoking only.

392
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:27,040
Though most of our society frowns on smoking, it's still legal, plus it's our birthright

393
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,380
to light up if we choose to.

394
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,540
From research I've learned is smoking is that not nearly as deadly as our social media tells

395
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,060
us it is.

396
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:42,440
There are other toxins that are deliberately added to our environment that are much worse.

397
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,500
So let's vent, share, and light up.

398
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,940
And be happy.

399
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,060
Please note, this group is for tobacco smokers only.

400
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,100
No fetish or sex or pot.

401
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,100

422
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,860
well as a guy

423
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,060
and i got a cigarette in his mouth

424
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,980
and he's staring at a candle. He's staring directly into a candle and it's captioned "mood".

425
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,700
He's gonna go blind.

426
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,940
He's gonna go blind for sure.

427
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:05,100
Yeah, you should not be staring directly into a candle.

428
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,940
That is a big mistake that will damage your retinas irreparably.

429
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,260
Yeah.

430
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,480
Pro smokers... oh, damn.

431
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,540
Someone wrote something on their cigarette and is smoking it.

432
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:21,180
Yeah, they wrote "unemployment".

433
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,180
God damn dude.

434
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,180
What?

435
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,980
It's so weird because you know smoking is bad for you.

436
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
No you don't.

437
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
I don't.

438
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:29,980
Oh.

439
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
Well, I know it's good for me.

440
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,900
If you don't know it's bad for you, it should be bad for you.

441
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:37,900
No, it should be good for me.

442
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,060
Just because you say it's bad for me doesn't...

443
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:44,700
It's all about my mental power and the way I choose to view the world.

444
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,260
I mean you see it as like getting a tumor on your lung or whatever.

445
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:51,620
I see it as, you know, a bigger lung.

446
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,460
- Yeah.

447
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:58,460
- More cool, more cool bumps in my chest.

448
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,100
- That's pretty cool. - And my organs.

449
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,620
Yeah, it's cool shaped organs.

450
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,460
Unique, it's unique.

451
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,940
- You know what, I think smoking's good for you.

452
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,140
- Yeah, see, that's what I'm saying.

453
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,300
It's all about mindset.

454
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,020
It's a mindset thing.

455
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:13,020
- Somebody posted a link to Mosala Secondary School

456
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:19,540

[Laughing]

473
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,780
So this is just four pictures

474
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,780
of a guy smoking in his bathroom.

475
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
[Laughing]

476
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,780
That's pretty awesome.

477
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,780
This is bad content.

478
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,780
Um... No, this is good.

479
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:12,780
No, because nobody can see the pictures.

480
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,540
I'm gonna post this one to the patreon because this one is fucking cool. All right

481
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,420

482
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,860

That's awesome. Yeah, definitely post that one

484
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,940
Yeah, I'm gonna post it right now

485
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:38,380
Yeah, I uh, I wonder in the description now, it's like no no fetish or sex stuff

486
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,380
Do people have like a smoking fetish?

487
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,380
I think so.

488
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:45,380
Is that like, is that even considered a fetish?

489
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,380
Or do you think smoking is attractive?

490
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,380
Or what is it?

491
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:51,380
Or do you want someone to like smoke into your pussy or something?

492
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:54,380
See, I think these are...

493
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:57,380
I think both of those are probably the thing.

494
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,380
Put a cigarette into your dick hole?

495
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,380
Yeah.

496
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,380
Smoking a cigarette with my dick.

497
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,380
That'd be cool.

498
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
That'd be awesome.

499
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,880
That'd be some really cool shit.

500
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,540
That would probably blow up viral.

501
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,620
That'd probably blow up viral online.

502
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,780
Blow up, blow up, blow up viral on them.

503
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,540
Yeah that'd probably blow up viral online and get straight to Ellen.

504
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Yeah if you were smoking a cigarette out of your dick hole.

505
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:29,700
Ellen's like hey you need, everybody on the internet needs to check this video out today.

506
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,700
It's a guy.

507
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,620
It's a smoking cigarette out of the penis.

508
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:33,620
Yeah.

509
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,260
That's the title of the video, Smoking Cigarette from Penis.

510
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:43,120
And uh, the guy, and then the guy can't figure out how to get the cigarette out so it burns

511
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,620
down and burns his penis sets on fire.

512
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,980
That'd be cool.

513
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
And Ellen loves it.

514
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:52,580
Ellen loves to see a penis get mutilated.

515
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,420
That's one of her hobbies, I hear.

516
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:00,340
Yeah, that's one of the things on the show all the time.

517
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:07,020
like she comes down she starts dancing and then she immediately is like all

518
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,480
right now it's time for my favorite part of the show and she doesn't say what

519
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,700
it's called and then everyone starts clapping and then she just like shoots a

520
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:23,440
penis yeah she she plays she says let's play let's play happy or sad and she

521
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:30,040
plays videos of genital mutilation and on all the on all the female genital

522
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,320
mutilation the audience all boos and it awes and is sad yeah and then the male

523
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:39,880
genital mutilation everyone claps and cheers and then they all go out and and

524
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:47,440
perpetuate circumcision a little known fact is that is that the the audience at

525
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:53,120
the Ellen show are all all doctors are all the every doctor that's how dr. Oz

526
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,680
got a show he just kept showing up in to Ellen and eventually developed a

527
00:25:57,680 --> 00:26:02,920
friendship with Ellen. Yeah, and yeah they're all doctors who practice

528
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,400
circumcision. So I would advise you to turn on the Ellen Show, pause on every

529
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,040
shot of the audience, take a good look, and don't let any of those faces near

530
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:17,680
your kid. Because God knows what they're gonna do to your kid's penis. That's true.

531
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:24,000

Shut up. I'm the doctor.

543
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,040
I am the doctor. I was on Ellen.

544
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
In the audience. You need

545
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:53,040
to trust me. I was on Ellen.

546
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,040
Now.

547
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,400
Yeah, I was an audience member of Ellen,

548
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,880
smoking a cigarette and telling you...

549
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:06,880
Yeah.

550
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,440
That would be crazy.

551
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,160
That totally didn't happen to me.

552
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
Yeah, that didn't happen to me either.

553
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,520
That totally didn't happen to every man who circumcised.

554
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,600
Yeah.

555
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,840
Yeah.

eggs and soldiers

558
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,120
the reason they're called the beach boys

559
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,840
is it's short for nude beach boys

560
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:37,520
uh... because the beach boys used to love to go nude beaches and circumcised boys

561
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,840
and that's why it's gotta they sing god only knows

579
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,960
or if you don't have a thunderstone you can just stick it into one of those

580
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,820
cigarette outlet things

581
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,360

00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,200
you know the weird outlets

584
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,800
in a car?

585
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:37,740
uh huh

586
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:41,680

588
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,340

589
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,360
damn you're a dumb kid

590
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,000
i was a dumb kid

591
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,120
that's uh... yeah that's fine

592
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,920
it's so funny how

593
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,600
kids like you have to tell them not to do things but if you tell them not to do

594
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,400
things they also want to do it

595
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,400
like uh... if you tell a kid not to stick a fork in the outlet like

596
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,080
there's gonna be a serious

597
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,800
so the only thing to do is to tell them to do it

598
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:18,080
and it's not abuse well no then if they do it then you can just be like look

599
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,880
i was trying to teach you a lesson

600
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,760
yeah i was that yeah

601
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,480
yet to learn on your own

602
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,960
you're not gonna learn i'd

603
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,940
yet

604
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,400
listen you talking to a few like listen if we tell them not to put

605
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,760
this fork in the outlet he's not going to use can it be doing have to tell me

606
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,120
every day until he's twenty five

607
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,120
you know we have to let him learn on his own

608
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:42,600
so we go hey someone you stick a fork in the outlet for your fifth birthday

609
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,920
and then he's gonna like

610
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,480
not even just a fork just like you could tell mistake i feel like i know he's

611
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:55,640
He's gonna douse himself in water and wrap himself in aluminum foil and then crawl into

612
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:56,640
the outlet.

613
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,640
That'd be cool.

614
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,040
That'd be awesome.

615
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,280
That's what I would do.

616
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,580
That's what I would do if I was five years old.

617
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:09,400
I'd become so small I could fit into an electrical outlet.

618
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:16,280
I would shrink myself down and then like the borrowers, the movie the borrowers, I would

619
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:24,680
around and I would go down under the electrical outlet if you get my pun there.

620
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,840
I pour some water on it.

621
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,960
Yeah, absolutely.

622
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,360
That's one of the coolest things you can do.

623
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,120
Everybody listening out there, try the podcast about list challenge.

624
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,080
Become very small and pour water onto an outlet and jump inside.

625
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,520
That's our new challenge for the week.

626
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,080
Yeah, we're gonna have deeply challenges.

627
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,040
If you don't do that challenge, I can't talk to you.

628
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,240
Yeah, I mean either.

629
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,080
If you don't do that challenge,

630
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,500
I won't be able to talk ever again.

631
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:58,360
I'll be so upset.

632
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,600
I'll stop talking.

633
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,760
I'll revert back to 12 years old when I couldn't talk.

634
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:07,600
Yep.

635
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,520
I'll revert back to 19,

636
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,740
and I'll start crawling around

637
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,320
and drinking from a baby bottle.

638
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,100
Like you did at 19?

639
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
Yeah.

640
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Or over...

641
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,840
You drank from a baby bottle?

642
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,840
Yeah.

643
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,320
And I crawled around and wore a onesie.

644
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,120
And I cried.

645
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,680
And played with alphabet blocks.

646
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,680
That's cool.

647
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Man why do babies like alphabet blocks?

648
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
They can't even read.

649
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,680
Right.

650
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Freaking idiots.

651
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Man.

652
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,160
Why don't you give them picture blocks instead?

653
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
Yeah.

654
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:42,160
Why not just put a picture of you on the thing?

655
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,200
- Oh, why are babies playing at all?

656
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,240
- And then you can teach your kid your face.

657
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,120
- Yeah, that's true.

658
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,140
Yeah, 'cause kids shouldn't be playing,

659
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,980
they should be learning.

660
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,260
And the alphabet, you shouldn't be learning the alphabet

661
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,260
as a baby, it's just too tough.

662
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,100
- Yep.

663
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,240
- Wonder what Caleb's doing right now

664
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,080
in his punishment chamber.

665
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,060
- He's probably, he's doing God knows what.

666
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:06,240
- Yeah, he's singing the God only knows by the Beach Boys.

00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240

And the other J is?

723
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,860
The British chef was like,

724
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,600

725
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,980

726
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:22,820
Yeah.

727
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,860
Do you not talk at work?

728
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,180
I don't talk at work,

729
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:29,100
unless I'm talking to customers or something.

730
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:29,920
I don't wanna like--

731
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,060
Well, there's your problem.

732
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:35,460
That's why you're not getting tips from the Buttigieg people.

733
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,500
They can tell that you're being too quiet.

734
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,140
- I think they should tip me regardless.

735
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,180
No, I try to talk to people, I try to get tips.

736
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,900
- Buttigieg people love to be talked to.

737
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,720
- That's true.

738
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,940
- They love a good talking to.

739
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,460
- Yeah, well, I mean, I can't reprimand them.

740
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,300
That'd be funny.

741
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,580
(laughing)

742
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:56,020
Just like, oh, you think you can order that here?

743
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,800

744
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,060

749
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,800
Caleb's family had a Thanksgiving.

750
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:19,660
I became part of Caleb's family.

751
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:23,740
Yeah, so we're married now.

752
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,080
- And what's the address?

753
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:29,620
- It's 123, 123 Street.

754
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:33,180
I couldn't think of a street name, so I just said 123 again.

755
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,180
- Okay, well that exists in LA,

756
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,540
so you just doxed somebody.

757
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,380
So great job. - 123 Street.

758
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,220
- Great job, Cameron, you just doxed Caleb's family.

759
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,260
- Yeah, everybody go kill the people

760
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:48,020
who live at 123, 123 Street.

761
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:51,280
And that's an official threat.

762
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,120
- Yeah.

763
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,940
- But they live in Bakersfield, which is where Corn is from.

764
00:36:57,940 --> 00:37:01,660
And so, apparently they, and Bakersfield is just like

765
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,660
the flattest city and it's just dust and stores.

766
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,660
It's very understandable that corn came from there.

767
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,420
It's, Caleb described it to me, he was like,

768
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,460
yeah, this is the only place in California

769
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,900
where people have southern accents.

770
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,560
Like that's the type of, yeah.

771
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,860
But yeah, so they have a street

772
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:27,120
that's named after corn there.

773
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:31,360
and they have a have it's called court corn row it's a street sign that as the

774
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:33,320
corn logo on it

775
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,500
and uh...

776
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,000
yet but it's not even a street just like on train tracks

777
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,680
it's uh... it's it's like this is in the middle of of of nowhere so funny

778
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,660
and it's all i guess baker's field

779
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:49,700
uh... i don't know

780
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,740
a hundred of them look too big for these are on the a hundred and

781
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,180
one hundred big

782
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:58,480
one hundred cities size

783
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,660
it's basically think of a really big city

784
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:06,180
nothing really small now really think of a really small city

785
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,500
uh...

786
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,740
and now combined

787
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,620
no don't combine them

788
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,640
do divide them

789
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,040
okay that's

790
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:20,340
bakersfield california is known for do you want music dating back to the early

791
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,480
mid

792
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,200
fifties to late eight sixties they made you up there

793
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,400
you like to walk that's sick

794
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,860
you guys like to do up

795
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,820
i guess so

796
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,560
that's the that's why jonathan davis always be like

797
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,960
don't doubt that the problem i'm not sure

798
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,160
yet these do you want to have to have to do

799
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,760
yeah

800
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,480
uh...

801
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,460
when those corn streets i was on like a twelve foot tall poll they're really

802
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,340

804
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,940
uh... someone would are you kidding me of course they would i would only have a

805
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,180
camera next to that street yeah

806
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:02,700
they definitely do uh... it's just it was a whole areas we call poll

807
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:06,580
later literally twelve feet tall maybe a little taller

808

00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,500
there's a tall

811
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:16,740

as i'm sure it does not hold up

829
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:15,500
but i'm really not

830
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:19,420
i have been surprised by how much new metal does hold up though

831
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,740
i've been listening to so much limp bizkit lately

832
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,380
uh...

833
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,760
and uh... it's good

834
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,200
you know because he's like he's gets kinda like it's like what if a guy with

835
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,240
a rock and roll star

836
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,960
could rap

837
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,620
and kinda drop the rhymes with the best of the hip hop hip hoppers

838
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,440

839
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,960
insane bars like he's like let me sniff on them panties miss and he's also like

840
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:54,040
he's like he's like bum right now I'm dangerous yeah right now I'm dangerous

841
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,720
though that now I'm dangerous that's one part of the blimp is good I can't defend

842
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:04,520
is that exact line I think that's maybe the lamest line in any song ever the

843
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:12,080
coolest line in all of their songs no no Jonathan Davis has a as an EDM band yeah

844
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:18,160
J devil that is so that is the best name yeah he could have had for that yeah

845
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,400
dude it's awesome cuz remember they did that album corn did a dubstep album

846
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:28,080
called the path of totality with like Skrillex and and yeah noisier and stuff

847
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,240
because Jonathan Davis has always been to like EDM on like the back burner but

848
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,200
then he's like you know what you're gonna do this with the whole band and

849
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,840
everyone hated it

850

00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:30,760
Oh, alright.

890
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,760
Okay.

891
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,760
Nice.

892
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,760
We're doing business solutions.

893
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:34,760
I think that's what we need to do.

894
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:50,120
We need to start an LLC called Podcast About List Business Solutions.

895
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,760
If we ever get big and have to start an LLC for tech stuff, we will absolutely call it

896
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:01,760
it

897
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
and a business name.

898
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Well, hold on.

899
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,440

Yeah.

902

Because that would probably be the best company name of all time.

903
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:20,760
If they let us do it, we would be on fire.

904
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:29,120

978
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:55,020
that's something to think about

979
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:58,140
that's that's a little something to think about

980
00:47:58,140 --> 00:48:03,200

981
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:04,080

you like that i don't like it

984
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:14,460
In Alaska it says vulgar names are not allowed, but it doesn't say that for anywhere else.

985
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:20,380
So I have to assume it's only Alaska that you can't.

986
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,800
Maybe.

987
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:22,800
Who knows?

988
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,660
In Hawaii you can't use the word Olympic.

989
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,420
Really?

990
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,540
Yeah.

991
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:31,180
Hawaii they have a lot of prohibited words.

992
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:32,180
Interesting.

993
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:35,260

00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:42,660

1044
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:45,820

yeah i love ones that i would say he's an i'd frame html element

1047
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,700
but i guess you would know about that

1048
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,780
no i'm not an entrepreneur yeah and meanwhile i am

1049
00:50:59,780 --> 00:51:03,500
that's true you're the only entrepreneur i know

1050
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:07,300
that's right

1051
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:10,180
yeah that's true

1052
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,460
yup

1053
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:16,420
it's funny how ugly stephen king is

1054
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:17,940
he's like really

1055
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:21,860
really ugly and his son is very ugly too

1056
00:51:21,860 --> 00:51:25,000
and what's his son's name it's like uh... joe joe

1057
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Joe Hill. Joe King. Joe King or Joe Hill. He went under a pseudonym because he was afraid

1058
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:38,000
his dad was too famous. Did your uncles ever tell you while you were watching SNL that

1059
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:48,480
Andy Samberg was Adam Sandler's son? No. My uncle told me that and apparently enough people

1060
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:55,580
I know have been also told that by their uncles. That's pretty funny. That Andy

1061
00:51:55,580 --> 00:52:00,680
Sandberg is Adam Sandler's son and he changed his name so that he could get

1062
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:08,360
famous on his own without having to use his dad. Which is the stupidest. That's so

1063
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:17,840
funny. Wow. Why why would he need... Also most of it just sounds like it's because

1064
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:24,480
his name is like Andy Sandberg and that sounds similar enough to Adam Sandler.

1065
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,760
Yeah, that's how it works when you have a son. You name them something that's

Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1074
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,480
I was thinking about why that

1075
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,480
Stephen King and his son are both ugly because they're both in this docu-series

1076
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,480
about the history of horror that's hosted by Eli Roth

1077
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,480
and Greg Nicotero.

1078
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,680
Oh, I watched that.

1079
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,680
You watched that?

00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:37,680
Yeah.

1081
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:38,680
Didn't like it very much.

1082
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:39,680
You didn't like it?

1083
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,680
No, I just saw it.

1084
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:42,000
It was just kind of like surface level.

1085
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,000
I don't know.

1086
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeah.

1087
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,000
It was very much.

1088
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,000
Yeah, I mean it was surface level.

1089
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,000
I mean, they got into some things.

1090
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,000
There was some stuff that was cool.

1091
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
I guess, I don't know, it was fun to just kind of watch.

1092
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,200
Yeah, definitely a good time waster.

1093
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,720
I did enjoy watching it.

1094
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,520
I just don't, but yeah, it was nice.

1095
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,960
It was, and it was like, yeah, Rob Zombie.

1096
00:53:57,960 --> 00:54:00,120
Nice to hear him say like three words every episode.

1097
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,000
Oh, did you know he went to Parsons School of Design?

1098
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,120
really

1099
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:07,440
yeah that's cool that's how he met his girlfriend

1100
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,640
who then they've been originally girlfriend yeah

1101
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:14,460
his wife's on the girlfriend yeah i knew that news from a frill hair

1102
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,620
so funny that the ice

1103
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,640
that two guys from a parole

1104
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,260
ended up being like

1105
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,640
making lame music

1106
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,200
lame yeah theatrical music

1107
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,040
from the same family house and yet as they're both brothers yes of why they

1108
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:36,040
both had careers doing that. Yeah. It'd be great if Power Man 5000 starts making movies.

1109
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:44,200
Yeah. They'd be like robot movies or something? Yeah, robot movies. My favorite genre. But

1110
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,520
that docuseries, I think my favorite part of that docuseries is how they had, every

1111
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:52,880
once in a while they would have a clip of Jack Black just talking. And it was like,

1112
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:57,100
Why are you here? What what cuz you just be like and then the demon was like

1113
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:06,900
Yeah, and he's like though he had one story that he showed Rosemary's baby to his pregnant wife and she got mad at him

1114
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,400
Which is so funny to show to show Rosemary's baby to your pregnant wife

1115
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:20,460
That's such a always show my wife Rosemary's baby before she has a kid. Yeah, and I say I would never do this to you

1116
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:28,040
Rest assured this will not happen. Oh my god is this I thought this was a movie about a good pregnancy

1117
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:31,280
My bad, I didn't mean to show you this I

1118
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,120
Thought this is gonna be fun. Yeah, I thought this was gonna be about a cute, baby

1119
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:40,760
But no, but no it turns out. It's about Jack's black wife

1120
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:43,620
Jack's blacks Jackson Blackson

1121
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:50,980
That's his full name. That's his wife's name. Oh his wife's name is Jackson black. Oh in black. Oh in

1122
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:57,980
in

1123
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,980
that's why he married her

1124
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:01,980
because they're like

1125
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,980
our names are so similar

1126
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:05,980
I guess we have to get married

1127
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,980
we gotta go through with this, yeah

1128
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,980

1129
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,980

00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,980
and their vows were just like

1132
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:22,900
I will not change my name, thus ruining our marriage.

1133
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:26,460
I will not do anything.

1134
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:31,620
I promise I will show you Rosemary's baby while you are pregnant.

1135
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:35,780
Our child will be named Black Jack Black- Black- Black-lyn.

1136
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:36,780
It's hyphenated.

1137
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:37,780
Jack-o-Black-o-Black-lyn.

1138
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:44,420
Yeah, it's our child's name, if it's a boy, will be Black Jack Black-Black-lyn.

1139
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:53,340

1140
00:56:53,340 --> 00:56:56,460
we're gonna name our baby everyone that everyone at the wedding is like you

1141
00:56:56,460 --> 00:57:03,060
don't have to say that in the vows you can save that for your own private

1142
00:57:03,060 --> 00:57:08,580
we really we don't care right now yeah I why did you even invite us you if you

1143
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:11,460
We thought you loved each other.

1144
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,460
This is kind of weird.

1145
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,460
This isn't even...

1146
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:16,380
Why are you telling us your wedding vows?

1147
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:22,380
And I promised I will always skadoosh.

1148
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:30,180
Yeah I vow I will not take over your career as a substitute teacher.

1149
00:57:30,180 --> 00:57:34,220
And I will not have a rock band of children.

1150
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,060
That movie, yeah Jack Blas kind of sucks in that one huh?

1151
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:39,060
Yeah, you know with kids all day

1152
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:43,980
You know now that I think of it now that I think of it being a teacher is kind of fucked up

1153
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:46,500
Just you in a room with a bunch of kids

1154
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:50,620
I would never I think we might need to get rid of teachers

1155
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:52,500
Yeah

1156
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Hey, you're saying it. I'm just

1157
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:57,500
repeating this

1158
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:00,020
I'm just repeating that shit

1159
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:05,380
I'm still on this website small biz trends comm and they have trending topics at the top and

1160
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,620
And here are the trending topics for small business.

1161
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:09,620
Do they have business solutions?

1162
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,620
Here are their trending topics.

1163
00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:13,620
Holidays. Small business growth.

1164
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,620
Small business Saturday.

1165
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,620
It's not even Saturday.

1166
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,620
That's the shit right there.

1167
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:21,620
And then the top trending topic is in quotes

1168
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:23,620
"What is..."

1169
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,620
[laughter]

1170
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,620
I'm gonna see what this is.

1171
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,620
Yeah, what is "what is"?

1172
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,620
What is ghosting and how can small tech companies avoid it?

1173
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,620
This is just a joke.

1174
00:58:33,620 --> 00:58:34,620
avoid it.

1175
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,820
Small tech companies are getting ghosted?

1176
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:39,820
I don't think they are.

1177
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:43,540
I think they're the ones doing the ghosting.

1178
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:46,980
But ghosting is about dating though.

1179
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,180
Woah, what?

1180
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:53,300
Ghosting is when you're dating someone and you don't text them for an hour.

1181
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,300
No.

1182
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,300
Yeah.

1183
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:56,300
Nuh uh.

1184
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,300
Yes.

1185
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,580
Ghosting is a huge problem for some people apparently.

1186
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,700
Ghosting is when you get scared by a ghost.

1187
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:02,700
Yeah.

1188
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:08,160
I think is when you wear a white sheet and you go to someone's house and you go

1189
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:18,100
I wonder what the first piece of media to have ghosts go just like singing like that is it was a

1190
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:22,140
Movie called

1191
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:23,880
fucking

1192
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,300
suck a shit suck a shit

1193
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:34,300
Movie called the suck and fuck of shit suck a fuck of shit the movie of a go the movie of a ghost movie of a ghost

1194
00:59:34,300 --> 00:59:38,220
Just gonna fucking a shit is a movie of a ghost

1195
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:42,880
That is that's just a lame sound for a monster to be making it's going like yeah

1196
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:49,700
This sounds like it's supposed to be the moaning and crying

1197
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:53,800
Yeah, but it isn't that it's them singing

1198
00:59:54,380 --> 01:00:00,380
That's true. You know maybe in the books it says they're moaning, but when it comes to the screen. They're all going oh

1199
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:12,820
Ghosts always be doing that mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah

1200
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:17,740
What's up? Yes? What's the deal with ghosts?

1201
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:22,220
What's the deal with this ghost you keep singing?

1202
01:00:22,220 --> 01:00:29,220
in

1203
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:36,220
looking

1204
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,980
I'm looking at bushings.

1205
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:40,980
What's that?

1206
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:41,980
Is that like a...

1207
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:46,020
That's the thing in the truck that... the soft things that help you turn.

1208
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:48,620
Oh, okay.

1209
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:49,620
Nice.

1210
01:00:49,620 --> 01:00:50,620
Yeah.

1211
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,620
Nice.

1212
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:53,660
Seriously nice.

1213
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,460
Seriously a nice thing.

1214
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,460
Seriously cool.

1215
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:02,540
Alright, um... let me pull up the Patreon and do Patreon shoutouts because I know we have

1216
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:03,540
at least one new...

1217
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,900
Yeah, we got one new...

1218
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:11,900
I think it's Brian Tunneler.

1219
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:13,740
I think it's Brian Regan.

1220
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,740
Thank you Brian Regan.

1221
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:20,860
We're a few small podcast hosts and we want to crawl up inside your asshole and just explore

1222
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:26,660
what it's like up there.

1223
01:01:26,660 --> 01:01:27,820
What were you asking before?

1224
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,820
Sorry.

1225
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:32,740
Do you think I should stream me playing games?

1226
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,700
Yeah.

1227
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:42,980
I just got this new game called Session and I've been playing it and it's just me learning

1228
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,060
how to play the game.

1229
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:46,060
Yeah that would be fun.

1230
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:48,700
I have 4 hours logged and I'm still not very good at the game.

1231
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:50,380
You should stream it.

1232
01:01:50,380 --> 01:01:51,540
You think people would be into that?

1233
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,400
I'd watch it.

1234
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,580
And that's all that matters.

1235
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,260

1246
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,060
We should be done with this punishment.

1247
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:41,020
If you don't like how the show has been going, you're gonna love our episode on Sunday.

1248
01:02:41,020 --> 01:02:44,180
We record on Sunday, but then it comes out on Monday.

1249
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:48,060
And then the week after that, Pat's in LA.

1250
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:51,700
And then we're gonna have the best episodes we've ever done.

1251
01:02:51,700 --> 01:03:00,300
We're gonna have a Jollibee party, so if you're in the LA area, keep next weekend open.

1252
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:01,300
You're invited to come eat Jollibee.

01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:02,300
Yeah, because something's gonna happen.

1254

Yeah, if you know what we're saying.

1255
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:07,180
Something's going to happen.

1256
01:03:07,180 --> 01:03:11,300
Something big is gonna blow up in a, kind of like in an online sense though.

01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,620
I mean like we're gonna blow up viral.

1258
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:17,660

1259
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,660
We're gonna go viral with our new Jollibee challenge.

1260
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:21,660
Yeah.

1261
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:26,100
We're gonna put viruses in the Jollibee food.

1262
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:29,880
We're gonna go in, we're gonna say, "Can I have one chickenjoy?"

1263
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,300
And we're gonna go viral.

1264
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,300
Yeah.

1265
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,300
That's gonna be viral.

1266
01:03:33,300 --> 01:03:36,060
Cause everyone's gonna be like, "A chickenjoy?

1267
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,180
What?"

1268
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,780
And then we say, "No, it's a Jollibee thing."

1269
01:03:40,780 --> 01:03:43,860
And then Jollibee will hire us to make commercials for them.

1270
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:44,860
Yeah.

1271
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:47,300

01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:49,300
Yeah.

1274
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:53,620
Everybody wish me a safe trip on my flight or I will fucking die.

1275
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,020
Yeah, Patrick's afraid of planes.

1276
01:03:56,020 --> 01:04:03,020
He doesn't mind the heights, he's just really afraid of seat trays.

1277
01:04:03,020 --> 01:04:09,220
I'm flying on Malaysian Air flight 93.

1278
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:14,060
Malaysian Air United 93 is what I'm flying on.

1279
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,380
So I'm a little nervous.

1280
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:19,420
Alright, bye.

1281
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:20,300
Goodbye everybody.
