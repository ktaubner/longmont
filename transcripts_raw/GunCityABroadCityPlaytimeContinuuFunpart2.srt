A Broad City

00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,740
Playtime continue fun

8
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,740
You thought you'd have a simple

00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,740
Christmas celebration on a luxury

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,740

00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:49,740

00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,740
doing? He's playing

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,740
He's playing with his phone. I'm moving all the shit around

14
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,740
so that my phone doesn't get onto

15
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,740
the cables and doesn't make a noise. Thank you

16
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,740
That turned into a disaster

17
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,740
Sorry, that's the next part of the

18
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,740

00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,740
Alright, Pat.

20
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,740
Your boy, New Sullivan, stolen from you.

00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,740
Catatonic, you slept for months.

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,740
Now, you awaken, disturbed, but ready for action.

23
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:21,740
Belinda Crokes, Leo's gal Friday, contacted you to handle the case of Playtime.

24
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,740
The man who's been terrorizing Pleasure Palace.

25
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,740
Who stole away your boy.

26
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,740
Ah, well we don't know if he's a man, now that I think about it.

27
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,740
Oh, clue.

36
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:11,340
name tag. Probably. Caesar. Caesar. It says Caesar. Man. Man. So you went to the royal

37
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,060
district in the pleasure palace and you took the job. And then you were attacked by a nope

38
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:24,740
mysterious monster. Don't hype. Stop that. Yep. Fuck you. Okay. Buttercup. Afterwards

39
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:31,440
Playtime struck again, another childless couple, but this time members of the Royal Guard, a grave crime.

40
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,400
Now you have a new murder on your hands. I'm directing our attention to the new murder.

41
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,160
It's right here on the table. Oh shit motherfucker. Oh!

42
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,740
And some leads to track down.

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,740
Damn!

44
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,680
So I'm gonna give you guys a little bit of a, just a little bit of a

45
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,200
kind of a little recap, it's been a little bit.

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,780
So you're on space station Leo's Pleasure Palace

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,060
Courtesy of King Leo who you guys knew as Leo the collector yeah back in the day. He's had that gully

48
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,300
Mali yes, so we get a galleon galleon go

49
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,060
your son

50
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:14,420
New Sullivan was kidnapped right you hope by playtime

51
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:21,300
Mysterious serial killer who's been targeting primarily childless couple so how would he why would he be killed?

52
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,100
We've lost all hope because no serial killer in their right mind

53
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,300
Kidnaps a kid that serial killer kill a kid before or only adults so yeah

54
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,380
You guys are gonna get the debrief on this so he's trying to get us to come get it so that we fall

55
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:41,620
So we'll be so we will be abandoning our child. Yeah, so yeah you three are detectives, right?

56
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,620
You decide to do one last job again, right?

57
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,180
To make sure

58
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,700
Cool, so what happened recently and we'll talk we'll talk through some of the app

59
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,280
I kind of want to like I feel like a lot of time

60
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,100
I kind of do a little bit too much of a like so what do you want to do so I want to actually like

61
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,140
Kind of curtail your options here make it clear what you have going on

62
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:10,220
So you just killed a monster that seemed to rise up from somewhere inside the space station

63
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,520
Yeah, it's been like three weeks. Yeah, it's been a minute. So nope. It's been three weeks. I just said that okay

64
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,860
That's you know what I'm sorry you're right is what you just said. It's not a minute was a minute ago

65
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,460
Okay, fancy man with your literal

66
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,620
ideas

67
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:33,540
So you're standing right now in the mess hall where that childless couple was killed this time their members of the Royal Guard

68
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,740
Playtime has killed two other couples

69
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,020
so

70
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,960
Is killed so it was kidnapped or killed?

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,340
New Sullivan then you guys were catatonic and then he went on

72
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:55,760
They went on a little spree of killing other couples. Tell me he did not get Tom Holland and Zendaya

73
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:58,980
No comment

74
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,080
Play time has killed two other couples. So both of them were new gun City residents

75
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,940
so you guys are on the state plates the the the the space station and

76
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:15,220
But so they were just residents of that of this the space station, but they were never like actual members of Leo's Royal Guard

77
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:19,260
That's where it's kind of like now like Elvis is getting kind of serious. They're getting kind of bold

78
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:24,780
Every time they've killed them the space station has had like a like a blackout

79
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,700
Like so not like the lights are out, but like the powers down which happens in massive like

80
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:37,260
Space stations that can happen on occasion, but it seems to be literally this happens then somebody dies

81
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Okay

82
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,780
Yeah, the lights the lights go out like the power goes out basically like there's like among us like among us

83
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,780
What's among us?

84
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,740
And me

85
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,980
Plays it with my damn neck. No, I don't play with adults only

86
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,220
Can you show the adults only?

87
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,840
Patches plays a special copy of the game called among kids

88
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,380
It's not true. His character is two times bigger than everyone

89
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,680
It's not true

90
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,220
Glass it's not Julio. Can you please put up the the thing I wanted to have put up?

91
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,280
No

92
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,780
Yeah, thank you. Oh here. I'll so

93
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,380
This is a basically a sort of a map of

94
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:44,660
So cam is leaning over so that people can see the space station

95
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:50,720
But so I can't a station is on the back of our that's one that's usually out of this window. Yes, that's correct

96
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,400
So one that we're on yes the one that you're on

97
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,800
We talked about the logic here you guys are controlling

98
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:06,520
Oh, we're in a control booth. You're in a control. We are that's like yes sitting right and we're controlling these

99
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:14,180
These guys are in the table where we're playing is in the thing in the window

100
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:21,600
All right, so makes perfect sense only one look it looked cool. I just look that's what I wanted. Okay. Let's okay

101
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
No, you're fine. So um

102
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:29,160
Sorry, I'm pulling it up on my end as well. Just so I can well. It's right there. Oh, it's a good point so nope

103
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:33,160
Nope, that's pretty good.

104
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,160
It is there though.

105
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,160
Okay, I believe you.

106
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,160
Why does this spaceship look like the things you see in the ads that are like,

107
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,160
"This thing will suck the shit out of your clit"?

108
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,160
If you had to guess why.

109
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,160
If I had to guess why?

110
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,160
Yeah.

111
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Is it supposed to?

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,160
Yeah.

113
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,160
I thought maybe it was supposed to be a shrimp or something.

114
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Shrimps will also suck the shit out of your...

115
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
Is that what you said the first time you saw one of those?

116
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Like, "Ah, it's like a fucking purple shrimp!"

117
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,160
"Ah, it's like a shrimp for your pussy!"

118
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,160
Yeah.

119
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
It was like a, uh, a stranded, like, uh,

120
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,160
a sailor stranded at sea.

121
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
It's like a woman used to masturbate to cucumbers for decades

122
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
and for hundreds of years they put shrimp

123
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
in that one when a woman called the top artist a quid.

124
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
I wanna know, I wanna know why it looks like that

125
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,160
for the story.

126
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,160
He's going into the... He's a pleasure pal.

127
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
He's going into the back of the... Also, it's a sex toy.

128
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,420
Leo loves toys.

129
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,360
No, you're not.

130
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,200
There's lots of things going on here.

131
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,320
- Pat's going into the sex toy shop at the mall

132
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,720
and he's looking through the window

133
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,080
and everyone sees him drooling.

134
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,200
But they're all morphing into shrimps.

135
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,440
(laughing)

136
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,800
- Oh.

137
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,280
- So you guys can see the,

138
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,880
so where you are now is that royal district

139
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,160
on the top there.

140
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,020
So, and you can see there,

141
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,240
there's New Gun City, the upper district,

142
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,360
and there's New Gun City, the downer district.

143
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
- Weatherman vibes.

144
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,120
And then there's the resort, the Ten Seasons,

145
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,840
which is in the middle over there.

146
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,960
- I'm just pointing random spots I can't tell.

147
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:07,000
- Then there's Funderland, which is temporarily closed,

148
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,160
which is the amusement park mall,

149
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,400
fun zone where Leo's, majority of Leo's collection is.

150
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,280
I think the pointing is helping somebody, keep doing that.

151
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,320
Then we've got the command deck,

152
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,400
that's where Gumby Superior, who you met earlier,

153
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,480
the captain of the space station is,

154
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,240
and his crew are among the station operations

155
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
and also in the command deck.

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,440
- Hey, here's a question.

157
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,560
Why do you need a captain?

158
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,360
Doesn't that space station just kinda fuckin' sit there?

159
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,520
- Well, yeah, it's a good question.

160
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,400
Well, I think he's kinda running the space station.

161
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,480
- It's like Deep Space Nine, it's because they have a--

162
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,880
- So he's a president.

163
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,720
- He's sort of like a president.

164
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,040
- There has to be a military presence.

165
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,960
- Yeah, he was, yeah, so he was a war hero

166
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:53,960
in the Vampire Wars, who now works as a contractor

167
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,040
for this kinds of things.

168
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,400
- No, that's all you need to know.

169
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,240
- That explains everything.

170
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,160
- Yeah, so he was hired kind of on contract.

171
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,480
It's also kind of a political move by Leo to be like,

172
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,600
look, I can get the general from your Vampire Wars

173
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,520
and just bring him onto my space station.

174
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,040
- Leo's badass for that.

175
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,240
He's like Commander Sisko.

176
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,920
- Yeah, I haven't seen Deep Space Nine.

177
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:14,760
- You're like Commander Crisco.

178
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,480
- Come on, come on.

179
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:21,980
So then you have the ship crew quarters over there,

180
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:24,160
then you have the leprechaun slave quarters.

181
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,640
Then you have the undercity.

182
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
- Interesting creative choice.

183
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,760
- The undercity is not--

184
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,120
- Wait, underwear?

185
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,640
Oh, did I do that?

186
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,120
Fuck!

187
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,080
- So the undercity isn't like an officially sanctioned part

188
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,320
of the space station, but it is,

189
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
if you go through the downer district,

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,100
you will eventually get towards the undercity.

191
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,700
There's obviously, there's a couple docking bays,

192
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:51,700
One for freight, so like for supplies that are brought in by the Downer District.

193
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,700
Then you have docking bays for military ships by the Royal District.

194
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,700
And then docking bays for tourists who are right inside of the Ten Seasons Resort.

195
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:07,700
In between the ship, so that sort of like spot between the top half and the bottom half.

196
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,700
Lots of goods and folks, in this case leprechauns and ship crew,

197
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,740
fly through there sort of an anti-gravity kind of like section of

198
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,660
maintain to hold their breath

199
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,420
I know so they put on space suit and they like will help shepherd goods up and

200
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,860
also travel that way like in that movie

201
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,460
that's a dope ass basically that ways they don't ever interrupt anybody at the

202
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,380
resort so you guys go you guys have to kind of go through space I don't have to

203
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,740
take the long way around

204
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:35,780
yes they also have to take a long way around there is all hey now I want to

205
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,660
take the fucking long way around

206
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,660
Well, you can't. We do.

207
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,660
I mean, you should have to take the long way.

208
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,660
Well, you guys get to use the zippy loop, which is the automatic.

209
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:50,660
You guys used that earlier. It's sort of the like kind of like super fast train inside of the space station

210
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:52,660
that gets you to wherever you want to go.

211
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,660
So where the leprechauns are not allowed on the zippy loop.

212
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,660
That's why you had that altercation last time.

213
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,660
If you remember, the ship crew can ride the zippy loop.

214
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,660
But if you're transporting goods or, you know, for speed,

215
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,940
it makes more sense to move through that little chamber there.

216
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:10,740
Finally, there's the guts of the station.

217
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,860
And you basically just have the entrances to them.

218
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,020
The whole station has the guts inside them, right?

219
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,660
It's just like places for the plumbing, electricity,

220
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,940
the power cores that help power the station.

221
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,420
All of that exists there.

222
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,580
The ones that are visible to anybody who's works at the,

223
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,420
or is on the main area of the ship,

224
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,260
or just the upper and lower section of it.

225
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,180
But there's a separate map entirely for the full guts of the station

226
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,960
That's where the crew and where the leprechaun slaves do most of their work maintaining the ship

227
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,020
Sometimes moving between certain places my guts are full of ship, too

228
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:51,480
So where you guys so I want to give you guys that that kind of overlay because right now we're moving into sort of the

229
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:58,980
Investigation portion right so you have the the the dead couple here in the mess hall you guys are the detectives

230
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:03,540
There's also a dead monster outside that might you might want to look at as well

231
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,200
You can do that and then this

232
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:12,700
It's that the puppy no, it's not quite that it was that's not the puppy. No is this guy?

233
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,580
Yeah, yeah go down here

234
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,580
Yeah, I remember that guy

235
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,140
So you can start to examine the bodies and then figure what to do from there examining

236
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,380
You can also go to the previous murder scenes as well after you do that.

237
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:37,140
And then you can also go to the space station, the command deck as well and visit with Gumby Superior.

238
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:40,020
You can talk with some of the ship crew and some of the people who are in the inner workings

239
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,020
so you can get other information from them.

240
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,660
So that's kind of... And then you can also go back to the resort.

241
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:48,660
If you remember, Giancarlo also said, "Hey, if you ever want extra money,

242
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,140
I have some things I could ask you to do."

243
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,700
So he kind of has like side quests for you basically.

244
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,980
You guys get a thousand tokens a day as a stipend.

245
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,540
It costs you each 500 to stay in the hotel every night every night

246
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:06,600
So we get so you basically get 500 token is like 25 cents arcade token

247
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,860
So it's not that much money you guys you guys are also there are shops in the upper

248
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,420
District the lower district and in the under city. I'll just tell you that where you can get some

249
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:20,140
Exclusive gear to your characters if you save up

250
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,280
Appropriately, and if you do side jobs for Giancarlo as well

251
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,060
But so that's kind of lay of the land

252
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:33,300
Do you want to start investigating here that people are kind of around you kind of looking expectantly you guys are the detectives who were just?

253
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:37,380
Hired where there's a dead couple so you guys right now at the mess hall the royal district

254
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,220
There's I was just gonna say I want to go to Auntie Anne's

255
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,100
the Auntie Anne's would be in

256
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,860
Funderland here there is

257
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,860
Unky Ben's and says and he just has rice

258
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
Yeah

00:14:54,380 --> 00:15:01,460
Call me Gary C. Enterprise. What color is he? He's purple like everybody else. Okay. Thank you asshole. Thank God

260
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,800

Hello

265
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,620
Wait that worked. That's all move

266
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:29,820
So yeah, I mean you guys okay wait. No. I'm investigating them right now. Okay, cool. Yeah, roll just roll it you can roll investigate

267
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:40,020
Investigating like that threes company before the crowd oh my god. They fuck you oh

268
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,940
There's yellow

269
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,780
Yellow legit on the betrothed I can't

270
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,460
Guys I'm noticing something

271
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:54,780
There's no is a semen on the body. No

272
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:07,860
Don't eat the yellow come Jingleheimer who is the head of the Royal Guard?

273
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:14,460
But the division specifically around investigations as there is no yellow jizz on there. Hi

274
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah

275
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,020
Yeah, you're very good

276
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:27,300
25 Wow okay with the 25. Give me a second

277
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,260
That's pretty good, so yeah, okay

278
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:38,620
Looking at these corpses you can see the same types of wounds that you probably heard from the dossier

279
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,680
Red from the dossier that you receive from Belinda and other authorities have described no struggling

280
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:48,980
Clean cut almost like from the ether. It's like it's like almost like a slice from nowhere

281
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:54,020
There's no like entrance or exit that you can really tell it's like a clean just like

282
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,740
very very neat

283
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:59,420
There's no blood coming out of there. Oh, there's blood

284
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,000
There's blood gushing and there's the toys that are sticking out of there if you remember Gumby superior action figure sticking out of one

285
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,540
Oh, and and the Bill Cosby children's book sticking out of the other

286
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,500
The victims are in their late 30s

287
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,500
And Jingleheimer would be telling you this.

288
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Sorry.

289
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Jingleheimer would be telling you this.

290
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
They joined the god together.

291
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
It didn't seem like they'd have kids anytime soon or at all.

292
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Which makes sense why they'd be victims.

293
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,500
You look through their wallet and you see pictures of them with their dog.

294
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,500
Oh.

295
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
And a freak.

296
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,500
Their dog must have put fucking yellow booger jizz all over their fucking bottom.

297
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:44,500
And a freak, their freak who must have been their attendant.

298
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Who appears part fungoid. Freaks, for those who don't know,

299
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
and for you guys who also don't know,

300
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:57,500
are sort of, they're kind of like Futurama-style, like, you know,

301
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,500
mutants that live in the sewers of Gun City.

302
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,500
But on Leo's Space Station, they've been given a little bit more.

303
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
Yeah, that's sort of what they look like.

304
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,220
Pull that one up. Yeah, pull it up. Yeah, you pull that up

305
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:16,820
Good

306
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:19,180
Yeah, yeah, that's

307
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,460
Sort of like yeah, like a facial tattoos. Yeah

308
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:30,620
Yeah, kind of like a tattooed delinquent type of guy mutate. Yeah, so like you guys met sentient Tommy guns

309
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:38,500
In the first adventure you've met fat cricket guys. That was papi Chuko and those aren't freaks though freaks are

310
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,660
basically have a genuine deformity and impurity.

311
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,100
It's a very racist designation.

312
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,620
- They're impure, you say.

313
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,100
- Basically, it's a mic, they're literally like mixed race.

314
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,620
- I thought you were going to say a mic.

315
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,580
- Yeah, I thought so too.

316
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,500
- That would be horrible.

317
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:57,540
That'd be way worse than mixed race.

318
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,580
- This crowd is not, we don't take too fondly to that.

319
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,980
- By mixed race, I mean fungus, fungoid and human,

320
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,260
which their freak is, Yanni.

321
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,900
- You should've said mixed species.

322
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,660
Mixed species, thank you.

323
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,660
I should have said that way earlier.

324
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,500
- Specious.

325
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,340
- Speciously.

326
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,160
- Speciously.

327
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,620
- Pesaur, Pesaur, help me out.

328
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,460
- What the hell is wrong with you?

329
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,460
- What is happening?

330
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,300
- Help me.

331
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,120
- What is happening?

332
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,020
- I'm catching whatever he caught.

333
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,500
So yeah, butt freaks are treated well.

334
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,340
- Butt freaks.

335
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:30,580
(laughing)

336
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,820
- Okay, everybody let's be quiet for 10 minutes.

337
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
- This is impossible.

338
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,660
- Go on.

339
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,500
- Literally you're not gonna have--

340
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,180
I could be quiet for 10 minutes, watch me.

341
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,020
- Okay.

342
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,380
Now I'm being quiet, hold on.

343
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:46,240
He's, Cam's tickling Caleb.

344
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,920
For those listening.

345
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,720
- Okay, now let's, okay.

346
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,520
- All right, so other things that you see

347
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,680
when you're examining their body,

348
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,520
what's that?

349
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,760
(laughing)

350
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay.

351
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,640
- Let's wiggle these giggles out.

352
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,480
- Cleanse.

353
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
- Come on, wiggle 'em.

354
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,760
one two three four five six seven eight nine zero is what we get for for not

355
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,400
being in the same room for three weeks

356
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,800
what this is what i get

357
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,000
yeah

358
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,240
ever really catch another

359
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,160
yeah yeah i like that so

360
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:27,200
you would notice that uh... the stories inside of the wounds

361
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,200
are

362
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
seem to have

363
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,960
deformities themselves

364
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,040
no poop

365
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,320
There's no poop on them.

366
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,520
Please stop.

367
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,120
Come on.

368
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,080
This is, is this what it's like?

369
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:41,920
- No!

370
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,760
(laughing)

371
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:43,580
No.

372
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:48,580
- So, and the Cosby book has like misspellings on it.

373
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,440
Like there's something off about these toys.

374
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,880
- Yeah.

375
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,400
- Which, that's sort of what you notice about it as well.

376
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,440
- Do they seem like rip off knockoffs?

377
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,160
- Not quite rip off knockoffs.

378
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,040
They seem like not,

379
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,120
- They seem like, it's like misprints,

380
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
more than like rip-off knock-offs.

381
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,560
- Indeed.

382
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,840
- But yeah, so I mean, that's basically

383
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,960
what we were able to tell with that 25.

384
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,880
I mean, otherwise, I mean,

385
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,280
if you talk to some of the witnesses,

386
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:19,960
I'd say with that 25, investigation is kind of encompassing.

387
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,240
So you would hear that there was some,

388
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,320
the only kind of sound that that people heard,

389
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,680
'cause again, it was a blackout,

390
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,920
was some kind of metal against metal scraping.

391
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,760
Very light.

392
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,640
- Demons, their bodies are metal.

393
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,040
And they're actually robots.

394
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:35,880
- Robos.

395
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,600
- So we need to remove their skin

396
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,000
to reveal their cybertronic insides.

397
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,240
- Let's do that, but let me cue an action first.

398
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,560
We found their wallet.

399
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,600
Can I do see everything in there?

400
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,240
Can I just, I would like everything in there.

401
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,600
- You wanna, so there are a lot of people around.

402
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,640
- I'm not, okay, I'll take what I can take,

403
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,480
but I mostly, I also just wanna see everything.

404
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,480
- Aren't we investigators?

405
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,320
- Yeah, we're detectives.

406
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,560
- Don't we have badges?

407
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,740
I mean, yeah, but you know what that's we gotta put a police officer could never check somebody's wallet

408
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:10,000
Well, you could check somebody's wallet, but I'd wear it in light a hand if you're gonna take money

409
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,280
I never said I was taking money. I said I said I'd see everything in there. I said you wanted everything

410
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,720
Oh wait, I think I dropped my wallet over is anyone see a fucking wallet. Oh, I think I saw it

411
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,640
It's right in that pocket. Oh my god. What are the odds of dude perfect shit?

412
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,360
I pick it back up or not back

413
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,180
I pick it up for the first time but they don't know that and I open it and what do I see dear patch so

414
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,600
- So you saw pictures inside of it,

415
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,040
you see a credit card of their family.

416
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,880
- Their fannies?

417
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,720
- No, there's no butt pictures.

418
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,560
- Oh, goddammit.

419
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,680
- It was, changed it for the UK viewers.

420
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,600
- You see 300 tokens also in one of the wallets,

421
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,200
and 50 tokens in another wallet.

422
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,760
- Fanny's butt here, but it's pussy there.

423
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,600
- I'm taking the credit card,

424
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,120
and I'm gonna basically do a trace back

425
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,960
and see everything they ever bought in their life.

426
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,040
- And I'll take the money.

427
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,960
you could do a trace back on that all

428
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,800

00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,060

Yeah, get up in there

457
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:48,480
Inside these people

458
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,960
Listen yellow slime what what's so Belinda doesn't trust us. What's going on?

459
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,800
It's not that she doesn't trust you. It's that she wants to make sure there's oversight on the investigation from a royal guard

460
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,960
Okay. Well, he's doing a card tracker

461
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,820
Trace trace back with a card and I'm looking at the money to see if it's counterfeit or fake

462
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:14,520
I'm gonna test it out at a couple of stores around here and I'm wearing a purse to disguise myself as a woman

463
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:19,160
Okay, well here's what here's what he's doing actually I just decided for him

464
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:24,940
He's gonna dress up like each of them individually and walk around the spaceship to see if the killer thinks that maybe they survive

465
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:29,040
Try to kill him again. That's what I'll do. Yeah. Yeah now. Let me take off the

466
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:33,480
I'll do one of the broads clothes. I'll do one half

467
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:40,420
Male clothes and then the other half that's team is close. You look like Lady Gaga. Yeah

468
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:47,400
All right, no, I I'm going to have to forbid you from doing that are you gonna try? Oh, no we got forbidden

469
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:58,360
All right, yeah, I mean like okay, but like why though also what what you don't want this to be investigated

470
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,080
There's protocol to consider what?

471
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:07,860
Like not undressing the victims making sure we'll don't go do it in a lab. We're not undressing

472
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,860
We're just combining their clothes together.

473
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,860
We're only gonna take half of both their clothes.

474
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:17,860
It's not undressing, it's just combining half of the two shirts.

475
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:23,860
We'll take 49% of each and we'll put some random white cloth down the middle so you can see the line.

476
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,860
Who's the leader of this ship, us or you?

477
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,860
None of us. None of us are the leader of this ship.

478
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:30,860
That's what I thought, so don't tell us what to do.

479
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:38,720
I mean, okay. I mean he's gonna try the Royal Guard there are going to try to stop you from taking the clothes

480
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,240
Well, then we won't do it patches. I'm just saying I'm if you want to do it. Let's go to do that trace back

481
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,680
That's what I'm yeah, okay cool what they were doing before they got to this so if you want to

482
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,960
You can go back to your resort room. I guess that's where oh, do you know what actually we need?

483
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,140
I just as a it it feels weird to not have something

484
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:01,040
But can we can someone just put their credit card on the table so I can use it like to play it just

485
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,680
For the game, I mean, yeah, yeah, cuz I just it just feels weird my wall. It's not with me though. Yeah, I don't know if I

486
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:19,160
Apple pay is fine. Well, you just pull up your Apple pay I could use I mean that that works. It's probably futuristic

487
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,140
Yeah, just pull up his Apple just pull up your Apple pay. Maybe and I we can use that

488
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:27,120
Yeah, I left my all my it's like we're doing like it. We're doing a visual component

489
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,440
Yeah, yeah, this will work perfectly.

490
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Man, I wish I could steal all the money off his phone.

491
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:40,280
Cool, so where do you guys, you guys want to go, you guys can go to your resort, you

492
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,720
guys, like your room you can turn into sort of a makeshift crime lab is what I was thinking.

493
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:49,360
Okay, so are we actually like, we're detectives hired by the ship or no?

494
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,960
You're hired, yes.

495
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,800
So they don't give us anything?

496
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,480
I mean they will give you equipment to build the lab.

497
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,840
You can also do it in the like lab here, but like okay. No, what is I just yeah?

498
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,760
I just wasn't sure our last interaction

499
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,800

This is my life's work.

00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:32,620
We've been testing you the whole time and I mean you got me pretty good.

556
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,620
You got me past one test.

557
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,620
You passed the one test, you immediately failed the second test and it's like...

558
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,620
This is terrible.

559
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,620
But now you have to pass a third test.

560
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,620
Yeah.

561
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,620
Okay, bring it on.

562
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,620
Where is this coming from?

563
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Well, he's a demon with a computer tower on his back.

564
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,620
Wrong, I'm from Cincinnati.

565
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,620
Oh no, I didn't even...

566
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
I definitely wasn't going to guess that, so...

567
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,960
- Hello, you got me. - Listen up, listen up.

568
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,260
- What's up? - You fucker.

569
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,100
We, basically two people died.

570
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,740
We need to do a trace back on a credit card.

571
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,940
- Okay. - So, and we were told

572
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,740
that you maybe have some technological capabilities.

573
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,460
- I do indeed, I do indeed.

574
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:10,580
And what's, what are you?

575
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:11,740
- I'm a frog. - I don't care.

576
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,780
Get off the computer.

577
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,740
Okay, and he gets onto the computer.

578
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:17,260
He takes the credit card, he runs it through.

579
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,100
- Here's the credit card.

580
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,380
- Okay, cool, thank you.

581
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:24,180
He takes the credit card, which is a, okay.

582
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,980
He takes the credit card, he runs it.

583
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:26,820
Fuck.

584
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,300
All right, he can stay here?

585
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:31,140
Yeah.

586
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:31,980
And the credit card, he can just--

587
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,020
And the recent purchases are for--

588
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:35,660
Can you swipe it?

589
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,300
Yeah, can you swipe it through the--

590
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,780
Okay, cool, now it's scanning.

591
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,380
It's scanning, okay.

592
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,420
The recent purchases are for a,

593
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,700
hmm, what did they recently buy?

594
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,540
Probably what they bought was a crackpot.

595
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,100
It's just like random purchases.

596
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,220
It's like random human purchases.

597
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,060
Nothing clueful.

598
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:57,980
Nothing clueful.

599
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:58,820
Nothing clueful.

600
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,640
Not a single clue.

601
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,820
Can we investigate further?

602
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,380
I mean, I will say, okay, here's another,

603
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,380
I mean, I will say that it is very clear

604
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:09,800
from their purchases, nothing about having a kid ever.

605
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,940
Nothing about having a kid,

606
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,140
so they're definitely childless.

607
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,980
Definitely childless.

608
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,800
And no intentions of having a kid.

609
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:16,860
No intentions either.

610
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,700
They're dinks.

611
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,700
They're getting stuff like...

612
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,700
Double income, no kids.

613
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,700
Yes, they're dinks.

614
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,700
They must have been from planet dink.

615
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,700
I think they were just from...

616
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
I believe they were just from

617
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,700
New England. The New England Empire.

618
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,700
That's fine. Yeah, that's what I said.

619
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:35,700
So listen, we basically ran out of

620
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,700
fucking shit to do in there.

621
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,700
Can you tell us... here, wait.

622
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,700
Can you run some kind of test?

623
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,700
Whether it be DNA or...

624
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,700
Yes. You could maybe put these in a microwave.

625
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,700
- Hold on, I got a question.

626
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,700
- Can you run these on this toy in this book?

627
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,100
- He runs the test on the toy in the book.

628
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:56,020
- And also, have you ever seen a bunch of yellow jizz

629
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:57,660
on a dead person?

630
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,000
- Yellow jizz.

631
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,020
- Okay, I've piqued his interest.

632
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:03,860
- Roll insight.

633
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,680
- Oh my god.

634
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,860
- Two.

635
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,220
- He doesn't know anything about yellow jizz.

636
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,980
- Oh, goddammit.

637
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,820
- Okay, I'm gonna ask you again

638
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,500
if you know anything about yellow jizz.

639
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:21,080
No, no, no, no, you don't know. Okay, do you know anything about color different types of jizz run the test?

640
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,260
He's running the test. He says yes, of course I do yes, of course while he's running the test and

641
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:31,820
So he says strange the DNA on these toys

642
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,060
Been handled by nobody in our system

643
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:42,900
No, and he looks at the serial number on the must be must be a terrible test cuz I was touching them all over

644
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,140
Well, yeah, I mean I put him in my mouth I

645
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:52,720
Was washing them with water besides you three we will come up a thousand times when I look at the toys

646
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:59,860
And only in that the half-life on that would suggest you did it in five seconds actually this one says you you're going to eat

647
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,420
The toy again. I don't know how it's doing that

648
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:07,000
Spit it out. No, please

649
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:15,300
He gets on his face and he throws it back in the thing now. He's got my DNA on it. Yeah, no these

650
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,020
These toys don't exist I

651
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:26,020
Mean not not these toys these kinds of toys exist, but there's no trace of these toys in the system

652
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:30,580
Nobody's handled them. Nobody's touched them. It's like they were plucked from thin air

653
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:37,460
hmm, is there some kind of where would these toys if they were if they were real and

654
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:43,460
Traceable, where would they be from so are they manufactured somewhere on the ship or is there a toy store?

655
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:47,140
somewhere around or in the world Santa

656
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:53,580
Or did Santa Claus deliver these in a poor way maybe to a poor child who didn't get wasn't good enough for a real toy

657
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
And hold on let me try to see

658
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,100
You see all the same typing

659
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,580
It's like when old people type into Google, and they do a full sentence

660
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,300
- He's got a question mark at the end.

661
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,380
He's doing typing exactly what we just said.

662
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,140
- Well, I would say the only place

663
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,260
where you could find untraceable objects

664
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,420
such as this would be,

665
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,980
and I'm not supposed to say this, but--

666
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,820
- Then don't say it.

667
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:16,660
Whoa, come on.

668
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,660
- We don't wanna know what's wrong with you.

669
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,820
(laughing)

670
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,220
- Okay, I'll write it down.

671
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,300
And I'll write it down in code.

672
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,360
You have to decode it.

673
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,460
- That sounds hard.

674
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,660
You can get in trouble, just tell us.

675
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:27,580
- Okay.

676
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,860
The undercity.

677
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:32,540
At least as far as objects that are untraceable.

678
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,540
Underwear? Oh, he got me! Oh shit!

679
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:39,540
He's dead. He's dead now. I'm just playing.

680
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,540
I'm just playing. Yes, the Undercity.

681
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,540
At least as far as objects that would be untraceable that would be on this ship,

682
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:49,540
everything else is accounted for. Occasionally, some goods will slip through our system.

683
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,540
But the fact that there's no fingerprint traces on this is what,

684
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:55,540
besides of course all the saliva you guys put on it, but,

685
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,540
is peculiar. But I would start there if we're talking about goods that don't seem to come from anywhere in particular.

686
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:05,540
So the undercity is the very tip of the bottom part.

687
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:09,540
See the undercity, the way to get there is, there's no zippy loop to the undercity.

688
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:13,540
So does that mean we can ride the gravitator?

689
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,540
You could definitely ask for authorization to do that.

690
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:21,540
But, you can't just ride through the gravitator.

691
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,540
Says you or what? Here's the thing, the gravitator...

692
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:29,540
Funny it's just encapsulated in exchange.

693
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:33,500
because it is that means you can ask for authorization to do that

694
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,420
so i can bureaucratic here's what i would say i got a lot of talk here's what i

695
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,180
would say

696
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,360
uh...

697
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,520
there's two ways you get there yes

698
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,020
the gravitate will go back to that the first way

699
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,780
that would be most normal people's way he would be take the city look to the

700
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:48,500
downer district in gun city

701
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,380
and walk

702
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,940
through to the other side of the editor i just said that

703
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,160
uh... it was not called but i love that name so i was i didn't even given name

704
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,020
didn't wasn't as important to me

705
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
as it is to you guys.

706
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,580
- That's some more than shit to me.

707
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,980
I wanna ride that bitch.

708
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,460
- So I gotta change the sleep timer on my laptop.

709
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,140
Sorry.

710
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:09,480
So the undercity, to get to the Gravitator,

711
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,900
and to get access to the Gravitator,

712
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,980
you could go, again, you guys are detectives,

713
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,260
you work with the Royal Guard,

714
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,060
you could head over to Gumby Superior

715
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,820
and talk to the cap, talk to him.

716
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,420
He'd be able to give you access.

717
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,860
- I don't wanna do all that, I wanna just get on.

718
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:25,700
- You just wanna get on?

719
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,900
- I just wanna try to get in there.

720
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,820
- You just wanna try to get in there?

721
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:35,620
So the way you could just try to get in there, you would still have to go through the station operations and the command deck.

722
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,820
Do you have the map up? You have it up? Can you pull it up?

723
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,820
For them? Or at least... yeah.

724
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,320
Aw, yeah.

725
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:43,820
Yeah, I see it.

726
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,520
Yeah.

727
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,420
So you could...

728
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,220
Maybe like soda or something?

729
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:51,820
I'm genuinely like... I'm so sleepy.

730
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,120
I think you'll make it.

731
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,220
We'll get you soda next time.

732
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:58,220
We should have more soda and snacks now that we're doing this in person.

733
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,220
The burden of soda is on the drinker. I just came up with that.

734
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
That is beautiful.

735
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:10,220
So, you can see here, if you go through the station operations, you could get to the...

736
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Oh shit, I'm an idiot, sorry. You're trying to get to the undercity, right?

737
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,220
Or you're trying to get to the Gravitator.

738
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:16,220
Well, we're trying to get to the Gravitator to go to the undercity.

739
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:19,220
Right, so where you are now in the Royal District, you could go...

740
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:24,220
You could take the zippy loop to the station operations area,

741
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,500
And then you'd still have to kind of go through the command deck, but if you just avoid

742
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,860
You know you you would have to just avoid

743
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:36,400
Alerting people get to the ship crew area and from the ship crew area you could ride

744
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:41,900
I feel like we could definitely do that because we're sneaky as fuck you guys are sneaky you have disguise abilities

745
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,020
Yeah, you guys are charming what you guys both bully me Linda's

746
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,820
Belinda whatever name is she's given us some

747
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,080
Yeah, you guys do whatever we want a little guys. Yes. Yes, I would say justice. Oh, yes

748
00:39:55,080 --> 00:40:01,060
I would say you have more license than like yes normally even if we get caught nobody's gonna be that pissed off

749
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:06,860
If you want to ride the gravitator, let's ride it. You can ride the ground here some kind of

750
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:11,420
Lethal weapon thing they yell at us in an office. Yeah

751
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:15,820
Yeah, as long as we don't get a desk job oh

752
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:22,420
I will say that maximum punishment is desk job. Okay. That's maximum

753
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,500
So if we fuck up getting a play time gets caught if we fuck up the next like 12

754
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,540
Episodes or us is patches saying like and then you fill out that report I

755
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:37,020
Mean you guys think we should really shut up, okay, I just say

756
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:44,300
Okay, oh, why don't you here? You're right. That's actually a great point turd. Why don't you it's credit?

757
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,560
Sorry did somebody did somebody hear a mouse fart just now

758
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:59,380
You're right, we're not we're not gonna go do that so we will get the authorization

759
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:04,900
So why don't you go on ahead and start talking to them about the authorization for you, and we'll catch up

760
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,460
Later and we'll talk about the other

761
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:13,820
Go get your authorization do your thing listen because we're pretty much celebrities on this ship at this point

762
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:20,000
Nobody's gonna stop us you you're basically the lowest of the low right Craig. You're like you need an

763
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,180
Great. Yeah, you said your name was Craig earlier there. You're basically like a worm

764
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,040
Okay. Yeah, I'm open to that. So

765
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,280
Okay, I'll go get authorization. Sorry

766
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,700
It's your worm if you wouldn't mind kind of inching away from us because it would make us smile. Oh, absolutely

767
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,220
Now your name is Craig the worm

768
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,980
There we go. I'm Sullivan the frog to Craig the worm

769
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,620
What a life

770
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,620
Here I go. You like it

771
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,860
See you guys later

772
00:41:53,860 --> 00:42:00,100
Alright yeah, he's gonna go get authorization

773
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:12,140
No, there's no Craig the worm actually how did you get on the ship?

774
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:14,140
Make a note that's all

775
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:24,260
We got that fucking piece of shit out of our hair cool. Yeah, so you guys can ride the zippy loop over to

776
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,460
You can ride it all the way to the command deck

777
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:30,940
It opens up

778
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,640
Yeah, you guys ride the zippy loop you get to the command deck

779
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:43,740
You know the doors of the zip you live with open up, and you see a pretty sweet-looking

780
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,700
command deck station you know very

781
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:52,900
Enterprise very Mass Effect very stately looking place this command deck is

782
00:42:52,900 --> 00:43:01,420
You see lots of crew members walking around and hurrying along you see occasional leprechaun slaves as well trudging along carrying

783
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:05,300
Which ones

784
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:11,780
Okay, yeah, they they nod back to you mm-hmm. Yeah, I'm doing the princess Diana wave to them, okay

785
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,300
They're ignoring you a little bit more because there's confused

786
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:23,460
Stately he looks and I start picking up the leprechaun the kind of smooching them on the forehead and you're kissing the slaves

787
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,740
Okay, so no dancing

788
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:32,180
And I'm jealous. Thank you, sir. So I'm turning it into a dance. Okay copycat

789
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:35,540
Okay

790
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:41,380
And then what and then what happens and then we just keep moving yeah, no, that's fine. Yeah, I think we're all dancing at some

791
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:46,140
Okay, so you guys are all dancing down through the through the through the command center

792
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:52,540
And you guys are gonna want to try to so here's the thing once you've arrived here. It's gonna be kind of like

793
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:57,280
Noticeable that you're here, so you just kind of as long as you just move quickly through it

794
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,640
Yeah, we'll do that you move quickly through it you get to the ship crew area

795
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:07,200
Now somebody is there and it's like they're just they just like don't recognize you they look up and go hey

796
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,540
Sorry

797
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:11,540
What what what team are you guys on?

798
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,980
Listen, we're on a team. Oh, we're in a special

799
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:17,340
investigation

800
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:19,340
from the red team

801
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:26,420
And we're set by either a Melinda or a Melinda and

802
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:34,300
We basically so basically people are getting murdered. It's this whole thing and we are going to leave now. Goodbye

803
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:37,320
You're just gonna about a walk right by you

804
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:46,120
What just just just I just need some just some ID every second that you hate somebody dies

805
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,860
Here's our ID. Oh

806
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,540
Somebody else's credit card. Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh, no, wait

807
00:44:56,180 --> 00:45:00,900
Unless that's your do we have IDs yeah, I mean you guys would have my hand over my idea

808
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:04,180
I know ID okay, all right you guys all have very funny IDs

809
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:08,580
Okay Peter Griffin

810
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,260
All right, this is all very funny all right you guys said you're sent by Belinda all right

811
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:16,500
Let me just check with her and he goes to a little terminal

812
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:20,480
His back is turned. He's checking on the terminal. He's typing that in

813
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:27,500
Yeah, no, they said they're here for to investigate a murder. They said every second

814
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:31,700
They said every second. I don't let them in somebody's dying

815
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:36,420
Yeah, you one of them handed me a someone else's credit card

816
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,980
Okay

817
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,580
Yeah, you guys are clear to go

818
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:45,660
That's what we thought so I bet you feel like a murderous asshole now that you know how many people died with your second

819
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,660
Yeah, and then look at this

820
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,860
Don't know who that is

821
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,580
It says, should I say it out loud?

822
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,380
Are you covering the name?

823
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,380
So for the folks at home, Patrick has a picture

824
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,500
of a man in a V-neck he's holding.

825
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,660
- It's a pit bull impersonator.

826
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:00,500
- Is that a pit bull impersonator?

827
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,420
- It's a business card of a pit bull impersonator.

828
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,380
- A piss bull.

829
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,220
- All right, so we'd like to--

830
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,040
- Yeah, you guys walk through.

831
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:06,060
- I'm getting that Gravitron, mother--

832
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,900
- All right, cool.

833
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:07,740
- The Gravitator.

834
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,060
- The Gravitator, okay, cool.

835
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,420
- Oh, but I would like to ride the Gravitron.

836
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,260
- Yeah.

837
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,220
- So you guys get to the,

838
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,100
get to where the, sort of, there's like these little like,

839
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:18,780
pods that like, are kind of look like escape pods,

840
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:22,780
But they open up and you see ship crew members jump through.

841
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,780
You see really large ones where there's like huge pieces of cargo just like kind of floating through.

842
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:33,780
They float gently through and then they like kind of land on like a track and then they get carted away.

843
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:36,780
But you guys see the pedestrian ones. You guys want to jump in?

844
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,780
Oh hell yeah!

845
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:40,780
Make sure you have your gear on.

846
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,780
So you go there, you get your breathable gear, your space gear.

847
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:53,700
can jump through before you do should set your destination to downers downers

848
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:57,980
be which will lead you to the interest of our we do that you guys set that and

849
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:06,100
yeah you're floating through space now oh my god as you're floating through

850
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:12,540
you're seeing all the goods and services go by you see leprechauns holding on to

851
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:16,540
objects and pushing them through you see crew members pushing things through

852
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:20,380
you see like all the splendor of

853
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,620
of planet E-Bomb like below you

854
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:26,860
it's a pretty uneasy feeling you can see why

855
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:32,140
this is usually reserved for people in the crew and leprechauns but it also

856
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,580
feels really really sweet. Yeah I've done this before

857
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:39,500
yeah you floated through space before? I've floated through space it's funny

858
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,500
What's it like?

859
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Fucking gay, I don't care.

860
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:51,000
[Laughter]

861
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
I don't care.

862
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:53,000
[Laughter]

863
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,500
Oh, that's so cool.

864
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,500
[Laughter]

865
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:57,500
Yeah.

866
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,500
You think that? You think it's fucking gay?

867
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,000
[Laughter]

868
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,000
That's tight, man.

869
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,000
Oh, wow, fire.

870
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
Oh, man.

871
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,500
Um, yeah.

872
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:10,500
*laughter*

873
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:18,500
Alright, cool, yeah. I mean, you guys do float through the gravitator, and now, I will say you now have permission. You guys are gonna be able to float through the gravitator.

874
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Oh, fuck yeah. Back and forth one more time.

875
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:21,500
Yeah, okay.

876
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,500
Revolving door style.

877
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:23,500
I'm just yawning.

878
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:27,500
You're just yawning? You're yawning, you're just like, "This is gay."

879
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:28,500
This is gay.

880
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,500
You're yawning about it.

881
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:31,500
I wanted to take the stairs.

882
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:33,500
*laughter*

883
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:38,140
You go back and forth a couple more times and then you end up in the undercity.

884
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,140
Underwear?

885
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,660
Oh my god.

886
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,740
How did each of us get got by that?

887
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,740
Motherfucker.

888
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:44,740
It is one of those things.

889
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,740
You get got by.

890
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:46,740
Hoe ass.

891
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:47,740
Yeah.

892
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:48,740
It is.

893
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:49,740
You showing your hoe ass?

894
00:48:49,740 --> 00:48:50,740
No.

895
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,740
Oh, motherfucker.

896
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:52,740
Shhh.

897
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,740
Cool.

898
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:54,740
Underwear?

899
00:48:54,740 --> 00:48:55,740
Oh.

900
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:02,740
Under where?

901
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,340
I remembered it.

902
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,340
Sorry. Yeah, the Undercity. Give me a second. Another one?

903
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:13,340
Yeah, you're gonna build it with fucking blocks? Nope, two seconds.

904
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:16,980
So, where you guys are, you guys

905
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,060
are arriving at the entrance of the Undercity. So you're in the Downer District first.

906
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,500
It shares some of the same architecture where you guys were going through last time was

907
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,180
the Upper

908
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,380
Gun City District, if you remember, it had all that kind of a

909
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,520
like kind of like white plastic-y kind of thing and like kind of circuitry

910
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,900
motherboard-y looking. PS5

911
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:39,300
yeah PS5 style. PS5-esque aesthetic.

912
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:42,340
yeah but the whites

913
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:46,380
here that were uniform throughout start to have like a blueish hue

914
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:50,100
there's the artificial sunlight that is in which is why your

915
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:53,900
your day bane is fine. The artificial sunlight is a bit dimmer in the Downer District

916
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:58,640
There's less spare in powering the ship and you see some of the buildings that have the

917
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,600
darker brown or black look to them and almost bulbous in shape.

918
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,500
These are refurbished parts taken from earlier space station attempts as well as space material

919
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:11,240
found in New England's exploits above E-Bomb.

920
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:15,840
So some of the scattered alien parts that were found and helped build this space station

921
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:16,840
together.

922
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:17,840
You start to see more of that architecture.

923
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:23,640
You see also more of England, New England's architecture that resembles more of the New

924
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,680
England sky cities that you had seen before, as well as elements of Old England.

925
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,960
So there's pasty shops here and tea houses and theaters, there's roundabouts.

926
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:36,160
It's kind of like much more of a hodgepodge, it feels much more of an organic city, kind

927
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:44,200
of like built rather than where the upper district feels much more like kind of created.

928
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,900
So the killing in the Downer District that took place,

929
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:48,000
so the killing, the first killing,

930
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,200
just to let you guys know if you want to explore

931
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:53,160
where the killing was in the Downer District,

932
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:57,320
it was on the very edge, kind of where you're gonna be.

933
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,040
And I just realized, you guys also bypassed

934
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:03,500
having that guard follow you, which is pretty smart.

935
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,840
So now, what's his name?

936
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:06,680
- I don't know.

937
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,200
- Jingleheimer doesn't know where you are.

938
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:09,200
I just realized, I was just like,

939
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:10,040
"Oh, would he know?

940
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:11,720
"He wouldn't be here."

941
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,880
So the couple was admiring,

942
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,220
So what you knew about from the dossier about the murder in the Downer District, the couple

943
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:20,200
was admiring one of Leo's life-sized toys.

944
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:25,580
These are found more often in Thunderland, but can also be seen in the Downer District.

945
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:30,680
So Leo's Sky Cities often have these life-sized toys that are like statues that are put up

946
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:35,040
and they'll sometimes have retractable heads and will pull out little guns.

947
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,960
It's like these fun attractions in New England.

948
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,660
So they were admiring them.

949
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,880
When the lights went out, the couple's throats were slashed, their toys were jutting from

950
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:48,500
them, they were slumped over. This couple was in their 50s, each long time

951
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:52,040
bachelor bachelorettes, they finally found the right person, or at least they felt

952
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:56,680
they did, and didn't last long. This was the first killing, too, where you are

953
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:03,640
right now. So there's no, I mean you guys can investigate this area too, or you can

954
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:08,320
just go right to the under city. I'm gonna investigate. Yeah. So in this area, again so,

955
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:12,280
the beginning of the under city, because the under city has a bit of a

956
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,280
different look. There's almost like an informal...

957
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:16,280
I'm gonna ask my character to tell him to investigate.

958
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,280
There's like a couple lamp posts to kind of create an informal

959
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:20,280
almost like gate entrance.

960
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,280
And also you'll notice that there's less

961
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,280
guard presence now.

962
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,280
So as you move further away, the guards

963
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:28,280
are not as present. So, um, yeah,

964
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,280
Caleb, you want to investigate? Yeah. This is a lamp post.

965
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,280
Hold on.

966
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,280
Hold on.

967
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,280
Whoa, I just saw the new

968
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:38,280
uh, image.

969
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,280
Whoa! Are those TIE fighters?

970
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,960
Holy shit, I got an 18.

971
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:46,120
No, they are surveillance drones courtesy of Huge Ass Facts.

972
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:47,320
Oh, they're too scary.

973
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,320
Um, you got an 18?

974
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:51,800
It looks like they're saying "LOL" with their bodies.

975
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:58,600
So, uh, with that 18, I mean, you can see that there's, you know, this is, uh, uh, there was no...

976
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,840
Bloodstains, hear me again, this was like after the fact.

977
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,320
Mm-hmm.

978
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:07,960
Um, uh, you can, you talk to some of the folks who were witnesses there, um, and they talk about the sound of a scream,

979
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:13,860
And there's also a shopkeeper nearby who you haven't talked to yet, but he was there present his name's O'Neill

980
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:19,000
He's a shopkeep in this area. He's the only other person who was there. I'm gonna talk to him. Hey

981
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:28,740
Hi, what do you guys want when you when these people got murdered did you hear metal?

982
00:53:28,740 --> 00:53:32,680
No, I didn't hear any metal didn't matter

983
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:40,240
Like that kind of metal no I didn't hear that kind of middle you

984
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:46,000
Did you which kind of metal did you hear I didn't hear any kind of metal when this happened you're acting a very

985
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,200
Suspicious not acting what caught what type of skin is your body have?

986
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,220
What type of skin is your body have answer the man?

987
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,520
Human skin roll inside

988
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:10,720
I got a 13.

989
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:13,240
He seems like he's lying about the human skin part.

990
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:14,240
He does look human.

991
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,240
Android.

992
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,320
You're lying about the human skin part.

993
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,160
I want to do a magnet over his head.

994
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,840
Okay, you don't have a magnet.

995
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:25,920
I definitely have a magnet.

996
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,680
Roll to see if you have a magnet.

997
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,360
on a fucking spaceship everybody probably has a magnet. I probably have so many devices.

998
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,240
Let's roll d20 and see if you have a magnet. I definitely got a magnet. Eleven. You have

999
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,040
a magnet. Okay I take out my red and grey magnet. This is my fault. It's shaped like

1000
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:45,520
this. I can't complain. I have with me. U shaped magnet. And I go *whistles* horseshoe.

1001
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,760
That's what I was, the word I was looking for. Like this. *whistles* Why are you making that

1002
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:57,000
noise? What noise? You're making that noise. You're making a noise. Is there an android?

1003
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,200
I'm not an animal. I'm gonna investigate his body.

1004
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,000
I wait. Please don't do that.

1005
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:04,400
Wait, this guy just fucking, he shouldn't have given us this clue.

1006
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,000
Cause this is tipping the whole house of cards now.

1007
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm going to stub his toe.

1008
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:13,000
Okay. With my foot.

1009
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I'll roll an attack roll.

1010
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,000
But I don't wanna hurt him.

1011
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
Yeah, I guess it's not an attack roll.

1012
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
Roll a sleight of hand then. Let's do sleight of hand.

1013
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,000
I'll roll sleight of foot.

1014
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,000
Can we have a separate sleight of foot stack on for one?

1015
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,120
You're trying to surreptitiously stub his toe.

1016
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:30,120
Gage's reaction.

1017
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,120
Uh, I got an 11.

1018
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,120
Okay.

1019
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:36,080
You kinda like stumble a little bit.

1020
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:38,320
I actually stubbed my toe.

1021
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,320
But also his.

1022
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,320
And he's like, "Ow!

1023
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,320
Ugh!

1024
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:42,320
Why'd you do that?

1025
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,400
Look, do you wanna buy something or what?"

1026
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,680
Why did you lie about having human skin?

1027
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,880
I have human skin!

1028
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,880
No, we know for a fact you do.

1029
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,880
Wait, wait, wait, no, no.

1030
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,120
He has human skin, but it's what's underneath that counts.

1031
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,960
No, he lied specifically about having human skin.

1032
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,960
Maybe he has human skin in a box.

1033
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,960
Yeah. What's your biggest secret?

1034
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,960
I was going to ask you that.

1035
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,960
I'm not going to tell you guys anything.

1036
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,960
I'm going to use Yoda's mind.

1037
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,960
Yeah, mind reader. I'm coming up with toe-stubbing abilities.

1038
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:13,960
I don't have my paper.

1039
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,960
I got you, though.

1040
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,960
What I have to do is roll a resist.

1041
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,960
Your mind reading is what it is.

1042
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,960
So it's really just me rolling.

1043
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:29,960

1090
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:46,940
While we do with the rest of the campaign and I'm gonna set up this camera in front of it

Maybe dad run that shit back you guys were to recognize baby gad. I remember baby gad. Yeah

1096
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:13,940
From when we were in his gad village or whatever

1097
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:19,080
Did we trying to downplay a lot of those elements, but I liked his care. Yeah, he was good

1098
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:23,160
What did we do with babe we sold Sullivan? What do you do with baby?

1099
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:27,200
Get sleazy now with the Coliseum baby gad baby gad had a fight club

1100
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:34,460
Yeah, yeah, and his dad did not approve and then baby gad exposed his fight club. No no no you helped him out

1101
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,460
And then we didn't like him very much.

1102
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:42,460
He left and he left for bullet town last you heard to go a place that would be more accepting of his sort of

1103
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:48,520
entrepreneurial ways. Okay. And Sullivan had a perfect blue experience at the in Gadsville.

1104
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:51,380
We would like to go up to the roof. In the meantime. We'd like to go up to the roof.

1105
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:53,380
So the roof is in the undercity you said?

1106
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:59,760
Yeah, so it's like basically what he's saying is like the line that makes it clear that you're going from downer district to undercity the

1107
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:04,120
building is on the other side of that. Okay. It's like it's like it's like it's

1108
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:22,000
it's

1109
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,600
I was just about to say that I'm not Scottish so you guys

1110
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:32,160

Don't clop it's it's closed the door is closed. That's the way to get in. What do you want to do?

01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:28,040
We were in jail.

1135
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:29,560
This is definitely, these are the three most evil guys.

1136
01:03:29,560 --> 01:03:33,560
It's funny because the fantasy one we set out to, we specifically made evil characters.

1137
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:35,560
Yeah, and they instantly became kind of sweet.

1138
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:39,320
Yeah, they have like more heart and like, I mean they did have like a, they're plucky.

Yeah, they have like they do or fuck these three are just complete

1140
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:47,140
They're bad actors

01:03:56,340 --> 01:04:00,860
You get to the roof you can see all of the under see you can't see all that you can see a lot of the

1144
01:04:00,860 --> 01:04:02,860
Under city and all it's a grimy splendor

1145
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,780
You can see that it's it has more neon lights

1146
01:04:06,780 --> 01:04:10,560
It looks more like gun City like as you know it except again

1147
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:16,340
It has those like weird black and gray and brown kind of bulbous II buildings that were

01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:23,060
Parts of that old alien ship you see, but you know people are living there enjoying their lives already in yeah partying

01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,220
Yeah but it's actually

1159
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,220
Baby Rexha

1160
01:04:52,220 --> 01:04:54,220
Baby Rexha

1161
01:04:54,220 --> 01:04:56,220
You guys always teach me something new

1162
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:58,220
I don't fucking know. And David Gutta, right?

1163
01:04:58,220 --> 01:05:00,220

1164
01:05:00,220 --> 01:05:02,220
David Guetta

1165
01:05:02,220 --> 01:05:11,500
You guys are on the roof, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing unusual on the roof.

1166
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:20,420
You do see kind of a, like one of those metal, like, you know those little, like a little

1167
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:25,020
bit of metal piping that's kind of sticking out of the roof, kind of like what lets exhaust

1168
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:26,020
out of, of, of, of buildings.

1169
01:05:26,020 --> 01:05:32,100
Yeah, as in, the kind of thing that maybe Tim Allen and Santa Claus might look at and go,

1170
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:35,140
I ain't fitting in that damn thing and then get sucked in too.

1171
01:05:35,140 --> 01:05:36,140
You don't know though.

1172
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:37,140
Oh we don't know.

1173
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:38,140
You don't know.

1174
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,140
Alright, yeah yeah yeah.

1175
01:05:39,140 --> 01:05:40,140

Fuck you man.

1181
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:46,140
I can't even look at you right now.

1182
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,140
I'm so ashamed.

1183
01:05:47,140 --> 01:05:48,140
I'm sorry.

1184
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:53,540
Alright I'm dropping my magnet down that.

1185
01:05:53,540 --> 01:05:54,540
Roll for initiative.

1186
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:55,540
Woah!

1187
01:05:55,540 --> 01:05:57,220
We're about to fight a hole?

1188
01:05:57,220 --> 01:06:01,780
A snake jumps out of the hole.

1189
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:07,180

What the hell? That's some bullshit. I got a damn three.

1200
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,920
Three? Oh no wait, I have a one. Uh oh. So I got a 17.

1201
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:42,000
He took my point.

1202
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:46,640
Sorry, say your initiatives one more time.

1203
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,640
Three.

1204
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:54,480
Ten.

1205
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:57,440
Beautiful. I got a 17. Was it you? Yes.

1206
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,840
Okay, cool. Let's position you correctly.

1207
01:06:59,840 --> 01:07:02,340
You are like right in front of the fucking snake.

1208
01:07:02,340 --> 01:07:05,340
Does my magnet at least hit it?

1209
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:06,540
No, it doesn't hit it.

1210
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:07,340
It kind of like...

1211
01:07:07,340 --> 01:07:10,340
It's a metal snake.

1212
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:11,340
You lost your gun.

1213
01:07:11,340 --> 01:07:13,040
Well, actually...

1214
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:14,840
I actually forgot it.

1215
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,840
Well, because it is...

1216
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,340
It's a metal snake.

1217
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,340
It's not just metal.

1218
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:21,640
It's metal, it has flesh, and it has plastic.

1219
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,340
It's more like a straw than a snake, if you ask me.

1220
01:07:24,740 --> 01:07:28,340
And so it pops up when it hisses and you see its teeth.

1221
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:29,900
Its teeth look like little gears.

1222
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:31,220
Oh, man.

1223
01:07:31,220 --> 01:07:32,940
And where did the magnet go?

1224
01:07:32,940 --> 01:07:38,020
The magnet went like on its like upper neck, like it like like stuck to.

1225
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,180
Oh, I'm sure that's the noise a magnet makes.

1226
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:40,900
Right, guys.

1227
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:43,220
Well, it's like sticking like better than what you did.

1228
01:07:43,220 --> 01:07:45,020
You know, this is what a magnet makes.

1229
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:48,500
No, no.

1230
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:50,020
OK, so you're up.

1231
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:50,860
Yeah, it's on my turn.

1232
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:53,020
All right. I'm going to

1233
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:56,260
probably just hit it as hard as I can.

1234
01:07:56,260 --> 01:08:00,660
OK, you have a few abilities that do that.

1235
01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,300
So you have your hoagie surprise. Do it.

1236
01:08:03,300 --> 01:08:05,840
So you're going to run up to him.

1237
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:09,340
And your attack to that,

1238
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,840
you're going to add your attack to that.

1239
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,840
So I got a I got an eight attack.

1240
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:17,220
Oh, you add you add you just add that number to that number.

1241
01:08:17,220 --> 01:08:20,160
And I heard your stomach was 19.

1242
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:21,160
Yeah, that hits the snake.

1243
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:25,380
So you run up and it's like it winds out. It's like really long

1244
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,380
It's like a lot longer than you thought it would be

1245
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:30,520
feet in feet like 15

1246
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:34,580
Okay, it's like thin it's like you know it's like anaconda. Yeah

1247
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:39,920
And so you go up and you you whack it on the side with the hoagie

1248
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:43,040
Dealing damage how much damage?

1249
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,680
No, it's not you got a

1250
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:48,960
I

1251
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:51,760
Believe that I think I believe the button yeah

1252
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:57,080
Okay

1253
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:05,560
All of the poop colored dice so that I can not use them and stack them one time make a poop tower to make myself hungry

1254
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:07,560
So I fall asleep

01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,320
He said yep, he said yep

01:09:17,480 --> 01:09:20,500
Didn't work in the app. He's taking a selfie

1257
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:24,280
As your hoagie

01:09:24,280 --> 01:09:32,260
Connects connects with the same images don't worry about it as your hoagie connects with the snake doesn't make sense on this app

1259
01:09:32,260 --> 01:09:34,980
Pat yes

1260
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,300
The lights flash

01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:41,100
They go out

1262
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,940
They come back on

1263
01:09:42,940 --> 01:09:45,380
They go out again. No come back on no

01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,380
well I'm looking at my pants you're looking at your pants I look

1272
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:19,380
at my hands because I suspect that I might be the killer.

1273
01:10:19,380 --> 01:10:20,640
- Okay, cool.

1274
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,520
You hear a laugh.

1275
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:27,220
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1276
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:31,920
- No, you hear, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee, hee!

1277
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:33,300
And you hear it again.

1278
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:35,300
But I'm not gonna do it again, it's really loud.

1279
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:36,940
(laughing)

1280
01:10:36,940 --> 01:10:40,680
And just a moment. - O'Neal Jackson.

1281
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:42,980
- Cam, you for just a moment,

1282
01:10:42,980 --> 01:10:44,940
'Cause you're looking over at O'Neal.

1283
01:10:44,940 --> 01:10:47,380
You see a glimmer of something.

1284
01:10:47,380 --> 01:10:48,800
- Oh no.

1285
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,740
- And then you hear a horrible scream,

1286
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,500
but it doesn't sound like a victim.

1287
01:10:53,500 --> 01:10:54,660
Sounds like something else.

1288
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,460
- Doesn't sound like a victim to me.

1289
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:57,820
- Doesn't sound like someone getting stabbed.

1290
01:10:57,820 --> 01:11:00,940
It sounds like somebody, something that's angry.

1291
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:02,700
- Does it sound like they like it?

1292
01:11:02,700 --> 01:11:04,020
I can't tell.

1293
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:05,860
All I know is that's not a victim.

1294
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:09,620
- You see O'Neal holding his neck.

1295
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,460
- Oh, blood.

1296
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:11,740
- Okay, let me guess what it is.

1297
01:11:11,740 --> 01:11:12,780
A lucky charm.

1298
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:14,780
You see a copy of Hungry Hungry Hippo.

1299
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,780
Oh, okay.

1300
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:16,780
Stabbed in his neck.

1301
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:17,780
A copy.

1302
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:18,780
I wrote a copy.

1303
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,940
A copy of the game Hungry Hungry Hippo?

1304
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:23,940
You see, yeah.

1305
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,400
They got it on Xbox.

1306
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:26,400
You see a-

1307
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:27,400
It's the future.

1308
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,100
They got every game on the Xbox in the future.

1309
01:11:29,100 --> 01:11:32,780
You see an Xbox's Hungry Hungry Hippo.

1310
01:11:32,780 --> 01:11:33,780
Okay.

1311
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:34,780
And-

1312
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:36,420
I believe you.

1313
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:37,820
You see him like on the ground.

1314
01:11:37,820 --> 01:11:40,180
You see somebody over going to help him.

1315
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:44,900
But you guys are not gonna be able to look at that right now because you're gonna be in the middle of a fight with a snake.

1316
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:50,020
And next time we'll finish the fight with the snake and see what's going on with O'Neal, maybe.

1317
01:11:50,020 --> 01:11:55,660
I would like to quickly yell, "Do not help him, he is half leprechaun."

1318
01:11:55,660 --> 01:12:00,540
He does not matter. We're gonna ignore him when we come back.

1319
01:12:00,540 --> 01:12:03,360
Look at his back. Look at how cool our fight is.

1320
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:08,140
I'm hitting the snake with a sandwich. I love it.

1321
01:12:08,140 --> 01:12:09,140
OK.

1322
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,140
Who loves it?

1323
01:12:10,140 --> 01:12:11,140
That's it.

1324
01:12:11,140 --> 01:12:12,140
I love it.

1325
01:12:12,140 --> 01:12:13,140
Oh, you love it.

1326
01:12:13,140 --> 01:12:14,140
Me.

1327
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:15,140
Not you.

1328
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,140
Wait, underwear?

1329
01:12:16,140 --> 01:12:17,140
Was it short?

1330
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,140
Alright, and?
