00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,760
Okay, so my name is Pierce, as I said, and this is a focus group. I do focus groups

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,440
semi-regularly. I've been doing focus groups for this group for the past week

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,700
and a half. You guys are number 12. We're going to watch a partial episode of a

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:18,320
semi-popular podcast, and we're just going to give feedback. The podcast is

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,200
called "Podcast About List." It's an unscripted comedy podcast geared towards

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,400
young people or maybe young-minded people, and it's been experiencing mild

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,040
but steady success and the hosts are looking to experience mainstream success

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,000
and expand their reach to other key demographics. So hopefully after we

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,880
watch this clip you guys will help us with ideas to expand it to a broader

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:45,240
market. So as you watch it feel free to take notes on your pen and paper and

11
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,260
after we finish screening I'll ask you guys some questions. So make sure you pay

12
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,720
close attention and think about how it makes you feel. If everyone's ready we can

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:58,080
start. This episode is called the fappening.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:16,080
And welcome back to podcast about list. Yep. Uh huh. Guys,

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,680
how are you doing on this amazingly beautiful morning?

16
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,520
Guys, I'm gonna be honest, what I am a little bit hungover from

17
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,760
Why you party too hard, bro? Yep. I was out skateboarding last night and I hung

18
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:35,120
out with some of my friends after and we went to a bar. No, no way. And you did

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,560
what? They're there. Well, I drank way too much. Oh, God, what'd you drink?

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:47,680
Just beer and shot. You drink beer and shot. Just be a sound for that.

21
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,960
Damn! Beer and shot. Beer and a shot. How many combos would you say that you had?

22
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:02,880
I think it was 10. Oh my god. 10 beers and 10 shots. Luckily your young body could probably

23
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,880
handle that. Yeah. Yeah, thankfully. Beer and then shot. That's how drunk you got.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:16,240
Shot and then beer. You're in the clear. I don't want to alarm you, but I did actually

25
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,860
I'd take a hit of somebody's joint to know you smoked fucking pot. Was it a

26
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,800
blunt or a joint? It was a bowl. Well, you said joint. It was a joint and then

27
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,200
a look how fucking high he is still mother fuck. Yep, that I don't like. I

28
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:39,680
don't like how I feel right now. I'm so fucking sorry man. Yep. Luckily, me and

29
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,320
Cameron are very empathetic to this kind of struggle. Yeah, we've all been

30
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:47,980
It's every day bro. It's every day bro. We've all gone skateboarding and then

31
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:51,860
gone out with our friends. We've snuck them into the bar. They're a little too

32
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,500
young. Yeah, and then we've done beer and shot combos until we get sick and we

33
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,180
have to smoke weed. Yeah, the weed only made me sicker. I did throw up. It helps

34
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,980
with nausea. We does that's what I've read on my. No, it didn't help my forum

35
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:09,220
board. Here's the thing that didn't help me last night. No, I threw up all over

36
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,040
the bar and I'm not allowed back. Do you think anybody is ever faking

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,320
cancer so they can smoke weed? Yeah, you ever seen Breaking Bad?

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,220
Does he smoke weed in that? He completely fakes cancer so that he can

39
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:25,360
deal meth. That's like the whole point of the show and then he does anyway

40
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,320
cancer yeah and then he dies. He never had a tax or a movie. They reveal that

41
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,880
at the end of better call song. I didn't know it was just all fake. He just

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,820
had a really big panic attack and he fell down and died. It's pretty

43
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:41,640
interesting. It's actually a fascinating detail about the movie. Yeah, man movie.

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,240
Yeah, which movie Breaking Bad Breaking Bad. If you watch it in one, so you

45
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,540
never watch the movie. That's probably what I think. I'm still a little too

46
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:53,640
high. Yeah, honestly guys. It's hella jungle drop out today. Yeah. Do you

47
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:57,440
agree? Wait? I would agree if I knew what the fuck jungle drop. Oh, you

48
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,840
haven't heard jungle drop. No, I haven't heard of jungle drop. It's the slang

49
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,540
that's been going around New York in the young community. That's some kind of

50
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:07,900
United Kingdom style of music. No, it basically means when it's hot and humid

51
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,940
out and every cool person's been saying it like damn, it's jungle drop today.

52
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,580
Wow, it's mad jungle dry. I understand the jungle thing because jungles can get

53
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:20,740
mighty hot for monkeys and snails. But what is a drop? What's the drop? The

54
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,180
drop part mean? Okay, well, what drops

55
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:30,100
temperature? That's one thing. What what comes in drops? Wouldn't it rain water

56
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:36,840
or what to lots of things jungle drop that would make sense. If it wasn't it

57
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,460
didn't feel like a jungle anymore,

58
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:42,360
is it now you're thinking of jungle temperature right that would be called

59
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,240
dropping the jungle temperature. Okay, which I'll drop in for the next and

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,840
it's also it's slang slang usually is a reverend and means the opposite of what

61
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,640
you think it means that's true like sick yeah or dope or fried. You know what I

62
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:58,560
like fried stuff. I've been saying fried a lot recently. Yeah, I don't know what

63
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:03,880
it means. I don't know. I think it might a skater sling, but doesn't it mean that

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,740
you smoked weed? I think so. I think it used to mean that and now it just means

65
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:11,700
you're tired. It just means bad or I feel bad. Oh, I'm fried.

66
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,800
No, that's a mom thing to say.

67
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,620
You're right, that's the same type of thing. Other yeah, she's thinking a kind

68
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,820
of a scientific computer. My mom doesn't know anything about the computer. It's

69
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,500
like a like she's like your mom gets home from work and she's like God, I'm so

70

72
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:43,820

73
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,420

77
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:07,680

78
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,080
like brown Smurfs.

79
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:16,280
I've been putting brown Smurfs the entire village in the toilet and the

80
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:22,480
cat too. I have only been taking just just your big wet. It looks like it

81
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,520
it looks like I threw a can of chili into a an oscillating fan. Yeah, oh, it like

82
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,180
hits all the side. I've been I've been terraforming the environment inside my

83
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,600
toilet. Yeah, I like I'm trying to start a Mars colony in there. Really, I've

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,860
been shitting into the toilet and playing Civ five with the shit islands

85
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,680
that I create and making turd people and turd Gandhi turd Gandhi turd. Gandhi

86
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,260
who's more aggressive than you. If my toilet same as gone, if my toilet was in

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,320
the museum, okay, an art agnostic person, they would walk into the art museum,

88
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,800
they would see a Rothko painting. Yeah, we go. Oh, this is crap. My my kid could

89
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,800
do this. Yeah, they would turn. They would see the interior of my toilet and

90
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,520
they would say I've changed my mind about modern art. Yeah, modern art is

91
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,760
a my child. A child couldn't do this. No, I try to do it full, maybe in a

92
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,600
diaper, but not in a toilet. They can't reach that no

93
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:19,080
or maybe in a why did I have you did you guys ever have one of those training

94
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,560
toilets. Yes, maybe for a little last kid. Is that the one where it has no

95
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,640
hole? The plastic? No, no, no, no, it has a hole. It's a it's not just a flat.

96
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:35,420
It's a big flat. You get on your chair and you should no no, no, no, but those

97
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,880
toilets. I babysat a kid that had one of those one time. You still have to clean

98
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,280
you have to it's worse than a diaper. You have to clean the shit. Yeah, yeah,

99
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,520
they should maybe just make that's what I meant by no hole. I meant like

100
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,440
topologically no hole. Oh yeah. You should just make a peripheral that goes over the

101
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:56,120
toilet so that you don't have to clean it up. Reminds me of gaming, one of my favorite

102
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,520
things to do. I've been gaming so much lately. What level are you? I'm over 9000, which only

103
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,720
a gamer might understand that. Pull that shit up. Yo, producer, pull that shit up. Over

104
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:14,000
9000. Yeah, wait, can we see that real quick? I just want a quick reminder of what movie

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,400
maybe that's from over nine thousand for the listeners and watchers who don't

106
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,900
know over nine thousand is a meme yeah from the former era from the era of this

107
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,600
is something at the older end of our demographic might appreciate antiquity

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,480
yeah this. I mean this is old as fuck. If you remember this wait hold on okay,

109
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,920
so there's some guy, so it's muted.

110
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,520
So it's me yelling at a Hooters waitress. It's over nine thousand.

111
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,020
me

112
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:49,220
with me when I'm like the number of girls I dated in my life. Damn me when

113
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,100
somebody asks me

114
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:59,860
how many how many fig newtons I ate and one and one's one sitting.

115
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,260
I even nine thousand fig new over nine thousand fig newtons in one sitting,

116
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:10,080
but the serving size is only to those things make you poo, though fig newtons

117
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,540
All right back to shit yeah, let's think about it. I've been okay. So yesterday

118
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,820
I've been having a really rough shitting week. I'm going to be completely

119
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:22,380
actually truly sometimes I feel sometimes with the how jungle drop it's

120
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,940
been. Sometimes I literally feel like I go in the bathroom and the air grows

121
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:26,300
for

122
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:31,780
I feel like it's. I feel like I'm living inside of an animal's body, some kind of

123
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,220
mushroom fungus. I feel like you know the visuals you get when you're on

124
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:41,020
of the fucking acid in the I mean I do it like it's turning into lines. I feel

125
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,500
like that is happening with the texture and smell of what I'm creating. Oh

126
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,960
speaking of weed, what kind of like drugs like hard drugs have you been

127
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,980
doing? Are you crocodile

128
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:54,860
crocodile? Wow, that's fucking awesome yeah, I've been snoring every pill in

129
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,740
the house. Yeah, I ran out of like real pills to snort, so I started snorting

130
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,780
some vitamin B. Yeah, just the vitamin B be like

131
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,440
yep,

132
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,820
and I've started over nine thousand milligrams of vitamin B. Oh my God,

133
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,660
yeah, and

134
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,740
then I that probably will get you swole.

135
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:20,200
Yeah, I've been recently trying to get swole a F. I've been going to the gym

136
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,160
and been doing

137
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:25,840
I've been first of all I've been recording myself and other people around

138
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,720
me without their permission and their consent yeah, which is kind of a cool

139
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,580
thing that I like to do. Do you have a three sixty camera that you use? I have

140
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:37,280
an insta flicks or whatever it's called. Do you know what the ultimate technique

141
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:41,140
is to film people? What you set up your tripod? I'm going to put you on some

142
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,360
game here. You set up your tripod with your camera and I would say phone, but

143
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,160
no, you need a you to I'm talking. I'm a sorry just you said phone and it made

144
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,820
me think of my phone. Yeah, I miss it angry birds. I wish I could use my phone

145
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:56,500
right now. You set it up in the locker room. You know at the entrance to the

146
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,780
locker room where they put the big mirror. You set it up pointing at the

147
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,320
mirror. So somebody walks in front of the camera, they're getting in your shot

148
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,220
and you can beat them to a pulp. Someone walks someone walks behind the camera.

149
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,980
They're still walking through your shot. You're a mirror catches them. You're

150
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:13,320
fucking dead buddy yeah, because I've been lifting five pounds for twelve

151
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,140
hours yeah and I'm starting to I got a pump man. I'm a crazy pump. I can't

152
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,080
have my arms above my waist because of

153
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,120
I'm going to look at one pound for twenty four hours. Yep, there is a Mr.

154
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:31,800
Beast had this idea. Did I tell you I love Mr. Beast? He's got to be the best

155
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,000
guy in the world. I honestly think we model almost everything we do off of

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,960
this guy. Yep, a hundred percent and also you know my least favorite president is

157
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:47,560
who Ronald Reagan? Yeah, oh my God, no, thank you. I do wish that AOC would be

158
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,280
a new type of president called the lovely president yeah and also she should be

159
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:58,320
probably communist. I wish that I lived in communist China slash North Korea.

160
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,840
Yeah, you okay, hey yo Patti, what do you think about the strike?

161
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:06,720
What strike? Oh, that's good, it's fine, that's okay, don't worry about it, go

162
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,640
back to sleep. Mr beast asked asked his self and just a

163
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,600
and what's called a statement. He said

164
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,160
the best video in the world would be if you get a strong guy in a room or

165
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,040
wherever it can be anywhere and you give him a one pound dumbbell. Every curl he

166
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,160
does you give him a dollar. Wow! How many do you think you do? I heard well

167
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:35,040
me. I probably do five to six before I got bored and I'd want to get on my

168
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,360
phone and look at to probably want to play on my iPad and watch a skibbity

169
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,860
twilight. I like my iPad a lot. Yeah, me too. I can't get enough of my iPad.

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,200
Here's a story about Mr. Beast. Yeah, I like the fitness on it. Not. I like using it to

171
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:57,840
look at pics. I look at pics. I look at my camera roll on there. Oh my God. Looking at

172
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,640
my memories on the Apple Watch going back to my Facebook memories, the good old days,

173
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:08,240
2016. Back when shit was different back then. That was so fucking long ago, man. Now that

174
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,840
that I'm now that I'm turning 21 next week, it's all going to change. What is

175
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:18,400
going to change? I mean, I can finally like I can stop using a fake ID. Yeah,

176
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,640
one. Yeah, I use a fake ID to get into every single bar I've ever been to. I

177
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,120
use a fake ID. I'm getting on a plane on on should I be saying that on a

178
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,640
podcast though? Because then like something I just thought of it's okay.

179
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:34,000
We don't respect the police. We don't give a fuck and something else. I just

180
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:39,660
I thought of what the three stooges are gay dude. I've been saying this. What

181
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:43,740
the fuck is up with my can you imagine watching them try to fuck each other and

182
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,980
missing their dicks out of their asses over and over and over again? Yeah, one

183
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:48,420
second.

184
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,960
This is my impression of that

185
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,360
yeah

186
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,380
yeah,

187
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,580
what's the three? I don't know what the three stooges is. The three stooges is

188
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,900
about three okay. Imagine imagine by the way it's a little offensive honestly as

189
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,980
it's a kind of a younger as a student, as I feel like as a lineal list roots in

190
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:11,580
its word. It honestly does it's like saying the I word it's like calling

191
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:16,940
these people I word or something which is like irrelevant is not for me. You

192
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,060
know it's just a little bit like you know it's a kind of cringe. I guess it

193
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:25,240
doesn't feel good. My dude straight up yeah straight up my dudes. Honestly, if

194
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,260
you and if you don't know the three stooges, let me give you an example.

195
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,500
Just picture the three of us

196
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,700
deep fry it

197
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:37,300
to certify shit, throw it on mean base, yeah, shuffle it up a little, take it

198
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,960
out, make it fucking gay and those are the three guys and add some rule

199
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,340

00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:34,280
Austin Butler's voice more than Elvis honestly and he offensively stole rock

237
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,080

279
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,700
they send my mom on Mother's Day. That's right. That's a bullshit holiday and

white roses. I like green buds and green stems, the green seeds. That's a kind of

282
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,980
flower. I'm into that's a kind of flower. I'm into something where I can spark up

283
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:18,980
and watch some cartoons and some and some remix ready stems. Yeah, so I can

284
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,560
j it up. I love remixes. Oh my God, remixes are better than the original. I

285
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:27,700
love remixes. Every remix is better than the original. Have you heard this

286
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:32,420
speaking of originals, though? Have you heard this song run DMC collab with some

287
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:38,220
bullshit rocker band for some crap song? Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's exactly my

288
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,460
thoughts exactly, but it's something about walk like walk this way and run

289
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,260
DMC. I heard they wrote the whole thing. Oh God, I don't even want to discuss

290
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:53,140
that. Discussed number four think Magnolia, even the name makes it lovely.

291
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,240
I don't even know what that is. All I know about is the production company.

292
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,480
Yeah, honestly, film is one of my greatest interests.

293
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:05,920
I like I actually don't like a I do digital. I feel even though I find

294
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:10,700
myself kind of embracing irony and disgustingness and every aspect of my

295
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,940
life, including interpersonal relationships. Yeah, I can't help but

296
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:18,040
wax poetic about a beautiful film that I've experienced in the cinema. What's

297
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,180
the most recent beautiful film that you've seen?

298
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,560
you know that would probably have to be

and that's the audience. That's funny. That's actually really good. Thanks. I

320
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,580
got a little scared at first when I saw a sweet pea because I miss read it and

321
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:10,460
thought it said SCP as in the as in the pure nightmare fuel. SCP is the

322
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,560
internet is so fucked up. I know it's so fucked up. What are these people doing?

323
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:19,860

324
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,820
extremely online that yeah only I think I get this and a couple of other

325
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,220

00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,980
have to know you have to understand Zelda. You have to know that a guy can

329
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,700
be named Ben. You have to have drowned or known somebody who drowned or see a

330
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,620
picture of someone who drowned or no guys got to be able to read yeah. You

331
00:24:45,660 --> 00:25:05,660
is

332
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:11,100
so bad. It's a lost episode. Yeah, this is a lost episode of SpongeBob. If you ever seen

333
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:18,880
SpongeBob. Oh, we can't. It wasn't even want us to watch it. I understand. Yeah, I actually

334
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,800
really like trillions and stuff. Oh God, it looks like skip to the middle. Looks creepy.

335
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:34,440
I don't want to see this big creepy beginning. Oh, Squidward. He's just not bro. Turn that

336
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:38,600
that shit off bro. Why would you show us that what the fuck was that? What the

337
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,440
fuck go back to the list man? I don't want to think about what how that made

338
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:47,320
me feel, but I would watch some rule thirty four of it yeah squid. Look up

339
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,900
squid word rule thirty four squid. No, we can't do that okay. All right, sorry,

340
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:56,720
what's the next flower Carolina jazz man already on the list? The scent of a

341
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,520
yellow jasmine is amazing. If any scent was a heavenly scent, it would be poop.

342
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:04,200
Oh did I miss read that it would be this flower. That would be a beautiful name

343
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:08,880
for my future daughter poop, my future daughter, which by the way I would let

344
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:13,000
my daughter do only fans. I am literally going to gene edit my children, so I

345
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,840
only have daughters, yes, and make them all do. I want ten to twelve daughters,

346
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,400
yes, and I want them to take care of me when I'm aging and old and I don't want

347
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,040
them to have lives outside of my

348
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:28,320
palace. Yeah, you want to keep all your daughters chained up. No, they would

349
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,680
emotionally. They would want to stay with me, but they wouldn't be physically

350
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,280
god, I would I would be far away from most other things and there's not

351
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:38,740
really a bus or a plane and we don't own a car. So it would be hard for them to

352
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,060
leave, but they I mean honestly the point is I just want them to sponge bath

353
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,460
me yeah and make when you're older like when they're young yeah when I'm old

354
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,560
like thirty seven and I would make my kids do straight up. I would make my

355
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:55,520
kids become professional cup head speed runners yeah, even though the art style

356
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,220
got to start a young influencer, even though the art style is kind of

357
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:02,740
so okay, buddy. I want my to be an influencer. Influencer bubble is about

358
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:07,720
to pop man. Yeah, everybody knows this. Everybody knows this now. My kids are

359
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,460
going to be the influencers like Fred or Smosh.

360
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:16,340
I fucking that's that shit is kind of old, though, straight up mean like

361
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:21,100
Smosh and Fred is kind of old, though, like I'm more into like Kyson that I

362
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:24,100
I have speed, I have speed, I have speed,

363
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Aiden Ross, Aiden Ross, stake.com. This is my kind of shit. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

364
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,620
yeah, yeah, yeah, you know, i carly reunion

365
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:40,380
bro. They get pregnant on that on i carly. They all do they got i carly

366
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:43,380
pregnant. Every girl gets pregnant one day,

367
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:47,860
but they probably do abortions, which are fucking fine. Yeah,

368
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:54,780
you just think about all the procedures, though. I think that if this podcast

369
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,980
doesn't work, which by the way it is working, we have millions of views and

370
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:03,920
well deserved, I'd say yeah, but if it doesn't work, I'll probably try to

371
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,520
become some kind of abortion doctor. Definitely I think I would work for the

372
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,580
city for the city. Well, that's awesome because the library if you're at the

373
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,880
here's what I because I'm addicted to learning speaking of the city. Yeah.

374
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,940
What do you guys say right now we press stop, we head on to the city and we pick

375
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,140
up some girls in Times Square?

376
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,860
Yeah.

377
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,740
Oh, snap.

378
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,940
And fap with them?

379
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,220
Yeah.

380
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,420
Let's go fap.

381
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,060
All right.

382
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,180
Bye y'all.

383
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:27,780
Bye y'all.

384
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,460
Catch you on the flip side.

385
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:28,940
Later.

386
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,020
All right.

387
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,540
Any, any opening thoughts?

388
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,780
Do you want to start us off Aaron?

389
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,220
Do you want to just say what your overall opinion was?

390
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:36,780
Okay.

391
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,180
Yeah.

392
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:45,380
First, the actors had a sense of humor.

393
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:46,740
- Yep.

394
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:49,540
- And it was like a comedic,

395
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,260
comedic or comical.

396
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:55,100
The actor with a green cap.

397
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,860
- This one right here?

398
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,680
- Yes.

399
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,740
Every time he's focused,

400
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,860
the light is,

401
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,840
it's dark.

402
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:03,680
- Yeah.

403
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,180
- Yes.

404
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:07,140
- So maybe lighting is something we wanna work on,

405
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,940
especially in this side of the frame.

406
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,940
But was everyone else lit well?

407
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,940
It was very good, this side too, yeah.

408
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:21,940
And also the middle actor is trying to hide from the microphone.

409
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,940
Pretty low in the frame.

410
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:23,940
Yes.

411
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,940
And then this mic, I noticed that it's kind of covering up his face.

412
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:27,940
Right.

413
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:37,940
Okay, so we can get into specifics, but overall, comedy podcasts, and then maybe we can work on the visual presentation a little bit more.

414
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:41,140
Do you want to, let's, we'll come back to specifics in a little bit.

415
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,220
Do you want to share your opening overall thoughts?

416
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:48,300
Is this real?

417
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,300
This is real?

418
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,740
Like this is a real podcast?

419
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:51,740
This is a real podcast.

420
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,660
Oh that was awful.

421
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,740
You did not appreciate it at all.

422
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:57,740
It's not funny.

423
00:29:57,740 --> 00:30:02,980
I mean, I just didn't, yeah, I can go on.

424
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:05,340
But we should, do you have specific notes about it?

425
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:12,060
I mean, other than the lighting, the background, that was not interesting to look at.

426
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:16,480
They were uninteresting.

427
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:21,060
And then you just didn't find it to be a funny podcast?

428
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,580
This is one of the worst things I've ever seen.

429
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,900
Was it boring or was it?

430
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Boring.

431
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,900
I'm bored out of my mind.

432
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,900
Yeah.

433
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Okay.

434
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,620
And then Phil?

435
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:34,340
I'm very much in agreement with this young man.

436
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:39,620
Now I'm considerably older than most of you guys, so maybe I was trying to wonder, is

437
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:43,460
this relevant or is it, you know?

438
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:48,580
It's horrifying sort of, really.

439
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,460
Vacuous and I wouldn't watch it even paid.

440
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:58,220
I mean, this is, we watched it because we're all being, and that's pushing it.

441
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,220
Jumping to his moments about production value.

442
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:07,900
a lot of problems there and it degrades from whatever the words are. First, that would

443
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:13,460
be the foundation. I mean, you step in the door and you've got to have a pleasant visual

444
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,460
presentation.

445
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:19,740
For you, at least, there's no redemptive qualities about it. Like, if the visuals were better,

446
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,380
it might have been easier to watch or put on.

447
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:28,140
Yeah, and the visuals are a start. Right away, it doesn't... I'm thinking, "Boy, these are

448
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:37,500
bunch of children. And to me, they actually are children, but they're like third graders.

449
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:43,020
And I've actually seen better fifth graders do a better show.

450
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,300
At this level. Something that's come up a lot is people have objected to the amount of

451
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:53,300
headroom because there's so little in the frame. But from what I understand, logistically

452
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:59,420
this is so that we can actually put the internet websites that they're discussing to feature

453
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,860
them more prominently.

454
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,580
Maybe periodically tilt and put it in.

455
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:11,100
So that would require, just so you know, that would require another additional staff member

456
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,760
who would have to be able to pivot that camera.

457
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,580
Because right now these three are the only people on set when they record this.

458
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,580
Do we have any ideas on how to maybe clarify the visual language?

459
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,580
Because it's three presenters,

460
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,580
and then we're supposed to have internet websites being showcased in the back.

461
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
Well, at bare minimum, make it an even cloth.

462
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,580
I mean, it's like folded and messy back there.

463
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
At bare minimum.

464
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,580
Yeah, right. Exactly, exactly.

465
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,580
So let's just take a look here at...

466
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,580
this used to be one of their previous sets.

467
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:52,580
Would you guys say that they have

468
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:56,580
improved or maybe decreased in quality?

469
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:00,580
This is a hundred times better.

470
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,580
My understanding is that this flooded and that they had to

471
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,580
evacuate. So this might be

472
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,580
a work in progress, this new set, but we think that this was maybe a

473
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,420
better creative direction?

474
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,860
- Yes.

475
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,700
- Okay.

476
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,740
- I mean, a hundred percent.

477
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,260
- All right.

478
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,380
- Yeah.

479
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,340
- Now they can open their mouths.

480
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,980
- Mm-hmm.

481
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,500
This mic set up here, we have handheld mics here.

482
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:29,200
And I believe that in the most recent episode,

483
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,220
we have mics on a platform.

484
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,540
What do you guys think about this delivery style here

485
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,580
with handheld mics?

486
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,260
- Make them all black.

487
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,080
- Sorry?

488
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,300
- Make them all black.

489
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,220
- Make who all black?

490
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,720
No, the microphone boo-boos.

491
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,720
Oh, these are distracting, the colors maybe?

492
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,720
Oh my god, hugely.

493
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,220
And I'm looking at these things rather than looking at the guys talking.

494
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,220
So we want less color on the microphone.

495
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,220
Absolutely.

496
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:59,720
I have questions that we can address specifically.

497
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,220
Is there anything that you guys took notes about that you would like to...

498
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Alan, is there anything that you would like to address in your notes?

499
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:15,220
Yes, there were some instances that the chorus, they used to speak together.

500
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,220
- It was cross-talk? - Yes.

501
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,220
And the sound quality, there are some echoes.

502
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
Yeah, what did we think about the sound quality overall?

503
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:27,220
There are some echoes on the sound.

504
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:31,220
I mean, I found it intelligible, I just, it was the content mostly.

505
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:35,220
Technically, you don't have many objections aside from the visual language.

506
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,220
Yeah, as far as sound goes, it was sound-deformed.

507
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:42,220
What age group would you guess that this is targeted towards?

508
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:46,220
Eighth graders or less.

509
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:52,220
So does that become troublesome with the, like, we have discussions about drug use,

510
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:55,220
we have discussions about pornography,

511
00:34:55,220 --> 00:35:02,220
Does that sort of complicate this target demographic of younger people?

512
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,220
Correct. Depends on the young person.

513
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:13,220
Right. So what would you say, should we, I think that they're attempting to cultivate an older audience.

514
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,220
So should we, go ahead.

515
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,220
How old?

516
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,220
I would say probably we're trying to graduate from eighth grade to maybe

517
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,220
late high school, college, maybe even post college.

518
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,220
They missed the boat.

519
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:36,220
Okay, so how do we course correct to get that larger demographic, the older demographic?

520
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:38,220
Is that more pornography, more drug use?

521
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,340
- More content. - More drug use?

522
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:43,340
- No, just the type of comedy,

523
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,900
just very amateur comedy, just.

524
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,560
- So maybe more complex jokes,

525
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,660
are there any comedians that you could point to

526
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,060
that would maybe, they should take inspiration from?

527
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:57,260
- Segura, Tom Shum, people like that,

528
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,940
like that level of comedy should be.

529
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,780
- Right.

530
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:02,500
- Anything like that.

531
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,380
- Yeah, this was so far off of anything that I would work,

532
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,060
I'm having trouble there.

533
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,300
And they also insulted,

534
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,140
and I took it very offensively

535
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,980
when they were at the last section.

536
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,140
He was insulting a number of things.

537
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,140
The three stooges.

538
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,020
Don't get me wrong.

539
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,420
I mean, I can take it,

540
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,780
a punch throw.

541
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,980
- I do remember him saying that they were maybe homosexual.

542
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,620
- Yeah, they were gay, right.

543
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,480
And I was like, wait a minute, what the hell?

544
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,900
No, you missed the boat on them.

545
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,380
I can't even see that in the vaguest,

546
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:41,820
wildest perception of they are gay.

547
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,740
I mean, if gay means homosexual, actual, not--

548
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,580
- Just seems like such a boring joke.

549
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,540
Like, it's such a childish joke.

550
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,740
It's not even funny.

551
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,860
I'm not offended, it's just such a boring joke.

552
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,500
- It's younger, younger crowd.

553
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:55,340
- It's a dumb joke.

554
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,380
- That's like, you know, pooh-pooh jokes.

555
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,780
- Who was your favorite of the three?

556
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,820
Who do you think was the star of the day?

557
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,220
- Oh, God.

558
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,740
- I would go for the middle guy.

559
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,380
- Alan, this is the star of the day for you.

560
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,920
- Yes. (laughs)

561
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,840
I can relate with all this.

562
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,120
The content was so good.

563
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,200
It depends on the viewer, depends on the audience,

564
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,280
but I was able to relate and I was able to laugh.

565
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,440
I know where they're getting at.

566
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,360
It's kind of a random talk about things.

567
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,080
- But you thought that he maybe kept it together the most?

568
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:25,920
- Yes.

569
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,480
- Can we talk about our favorite,

570
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,520
just so that I have something to go back with?

571
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,480
Does anyone?

572
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,400
- Well, who's the guy on the left here?

573
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,320
- This guy? - Yeah.

574
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,160
- This is your favorite?

575
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,160
Is that one of you?

576
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,160
No.

577
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Okay.

578
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,160
I don't know.

579
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,160
Out of the three, yeah.

580
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:41,160
This is the star of the day for me.

581
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:42,160
The biggest dub.

582
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,160
And then, it doesn't matter to you, maybe.

583
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,160
It doesn't matter to me.

584
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,160
I mean, he's the only one that I can see.

585
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,160
This one right here?

586
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,160
No, him.

587
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
This one, you can see him the best.

588
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,160
Yeah, it's the only one you can see plainly.

589
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
And that's a big, again, back to production value.

590
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,160
Okay, I can see him, I can relate to him.

591
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,160
Now, what the hell is he saying?

592
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
First, I've got to get him to say, "I'm not going to do this."

593
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
And then, I've got to get him to say, "I'm not going to do this."

594
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,640
Yeah, it's the only one you can see plainly.

595
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,000
And that's a big, you know, again, back to production value.

596
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,680
Okay, I can see him, I can relate to him.

597
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,800
Now what the hell is he saying?

598
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,980
First I've got to visually accept this image as a pleasant thing to look at.

599
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
And it didn't do it.

600
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,980
Did anyone flop?

601
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Did anyone have the biggest flop?

602
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,980
The guy in the middle.

603
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,980
He flopped.

604
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,980
Yeah, I can't, you know, here, hi, how are you?

605
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
You know, wait a minute, it's me talking.

606
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
Sorry, hi, how are you?

607
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,980
Yeah, it's a big deal.

608
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:18,980
"Hi, how are you?"

609
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,620
You know, "Here, this is me talking.

610
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,260
Sorry, hi, how are you?"

611
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:26,700
Yeah, difficult to see.

612
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,140
What do you think their politics are?

613
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,940
We have discussions about AOC and abortion.

614
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:40,540
Can you take a guess as to what political spectrum we're trying to activate?

615
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
Liberal thinking?

616
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,340
Maybe a liberal crowd?

617
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,060
You both appreciated this guy the most.

618
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,380
What did you think about "jungle drop"?

619
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,260
Do you think that that's an expression that was compelling to you?

620
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:53,420
It was an expression. I never heard it before it made sense

621
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,020
They think that would you

622
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,960
Okay, but would you say that that's marketable was that like a marketable? Oh, I guess

623
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,780
Yeah, something you could sure

624
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,020
Yeah, what a shirt yeah, I guess

625
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:17,100
It's a jungle drop like a drop

626
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:27,840
Yeah, okay big deal, you know, I mean I've heard enough other you know, gee it's really hot

627
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:32,300
It's like, you know Tarzan hot, you know, right and I was like a catchphrase

628
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:37,340
Yeah, yeah, but I'm gonna force it anytime you try to force it. Yeah. Yeah

629
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:39,720
Maybe it's just a final note here

630
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,200
What could they do to appeal to an older crowd?

631
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,520
Or do they have to throw everything out and start fresh?

632
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,160
- Yeah, I think that's the thing.

633
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,520
- Throw it out and start fresh.

634
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,360
- If it's not, if they want to keep their existing audience.

635
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,200
- They have an audience?

636
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,640
- They do have an audience, and my understanding is

637
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,800
that they make a living through user--

638
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,040
- They make money doing this?

639
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,880
Oh, wow.

640
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,840
- The users pay them directly to consume premium content.

641
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,320
So, what is a way that they can keep that user base

642
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:12,120
and then activate an older demographic?

643
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:16,480
What incremental iterative changes can they make

644
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,160
in order to do that?

645
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,320
- Find more dumb people?

646
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,160
I don't know.

647
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,840
- Maybe just like a less educated older crowd?

648
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,920
How do we activate that?

649
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,040
- No, I don't even.

650
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:27,880
- No?

651
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,480
- Yeah, yeah, I think so.

652
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:32,520
- Okay, what would you do to activate that demographic?

653
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:37,280
- I mean, when you say the less educated adult crowd

654
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,880
would listen to this stuff,

655
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,560
how willing would they be to debase themselves?

656
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,400
I mean, at this point, that's what you're talking about.

657
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,800
- What do you mean by that specifically?

658
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,400
- Like, just make clowns of themselves.

659
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,680
They really just wanna just go all out.

660
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,360
- So maybe use the soundboard more,

661
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,800
more funny sounds with the soundboard, like--

662
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,080
- That would've helped.

663
00:40:56,080 --> 00:41:01,240
Vaguely, vaguely that would've helped.

664
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:04,200
I wish some, at the end, when this guy started talking

665
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,280
about abortion and all, where every girl gets pregnant

666
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:11,280
I'm just going, "This guy's a fucking moron."

667
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,280
I found it, you know, like, "Turn this guy off."

668
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:16,280
And it wasn't funny.

669
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:20,280
It's trying to be funny, but maybe insulting.

670
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,280
Oh, yeah.

671
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
It was actually...

672
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Yeah.

673
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Okay, so if it was offensive, should they maybe cut down on the swearing?

674
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Was there too much vulgarity?

675
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,280
The vulgarity of the swearing, that wouldn't matter to me.

676
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,920
It's more about just I don't know about the regulation on the airwave. They're doing dude. Just yeah, cuz they tried doing

677
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:46,460
They tried doing episodes with no swearing and I believe that the feedback was mixed

678
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:50,040
Do you think there's a way that we could figure out like it go more?

679
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,200
So with the switch they think they are at a point now where they don't know if they want to do more vulgarity

680
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,060
I'm going less vulgarity because it's almost sound again

681
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:02,760
Regulated vulgarity

682
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
- Yeah, yeah.

683
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,260
- Okay, and then--

684
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:08,560
- Are they going for the stupidity?

685
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,900
I mean, honest and true, it could have been funny,

686
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,520
sort of, but I was just getting like,

687
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,600
"Boy, you guys are really dumb, dumb shits."

688
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:22,600
- They have done a few episodes that I feel are more brainy.

689
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,560
They've done an episode using Mad Libs,

690
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,400
if you guys are familiar with Mad Libs.

691
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,880
- Yeah, I know Mad Libs, yeah.

692
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,720
- Maybe more of that to activate the more gifted,

693
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,200
of intelligent people who like Mad Libs.

694
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,200
Yeah, I agree.

695
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,760
Yeah, so maybe more games, more like...

696
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,240
Puzzle or you know...

697
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,280
Yeah, puzzle games like Mad Libs or something like that.

698
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,280
Deep thinking?

699
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,880
Yeah, yeah, where there's a little more thinking involved rather than just...

700
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,120
What would their audience be now?

701
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,120
Who's their audience now?

702
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:58,400
That I don't know, but I would say that it skews male and it skews maybe late teens,

703
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,160
early twenties, something like that.

704
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,200
But at least that's for the paying crowd,

705
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,760
the people who consume the free content,

706
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,080
I would say we're talking like 11, 12, 13.

707
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,240
- I don't see women liking this at all.

708
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,240
- They have had some pretty high profile female guests

709
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,840
on the show, one person who's on Saturday Night Live

710
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,400
was a guest on the show.

711
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,240
- Unbelievable.

712
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:25,040
- So this is where I worry that,

713
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,240
wow, I'm way too far out.

714
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,720
- High profile female.

715
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:28,980
Yeah.

716
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,760
OK, I think that's it.

717
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,720
One last thing.

718
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,060
Is there anything we can do about the title of the show,

719
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,280
Podcast About Lists?

720
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,680
Is that engaging enough?

721
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:41,160
Is there anything maybe quicker to the punch of--

722
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,400
is there any quicker punch that we could get there?

723
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,600
Yeah, I mean, I like that name.

724
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:50,000
Go with the name, but be what the name--

725
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,520
be what you've told me a little bit.

726
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,080
More lists, maybe get to the lists.

727
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,480
Yeah, well, that-- yeah, I was waiting for the list.

728
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:57,080
Yeah.

729
00:43:57,080 --> 00:44:00,840
Get that up in the beginning and make that the foundation for all the other goofy crap

730
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,840
that you're talking about.

731
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,840
That's not bad.

732
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
Give them that list.

733
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:04,840
Just do the list from the top.

734
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:05,840
Welcome to the podcast about lists.

735
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,840
Our list today is...

736
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:07,840
Yeah.

737
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,840
Yeah.

738
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:09,840
Maybe if they had something to go on, they'd be better.

739
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,840
Yeah.

740
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:11,840
Yeah.

741
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Let's talk about movies and fapping and all that.

742
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:13,840
Just go straight to the list.

743
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
Any closing thoughts there, Alan?

744
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:15,840
Generally, it was good for me.

745
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:16,840
So it seems like all in all, just pretty good.

746
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:17,840
Yeah.

747
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:18,840
It's good.

748
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:19,840
It's good.

749
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,840
It's good.

750
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
It's good.

751
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:22,840
It's good.

752
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:23,840
It's good.

753
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:24,840
It's good.

754
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
It's good.

755
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:26,840
It's good.

756
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:44,440
As the focus group drew to a close, Cameron, Caleb and Patrick reflected on the crushing

757
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:47,560
feedback they had just received.

758
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:51,600
Just because it hurt, didn't mean it wasn't true.

759
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:53,960
It was time to make a change.

760
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,120
The three regrouped, sat down, and hit record.

761
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,120
- All right, and we are back.

762
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:01,920
- And we're back, guys.

763
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:03,320
- Back to podcast about list.

764
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,360
- If you can't tell, we've made some improvements.

765
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:09,560
We have fixed the lighting.

766
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:10,980
- Yeah.

767
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,080
- I'm not slouching anymore.

768
00:45:12,080 --> 00:45:13,280
I've changed my chair. - You're not slouching.

769
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,120
- Yep.

770
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,400
- Yeah, and--

771
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:17,360
- It's funny that you're sitting,

772
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,440
I mean, not to instantly break the thing here,

773
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,880
but we tried to make you much taller.

774
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,960
You just look the same height as both of us now.

775
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,300
- Yeah, except for Caleb, I guess.

776
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,400
- I guess it must be the camera angle.

777
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,800
- Both of us except for me.

778
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,680
But yeah, I don't know.

779
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:33,240
I feel like we got a good new direction

780
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,280
that we're going in.

781
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,160
- We've been floundering a lot, to be completely honest.

782
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,120
- It's been-- - Much needed feedback.

783
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,160
- Yeah, I mean, you come to a crossroads

784
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,200
and you gotta pick a direction.

785
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,880
And we're going the road less traveled, I'd say.

786
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,120
- Oh yeah. - You know?

787
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,040
- Maybe we could change the name of the show

788
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,340
to road less traveled. I'm down to change the name. Yeah, well, people seem to like

789
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:59,280
the name. That's true to be the one thing that they liked. That is just kind of

790
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:04,160
crazy to me, but I mean, we're not that I would know. I wasn't even there at

791
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
whatever we're talking about.

792
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:11,320
How do you, how are you feeling self esteem wise guys? I'm feeling probably

793
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,600
just about the same as I always do. Yeah, I got a little boost.

794
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,280
You got a boost. Did you start the day you were started? Yeah, we're starting

795
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:23,740
majority voted star of the day yeah. Unfortunately, I guess it seems you got

796
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,580
no votes at all

797
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:30,380
yeah. I would say that that hurt me even more than probably being called a

798
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:36,240
flopper hurt you. I'm used to it yeah. It didn't really nothing. I feel pretty

799
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:40,680
bad. I'll nothing that happened and I'd like to apologize by the way to anybody

800
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:48,020
who was offended by different comments, comments that I made as well. I made I

801
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:51,060
I made one comment that I know was very controversial in the room.

802
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,060
Which one was that?

803
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:55,660
I was able to kind of introspect a little bit after, because I said it, I said this

804
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,660
on reflex.

805
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,680
I was barely wasn't even thinking about it.

806
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,660
I said the three stooges are gay.

807
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,980
Yeah, that I think hit home for many people.

808
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:07,820
It's it and then I kind of was able to think about it and think, well, why am I saying

809
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:08,820
that?

810
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:09,820
It's not true.

811
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,980
Yeah, kind of just a bald-faced lie.

812
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:13,060
I think that true or funny.

813
00:47:13,060 --> 00:47:19,580
instincts to go with the first thing that we do think of are often incorrect.

814
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:24,140
Going blue for the sake of going blue. It reminds me of a quote from one of my

815
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:31,740
favorite comedians, Tom Segura, who says, "I would trade 20 white babies

816
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:37,220
for an Asian baby. If I'm ever rich, I want a closet full of Asian babies and

817
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:41,260
I'll just put them out whenever I'm feeling down."

818
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:45,800
What is it? What is this? All kinds. Sorry, I'm not done. Okay. All kinds. Korean ones,

819
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:51,820
Chinese ones, Vietnamese, not so much. My dad was in the war and I hold a grudge. Now

820
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:56,340
what does that have to do with what just happened? Well, somebody said they liked... Yeah, Tom

821
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:01,020
Segura would be a reference to Sulcrum. They said that we should do more Segura style stuff.

822
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:06,580
I'm thinking of maybe growing out a beard like Tom Segura. Yeah. Yeah. I think that

823
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:13,160
that pretty good yeah. I'm just feeling yeah. This is a I'm a I'm kind of

824
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,800
centered. It was what I needed yeah. I kind of feel similar. I feel like a

825
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,480
reset baptized a little cleanse yeah. I'll the sin. We fix the camera angle

826
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,520
sets looking good yeah and here. Let me make sure you can see my my face. I

827
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,800
don't want to block my face with the Mike like oh true like Patrick so

828
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:33,360
rudely did, but I you know I fixed it. I mean we don't have a close up of me

829
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,480
really do a punch in, but I'm taller than I've ever been.

830
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,880
Yep, we have new looks also, which I think are working for us.

831
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,380
Oh, that's okay.

832
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,380
Mostly working.

833
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,360
Oh wait, did they say they like the handheld or the...

834
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:48,320
I'm just trying to not cover my face.

835
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:50,960
I just can't make it any lower, just put it in my lap a little.

836
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,600
That's the only reason I'm doing this.

837
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,320
Yeah, see this does actually clear up a lot of room.

838
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:01,480
I was also, you know, I guess this is just kind of a debrief even for the changes going

839
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,480
forward.

840
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,320
I was very you have to stop making that rubbing. No, I'm sorry that they

841
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:08,760
would not have liked that yeah. That was that was I don't even like that and I

842
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,240
like everything now.

843
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm actually very excited to announce that, despite overwhelming negativity,

844
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,760
which I understand and I honestly agree with

845
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:25,800
my new catch phrase jungle drop was actually well rather popular. People

846
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:28,800
said they could see it on shirts. They could see it on hats. It could be seen

847
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,320
as a catch phrase for I was I was pretty happy with that. I mean let's talk

848
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,520
got the positives yeah, you know and and and let's start and then let's kind of

849
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:40,660
cater this last half of this episode for that kind of thing. Yeah, one thing is

850
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:46,000
we got a direction with the programming. You know they wanted more lists and more

851
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,800
kind of I think they said more kind of scholarly style. So they said you know

852
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:57,120
what one thing I caught my ear on the focus group leader, who was very he he

853
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:57,860
mentioned that

854
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,260
mad libs as a more intellectual option. I mean that seemed to be met with a

855
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:08,340
resounding agreement. Yeah, so let's do a mad. I mean let's just you know let's

856
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:12,700
jump right into it. I guess a star of the day behavior right there. Yeah, yeah,

857
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:16,160
I mean I just realized that I can't really write in the words on my phone.

858
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,840
That's okay. We'll we'll just go one by one. Yeah, I guess. Okay, we'll just

859
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,760
re all just I'll just say it okay, and then I'll read up to that point sounds

860
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,060
good.

861
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:25,960
Okay,

862
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,120
or you know what I most of these I can probably I think I can probably

863
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,860
remember these okay, all right, let's do that. Then your name, Caleb, I'm not

864
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:43,200
going to lie favorite food, spaghetti and meatballs, okay, verb eating all

865
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,760
right, adjective we need to go a little more intelligent on this, okay,

866
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:49,960
adjective scholar, but not too intelligent for me to be able to not

867
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:53,960
remember scholarly scholarly embarrassing thing you did

868
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:55,920
focus group

869
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:03,320
to trade the listeners by being crass. You know honorable thing you did

870
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,480
change my ways, yep

871
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:08,060
favorite endearment

872
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:13,560
and a sweetie pie, sweet pie, nice negative adjective

873
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:18,880
hurt fiat. My feelings got hurt, okay, three positive adjectives,

874
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:25,480
new camera, new Caleb and new Patrick, okay, adjective is a neutral adjective.

875
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,500
I suppose and let's go scholarly with this one. Yeah, intellectual

876
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:38,880
Lacanian Lacanian okay noun look on Lacan okay verb reading

877
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,340
body part body part mind okay

878
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:50,060
face it Caleb. You are about the greatest thing since spaghetti and

879
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:52,980
meatballs. No one else can eating like you can

880
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:58,460
your best friend says you are the was the edge scholarly scholarly or you are the

881
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,180
scholarly as to person in the world. Sure you once

882
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:08,740
betrayed the fans with your crassness. I did, but you also changed your ways true,

883
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:13,500
so sweetie pie today is the day you're going to stop beating up on yourself for

884
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:13,900
being

885
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:19,940
hurt and start loving yourself for being new camera, new Caleb and new Patrick,

886
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:24,600
and if people give you a lacanian time, just tell them they well. This

887
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,880
actually works really well. It works very well. Listen to this this no.

888
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,840
This is going to blow your mind how well this works.

889
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:33,700
What was the verb again? The last verb was reading reading yeah, and if

890
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:37,060
people give you a lacanian time, just tell them they can take their jacque

891
00:52:37,060 --> 00:52:41,220
l'econ wow and read it up their mind. Wow

892
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:46,600
we even that is incredible. This is guys. This is a moment. The mad lib was

893
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:51,920
trying to put us in the direction of take that I know yeah it up your fucking

894
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:58,780
asshole and put shit in there with your hands and we turned it into a put bring

895
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:02,360
that book, put it in your mind, read that book, read it up your mind, read

896
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,660
that, but you can take that book, read it, read your book yeah see so we're

897
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:11,900
already. I don't know I mean I already feel different. You know the white is

898
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,260
down.

899
00:53:13,620 --> 00:53:17,500
so it might not be plugged in. It's probably not a little lost power. Well,

900
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:20,940
I'll fix that for you guys. Okay, we're just not going to make a big deal out of

901
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:24,360
it and this is by the way. This is the last technical problem we'll ever have

902
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:28,900
on this show. It's likely, hopefully, I mean the best laid plan is plans of

903
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:32,160
mice and men often go askew. Also, what are they what's up?

904
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:39,200
Well, the whites coming back on this very second, but pecking I like having

905
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:44,340
I had in my shot actually like sharing my shot. I used to have my own shot, but I

906
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,380
used to be territorial about my shot and if my okay well it reset the lighting.

907
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:52,520
It looks like that's okay. I guess you know what let's be positive yeah.

908
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,800
There's nothing I mean this is a great show you know and I think it's a good

909
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,120
show people pay for even doing this for years and years at this point. God

910
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:06,320
we're finally at a point where I think we've figured it out yeah. You know I

911
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,360
I think it's fair to say we're going to get a new set because this is shit.

912
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:16,700
Yeah, this is it's going to ideal. You can't teach an old dog new tricks. I'll

913
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,700
say that no, no, no, I think that maybe I think that I'm thinking that maybe our

914
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:21,100
set

915
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:27,420
should be themed around just the wrong things we've done and us us growing past

916
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:31,320
it and figuring out how to deal with the things that we've done. I will maybe

917
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:35,280
take that under consideration that in my mind and read it. Okay, I'll say that so

918
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,160
top ten books

919
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:42,640
top ten books well number ten or starting from well, you got to build up all

920
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:47,360
right. I mean if one is because the dictionary everybody's going to I was

921
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,080
going to go with the source, but we can we can double those are kind of

922
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:54,440
that's like Lebron and Michael Jordan. How do you how do you rank these two?

923
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:58,040
It depends on what era do you grow up in a thesaurus heavy school and in a

924
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:01,640
similar in a similar way to where we're going to tide dictionary and the source

925
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,760
for number two. I mean I'm for number and for number one. I think we can tie

926
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,200
number two. I think we can go Bible, Torah and Quran and the Book of Mormon.

927
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,560
Yes, and bug of a gita, you know, because we are worldly and we've seen all

928
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:19,460
sorts of countries. Oppenheimer quoted it famously. Yes, or he did something

929
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:23,560
quite bad. Yeah, which is not we won't be doing anything like that anymore,

930
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:27,100
and I will not, and if you see the Barbie movie as a man,

931
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:32,400
you're going to have fun and you and if you see the Barbie movie as a man,

932
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:37,320
it might be because you're gay and that's okay, but what do you mean, but that's

933
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,120
okay, you don't even

934
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,520
there's no

935
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,540
corollary yeah that goes completely on speaking a corollary. Let's leave all

936
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:48,440
the body stuff out of this episode. I'm done with my body because I don't talk.

937
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,280
We're not going to do two different breaks to talk about the toilet. We don't

938
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:58,280
need to toilet talks per thirty minutes exactly. No, what are we doing? I am I'm

939
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,720
going to go back and I'm going to listen to some episodes. I really feel like I

940
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,660
I washed in the blood today. I really think that I was disgusting on a level

941
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:10,220
that you know somebody said some I don't remember who it was somebody in

942
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,060
the focus group said

943
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:18,420
are they these are they are clowns and they do they have no shame. Do they not

944
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,940
realize that this is going to ruin their lives and I kind of realize like yeah

945
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:25,220
one day I want to teach at a public university. I want to teach teach

946
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,020
English one or one or one or two. Maybe I want to be a school bus driver that

947
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:34,360
yeah, and if you'd google my name, you're not hiring me to be a work at any kind

948
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:34,820
of a

949
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:39,920
first thing that comes up is me saying that when I poo in the toilet sorry,

950
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,120
yeah, the air gets furry yeah that what does that even mean and I think that's

951
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:48,720
on a level that's intellectually low and it's it's the humor is not even there.

952
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:52,520
I said that when I have been excusing myself

953
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,440
that my excrement is similar to throwing chili in an oscillating fan yeah,

954
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:04,260
that's this is a leave in the past. What is the reason for saying that there is

955
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:07,560
no there's no good reason to say in the light thing that we've said, you know, I

956
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,640
think that I think that maybe we knew this was coming on for a long time. I

957
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,160
think we felt it. We tried to do the swear jar yeah, but we let the the

958
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:18,760
unwashed masses, the hordes of the devil tear it down

959
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:24,800
and I think that maybe I think we need a swear jar. I think the swear jar maybe

960
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,680
was the wrong idea, but I don't think it was the wrong sentiment.

961
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:32,240
Absolutely not, and I think that we don't need a jar to show us how to live.

962
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,000
No, the truth is the only jar I need is a swinging sensor and not to say that

963
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:40,320
there's not reasons to use curse words every once in a while. You know your

964
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,160
toe, you're going to want to scream shite and if you read an amazing

965
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:47,320
passage from Tom Sawyer, you might go blast me. That was good. Fuck yeah, I

966
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:51,160
love this fuck yeah, fuck yeah, Tom Sawyer and Huck. Oh fuck. I love your

967
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:55,000
talking friendship yeah, you know, and the villains in this book are bitches.

968
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:59,540
This book has me on my ass yeah. This is the humor. Oh, that's lord. You could

969
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,360
say I just read infinite just that book knocked me on my ass yeah, and I stuck

970
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:08,100
that in my mind and I cut the fuck up yeah. I was cutting up. I was cutting a

971
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,800
shit

972
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:11,560
or no sorry.

973
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:18,040
You are not it's a process it's okay. You know it's your today is the first

974
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,240
day of the rest of your life.

975
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,840
that's right, that's right and I'm going to start tomorrow is the second day.

976
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:27,380
Yes, and so on and so forth, and I think that

977
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:32,500
since we moved to this office, maybe we've been in a cocoon, yes, right and

978
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,400
people are saying what do you see? What do you say when you see a cocoon? You

979
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:39,320
say I'm going to eat that you say I'm going to eat that rock. Oh, well, I

980
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:40,600
think it's a I think it's

981
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:45,040
snow peas. I like snow peas, snow peas are one of the most delicious things

982
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:49,120
God ever give that is still absolutely, but you see that and you say how they

983
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,440
who's hanging up rocks on trees. Yeah, what kind of more on this for us needs

984
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,300
to hire a new interior decorator? How do you like? I'm sorry. I feel like this

985
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,400
conversation is slipping back into our old ways and why would you eat a cocoon?

986
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:04,820
I just said it looks like a snow pea. He could be confused by it. Maybe some

987
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:08,700
kind of brown pea or bean. That is that is some are green. That is the

988
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:11,500
that is the thought of an imbecile

989
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:17,200
to think that a snow pea in a cocoon. We not do the ad hominem thing. I'm just

990
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,920
I'm saying that if we're trying to change, can we let's try a fallacy

991
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:24,820
clear episode maybe for once right some kind of like if we're going to get

992
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:28,620
into a debate, can it be spirited yet friendly? Yes, you know, I don't think I

993
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:33,060
don't think debating whether a cocoon would be a snap. P is something that

994
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:37,040
we've all made mistakes and in to you most of all you most of all

995
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:42,340
what and what and and I am too, but if if I make a mistake, you need to

996
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:45,940
forgive me for it. If I mistake, I do forgive you a cocoon hanging from a

997
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:50,260
tree branch that looks honestly a little brown and red. If I think that that's a

998
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:54,420
p that's peapod that's been cooked, so long and heard red, it could be could be

999
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:57,760
a more if I think the red light from the oven turns food red, you're going to

1000
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:01,700
condemn me for that, but a more more interesting conversation could be how

1001
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:06,220
your perception of color is way different than mine true. It's like when

1002
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:10,580
I see red on on meat. I think I think raw when you see red, you could think

1003
01:00:10,580 --> 01:00:12,980
that means cooked. If you're right is different than mine, yes, because

1004
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:17,220
everyone's the cones in people's eyes are all there. When you look at a steak,

1005
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:21,100
you could think it turns from brown to red as it gets cooked and by the way you

1006
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:25,500
just said cone and I'd like to applaud us for none of us saying cone. I like a

1007
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,140
big lump with knobs or anything like that any kind of like

1008
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,660
kind of

1009
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:34,760
that's a child. It's a reference. I just very facile. I think that this is oh

1010
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,280
back to my point. Yes, that I was making you see a cocoon. You might think it's a

1011
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:43,220
rock. You might think it's a bean. It doesn't matter what you think right, but

1012
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,140
almost nobody can identify a cocoon just based off how it looks. No first of

1013
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:51,700
nobody, but what I'm saying is you wait a couple of years, maybe four or five

1014
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:56,700
years of doing of the cocoon being there. Wow, that's a big, scary butterfly.

1015
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:59,940
Now that thing's breaking out and becoming one of the most terrifying

1016
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:00,860
predators,

1017
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,740
the

1018
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:09,060
said Hawk. Now here's an intellectual fact that I either learned or made up.

1019
01:01:09,300 --> 01:01:12,960
yes, a cocoon is for a moth yet. A chrysalis is for a butterfly.

1020
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,100
Interesting wow and a chrysalis is

1021
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:21,300
a cocoon is a cocoon gotcha okay, I'm right double checking on that. If you

1022
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,820
think about the difference between

1023
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,820
metapod

1024
01:01:24,820 --> 01:01:31,700
and maybe let's cool it on the video game right. I'm sorry, I don't I do I

1025
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:37,740
let's stick to let's let's classic films, classic films, the opera, the

1026
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:42,520
third man, the third past, thou seen the third man, maybe manuscripts. We could

1027
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:47,060
start maybe delving directed by Carol Clover. Oh goodness, what a treat you

1028
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:52,260
know what we I mean our previous attitudes before our focus group were

1029
01:01:52,260 --> 01:01:52,660
very

1030
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:58,340
very similar to the final line and gone with the wind. Frankly, my dear, I don't

1031
01:01:58,340 --> 01:02:02,300
give a damn. Yes, we with the wind and we were throwing care to the wind. We

1032
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:06,380
were thrown out and something that we I kind of realized listening and talk is

1033
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,220
our audiences is a

1034
01:02:08,220 --> 01:02:13,700
spring chickens. Yes, yeah, you know very spry. These are these are young young

1035
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:18,660
people whose minds we are there. I say poisoning, you know these people are

1036
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:24,340
just they're doing their their PSATs and their SATs and they're writing down

1037
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:27,620
where they're going to put their name instead of their name. They're putting

1038
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,940
right diarrhea or or

1039
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:35,660
I think that I think that to quote nor a little turd Ferguson.

1040
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:39,700
these kids whose minds are being poisoned by content such as this. I mean

1041
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:42,340
obviously we'll make an effort to try and improve the content and make it a

1042
01:02:42,340 --> 01:02:45,900
little less poison, but might I recommend you know for a for you know

1043
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:50,060
someone in our audience range, the eleven to twelve age demographic. These

1044
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,500
are these people, these because there are people, but we say children in

1045
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,180
society. Yeah, we do these children. They maybe they shouldn't be consuming

1046
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:01,100
podcasts and maybe we should be putting them on the path to again to cinema to

1047
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:05,500
film and we should be showing them content such as maybe they would enjoy

1048
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,700
persona, you know, great films such as

1049
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:12,600
oh gosh, Threads is another great film

1050
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,500
that I think says a lot about the world.

1051
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,500
Come and See, Dogville, you know, these are

1052
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:21,500
highly acclaimed films that really encompass

1053
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,700
the breadth of human experience more than

1054
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:27,500
any three stooges, pardon me, at a table

1055
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:29,500
ever could. I think that

1056
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:33,000
more, we should be influencing our audience

1057
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,100
to go on to more websites like Letterboxd

1058
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:41,520
and good reads rather than than twitter threads and I prostrate myself at the

1059
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:46,460
shrine of good reads. Yes, yes, yes, margaret atwood for me it is it is

1060
01:03:46,460 --> 01:03:50,000
definitely letterboxd. I think that that is an amazing website. Any website that

1061
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,340
will verify margaret atwood is a top website in my books. No, no doubt, no

1062
01:03:55,340 --> 01:03:59,420
doubt at all, no no and I think that no no good read complete. You have finished

1063
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,920
your website. You don't have to add anything else. It's it's perfect as is

1064
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:05,940
good reads. Yes, yes, and by the way, there's nothing good coming out anymore.

1065
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:09,780
The last good book, the last good book that was written was my year of rest and

1066
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:13,540
relaxation. Yeah, you know, which was a long, long time ago, which was in two

1067
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:17,120
thousand and seventeen, I believe, and her second book or the one that was

1068
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:21,440
after that. I thought it was crass garbage and oh, that's another thing I

1069
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,780
was thinking so hard. First of all, I mean I do think hard now all the time,

1070
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:29,300
but I was thinking also can I I'm sorry we said no cross. I can I push one thing

1071
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:33,240
talking about. I think that the author of my arrest and relaxation year. I

1072
01:04:33,240 --> 01:04:38,100
think her name is normal now. What is her name? I O Tessa most vague that's a

1073
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:41,260
completely average. I think that's a human name. That's the average name.

1074
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:46,400
Yeah, but anyway, continue you know what I seem to have my point seems to have

1075
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,640
dissipated out of my brain. I'm so sorry, no, no, no, that's no, it's not

1076
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:53,800
your fault, because not your fault. That's the other thing as broadcasters,

1077
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:57,760
which is you know the safe to say that's what we are. You know, let's and by the

1078
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,080
let's stop pretending that we are comedian, comedian, superstar, triple

1079
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:07,080
threats, let's we are broadcasters, we are not clowns, we are no, we are here

1080
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:08,880
to educate the masses, give

1081
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,840
bring hark good news comes, that's that's what people should be saying when

1082
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:20,240
they open up our program. Yeah, you know, so I think that maybe if we to use a

1083
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,740
little mnemonic device, okay, maybe we leave behind the Howard Stern, yes, and

1084
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:30,200
we start creating content that makes people say how are these men so stern

1085
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:35,180
wow when it comes to education and societal infrastructure and that's the

1086
01:05:35,180 --> 01:05:39,160
other thing infrastructure young men don't have a man on this. I'm sorry to

1087
01:05:39,160 --> 01:05:43,180
interrupt. Oh no infrastructure. I mean it essentially refers to if you can

1088
01:05:43,180 --> 01:05:48,920
imagine an ant hill. Yes, that is metaphorically what it appears when

1089
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,200
you're flying in a plane.

1090
01:05:51,700 --> 01:05:55,900
Wow, when you look down at the world, because it is a world, these won't say

1091
01:05:55,900 --> 01:06:00,220
this. Oh, what these are the concepts that excite me now and the earth is as

1092
01:06:00,220 --> 01:06:04,020
round as a man. I'm also now as we talk about this. I'm also just remembering

1093
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:06,980
that some people in the focus group did say that more funny sounds would be

1094
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:07,380
better.

1095
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:13,100
I think I do. I so maybe we keep you keep speak on infrastructure a little

1096
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:16,420
bit. Just go ahead, just go ahead and talk about infrastructure, Patrick,

1097
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:21,140
maybe what what kind of see this is not my area of expertise. Well, I'll go

1098
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:25,120
that yeah, I think you structure I'm here more to learn about infrastructure

1099
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,640
infrastructure can refer to roads,

1100
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:38,740
train tracks, fatality and even the sky for planes. It has to be considered a

1101
01:06:38,740 --> 01:06:43,080
infrastructure. Wow infrastructure programs in America have been historically

1102
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:47,600
under funded the last twenty years or so ever since Bill Clinton, who's a great

1103
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,720
man got into office and

1104
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:53,920
I will say you know I'm not some huge fan of

1105
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:56,920
the imperialist pig Joe Biden,

1106
01:06:56,920 --> 01:07:03,420
but I will say that he has promised to invest in infrastructure again because

1107
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:07,580
there are crumbling roads. People's commute their their tires are breaking

1108
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,320
on potholes and not only that,

1109
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:13,520
but we're putting America back to work by by by funding these infrastructure

1110
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:19,060
programs, you know, because that's a lot of jobs created. So all in all, I think

1111
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:23,260
that there's a bright future for infrastructure in this great nation.

1112
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:29,460
And yeah, another thing I want to another thing I want to do is be a little bit

1113
01:07:29,460 --> 01:07:34,860
more punctual, you know, so I think that's I agree. I think that's about

1114
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:39,460
time to out. You see, I always come here first yeah, and I'm always here and I'm

1115
01:07:39,500 --> 01:07:42,700
He does. I always come here second. Guilty of charge.

1116
01:07:42,700 --> 01:07:46,660
And I'm setting up all the cameras and everything and I'm setting things up and I'm thinking

1117
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:52,660
now to things that are said in the focus group and I'm thinking about my time in film school

1118
01:07:52,660 --> 01:07:57,420
and what did I, what am I? Why are we not flexing these muscles? Why am I not flexing

1119
01:07:57,420 --> 01:08:01,980
this muscle? Let's get a dolly in here. Let's get a dolly. I want a jib. I want gaffers.

1120
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:06,180
I thought you were going to say something else. What did you think he was going to say?

1121
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:10,040
Oh, we don't speak like I know I really got and okay one more thing that I

1122
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,300
would like to address one more thing I'd like to address.

1123
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:17,260
There is nothing please come into frame speaking of film school, please come

1124
01:08:17,260 --> 01:08:20,860
into frame. There is nothing funny about

1125
01:08:20,860 --> 01:08:26,940
I don't even want to say fat. No, there's the fapping is not funny. That's

1126
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:30,540
rule. Thirty four is not rule. What is it never be invoked?

1127
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:35,500
The it's it's some rules are meant to be even thinking about it. Some rules are

1128
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:40,220
meant to be broken, but yes, exactly, I could not have said that, but and so you

1129
01:08:40,220 --> 01:08:44,340
know what let's do a little bit of a I mean we have we have variously massive

1130
01:08:44,340 --> 01:08:49,620
online followings. Let's do a sort of campaign sure to erase. What about the

1131
01:08:49,620 --> 01:08:50,940
anti FAP pledge

1132
01:08:50,940 --> 01:08:54,940
anti FAP, but more more than that? I think more pressing because

1133
01:08:54,940 --> 01:09:00,500
you know well, I would say FAP is going to FAP, but I'm not going to say that.

1134
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:05,600
I'm going to say that rule thirty four let's eradicate this filth from the

1135
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:10,040
internet yeah okay, let's eradicate this and while we're at it, let's take down

1136
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:13,380
the internet archive because a lot of pornography is hosted on there. Thank

1137
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:19,400
you. I don't need to see Valorant, Viper and Jet doing the and I don't even I

1138
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:26,380
don't be all nasty asked to ask to quote the film from the end of Requiem for a

1139
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:30,520
dream. I don't need an off ski. Aaron off ski is a brilliant, brilliant man, but I

1140
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,620
I don't need to see this stuff.

1141
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,700
- Yes. - And I don't--

1142
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,160
- And nobody else needs to either.

1143
01:09:35,160 --> 01:09:38,700
- No, no, least of all the easily influenced youth

1144
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,860
of this world. - Yes, and you should never,

1145
01:09:41,860 --> 01:09:43,580
I mean, I don't even want to entertain the idea

1146
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,140
of Overwatch rule 34.

1147
01:09:47,140 --> 01:09:48,420
- 100%, yeah.

1148
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:51,420
The video, which I think everybody's seen

1149
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:56,420
of the woman dressed as the character from Overwatch,

1150
01:09:57,140 --> 01:10:00,700
and she says, "Nerf this," and then she slaps

1151
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,620
her giant rear end, and I believe that she

1152
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,580
flagellates at the end of the video.

1153
01:10:06,580 --> 01:10:08,380
This video needs to go.

1154
01:10:08,380 --> 01:10:09,860
- Yeah. - This is a disgusting.

1155
01:10:09,860 --> 01:10:11,100
- Might I propose-- - Digital Millennium

1156
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:12,440
Copyright Act strikes.

1157
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,100
- Might I propose an alternative,

1158
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:17,100
because it may be difficult to eradicate.

1159
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:22,720
Perhaps, maybe, we take all this Rule 34 smut

1160
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:25,520
that's featuring all these characters that are,

1161
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:28,600
you know it's like at their video game characters you look at their comic book

1162
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:31,080
characters their t_v_ show characters

1163
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:34,800
and what is the audience for these forms of media it's children it's children and

1164
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:39,760
young east so why don't we take rule thirty four and we and we move it to

1165
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:44,520
apply to characters that are for people who have developed brains and can decide

1166
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:48,480
thank you what they want in life so let's see it let's you know see some

1167
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:52,520
homer let's see some no no see even that's a cartoon pat

1168
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:57,480
let me let me tune. I'm no no no no no no let me let's a okay an adventure. I

1169
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,560
understand now he's actually I'm actually not even sure who you're

1170
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:04,640
referring to when you say, but let me let me let me give you my proposal. I

1171
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:08,800
think that perhaps we should limit rule thirty four to characters like matlock

1172
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,280
yes,

1173
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:15,960
there's like Columbo Columbo, yeah, Jack, the the stars of Jag the stars

1174
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:16,680

1180
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:50,720
