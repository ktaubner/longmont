7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I talked to Cameron on Twitch.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,800
You never hop on.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,800
It's because I'm busy, dude.

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,800
You're not busy.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,760
- You're not busy, every time that we go on Twitch

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:31,360
you're playing like Warzone, or Valorant.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:33,040
- No, he doesn't play Warzone, come on.

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,120
Now you just showed you don't know him at all.

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,960
- Yeah, you don't know me at all, dude.

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,840
I play Valorant and I play Counter-Strike

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,040
with my younger brother, that's the only games I play.

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,400
- No, you play, it used to be Warzone.

19
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,240
- We'll be like, oh, we're gonna go live on Twitch,

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,760
we're gonna play a game, and Kale will be like,

21
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,560
sorry guys, I'm busy, and then his Discord says like,

22
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,720
watching game video one minute.

23
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:54,160
(laughing)

24
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,280
- Well, 'cause I'm busy.

25
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,800
- Busy doesn't mean that I am at work.

26
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,640
Busy just means I'm doing stuff that I'm doing.

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,760
- It just means you don't want to hang out with your friends.

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,720
- Yeah, you want to go and you want to watch

29
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:08,880
that Korean guy play Warzone.

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,720
- Yeah.

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:10,600
- Korean Savage, dude?

32
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,440
- Listen.

33
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,280
- Korean Savage.

34
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,200
- I don't, he's not, you know, he's not my number one anymore.

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,960
- Yeah, Caleb will be like, "I'm busy."

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,680
And then his Discord status says,

37
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,520
"Reading 101 Minecraft jokes dot pdf."

38
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,840
- No, I let, there's a kid that I let

39
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,720

41
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,600
I sometimes let him borrow mine. And you let your brother use your discord. And you said

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,600

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,880
said it with a wimpy face. Do not. I'm not grooming him, I'm giving him advice, friendly

44
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,200
advice on it. Like how the Greeks, the ancient Greeks, they would take a young boy and show

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,560
him how to be a man. If grooming was a bad thing, they wouldn't do it at barbershops,

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:07,160
is all I'm saying. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. Facts. You wouldn't be allowed. If grooming was bad,

47
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,720
you wouldn't be allowed to do it to a dog at a dog hotel. Barber shop, and he's like,

48
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,560
"Yo, that's facts right there. That's facts when I'm at the shop, man, getting chopped

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,880
up when I'm chopping up at the shopping up it's facts there's a there's this like

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:32,880
thing and God there's like this building in goths town that has been like building

51
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:38,720
in Gotham it's called Wayne Tower no there's this build this building in

52
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,640
Goths town New Hampshire that has been like six businesses in the past two

53
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,480
years and now it's a barbershop called Tonic and it's one of those like white guys with

54
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,280
military cuts. Yeah, yeah.

55
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,080
And I'm waiting for that to go under so I can start my artisan mustard shop.

56
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,760
Have you guys seen the HBO show The Shop?

57
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,040
No.

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,840
Where it's like, it's like a bunch of like black athletes and like musicians and like actors

59
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,960
and they're all just like sitting in a barbershop and talk and it's just like a round table discussion

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,840
on like random shit but then one of the episodes for some reason Jon Stewart is there

61
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:25,600
it's like LeBron James like Rick Ross and Jon Stewart

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:32,160
and he's doing he's just doing his uh his half-baked character he's just

63
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,080
His whole discussion is asking them different things have they done on pot

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,940
No, but it is like it's so funny cuz he's just asking he's like so interested he's he's like so what do you mean when you say

65
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,940
steez

66
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:53,220
It's really good dude, yeah, I mean that's yeah

67
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:56,600
I think I think they've done a couple episodes and they always have just like one

68
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,920
Like white dude who's like always a dork. Yeah, it's usually a comedian

69
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,900
Yeah, like we should when the podcast dies

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:11,960
We should all we should open a barber shop called like the grizzled survivor where they only do buzz cuts like that one of those

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:19,160
Kind yeah, yeah beard beard. Yeah, forget where it is in Nashua. Hardy moose. I got

72
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,840
Yeah, yeah the whiskey trout

73
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:35,440
The US warrior haircut. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, there's a there's a barbershop. I went to in high school one time

74
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,940
In Nashua that is owned by veterans and I asked them for a specific haircut

75
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,940
And then the guy like clearly only knew how to do one haircut

76
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Like the one like the military haircut and like he was like look man. I'm just gonna do what I'm gonna do and

77
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,740
artist. Yeah, he's like, "Look, I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do because what you want it

78
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:02,460
doesn't make sense." And I was like, "I've gotten that haircut, like, that's the

79
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:07,820
haircut I get." So I had like some stupid fucking like... It is funny when barbers pretend

80
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,780
they're like artists. Barbers pretend they're like

81
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,980
tattooers. Yeah. And they're like, "Well, you know, we got to meet somewhere in the

82
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,500
middle." White barbers at least. Yeah, and it's like, "No, we're not meeting somewhere

83
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,900
in the middle. I want red socks shaved into the side of my head. Thank you very much."

84
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:29,140
Yeah, yeah, it's very funny that you can you'll go into a barbershop and be like oh I want this haircut and they're just like

85
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,880
I think I'm gonna do a different one on you. Yeah

86
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,780
Matt somebody's clipping your toenails and they were like, yeah, I actually want to do a spike instead of just

87
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:48,520
Like an alligator, yeah, it's like if you had a job like giving elderly people sponge baths in a nursing home

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,920
and you're like, "No, I'm gonna use milk this time instead of water."

89
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,820
Yeah. I'm giving you a milk bath.

90
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,220
I know what's good for you.

91
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,520
Yeah, I know what's gonna look good on you.

92
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,220
You're gonna look good covered in milk.

93
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:58,320
Mm-hmm.

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,420
Yeah.

95
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,720
You will smell so good smelling like that.

96
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,220
You're gonna walk around all day.

97
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,620
It's 90 degrees outside.

98
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,620
You're gonna get out of here. You're gonna go outside.

99
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,820
And you know what? While you're at it, get rid of that fucking walker.

100
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,020
It's ugly. All right?

101
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,020
Oh my God. You look like...

102
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,520
Ugh, you look weird.

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,020
- You look weird.

106
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,580
You're not gonna use this anymore.

107
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,380
- Here, yeah, we're gonna cut your nipples off,

108
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,480
we're gonna leave you with one arm,

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,080
we're gonna put it right in the middle of your chest.

110
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:25,920
How's that sound?

111
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,660
- Yeah, that's what freaking barbers are like now.

112
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,620
- I'm just gonna turn you into Mr. Potato Head.

113
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,460
How's that sound?

114
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,540
How's that sound?

115
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,580
- Hey, grandkids have a new favorite toy.

116
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:34,420
It's you.

117
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,340
- We're gonna keep all your limbs, all your eyes,

118
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,820
your hat, and your mustache,

119
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,220

120
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,340
and your grandkids are gonna play with that.

121
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,220
- Hey, have you ever heard One by Metallica?

122
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,220

123
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,460

00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,840
I'm gonna cast a spell on you.

126
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,080
You're gonna turn into a frog.

127
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,740
You're gonna look great.

00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,580
There's gonna be a princess.

I'm a witch doctor, if I'm being honest.

130
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,240
There's gonna be a princess.

131
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,620
She's gonna give you one kiss,

132
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,380
and then you're gonna transform back,

133
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,820
and that's what we're gonna do today.

134
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,220
I would hate to be a frog.

135
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,060
I would hate it if I was a frog.

136
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,460
You would have to eat flies all day.

the other day the other day i was walking in me and jan were walking into our apartment

144
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,260
And we like, open the front door.

145
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:44,760
Like, as I was opening the front door, she was saying something.

146
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,260
And I just like, pretended to yell at her.

147
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,260
And I was like, "You're fucking gone!"

148
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,260
Like that.

149
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:57,260
And then I opened the door, and one of our neighbors, this lady, is just standing there, like, staring at me.

150
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:00,260
Holding, like, a bag of clothes, like, for her life.

151
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,260
And I was like, "Oh, I'm so sorry."

152
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,260
She's like, "I thought someone was attacking me with a pen."

153
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:11,620
But now it's even worse, because now some lady just thinks I yell at my girlfriend.

154
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,120
Right.

155
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,620
Which I guess I do.

156
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,120
Yeah, you could have just...

157
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,740
I guess I technically do.

158
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,660
You could have just like sat there and just been like, "No, I was actually joking."

159
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:19,660
No, you don't get it.

160
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,160
You don't understand.

161
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,940
I was calling her a con as a joke.

162
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,220
The stairs yelled at her.

163
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,460
It was the edge of the door frame that yelled at her.

164
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
"Ah, this door is so creaky."

165
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,380

I think actually she maybe moved out this week, thank God.

169
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Probably she moved out because of you.

170
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,580
yet she probably did did yeah getting owned

171
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,460
getting so yeah one of the best ways to get on its own your neighbor moves out

172

Let my smoke alarm go.

178
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,180
You're playing the Jersey Shore theme song.

179
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,180
*laughter*

180
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,180
Blasting the Jersey Shore theme song

181
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,180
and just running up the wall

182
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:13,180
trying to do backflips over and over.

183
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,180
You're trying to subliminally

184
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,180
try to get her to move to New Jersey.

185
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,180
Boom! Just running up the wall

186
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,180
and falling over and over again.

187
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,180
What the hell are you doing?

188
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,180
Sundays is jumping practice, thank you very much.

189
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:27,180
*laughter*

190
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,180
Hey! Look, I gotta jump!

191
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:31,340
I'm trying to get my vertical leap crazy good.

192
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,500
I'm trying to be in a white boy dunk competition.

193
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,220
- I got those basketball shoes that have the platform

194
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,420
on the front but then no heel.

195
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,260
- Yeah.

196
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,220
- I'm doing body rounds.

197
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,340
- Those are a thing.

198
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,840
I've seen those at like six different Goodwills.

199
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,940
- Player, I'm gonna be real with you.

200
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,980
I work at a Foot Locker.

201
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,100
You're just making it up.

202
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,620
- You don't work at Foot Locker.

203
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,460
- I do.

204
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,900
- I feel like you in a Foot Locker uniform

205
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,300
would look very scary.

206
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,220
You work at Foot Locker, you're the security guy, they hide inside one of the Foot Lockers

207
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,060
to make sure nobody's stealing anything.

208
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:09,740
Nah dude, I would be, if I worked at Foot Locker, I would just become the guy from the

209
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,180
Chicken Wing talk show.

210
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,180
Yeah.

211
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,140
If I got really into sneakers, I'm just that dude now.

212
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,820
You're Sean Evans.

213
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,380
I'm just talking to Action Bronson.

214
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,500
Just about whatever he's talking about.

215
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,180
I've never seen, watched that show.

216
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,840
I feel like just like this looking at that show that

217
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:35,380
That's like that feels like a rung down from from fucking Joe Rogan like that's like the way

218
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:40,740
That's like lamer Joe Rogan. Yeah, it's a crazy thing to be yeah, I mean, but he'll just like interview

219
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,820
Yeah, like I said, so I understand so I understand your favorite movie is the guardians of Gahool

220
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:53,880
Go straight up that's the best movie ever I love the guardians of Gahool

221
00:10:54,460 --> 00:11:00,140
and then like the thumbnail is like action Bronson's brain fell out while he

222
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:05,500
was eating a chicken and it shows a brain out his ass actually Bronson combed in a

223
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:10,580
poop when he ate it it's so cool how action Bronson was just able to coast on

224
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,660
sounding like ghost face for that long yeah and then just gets mad about it and

225
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,900
if anyone brings it up yeah then him and ghost face did the song together yeah

226
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,900
dude that was huge. What people don't know about Action Bronson is that he's on an Italian ivory.

227
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:30,460
Yeah, that's not got the same cultural impact. Action Bronson actually swallowed

228
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:37,100
Ghostface and he was talking from inside him. That's why his mouth never moves when he raps.

229
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:43,340
He just opens his mouth. He's so hungry, that's why he's always talking about food. Yeah,

230
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,340
Because he's got a feed easy to do.

231
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,340
He's got a feed too, yeah.

232
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
I'm eating for two.

233
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,340
I got Ghostfacekiller locked up in storage.

234
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,340
I'm feeding him porridge.

235
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:57,340
Let's keep going.

236
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,340
I don't know.

237
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,340
I'm Albanian.

238
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,340
Nice.

239
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
Keep going.

240
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,340
I don't have any more.

241
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I'm Albanian. I'm Iranian.

242
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
I'm selling nukes to the Iranians.

243
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:24,660
in

244
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:45,740
is

245
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,420
I like the mullet by the way, it does look good.

246
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,580
- It looks good, it's the ultimate boys haircut.

247
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,140
It's just there's a time in your life

248
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,140
where it just, it will thrust itself upon you.

249
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,540
You have to shave at least one side of your head.

250
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,340
- And if you shave just one, that's a problem.

251
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,580
- I did that in freshman year of college.

252
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,860
- There's no Dr. Cortex.

253
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,700
(laughing)

254
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,220
- There is Adductor Cortex.

255
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,940
- No, Dr. Cortex Insanium, it's not a real thing.

256
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,940
- Yeah, it is.

257
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,780
- Nah.

258
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,620
- He's Dr. Cortex.

259
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:16,100
I looked up Dr. Cortex Insanium, nothing came up.

260
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,780
You probably spelled Insanium wrong.

261
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,780
It looks like there aren't any great matches.

262
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,780
Dr. Neo Cortex.

263
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,420
Oh, that's why he has that big N on his head.

264
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,420
That's not why.

265
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,780
Thank God that's why.

266
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,980
I thought it stood for Ned Flanders.

267
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Yeah, I thought it stood for no.

268
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,700
Because he looks like a Simpson.

269
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
Yeah, no brain.

270
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,700
No brainer.

271
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
No brainer.

272
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,380
This guy's smart as hell.

273
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:45,500
That's what it stands for.

274
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,500
He's friends with Uko.

275
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:52,100
That's why when I'm answering a multiple choice quiz where it says Y or N, I circle N for

276
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
no brainer.

277
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,100
This question was easy.

278
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,580
Yeah, no brainer.

279
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,980
This one's the correct one.

280
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,980
Yeah.

281
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,540
So what have you guys been up to the past couple weeks?

282
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Anything?

283
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,540
Fucking nothing.

284
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:06,220
I got a job.

285
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,900
I haven't had it yet though.

286
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Yeah.

287
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:11,900
works at Applebee's.

288
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:18,180
I am opening an Applebee's franchise out of my mother's house.

289
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,180
That's huge dude.

290
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,180
I'm doing one.

291
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,100
An Applebee's speakeasy in the basement of my mom's house.

292
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,500
An Applebee's speakeasy.

293
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,900
We just buy Applebee's and TGI Friday's frozen appetizers from the store.

294
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:38,460
We take people's orders and then we just immediately Uber Eats that to my house.

295
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
be $50.

296
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,580
That'll be $50 and it'll take an hour and a half.

297
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:47,740
But there's something about the ambiance of this place that just can't be beat.

298
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,380
There's something about the cold temperature that's just different than what you could

299
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,380
get at a normal app.

300
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,300
There's something about it that just feels like a guy's house.

301
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,820
That's honestly like the whole appeal of a COVID speakeasy is that like, oh, I'm like

302
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,660
breaking the rules.

303
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:06,480
There is a place when I was in LA, I didn't go, but when I was in LA, my brother was telling

304
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:13,280
me about a bar that has like pool tables and they're just open all day every day.

305
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:17,760
They just have the lights off. And apparently if the, because the whole

306
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,760
thing in California right now is if a bar is open they charge, they fine the

307
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:28,000
bartender $10,000. Oh my god! What? Yeah and so the whole, that's, that's, it's smart

308
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,120
because it just gets, it makes sure that no bartender is willing to work. But so

309
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:35,560
what, they've gotten busted a couple times but what the bartender has done is

310
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:39,000
is when they see the cops like walking up to the door they just sit on the other

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,040
side of the bar

312
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,480
and they say yeah I don't know what happened the bartender just left

313
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,280
and it's worked

314
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,280
that's so sick dude. That's so funny. It's genius dude

315
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,960
like most, it's crazy cause. That's what you do if you ever get

316
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:58,600
caught like mugging somebody just you just hand them the knife

317
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:02,360
The mugger just ran away! There's the mugger he's right there!

318
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,000
Oh my god, thank god you got here just in time!

319
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah.

320
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

321
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,360
Yeah, dude, most like bars in New Hampshire are like open.

322
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,680
Yeah, but there's no- And they have like wall-to-wall people.

323
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,680
It's like- That's New Hampshire.

324
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:17,000
There's not like an order though to make it not open, right?

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah.

326
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
No.

327
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
No, no.

328
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's live free or die, you know?

329
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,320
You can't- Yeah, and that's exactly what people are gonna

330
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,320
do.

331
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
Yeah, dude.

332
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Yeah.

333
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
Epic.

334
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:32,320
Just getting COVID from just like the shittiest just dive bar in like Lincoln, New Hampshire.

335
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I can't imagine the mindset that would make me want to do that.

336
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Alcoholism?

337
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,320
Yeah.

338
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,320
I feel like that's pretty simple.

339
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
Wanting to have fun, not believing COVID's real.

340
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,320
That's kind of a true, that's the devil's three.

341
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Yeah.

342
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Yeah.

343
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,320
The devil's triad.

344
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,320
The dark triad.

345
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
Yeah.

346
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,320
Whoa.

347
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I'm on day four of not drinking today.

348
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:59,320
But I have to, tonight I'm supposed to go hang out with somebody.

349
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,200
I forgot I made this plan to go hang out with somebody at a bar.

350
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,200
So what do I do?

351
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Sparkling water.

352
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
Sparkling, but then...

353
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,320
Ask for a big jug of milk.

354
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
Get milk like Spongebob.

355
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,040
Vodka tonic called the vodka.

356
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,400
But then they're gonna think I'm like a girl.

357
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,920
They're gonna think you're a freaky pervert.

358
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,440
Can I just have cranberry juice and a man's piss just mixed up in a thing?

359
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
'Cause that's the kind of guy I am.

379
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,980
Were you guys afraid as a kid of having, of being not with your parents?

380
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,780
We've had this conversation like five times on this podcast.

381
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,620
- Yeah, it's always in my head.

382
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,100
- You bring it up every time.

383
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,660
- It's 'cause it's one of my biggest fears,

384
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,700
the idea that we would eat a burrito

385
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,980
and then my mom would be like,

386
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:06,100
"We can't pay for this burrito, you work here now."

387
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:08,340
- Yeah, you're getting adopted by Guillermo.

388
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:09,260
- Yeah. - Yeah.

389
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,080
(laughing)

390
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,380
- He would be a better father.

391
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,620
- Yeah, dude, teach you to make burritos.

392
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,460
- Yeah.

393
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,300
- My father never taught me to make burritos.

394
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,140
- No, you have to learn, that's something you learn

395
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:21,980
on your own.

396
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,820
- I guess my dad taught me how to use--

397
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,580
- Sending my son out to the woods for a week

398
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,040
so he can learn to make burritos and become a man.

399
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,640
- My dad taught me to use partypoker.net

400
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,440
and how to make a gin and tonic.

401
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,280
- Yeah.

402
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,000
- By the time I was nine years old.

403
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,480
And those are two things I'll never forget.

404
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,760
- That's probably, that's why you are the way you are.

405
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,560
- Smart, beautiful, head of hair, genius.

406
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,760
Great at gaming.

407
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,600
- Well, I don't know.

408
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,440
- One of the world's greatest podcasters.

409
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,520
No, it's true.

410
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,360
It's all true.

411
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,360
I don't know about that.

412
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,000
I don't know about that one.

413
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,960
I'm making an emoji face right now, the one with the teeth.

414
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,720
You know the one with the teeth?

415
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
What do you call that face?

416
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,720
A grimace?

417
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,840
He's kind of cold, but not cold enough to have the cold on him.

418
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
This emoji face?

419
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,080
Yeah, I'm making an emoji face.

420
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,440
In the comments below, guess what face we're making.

421
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Guess the face!

422
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,840

Yeah.

424
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,160
Okay, now guess this emoji.

425
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,320
It's the one that has an ant.

426
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,040
I'm doing the black hand emoji right now.

427
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,920
Don't.

428
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,440
Somebody guess how.

429
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,000
Is David Blaine making a comeback?

430
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yeah, he's floating on balloons.

431
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Dude.

432
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,320
It'd be so funny if someone shot him down.

433
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,960
It would be so fucking funny.

434
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,360
Just some kid with a baby gun.

435
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:49,280
Just some kid with that mission in Majora's Mask where you gotta shoot Tingle down.

436
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:54,160
like a 55 year old guy who's sitting in a lawn chair in his front yard and sees him

437
00:20:54,160 --> 00:21:01,400
is like I found a UFO pay me a million dollars to take this one down

438
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,960
hell I found an alien it's just David playing he is shooting a David plane

439
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,160
yeah what people are talking about with the David Blaine trick is that each

440
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:16,280
balloon is filled with the dying breath of a child yeah yeah he did he did do a

441
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:23,000
magic show at Epstein's yeah did he yeah yeah that's for me was like he was only

442
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:32,040
Johnny Cash did a show in prison oh so did Jeff Ross so yeah David Blaine was

443
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:38,800

444
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,880
David Blaine was only on David Blaine was only on on little st. James to in

445
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:57,880
in

446
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,480
like fake freckles and like a big big fake bowl cut wig

447
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,920
pretending to be a kid.

448
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,760
- Yeah.

449
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,600
(laughing)

450
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,420
- He tries to get--

451
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,340
- He's just dressed up like Stuart from Mad TV.

452
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,920
- I'm going to escape from this island.

453
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,760
- Yeah.

454
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,800
- Close your eyes for two hours.

455
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:17,140
- That's Jeffrey Epstein when he snapped his own neck

456
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,520
by kneeling down with a bed sheet.

457
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,360
He was trying to do a David Blaine type trick

458
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,120
where it looked like his neck was made out of rubber,

459
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,040
but he didn't learn the trick correctly.

460
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:24,880
- No, he did not.

461
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,400
- He didn't watch the YouTube tutorial.

462
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,480
Yeah, he just saw David Blaine do it at his island and he was like I'm gonna try this when I go to prison

463
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,960
I'm imagining Giselaine Maxwell going to the...

464
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,280
He went to prison he's like well, I got nothing to do in here might as well pass the time by trying a magic trick

465
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I saw David Blaine do and accidentally killed himself

466
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:47,680
Giselaine Maxwell going to the set of Mad TV and seeing Stuart and then just being like I need him.

467
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:52,800
I think

468
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,200
Do you guys think what the masked magician does is moral?

469
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,600
Who or is it?

470
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:02,340
The masked magician the guy who he wears like a paper bag on his head

471
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,120
And he fucking shows how to do a bunch of magic tricks on spike TV. Oh, that's that's that's mean dude

472
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,580
Mm-hmm. That's like if you went on TV and showed that people how to make a McDonald's burger at home

473
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,760
It's not okay

474
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
You know that they've done that

475
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,240
There's a YouTube channel where the head chef of McDonald's makes a big that's like if there was a YouTube channel where they tried to remake

476
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,560
popular snacks

477
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,600
Where a woman tried to make like cheeses and stuff in her oven and was showing you how to do it

478
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,420
That would be just like making meals from the movie ever did that would deserve to die basically is all I'm saying

479
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,280
Yeah, that's like watching goodfellas and making the pasta. It's like

480
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:46,620
Food in real life, uh-huh it's kind of like it's like if a dialect coach showed you all the different accents of a character

481
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:51,660
in a movie. It's just messed up. The Masked Magician is like a man making the world's

482
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:57,220
sharpest knife out of plastic. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's like watching a satisfying video

483
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,320
where something gets squished. It's like watching Aaron Cairo teach you how to kickflip. That's

484
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,620
a little specific. Yeah, I don't know about that one. That guy, Aaron Cairo, have I, I

485
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:13,100
got the DVD delivered to your house, Cameron, the Scientology one? Yes. Yeah, there's a,

486
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,500
So there's this really popular skateboard YouTube channel.

487
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,540
They were like the first skateboard YouTubers.

488
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:27,460
And the dude who started the channel is heavily involved in Scientology.

489
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:32,320
He's on that DVD giving a testimonial about how Scientology helps him skateboard.

490
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
That's pretty cool.

491
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,620
Dude, I think if I had stayed in LA, I would have become a Scientologist.

492
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
You would have become a Scientologist.

493
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,620
Yeah, why not?

494
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,620
Yeah.

495
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,620
I mean, just yeah, why not?

496
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,620
Who cares?

497
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:45,780
I wanted to it would have been like you can only meet Tom yeah you met you have

498
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,660
to make choices in life at some point to just like kind of have an interesting 20

499
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:55,300
years look if I that would have been a good one if I joined Scientology I would

500
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,260
have I could have given John Travolta a good massage yeah no you it would have

501
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:05,020
been the worst massage of his life yeah I don't think you don't stand you know

502
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:12,700
that he fucks the boys no yeah no no no no I think you're completely missing the

503
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,380
point of the massages he pretends to get massages and then he grabs our hands and

504
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,700

Yeah.

520
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:44,360
I saw Mark Wahlberg on the set of Boogie Nights having sex with a woman.

521
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,360
Hollywood is crazy.

522
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,360
Oh my god.

523
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,520
You will not believe what I saw Mia Khalifa doing on the set of one of her videos.

00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
He was reading a book!

525
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
[Laughter]

526
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,520
You guys see that video of those...

527
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
The soldiers?

528
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,520
The army guys asking...

529
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
Can you imagine being like a guy who lives in like...

530
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,520
In Syria

531
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,520
And like a bunch of guys with guns come up to you

532
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,520
And we just start going like "Have you seen this woman?"

533
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
And you don't know who they're talking about

534
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
They're filming you. Yeah, I'm just walking around saying "Mia Khalifa"

535
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
Like they're the minions, that's all they can say.

536
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,520
[Laughter]

537
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,520
Mia Khalifa

538
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,360
- I'm a big ol' guy.

539
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,200
- Me a Caliva.

540
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,020
- I just be like, what the fuck?

541
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,300
We should do ISIS right now.

542
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,120
These guys suck.

543
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:30,920
- No, it just made me understand why they're upset.

544
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:31,760
- I mean, yeah.

545
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,320

546
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:34,840
all those dang beheadings.

547
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,660
- Pat's in ISIS now.

548
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:41,000
- Look, look, I'm just saying I understand it.

549
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
- Yeah, what do you understand?

550
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,340
- I'm not saying I'm gonna join.

551
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,200
- He's winking.

552
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,040
- I'm not winking.

553
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,480
- Do you guys remember in like 2014 or whatever

554
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,400
when Obama was like, "We're not calling it ISIS anymore,

555
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,080
"we're calling it DASH."

556
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:54,920
- DAISH.

557
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,320
- No, I don't. - 'Cause they don't like that.

558
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,160
- You remember that?

559
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,100
- No. - DAISH?

560
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,600
- I was in college and my English professor,

561
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,640
he was like, "Yeah, basically it's whatever,

562
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,000
"Middle Eastern for piece of shit assholes."

563
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,800
(laughing)

564
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,640
I'm like, "That's not true."

565
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,480
- That's awesome.

566
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,640
- DAISH is--

567
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,480
- Oh, yeah, wait, no, I do--

568
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,760
- It's an acronym.

569
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,080
It's Do Right and Kill Everything.

570
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,080
That would be Dakey.

571
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,080
That'd be Drake.

572
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,080
That's Drake.

573
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,080
Dakey.

574
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,080
Dakey?

575
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,080
Dakey.

576
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Dakey.

577
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,080
I know you had it.

578
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,080
That would be Dakey.

579
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,080
I just switched.

580
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,080
No, no, no, I know what it would be.

581
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,080
It would be Dakey.

582
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,080
That wouldn't be Dash.

583
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
I just switched brains with Pat for like one minute.

584
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,080
I just couldn't understand numbers or acronyms.

585
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,080
What's the acronym?

586
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,080
I don't know.

587
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,080
I'm not sure.

588
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,080
I'm not sure.

589
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,080
I'm not sure.

590
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
I'm not sure.

591
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,080
I'm not sure.

592
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,080
I'm not sure.

593
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,080
I'm not sure.

594
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,080
I'm not sure.

595
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,080
I'm not sure.

596
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
I'm not sure.

597
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Wow, that was horrifying.

598
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,080
Patrick's doing the yes face right now.

599
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,080
Patrick just turned to the side and did the yes face from the pictures online.

600
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,080
Yes.

601
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,080
No, I didn't.

602
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,080
What's the yes face?

603
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,080
The one where it's like, yes.

604
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:09,080
Where one of the guys is saying, "You like Marvel movies? You like Funko Pops?"

605
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,080
And then it shows a funny guy who says yes.

606
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,080
Yes.

607
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,080
Who has to show he's cool because he doesn't even have to explain himself.

608
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,080
I feel like that's like maybe the last one. I haven't seen a new image in a very long time.

609
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:28,080
It just literally is Rage Comics. I mean, we're just looping around.

610
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:37,080
It's Rage Comics and then the new Impact font. Those are just the Coomer ones.

611
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:42,080
The ones that are like, X-year-olds whatever and just have things that they do.

612
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,080
that's literally just like the same as socially awkward penguin.

613
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,840
Yeah like it's exactly the same. Except worse dudes. I mean socially awkward

614
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,080
penguin that's he's goaded. Yeah no everything's

615
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:56,000
awkward. Goaded because he's got his own bloodhound gang song.

616
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,120
That's right. Yeah. Once the bloodhound gang shows respect that's

617
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,040
when you know you're a legend. Same with Joey Fatone. Same album.

618
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,640
Same album. Joey Fatone and the socially awkward penguin. They were going

619
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,240

with the best in the game and know that you can't touch it.

637
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,960
- That's what it's like in New York.

638
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,240
That's where the best ones all migrate to.

639
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,640
It's all the same.

640
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,680

00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,600
- Yeah, if you wanna be the wig of the week,

642

647
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,160

My name is Rap.

683
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
That's what, uh, Mindy Kaling's brother tried to do.

684
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,000
Yeah.

685
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
Oh yeah.

686
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:52,360
Yeah, MendyGale's brother just shaved his head and then he went by like Deshawn or something,

687
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,360

688
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,360
Deshawn.

689
00:33:54,360 --> 00:34:03,600
Let me look up what he went by because he was trying to like expose affirmative action.

690
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,040
Yeah, that's what he said when he got caught.

691
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:11,320
Yeah, I was just trying to expose it.

692
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,600
But there's like a video of Jessica Cruz like complaining about gentrifiers in Brooklyn

693
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,960
and she has the like it's insane that nobody caught on earlier in this because

694
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,480
her accent is insane like it's the craziest fake accent like she's like

696
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:30,120
like any accent like it's she's just doing a crazy voice and then there's one

697
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:33,840
point where she like is making fun of like white gentrifier so just so we can

00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,340
Don't care, nerd.

763
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,340
Okay?

764
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,340
Oh, what's that?

00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,140
I accidentally brought my camera into the woman's bathroom?

766
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,140
Okay, yeah.

767
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,140
Like it matters.

768
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,940
It seems like you're a fucking nerd.

769
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:00,940
Fucking idiot.

770
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,100
Look, the GoPro stays on my head, nerd.

771
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,580
It's for- Yeah.

772
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
This is a- It's for pranking.

773
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,180
- I thought you liked science.

774
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,500
I thought you liked science.

775
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,340
I'm doing a science experiment.

776
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,160
- If I take this GoPro off my head,

777
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,100
I'm gonna fall over, 'cause I'm only use,

778
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,220
I used to be really tall, okay?

779
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,420
So now I need to enhance my height with this

780
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,960
so I keep my balance.

781
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,720
- This GoPro has my brain in it.

782
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,860
This body is an avatar that I control.

783
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,580
- And I need to be in the woman's bathroom.

784
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,980
And I need to be in the woman's locker room

785
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,900
because I like it in here.

786
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,220
Okay? - It smells good.

787
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:32,100
- It smells good and I like the color of the walls.

788
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,540
- It smells good like women's poop.

789
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:35,820
(laughing)

790
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,660
I love the women's bathroom because it just smells so much better.

791
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,420
It smells like a woman's vagina and her piss and her poop too.

792
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,420
It's great.

793
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:48,700
Did you, uh, did you guys believe as a kid that the girls' bathroom at school had a couch

794
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,700
in it?

795
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:50,700
No.

796
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,420
That was a rumor at my school is that the girls' room had a couch in it.

797
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,420
You never looked in the girls' bathroom to see?

798
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,060
Uh, no.

799
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,060
You were brave.

800
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,060
I mean, I would try.

801
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,060
I would try.

802
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,060
Somebody told me there was girls in the girls' bathroom.

803
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,060
Yeah, that was a rumor.

804
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,460
I wouldn't like deliberately try to look, but like if the door was like a little bit open

805
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:14,020
Yeah, if the door is a little bit open I would stick my periscope in but I wouldn't like deliberately do it

806
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,540
I would get one of those mirrors on like a

807
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:20,380
Yeah, I would push my selfie stick underneath the door

808
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:24,860
But if there was straight up if there's a crack in the woman's bathroom door, I'd stick my thingy in it

809
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:29,220
Not gonna lie. It wasn't deliberate. It was just like if it's if it you know

810
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,420
It was accident

811
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:34,120
Excuse me janitor. It was accident. Can I leave?

812
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:39,760
now I have to leave great okay now I have to know the principal is calling me on

813
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,320

814
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:50,280

816
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:58,200

00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,480
girls bathroom to catch any perverts who might be sticking their thingy in between

818
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:05,880
the door so basically I just stick my thingy so there's no room for their

819
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,880

Oh, you're going to the office?

825
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,800
No wonder you're a janitor because you're so stupid.

826
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,800
He was in the girls bathroom and he dropped his blackberry in the toilet.

827
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
No, don't go ask in the main office. They moved the main office to China.

828
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,800
It's...

829
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,800

It's in China.

833
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,800
Just leave me alone in the bathroom, Mr. Janitor.

834
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Oh, okay.

835
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,800
Because janitors are so stupid.

836
00:41:55,800 --> 00:42:00,640
finds a beautiful Chinese wife and he becomes a senator in China. Yeah and then he declares

837
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,920
war on America to try and kill you. In the old country I was but a lowly janitor. Here

838
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,960
I am a most honorable senator. Yeah. Do you guys hang out with the janitors in school?

839
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:17,680
Oh dude I had the coolest janitor. He taught me how to whistle. I hung out with one of

840
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,040
my friends had a summer job at the school so he like knew the janitor pretty well. This

841
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,360
guy Bruce and we used to just hang out with Bruce after lunch. We had like a

842
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:33,280
janitor who is like he loved like hanging out with the kids in the hall and then

843
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,560
and we all like loved him we were like this is the best guy ever and then one

844
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,960
day we found out that it was our classmates dad and they had like tried

845
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:46,080
to keep it because she was like it's a nice story because she I guess thought

846
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:48,940
that it would be embarrassing but then everybody was like you're like the

847
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:49,940
coolest dad in the world.

848
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:50,940
Oh that's nice.

849
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:51,940
Yeah that's nice.

850
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,740
At my elementary school there were, we had, there was Big Bob and there was Little Bob.

851
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,340
And they were both veterans.

852
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:03,500
And Big Bob was nice but Little Bob would startle kids by making the Donald Duck noise.

853
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,700
Yeah, you tell those about that.

854
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,100
Yeah he would do that very loud and scare children.

855
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:11,500
That is a terrifying point.

856
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,560
I talked about my magic janitor before.

857
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:18,900
The guy that he shot someone over a parking lot and used to do magic tricks at lunch.

858
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:25,660
parking spot. I've definitely talked about this. Okay Pat, I've heard so much here.

859
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:29,460
I'm gonna let you tell the story. Please don't mess it up because I really want

860
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:34,220
to know this one. Alright, so he used to do magic tricks for the students at lunch

861
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:39,700
and then one day he shot a guy or pulled a gun on a guy over a parking lot

862
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:46,660
dispute. Okay, so it was the same thing. You said the exact same thing. I wanted a story. You messed, the one thing I

870
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:27,480
from the skate park and then seeing not the magic janitor on Facebook not the

871
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,640
magic janitor in all caps not the magic janitor they're saying that like had

872
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:38,020
other people been arrested for shooting people like all over town they were like

873
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,020
- Oh, and also the magic janitor, shit.

874
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,700
- No, it was just a crushing blow.

875
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,740
- First the mailman and the milkman, now the magic janitor.

876
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:49,180
- We should have guessed it was all jobs that began with M.

877
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:53,060
It was milkman and mailman and magic janitor.

878
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:55,080
Looking to hire a new magic janitor.

879
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:02,100
- Bruce congratulated me for a stupid thing that I did.

880
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:02,940
- What'd you do?

881
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,820
- Once he, Bruce was like, he thought it was really funny

882
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:10,740
'cause I got the, I used to just take the fruit snacks

883
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,700
and I would rub 'em in milk

884
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:13,060
and then throw 'em to the ceiling.

885
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,700
- Yeah. - And it got stuck

886
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,360
on the ceiling for like two weeks.

887
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,620
And then I had to clean the cafeteria for a week.

888
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,460
- Nice. - With Bruce.

889
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:24,480
So it's like, oh, you're just letting me hang out

890
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,220
with my best friend. (laughs)

891
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,220
- Yeah, what a nightmare.

892
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:29,820
- Oh yeah, oh, my punishment is I get to hang out

893
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,940
with my best friend, the janitor.

894
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,340
- Cool, big brother time, yeah, nightmare.

895
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,660
- Yeah, getting to hang out with my cool uncle

896
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:47,940
from home. Sick. My uncle from another grandpa. Yeah. My uncle and the dad's best friend. Oh, so you're just gonna make me

897
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,300
hang out in my really cool neighbor's basement for a week? Yeah. Barely even a

898
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:59,420
punishment at all for me. Epic win. So what did he congratulate you on? Oh, he was

899
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:04,180
just, he was like, "How the fuck did you get it up there?" Doesn't sound like a

900
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,180
Congratulations to me.

901
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:06,180
Are you serious dude?

902
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,380
Pat, are you fucking serious right now?

903
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,940
I don't know.

904
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,620
You just told, you just did the same thing, you just said the same thing twice again.

905
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:19,740
You threw the things up there and he thought it was cool.

906
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:21,740
Oh my god dude.

907
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,460
I can't believe this dude.

908
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:29,860
I'm paying, I'm gonna pay $800 to have you take UCB Storytelling 101.

909
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:30,860
Okay.

910
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,860
Are you okay with this?

911
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,860
That's fine.

912
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,860
That would help.

913
00:46:34,860 --> 00:46:36,860
It would.

914
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,860
We could write it off as a business expense.

915
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:40,860
Pat comes back with a British accent.

916
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,860
Yeah.

917
00:46:42,860 --> 00:46:44,860
It was a long time ago.

918
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:46,860
You know what would happen?

919
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,860
You know what would happen?

920
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,860
I would come back.

921
00:46:50,860 --> 00:46:52,860
You'd get raped. It's the UCB. Of course that's what would happen.

922
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:59,860
I would come back as just one of those guys who's just emulating John Mulaney.

923
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,860
Oh yeah.

924
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,860
Yeah. Which I thought was kind of weird at the time.

925
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:07,860
That's what you would say after every single part of your story.

926
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:09,860
Like a liar.

927
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,860
You know, yeah.

928
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:17,860
Which is a crazy thing to do to a child, to lock them in the basement with the janitor for a week.

929
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,860
John Mulaney, I fucking hate you, dude.

930
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,860
John Mulaney did ruin a generation of men.

931
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:27,860
You fucking metrosexual toothpick. You suck, dude.

932
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,860
He really did.

933
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:54,860
last

934
00:47:54,860 --> 00:48:00,460
fingernails and and saying you're gay but you're not I think yeah those are they're

935
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:08,960
a bit odd these fellows are a bit odd to me no you go to you go to any small town

936
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,980
that has like at least one McDonald's and there's a sexual guy go to a youth who

937
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,740
move it's actually it's actually it's pretty there to get away from something

938
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:20,740
From a smaller

939
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:28,420
It's it's woke to make fun of metrosexuals because they're appropriating gay culture. Mm-hmm. It's actually okay

940
00:48:28,420 --> 00:48:33,580
There we go. There's why it's okay to be really mean to Travis McElroy

941
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:37,960
Stealing anything you want absolutely anything because it's really

942
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:45,440
Because it's in service of the greater good which is you know, keeping culture separated and making sure that

943
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:56,260
Yeah, making making sure that that cultures never interact. Uh-huh. Yeah, that's that's yeah that just doing just doing woke

944
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,660
Yeah, listen, listen, man

945
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:04,420
If if if Bernie Sanders got elected, I guess it wouldn't be Bernie if Kamala Harris gets elected

946
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:08,900
We're gonna have the dome from The Simpsons. We're gonna put all the gay people in there and oh

947
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:16,220
You know, that's that's how culture should be. Yeah, I don't think it's right that when when this is just the white folks

948
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:22,620
I don't like I think it's right when white folks use POC water fountains.

949
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:25,540
That's the wrong, that's not your space.

950
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:26,540
You know what I mean?

951
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:27,540
Stay out of those.

952
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,100
It's fucked up.

953
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,100
Yeah.

954
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,100
They got me fucked up.

955
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:35,340
I'm gonna have some water.

956
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,340
Yeah.

957
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:37,340
I'm gonna have new water.

958
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,500
So when we went on, I've been thinking about this.

959
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,540
We need a, we need a wiki.

960
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:45,900
when we when me and Caleb went on K-Zone last night you don't know what kind of

961
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,540
pain you're about to bring on us. CERB said they had a wiki. We need a wiki.

962
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:53,980
They're gonna say I'm like 10 pounds heavier than I am.

963
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:59,060
Shut up dude. We need it. You're not gonna like what happens. I'm only 215 pounds I learned.

964
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:05,860
I'm not that fat. I'm not even 500 pounds yet. Yeah I'm not the gargantuan

965
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:10,660
monster that the fucking fans have the image of me. Yeah it's very funny that

966
00:50:10,660 --> 00:50:14,340
that all the fans are like, "We'll draw a fan art of Patrick."

967
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,660
And it's like Patrick, it's like a circle.

968
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:18,500
- It's Fat Bastard.

969
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,320
- Yeah, Patrick face, yeah.

970
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:22,820
- Right, and I'm just a little bit overweight.

971
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,740
I just have a beard, I don't, I'm not fat.

972
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:28,000
- Yeah, and I'm like not even bald.

973
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:29,740
- Come on.

974
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:30,580
(laughing)

975
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:32,500
- You know, like I have like tons of hair

976
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,460
and they just keep drawing me with,

977
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,480
just completely bald, it's so weird.

978
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,260
Fans, argh!

979
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:40,920
(growls)

980
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,760
- Yeah, dude, those people are perfect.

981
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,280
- Don't, no, please nobody make a wiki, dude.

982
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,320
- Make a wiki just for Caleb.

983
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,160
- No.

984
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:47,980
- Make a Caleb wiki. - Don't make a Caleb wiki.

985
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:48,820
- Don't make a Caleb wiki, it's not cool.

986
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:51,840
- Please make CalebFandom, Caleb.Fandom.com.

987
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,680
- Please don't do this.

988
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,320
- Please do it. - WetCaleb.Fandom.US.

989
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,560
- Can somebody make a deviantART gallery for Caleb?

990
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,400
- Please don't.

991
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,200
- Nope, nobody ever draw me with a dragon's penis.

992
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,040
- Or near one.

993
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,040
- Nobody make me look like Duke Nukem, okay?

994
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:08,480
I don't want anyone to draw me as Duke Nukem

995
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,240
and Caleb as the Doom guy and Cameron as the Wolfenstein guy.

996
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,080
Don't do that.

997
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:13,920
- If somebody draws me--

998
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,040
- The Wolfenstein guy, you mean Hitler?

999
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,360
- Yes.

1000
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,280
That's exactly who I mean.

1001
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,320
- If somebody draws me fucking a very feminine version

1002
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,360
of the Scout from TF2, I'd be so pissed off, dude.

1003
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,200
- Oh.

1004
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,160
- Oh my God, dude.

1005
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,160
If you guys make me fuck cons off

1006
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:32,320
from the fucking Overwatch. - The Pyro's a woman.

1007
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,760
- The Pyro's a woman?

1008
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,760
- Pyro's a woman.

1009
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,080
- That's not true.

1010
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:36,920
- Well, that's true.

1011
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:37,760
- That's literally not true.

1012
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,840
- I think it was confirmed in one of the animations,

1013
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:41,680
one of the videos.

1014
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:42,520
- Oh, then, yeah.

1015
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,080
- She pulls out her boobs.

1016
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,720
(laughing)

1017
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:46,560
- Yeah, it was confirmed in this--

1018
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:48,840
- Someone says, "Those are hot."

1019
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,840
- It was confirmed in this animation I saw

1020
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:53,880
on this Rule 34, yeah.

1021
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,960
- It is funny that they're--

1022
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:58,280
- Pyro's also a red wolf.

1023
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,080
- They actually confirmed that all the Mortal Kombat

1024
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,160
characters have orgies in an animation that I just saw.

1025
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,140
- They confirmed that everybody in every video game

1026
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:07,560
has a vagina and a dick.

1027
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:11,300
Yeah, it's pretty exciting stuff. Yeah, it's funny how like I

1028
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:19,240
Don't know like I I'd say at least like this is a fake statistic, but like 30% of furries are a red wolf

1029
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:25,360
And then yeah, like every because everybody went out nobody wants to be crazy

1030
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:32,440
He said what animal are you you would have said red wolf coolest color coolest animal? Yeah, I'm half dragon half wolf

1031
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:39,480
The advanced furries are when you get to the to the yeah when they're a little older and they're like I am but a white toad

1032
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,480
Yeah, I'm a snail. Yeah

1033
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,880
White toe. I'm a bit of an odd beaver

1034
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,600
Yeah

1035
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,880

So if you're if you're half dragon half wolf do you just like you still eat gold

1039
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:04,380
What's no you're half dragon half wolf you get your meat

Yeah, that's right

1042
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:20,340
So I get my meat from the dungeon I howl at the moon that's inside of the dragons den

1047
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,960
Bowl. Wow. I'm going to the furry convention and when people ask me what I

1052
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:32,960
man kid don't make me do furry math mm-hmm I don't know how to do it so I

1053
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,200
want to make a furry is probably gonna do so much math to figure out yeah to

1054
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:44,000
calculate the size of the angle of the tail

1055
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,340
- Yeah. - Dangle.

1056
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:48,100
- Yeah, they gotta do-- - Angle of my tail's dangle.

1057
00:54:48,100 --> 00:54:50,400
- They gotta do math to figure out

1058
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,080
the minimum amount of years they can spend in jail

1059
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:55,240
for downloading the photo they're about to download.

1060
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,200
- Yeah, the Vaporeon.

1061
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,320
- Yeah. - So do, do, do,

1062
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,480
furries-- - I knew a furry.

1063
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,520
- Yeah, it was-- - I knew if that's Vaporeon.

1064
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,680
Yeah, there was a guy-- - It was in your mirror.

1065
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:07,840
- There was a guy-- - That's right!

1066
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,300
- There was a guy I knew who was a furry

1067
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:13,240
and once somebody caught him looking at a Vaporeon,

1068
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:20,100
rule 34 once it was a Vaporeon cub too so dude he was they caught him because he

1069
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:25,760
was working he worked as a as a construction worker and he was he was

1070
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,800
looking at it I poked out of this he was looking now he was looking at the

1071
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:36,400
Vaporeon picture on one of those big traffic signs that shows you yeah this

1072
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:41,920
world is sick dude it's messed up that things like this happen this world is

1073
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:47,000
sick can you imagine if there was like if we found out that monkeys were like like

1074
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,400
drawing pictures of bananas that looked like monkeys and then trying to like

1075
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,080
jacking off to them yeah we would we would shut down the zoo buddy yeah we

1076
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:59,080
monkeys drawing elephants fucking each other yeah we just like yeah just

1077
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,520
staring at the elephants across the cross this is jacking off did we would

1078
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:08,960
that is a sick I mean they do they do that we just kind of like I mean monkeys

1079
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:13,400
jack off but I don't think they jack off to the other animals. I think well it's

1080
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:16,680
in their sight they don't know that they're like a chimp when you see a

1081
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,560
chimp jacking off the chimp does not know it's jacking off. It's just got a dead eye.

1082
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:26,480
You're talking about underselling the intelligence of these creatures dude.

1083
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:29,960
They know what they're doing. Yeah but it's they don't need it to look at

1084
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:34,240
anything. They're imagining. Yeah but they're just staring like a thousand

1085
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,080
- Exactly, there's that video of the monkey

1086
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:38,400
jacking off with the frog's mouth.

1087
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,600
- Well no, but that's like a fleshlight, right?

1088
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,480
That's not jacking off to the frog.

1089
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,320
- Yeah, that's true.

1090
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:47,040
- He's not like, oh my God, this frog is loving this right now.

1091
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:47,880
- Well, we don't know.

1092
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,320
- When you jack off, you're not jacking off to your hand,

1093
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
right, you're jacking off with your hand.

1094
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,160
- Yeah.

1095
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:53,980
- Unless it's Caleb, he does it with his feet.

1096
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,840
- You're jacking off with a chip.

1097
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,240
- I pretend it's like Louis Armstrong's hand.

1098
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:02,120
I'm like, oh my God, you are so good at the trumpet.

1099
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:02,960
- Wow.

1100
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:09,520
This grip is insane. I would never want Louis Armstrong to suck me off. I would hate that dude.

1101
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:14,200
His lip is so bruised from playing the trumpet so long. That's right. He'll be going

1102
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,800
"Mwaaah, mwaaah"

1103
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,800
That's the noise he would make.

1104
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,840
My mom says when I was a kid I saw that picture of Louis Armstrong blowing the trumpet and I asked her if he was a

1105
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,840
raisin.

1106
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,880
Well, I mean that is what the California Raisins was

1107
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:36,840
They should have called them the California racists cuz those

1108
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:45,800
Racist mm-hmm go take him down dude. Yeah, I'm taking down the California raisin one of 257

1109
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:48,120
So let's talk have you ever seen your raisins? Yeah

1110
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:56,800
Have you seen have you ever seen dizzy Gillespie play the trumpet? No, I played it. He played it wrong or something

1111
00:57:56,800 --> 00:58:01,040
Oh, yeah, and I've heard later. Yeah later in life it

1112
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:06,200
The way that he used to play the trumpet it caused like his jaw muscles to like expand

1113
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:09,480
So anytime he blew into the trumpet he would look like a frog

1114
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:14,440
Also the horn of his trumpet bent upwards

1115
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:21,960
So it's a guy blowing into a trumpet and he's going like oh my god. Yeah guys fucking face, dude. Yeah

1116
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:28,680
You should see the video of him playing Salt Peanuts in fucking rules. I mean he looks insane

1117
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:36,760
Terrifying dude. I know what he looks like he looks like he looks like in fucking society when the guy's face is in the middle of the ass

1118
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:44,160
Yeah

1119
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:48,480
You rules that video the video of him playing Salt Peanuts

1120
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,940
like he's like pretty old and he's playing salt peanuts so it's just like

1121
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:59,180
him doing that with the trumpet and then going "Salt peanuts! Salt peanuts!"

1122
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:02,540
It's crazy man you can't get really you can't be the best at anything without it

1123
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:06,720
kind of like destroying your body or your mind. Right that's like

1124
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:11,780
John Coltrane with heroin. Yeah exactly. Yeah he was the best at doing heroin.

1125
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,500
He was so good at doing heroin. With every sport it's like it destroys like a different part of your

1126
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:20,820
body like your back or your legs your mind with comedy and music it's just

1127
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:28,100
heroin every single time yeah heroin or whatever killed Mitch Hedberg it was me

1128
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:37,140
oh no I think it was heroin I think he died I think yeah he that makes the most

1129
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:44,500
sense one of the funniest photos is that is that photo of dead Chris Farley I have

1130
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:50,980
seen that yeah I know he looks so bad dude also like who took this photo right

1131
00:59:50,980 --> 00:59:56,780
full of hell has a shirt that's just the picture of of dead Chris Farley and it

1132
00:59:56,780 --> 01:00:00,980
just says full of hell numb your mind and it's a picture that dead Chris Farley's

1133
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:07,260
badass pretty sick what's on his face a blood a blood like a ball it's like a

1134
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:12,820
Chris Farley Chris Farley did like a week or two before he died he did it an

1135
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:18,380
an appearance he did a special guest appearance on all that and he is on so

1136
01:00:18,380 --> 01:00:26,140
much shit it is so crazy to see a man on that many drugs interacting with like

1137
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:31,180
12 year old the Keenan Thompson yeah it's just Keenan Thompson just trying to

1138
01:00:31,180 --> 01:00:37,420
act like a crazy kid and Christopher Lee just going like well I'll tell you this

1139
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:41,820
much this was we missed out on one of the greatest episodes of WTF that would

1140
01:00:41,820 --> 01:00:47,260
have ever been. Oh yeah. Yeah that's the real tragedy here. Yep. You know if I ever get

1141
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:51,020
access to a time machine I'm sending Mark Maron back in time to interview every

1142
01:00:51,020 --> 01:01:05,220
historical figure. That's right. So who are your guys? Who are... Plato? Oh Mark Maron.

1143
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:11,300
We love you. One of the best like thing like dad things to say is

1144
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:14,820
like you know if Chris Farley was still like watching grown-ups it's like oh you

1145
01:01:14,820 --> 01:01:20,380
know if Chris Farley was still alive Kevin James wouldn't even be here and

1146
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:26,620
that's what we missed out on. Cut to Chris Farley in the 90s just saying like POO!

1147
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:32,100
And our dads just at home like oh my god that's the funniest shit I've ever seen.

1148
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:39,820
Yes! Yes! Yeah man. He let he let he made it so fit he broke the glass ceiling for

1149
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:44,620
fat guys. He did. He really did. People said okay they can they can eat food and

1150
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:49,740
roll around but but can they yell? Can fat guys yell and be from the Midwest?

1151
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:58,220
He dared to answer that question. Can fat guys be from the Midwest? Can a fat guy be

1152
01:01:58,220 --> 01:02:04,220
from Milwaukee? Let's find out. That's right. That's right. That's a science

1153
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:12,820
experiment. That'd be a good science experiment. It's like an anthropological study. We wanted

1154
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:18,900
to find out. It's a science fair. Yeah, it's an 8 year old kid at a science fair with that.

1155
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,220
Can a fact, can a fact I be from the Midwest? Well, let's take a look at the numbers here.

1156
01:02:22,220 --> 01:02:28,420
I've grown a man named Chris Farley in a test tube to test this hypothesis. He has, he has

1157
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:32,300
equally. Turns out the soil is very rich. Yeah. He has equally fat brothers. Turns out

1158
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,420
can live for a while but then he dies and they take a funny picture of him.

1159
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,060
Have you ever seen his brother Kevin Farley?

1160
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:43,500
Just does like what he does.

1161
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:50,060
It's so funny when there's a very famous comedian and then his brother is just a worse version.

1162
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:51,060
Yeah, like Jim Belushi.

1163
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:53,380
I mean, it's the best, dude.

1164
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:58,740
Jim Belushi, well the Wayans brothers are all equal, in my opinion.

1165
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:00,700
I think they're all equally funny.

1166
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:04,540
I would say Damon Wayans is the best one.

1167
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,500
Yeah, Damon Wayans, obviously.

1168
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:08,700
Well, no, Keenan Ivory is the best one.

1169
01:03:08,700 --> 01:03:10,860
Because Keenan Ivory was the one...

1170
01:03:10,860 --> 01:03:12,300
Keenan Ivory is the...

1171
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:13,300
You put the...

1172
01:03:13,300 --> 01:03:14,300
You got the foot in the door.

1173
01:03:14,300 --> 01:03:17,580
I'm gonna put your foot in my door.

1174
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:20,220
I'll put your foot in my mouth, bitch.

1175
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:21,220
Let's go.

1176
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,220

01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:23,220

01:03:24,220 --> 01:03:25,220

1180
01:03:25,220 --> 01:03:26,220
Like Randy Quaid and...

1181
01:03:26,220 --> 01:03:27,220
