00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,120
Let me see your butt.

(laughing)

8
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,800
(explosion)

9
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,480
- So we're deciding on what kind of episode

10
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,320
we want to do today.

11
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,760
- We've decided on one thing.

12
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:16,600
- We're gonna narrow it down.

13
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,420
- I'm gonna narrow it down

14
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:18,260
because I got something in my teeth.

15
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,040
- What was it that you said?

16
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,880
- Dental.

17
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,520
- Dental, okay, that's a veto from me.

18
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,280
I'm using my one veto immediately.

19
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,280
- Really, you're doing your bit,

20
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:28,000
you're doing your America's Got Talent X.

21
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,840
- Yeah.

22
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,880
- Or X Factor X.

23
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,200
I know not a dental on the X Factor do you use the X to get the person off the show

24
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,760
yeah and then you use the factor to get them on but wait don't they have an axe

25
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,200
on America's Got Talent? They have a golden buzzer. But what is the X where's the wait which show has

26
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:49,360
the X's where you X people X men that's America's Got Talent right or is that

27
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,440
the X Factor? The X Factor it's good if you get an X. But there's X's on

28
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,200
America's Got Talent too where if you get three X's that you stop the performance.

29
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,000
That's why it's important to know which show you're on when you're performing.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Have you seen that one?

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Have you seen that one?

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I've seen that one actually.

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's pretty good.

34
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh my God.

35
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,360
Have you seen that America's Got Talent clip where it's like a grandma goes up and she's

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,040
trying to do stand up and she goes like, "How's everybody doing?

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,040
Are you all right?"

38
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,560
And she says, everyone's like, "Yeah."

39
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,200
And then she goes, "No, you are all left."

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,840
And they all buzz so quick.

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,400
it's like the fastest anyone's ever been buzzed on the show that's awesome so I

42
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,440
want I feel like we're getting distracted though because I had two pitches all

43
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,600
right what are you my first pitch is a duck face Christmas well we said that we

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,840
wanted to do a Christmas okay we said we might want to make it kind of musical

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,800
okay a duck face Christmas yeah pitch for a Christmas yeah and then my other

46
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,360
pitch that I just came up with is a fascinating slash peculiar Christmas

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,880
which is kind of like a curious curiosity mixed with Christmas peculiar yeah yeah

48
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:05,520
the most peculiar day of the year we can call it peculiarity is is the same thing

49
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,080
as as some fascinating i mean if you if you have enough curiosity it is no i

50
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,240
think like an extra eye on an animal is peculiar but it's not you would not be

51
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,240
fascinated by an extra i can also be fascinated by how a clock might work

52
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,480
that's and yeah but that's that's not very peculiar it's a rectangle and

53
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,120
square type thing there's shapes of it's the shape of the clock and there's

54
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,400
something peculiar yeah how Santa's sleigh yes and exactly how does it fly

55
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,280
reindeer right I remembered and that's peculiar it is kind of peculiar

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,640
peculiar Christmas I guess who I guess the entire holiday is a bit or why did

57
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:47,240
he decide on why wouldn't he decide on something with wings to fly him away why

58
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:54,240
Why not like a duck? Yeah, maybe like a maybe Santa could make a face similar to a duck.

59
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,900
A dove or a swan. Or a partridge. I feel like it should have been partridges. Yeah. Or flying

60
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,040
reindeer you completely lose me. Yeah, exactly. Like, listen, all right, there's a fat guy.

61
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,400
He's up in the mountains of the north. Yeah, he's already that's already sounding a little

62
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,200
bit anomalous and atypical. Yeah, and he's got some shorties. He's got mad shorties and

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,200
and one and they're all making different kinds of Xbox games and that's all

64
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:23,800
that's all good and gravy with me, but it's also kind of incongruous and

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,500
dubious. I think it's a bit in in Congress, but until you get to the

66
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,800
reindeer part, I'm pretty much believing it. Well, the reindeer part is

67
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,300
totally eccentric and back ass words. Yeah, then that's basically what I was

68
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,900
thinking and that's where it felt the whole story falls apart for me there.

69
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:44,500
You know if they said yeah, Santa does Santa does all that shit, but he's got

70
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,020
flying reindeer sounds to me a little freaky or kinky yeah that's almost like

71
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,540
I think that's kinky it says I mean I'm just I'm looking at synonyms for

72
00:03:53,540 --> 00:04:00,420
peculiar okay kinky kinky kinky is a wacko for peculiar dilly I guess I guess

73
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:09,820
my I guess getting fucked in the ass is a little bit peculiar or remarkable how

74
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,800
How remarkable how remarkable is it that

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,660
chained up and fucked in the

76
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:21,180
be a bit it's a bit airity off center yeah,

77
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:28,100
but I wouldn't call you're going to be walking a bit off center. I yeah, but I

78
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:32,020
would not call it. I mean I'm just reading the list of synonyms here, but

79
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,700
these are synonyms. I would not choose deviant. I might not say that I might

80
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:44,020
use that one or it says yeah queer well well no depends on who's doing it I was

81
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,960
think it would be better it would be funnier if the instead of queer they

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:53,420
said were peculiar yeah that'd be a little bit of a better word I think yeah

83
00:04:53,420 --> 00:05:04,140
yeah and they could talk about different shows but they're making that show

84
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,940
so peculiar yet the white lemony snicket is one of the most peculiar shows

85
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,940
peculiar has been the funniest word to me. It's a funny word yeah the past few

86
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:17,940
days yeah how peculiar the peculiar community is really good to that's that

87
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:23,640
that would be a great a great name for like a children's book that's for kids

88
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,340
who like Tim Burton. You know what's so so and so in the peculiar community. I'm

89
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:31,140
gonna add that to the list of really good things to like just things to say

90
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,980
when your card declines.

91
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,240
Is just be like, "That's peculiar."

92
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,500
(laughing)

93
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,980
- Buyin' one pack of cigarettes.

94
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,020
- Your card has declined.

95
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,340
That's actually peculiar.

96
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,180
- Yeah, huh. - Fascinating.

97
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,580
- We'll have to look into this.

98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,820
- Yeah.

99
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:48,860
You ever do the thing where you say,

100
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,540
"I'm gonna come back later and pay for that?"

101
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,060
- Yeah, you don't do it.

102
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,500
- I mean, I haven't not done it yet,

103
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,260
but every time I think about it,

104
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,860
I'm like, "Maybe this is the time."

105
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,180
- I've never actually done that.

106
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,380
I've always just like figured out a way.

107
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,420
I've always, you know, if they have an ATM or something.

108
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,580
- Figured out a way?

109
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,420
- I think that they-- - You figured out a way, yeah.

110
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,260
- I've always figured out a way--

111
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,100
- That sounds peculiar.

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,500
- I've figured out a way to pay them no matter what.

113
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,320
- That's what you're saying?

114
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,580
- Sounds like he's doing some peculiar stuff.

115
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,980
- I'm popping this thing, I'm done with it.

116
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,260
- Do not pop that thing in your mouth.

117
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,100
- What are you doing?

118
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,220
- Don't, stop. - Oh my God, you're gonna

119
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,420
give me a weird thing on my neck if you do that.

120
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,780
- I need to get it, like, I need to go to the doctor.

121
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,460
- A weird thing, a weird feeling on my neck?

122
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,620
affecting how I say words. You do look like you got punched in the face.

123
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,900
This is the second time in a year that you've had a crazy like mouth. I look like I got punched

124
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:38,220
in the face like on my lip. Yeah, your lip looks a little bit busted right now. It's a bit peculiar.

125
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,500
Have you talked about this on the podcast yet? Do you have a ball in your mouth? Yeah.

126
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:45,820
Oh, okay. Yeah, the ball. I think so. I think I talked about it on stream or something, but yeah,

127
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:53,660
I'm totally convinced this is a benign or very malignant tumor in my mouth. And I'm not going

128
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,060
to the doctor because I'm too afraid. Should we cut it out and do a biopsy? That would

129
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,740
actually be great. Yeah. I think they need to get rid of these stupid terms benign

130
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,500
and malignant and call them what they are good and evil. Yeah I do mix up benign and

131
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,140
malignant pretty often where someone will say somebody will say your cousin

132
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:16,500
got cancer. Yeah somebody will say that. And it's malignant and I'll say thank God. Yeah. And they'll go no that's bad.

133
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,360
That's the bad one. And I'll say okay. They should literally call them good and evil

134
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:27,140
tumors yeah way simpler you have an evil and bad I think if it's to be words it's

135
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:33,960
way too confusing easier to mix them up very good but bad and very good okay

136
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:43,480
yeah that could work or very good and very berry your husband has tutti-frutti

137
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:49,640
cancer yeah well that's a good that it also could be salty and sweet

138
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:56,480
yeah okay maybe there are five types and it's salty sweet sour umami spicy spicy

139
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:02,560
and spit sweet salt fat acid heat then that's one of the greatest books fire

140
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:11,120
air water air wind earth are getting earth I forgot earth Larry Moe curly

141
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:18,800
me curly Joe and Curly Joe, Chris Ed and Eddie yeah yeah or another Ed no,

142
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,080
we could just have a know we could do it. I saw why they should have had the

143
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,080
third edge should have been an Ed with three DS and the hell and Ed and Ed did

144
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,080
yeah did yeah how the hell on Blue's Clues salt and pepper have a have a kid

145
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,800
named paprika boy. I think I think Pepper was cheating on her husband. I

146
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,120
that she got in I think she maybe hooked up with Tony Sachery.

147
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,520
And you think that's how they got paprika?

148
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
That's how they got paprika.

149
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,520
I don't know any.

150
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,640
Salt and pepper does not make paprika.

151
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,280
Do you remember there being other dogs besides Blue and the Pink one?

152
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
Well Salt and Pepper weren't dogs.

153
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,280
Those weren't dogs.

154
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
They were salt and pepper.

155
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,280
They were spices.

156
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Oh I don't remember that.

157
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,280
They were in the kitchen.

158
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
They were salt and pepper in the kitchen.

159
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,280
Is that one of the later seasons?

160
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,360
Yeah that's not until like season five.

161
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,800
Is that after Steve is gone?

162
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,400
Because I only remember Steve.

163
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:13,400
was there. Steve was there. Who was this guy after Steve? Joe. Joe what? Mama. You want

164
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:23,400
to take that back? You want to try that one again? Okay, pick up the mic. Alright, so

165
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:32,040
who came after Steve? Joe. Go ahead, ask. And what, hold on, hold on. And what was Joe's

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,280
last name? Mama. This is his real name. See you guys are making me put my phone

167
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,800
away. I can't look it up. He can't do the IMDB thing. Oh my god this is perfect. You

168
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,920
know why? Because me and him always think he's wrong about something and then he's

169
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:57,360
always right. So since he's making me put my phone away to sabotage me.

170
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,280
He can't ever be right about anything. We just say no that's not right.

171
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:09,280
Oh my god, we're Machiavellian geniuses.

172
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,280
Yeah, you guys are trying to say like, "Oh, he gets distracted too easy.

173
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,280
He has a medical brain condition that makes him get distracted too easy."

174
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:23,280
No, it's so that you guys can tower over me like some kind of giant.

175
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,280
You're right. You have a medical condition.

176
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,280
Yeah, that's what I usually...

177
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,280
The doctor looked at your mom and said, "Unfortunately, he has a medical condition

178
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,700
condition where he can be distracted by a telephone.

179
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:38,380
Yep, that's what they said the medical could so anyway. What about what about a

180
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:41,740
space alien Christmas? You think that's what we might be able to do or an

181
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
astronaut Christmas? Hi Joe

182
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:50,060
Joe Mama Joe Mama got him. Oh my God astronaut Christmas. I don't like

183
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,920
Christmas alien because there's no winter. There could be winter on a

184
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,780
different planet. If they go to another planet or time

185
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,100
I don't know how you're doing you how are you finding another way to do your

186
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,680
phone with a spoon you're playing angry birds you're angry birds with a with a

187
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,280
spoon and a something you're supposed to talk and think

188
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:16,480
Jesus not can you please weigh in on a space alien Christmas

189
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,480
don't you what if I was like silent like harpo marks. I don't think that would

190
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,640
work on a podcast. I think it's a bad idea.

191
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,440
That's really funny.

192
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,880
you. Yeah, but I am wondering what you think of space a space alien Christmas.

193
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,520
I still just think that I think it just needs to be musical. Well, yeah, I can

194
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,540
be musical. I'm just I'm pitching the you see my for the musical.

195
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:43,640
Yeah, you like to eat it. You're in your clothes in your eye. You can look like

196
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,400
you stub your toe. Yeah,

197
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:50,120
you would have made just a great pirate. I think yeah, I think you would have

198
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,360
been like an all timer of a pirate. Yeah, you would be a great smith. Yes, I

199
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,540
would be a good you would look so good with a parrot on your shoulder and

200
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,460
missing an eye and we I swear to God we've said this before that you would be

201
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:08,180
a good pirate yeah that just means it's more true yeah you have dark or I'm just

202
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:13,260
like or I had a dream about this not a dream last night that I had a dream I

203
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:19,700
escaped an invasion yeah it's so kind of a body snatchers no no no it's basically

204
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,780
basically some kind of like I mean I you have to assume come some kind of like

205
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,340
republicans that are basically invading this like beautiful like island that i

206
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,300
was on

207
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,620
and they were basically doing a lot of different gun violence and

208
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,660
i just dodged them and kinda running away

209
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,860
and maybe doing some double crossing convincing them i was on their side and

210
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,420
i was actually not on their side and i escaped at the end

211
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:45,300
but they did kill millions of people and i was sitting there and i did

212
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,460
pretty much nothing about it. Did i tell you about my vampire kidnapping escape dream?

213
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,420
Is that after the show? The live show?

214
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,420
I think it well I don't think it was right after but it was after where you were

215
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,340
Dracula infected his brain with yeah yeah I was so scared that dreams that I was

216
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,860
well it was one of the it was a dream so I feel like actually you know what maybe

217
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,900
if this is an episode where we come up with movies because I think that that

218
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:10,300
could be a movie first of all the dream you just said there's nothing it's called

219
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:18,380
uh a low January 6 yeah oh that's good but here's my this movie okay this dream

220
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:22,100
I feel like a perfect movie. Yeah, that's the tagline. Yeah, the movie's called Caleb

221
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
is

222
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:33,020
I in the dream. It's the dream starts. I'm already kidnapped. I'm locked in a room with a vampire with a Dracula. He's not fair

223
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:39,000
Yeah, I know I don't get a chance to do anything stop yourself the room. It's the the the room

224
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,100
It's and I'm in locked in like a school or something - okay

225
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:47,460
The vampire has me in a school and basically the dream is that I go out of the door that the vampire has me and I

226
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:51,540
I run down the hallway and I run down the stairs and then there's a there's doors

227
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,660
and they have a they have like a they have a number punch keypad combination

228
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:01,220
lock to open it from the inside yeah and in the dream I type in I type in the

229
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,820
number. I just type in a random number and it works immediately. I go well,

230
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,060
thank God, if I had to do even one more number, he probably would have got me

231
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,300
and then I go outside and his daytime and like oh, thank God, it's daytime. He

232
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,700
can't follow me and then I woke up. That's like just there's almost no

233
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,000
tension in that yeah I ran downstairs and like just put it but it could be a

234
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:24,220
really short movie it could be a short film. I had a dream the other night

235
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,620
that I was attempting like a cartwheel and I woke up. Is this a dream episode or a

236
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:34,620
movie episode? Well this could be a movie. Okay all right then that's why I continue. I had a

237
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,940
dream that I was attempting a cartwheel and I woke up and I had both of my arms

238
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:45,840
like this and I flung myself forward you just did a cartwheel in the dream and

239
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,780
then you're in you called Patrick's cartwheel the movie it's actually not a

240
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:54,820
bad idea yeah that might be even better instead of a movie even as a gif yeah an

241
00:14:54,820 --> 00:15:05,120
animated what's it like what if what about like an oak lakes with oceans 11

242
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,200
Ocean's 12 thing but with 12 years of slave and you have like 13 years of slave.

243
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,760
That's the sequel? Yeah. They add a year? Just do one more year. It's just one more

244
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:18,880
year? Does he have to do 13 more years or just one more year? I think it's a different...

245
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,680
I never saw that movie. Wait, so is it a heist movie? Is that where the Ocean's thing comes in?

246
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:28,160
Well the naming scheme is where the Ocean's thing comes in but maybe he gets

247
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,000
okay maybe he gets the whole gang back together and he's like I gotta do one more year.

248
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,400
more. Why are you saying gang? Like everybody that he that like

249
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,480
this the guy who is I've never seen the movie I'm guessing the bad guys and

250
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,840
there's good guys and he's gets everybody together and he's like we got

251
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:49,760
to do you remember when I was a slave for 12 years we have to do one more year

252
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,920
until cuz maybe somebody you know what it is somebody comes to him and says

253
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,840
I'll give you a million dollars if you do one more year as a slave he says ah

254
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,600
Ah, they're right as I was out, they're pulling me right back in.

255
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,720
But if he gets a million dollars to be a slave, then he's not a slave.

256
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,080
Oh, that's actually, that's one of the philosophical conundrums at the heart of

257
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,200
the film. Yeah, it's kind of like, it's a, it's a retreat box.

258
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,280
If you get a slave for one million dollars, is that like a good...

259
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,400
Yeah. For one year.

260
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,000
And the, and the subtitle, it's, it's called, it's called, it's called

261
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,680
"13 Years a Slave, a Peculiar Quandary." Would you do this?

262
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,320
And it's a philosophical movie.

263
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:28,360
I think, I don't think I would be a slave for a year for a million bucks. That's pretty tough.

264
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,680
Yeah. Yeah. I guess it depends what I would be doing.

265
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,360
Like do you get a stipend every day?

266
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,480
No, I think that you have to go full slave.

267
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,360
Yeah, you're fully.

268
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,000
We both went for full slave.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,400
We both moved our hands like this and said full slave.

270
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,760
Like we were wiping a car window. Full slave.

271
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,720
Full slave.

272
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,200
Yeah.

273
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,680
One year.

274
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,560
One year.

275
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,400
Full slave, university in Florida.

276
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:59,440
Yeah, but I yeah, I don't tell you I almost went to full sail. I don't think

277
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,160
you told me that, but I knew that. Yeah, yeah, I'm sure that you were you did

278
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:08,320
that when you did DeVry, you're doing all that. I almost went to full sail.

279
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,840
Well, I'd like to make it was a for-profit. I'd like to make a third

280
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:20,560
person shooter. Yeah, I think I think the coolest thing that people go to full

281
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,800
sale and those types of things for is like 3d modeling and they just make

282
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,480
their they just put stuff on deviantART. I think that's awesome. I think that's so

283
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,800
cool. I saw this picture on Facebook. Oh it was like I think I showed you. Oh my god.

284
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,120
Yeah it's like the snake. It was a college in like the Philippines or

285
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,920
something where they do like they do like 3d modeling classes and they like

286
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,360
post the like college itself posted on their official Facebook page like one of

287
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,240
the like final projects and it's like a snake that's like smiling. It's like a

288
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,240
What about a movie about a 3D artist, right?

289
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Oh, the 3D artist.

290
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:07,240
The 3D artist and a client comes in and he says, "Here is, here's all the dimensions for the character that I need for my movie, right?

291
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:13,240
And here's all the dimensions, so plug it into your computer program and I want that. You got to model this thing."

292
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,240
You got to print it.

293
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,080
So he does all the dimensions right and it starts to look familiar and he

294
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,100
finishes it and it looks exactly like his dead brother. Whoa right and then

295
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,340
the guy says and also i'll give you one million dollars to be a slave for

296
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:31,440
higher here. That's the cinematic universe that we're working on. Yeah,

297
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,240
I think that'd be really good. You could call it the disaster artist.

298
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,740
That's good because it's a complete disaster to be put in this life. Yeah,

299
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:43,740
that's true.

300
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,740
Remember that movie?

301
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,740
Oh I found it.

302
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Come check this out.

303
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
It's slipping up my speech.

304
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,740
Spit it out.

305
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,740
Look at this snake with vampire teeth.

306
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,740
Oh my god it's a complete ball.

307
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
I can't turn my laptop.

308
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:03,740
Damn he looks dope.

309
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Doesn't that look sick?

310
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,740
I might enroll in this school.

311
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Can we make this a cover for this episode?

312
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,740
Yeah I think so.

313
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:16,480
profile picture. We should just make that the new cover for the podcast. Yeah.

314
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:22,680
Yeah that's so good. Well we'd have to pay the guy. That's fine. I'll pay him. Let's see if I

315
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:27,520
don't know if it says he did it. Okay here's the plan. I'm gonna reach out to...

316
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:36,100
It's for the snake. Okay. We give him, we send him an email say like hey we are

317
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:42,000
are three guys who host a podcast we love your snake with a smile guys I have

318
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,340
horrible news what every post on this on this Facebook page has a little

319
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:54,340
subtitle under under the the name that says the here it says satire page we got

320
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:59,900
played it's a satirical it's a satirical 3d snake what serious I'm completely

321
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,380
serious I didn't know that Facebook could do that so if it's satirical that

322
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:07,180
means that they must be making fun of what our satire pages. They're a way for

323
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,420
people to share social commentary by using humor, exaggeration, and absurdity to

324
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:15,740
make a point. Why are they labeled as satire pages? Posts from satire pages can

325
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,020
appear very similar to posts from public figures or conventional news sources.

326
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,780
Pages can label themselves as satire pages to help avoid this confusion. Is that real?

327
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,660
That's something that Facebook does? That's what it says when you click on this. That is so funny dude.

328
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:32,620
So like if you go to the Onion it says satire on you? I would imagine it does. I never, I don't really go to the

329
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,500
the on that's so I'm going to check it right now. I wonder if the onion put out

330
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,420
any heat lately.

331
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:46,020
No dude, this doesn't even say satire page. It's his media slash news

332
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,560
company. Let's check up on the audience. Who can I hate? I do I am. I think I'm

333
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,620
really passionate about fake news. Now that I got tricked by that three D

334
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,020
snake, I think I'm really. I think we really have to crack down on social

335
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,620
media and what we're allowed to post. I agree. I think that these these trolls

336
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,420
online and these are gone too far this time too far. It's just they made me

337
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,380
believe that in the Philippines you can take a class on making a 3d snake. I

338
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,140
feel like a total bozo. I think that these Russian bot farms basically we

339
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,500
need to go to a complete nuclear war. We need to go to Russia. Just kill every

340
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,860
one of I agree. I think that Russia should just be completely wiped off the

341
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:27,420
mouth. Yeah, I'm I'm completely pro Ukraine. Now I was on the fence before

342
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,380
I've said this from the beginning wipe them both out. Yeah, just flatten them.

343
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:36,220
Oh, I just found a new funny onion headline. What does it say? CEOs warn

344
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:41,540
against the dangers of artificial intelligence. That could be a movie. The

345
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:46,220
CEO opening scene, the CEO, he's sitting in his office, right? We are up from the

346
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,780
little bronze nameplate that says, says Derek awesome, the CEO, the CEO, and then

347
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,940
it's a pans up and he says, what did he say? What's up? What did he say about AI?

348
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,900
Oh, he's, uh, they, let me scroll back up here, they warn against the dangers of it.

349
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,540
There's gonna be dangers in regards to artificial intelligence, right?

350
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
Yeah.

351
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,940
So that could be like the opening scene, and that could be what they call an inciting incident

352
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
in the movie.

353
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,700
So now we need a rising action, so maybe he says that and then the person across from

354
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,060
him who's clearly half robot but he doesn't realize it goes like, "No, there's not any

355
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,060
dangers to it."

356
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:31,140
Before we go any further, I just wanted to say, I thought, this whole time I thought artificial intelligence was what they called Fox News.

357
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,140
Ohhhhh.

358
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,060
Are you fucking for real?

359
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,220
Did you really think that?

360
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,660
That's like so stupid.

361
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,340
I just thought of that.

362
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,460
You just thought of what you thought?

363
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
Mmhmm.

364
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,460
What?

365
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,500
You really thought that?

366
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:50,020
This whole time I thought artificial intelligence is what they labeled Fox News.

367
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,380
I'm reporting this fake satire Philippines page.

368
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,380
I think that they should put...

369
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,380
For false information.

370
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,380
I think that I would actually find Fox News a little bit humorous if they put that little

371
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,540
satire button on the bottom of that, right?

372
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Yep.

373
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,780
Because then I would find their outrageous...

374
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,780
Yeah, they should put artificial intelligence at the bottom of it because when you read

375
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,460
it you become stupid and it's not real.

376
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,180
Well, they should put lack of intelligence.

377
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:11,720
And they should call it fake news.

378
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,720
I think that they should...

379
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
Fake...

380
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,700
Fox should stand for fake all over...

381
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:22,420
over it may be pronounced Fox News but it's spelled FAUX yeah oh like foe yeah

382
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:29,380
but it's pronounced Fox hmm what about pH Oh news I would read it and eat read it

383
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:36,140
read it read it and eat that could be a good movie name news there is a food

384
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:40,980
news and weep no no this movie is called KK Panabaker X what's it about me

385
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:46,940
reading the last three Harry Potter books? Tearjerkers. Oh yeah. Waterworks.

386
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:53,340
I don't know. Bye-bye Dobby. Dobby, did he die? Oh yeah, he died in the

387
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:58,180
one, yeah. In my brain, Dobby died the second he was introduced. He should have. He's too

388
00:23:58,180 --> 00:24:03,780
weak and sickly a creature to sustain. Dobby had a brother named Creature. Yeah, I

389
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,940
don't even know if he's-- I don't think he's a brother, I think he's the

390
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,820
same species I think we said is insanely racist full-on speaking of slavery full

391
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,140
on slavery complete slavery yeah it's really and it's and it's like and Dobby

392
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:20,660

slave yeah if you give him a sock he's free yeah kind of fucking shit is that

395
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,380
it's a stupid it really works it's one of the worst book series in the world

396
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,820
it's so funny that like you, you just see people complaining about jk

billionaire because he wrote the most fucking stupid books ever. It's also

407
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,640
it's so funny that the whole like conflict of that thing of that those

408
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,520
books is like the evil guys want to do genocide, but the good guys they don't

want to genocide, but they still don't like the people they're going to get

410
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,520
like that. They're trying to kill yeah the muggles are there still there. Hey,

411
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,620
there's literally like a homeless lady who had like a like was writing it on

412
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:46,040
library computers just being like and then there's a slave name. Don't be

413
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:51,920
yeah, don't be going to be a complete slave, but he's a friendly one and then

414
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:54,500
The mean ones called creature right?

415
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,000
Yeah

416
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,680
The mean ones is brother too

417
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,700
They're all brothers

418
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,980
All slaves are related

419
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,780
And he's got some kind of mark

420
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,780
And you give him a sock

421
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:03,620
Yeah

422
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,820
And he gets off the slavery

423
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,380
And he's completely done with being a slave

424
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,060
And there's a blonde boy

425
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,420
And he's a complete villain

426
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,700
He's mixed with a snake

427
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,300
What's he? He's a...

428
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,420
Oh Dobby's an elf?

429
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,380
House elf

430
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,180
House elf

431
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:18,980
*laughter*

432
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
Oh my fucking god

433
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,980
Yeah, and his house!

434
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,980
Ah, oh, frog!

435
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,980
At this point it's so hacked to be like, man,

436
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Harry Potter was weird, but yeah

437
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,980
It's fucking crazy.

438
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,980
It is fucked up.

439
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,980
It's really, it's like wrong.

440
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,980
I always hated Harry Potter because of who it was.

441
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,980
Me too, I did not like it.

442
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
I read it all and then I thought,

443
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
I was like, why did I do that?

444
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
This sucks.

445
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
Yeah, someone is, she's writing the bank scene

446
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,980
and gives it to someone and they're like,

447
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,380
Is this doesn't seem kind of like anti-semitic.

448
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:54,380
She's like, no, it's not supposed to be Jews expecting me

449
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,780
midgets, right?

450
00:26:55,780 --> 00:27:00,180
It's supposed to be midget Jews, not normal Jews.

451
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:04,180
And they got also slaves working for them, right?

452
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,480
Yeah.

453
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,380
Oh my God.

454
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:09,780
I remember I rewatched all those movies recently in the past

455
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,280
like two years because my girlfriend wanted to and the first

456
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,680
like in the first movie when they go to Gringotts and they

457
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,680
see all the goblins.

458
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:17,980
It's fucking crazy.

459
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,520
the first thing that the Hagrid says when they walk into that bank is like he

460
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,440
turns to her and it's like you have to stay close to me. You can't trust any of

461
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:28,640
these goblins for a single second.

462
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:36,120
It's so funny that you now you could go to you can go pay a hundred and eighty

463
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,280
dollars to go see them at Universal Studios. So sick and it's really fun

464
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:44,560
dude. I part of Harry Potter. I like is the amusement park bro. I love

465
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,820

480
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:31,120
though and let me tell you universal yo the velocity coaster is next is next

481
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,920
freaking level i really literally want i want i want to go on the et ride i want

482
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:39,200
i want there to be ones where they're where king kong picks you up and rips

483
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,040
you in half the king kong ride at universal i would honestly love so it's

484
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:47,360
really bad but does he jump up no you're in a car they're screwed the one cool

485
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:53,520
part of it is they have a giant uh animatronic um kong head at the end of it that's what i want is a

486
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,280
giant the hulk ride is sick the hulk ride i i like i almost passed out on the hulk ride the hulk ride

487
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:05,120
is so fucking he has nothing to do with hulk it's a gamma chamber some shit it's a gamma chamber what

488
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,200
the hell is that what's the that's the that's the story of the ride oh yeah i thought you're saying

489
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:15,360
that's like a kind of roller coaster

490
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,520
chamber. The Velocicoaster is like incredible though. That was our

491
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:24,040
pre-show reel for a little bit. Well you've made us watch the ET ride thing

492
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,840
probably 30 times. It's so good. Well it's the video just doesn't do it justice.

493
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:33,360
It's one of the best rides in the world because it's one of the worst rides. Wow.

494
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:40,000
So good. It's so bad. It's good. Wow like Trolls 2. You should do an MST 3K for that. You

495
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:47,200
should yeah I would actually be great at that when ET says thank you Patrick I

496
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,300
get you get chills I guess so he knows my name how you know you sitting in my name

497
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:59,960
isn't Patrick he says you're gonna have to say thank you Caleb really what if

498
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:03,960
you have a name that nobody else has yeah what do they plug in have they

499
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,160
recorded ET saying he's saying a bunch of names but if I don't know what if my

500
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:13,160
name is like what if my name is like water bottle. I don't think they have that.

501
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Thank you water bottle. He can say water bottle? Yeah. Holy crap. I guess that's just water

502
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,360
and bottle so they probably already recorded names for people named water and people named

503
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,840
bottle. Thank you Mohammed. Your mic keeps going crazy whenever you move it around. There

504
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,000
might be something wrong with that cable. That's okay by me. Yeah. Yeah that's not really

505
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,600
my problem. It's gonna have to be okay with everyone listening. Sorry. Is there any kind

506
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,440
of Nickelodeon rides or the I think I got rid of all the Nickelodeon stuff I

507
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,280
won't there's dr. Seuss they're building for years they've been building the

508
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,520
Nintendo Lynch part what oh yeah the Nintendo and look so sick they took out

509
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,960
they took out some unless the haggard unless the twin dragons is still there I

510
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,120
was a good ride I think that dueling dragons is gone maybe yeah I think the

511
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,040
dueling dragons is gone and then they replace that with Nintendo world

512
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,160
Nintendo World, yeah, is still, but the Hagrid motorcycle ride was sick. Did you

513
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,560
ride that one? I did. That one is tight. I went on the, when they go to, you go to

514
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:18,000
the big Hogwarts. Yeah. That one's sick. The one, the dark ride, when you, when you

515
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,560
go and... We should just, we should just plan. We really need to go. We should just

516
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:26,080
plan an amusement park. We should just plan an amusement park trip. We should go.

517
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:31,800
No, an amusement park. First, the best time to go is like the three days after

518
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,400
thanksgiving this guy watch that German tour that's I think exactly when I read

519
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:41,040
a long video about roller coaster day that last year I went to Universal three

520
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:48,840
days I think also maybe we could go in tonight we can go tonight I we really

521
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,720
need to plan a big Universal trip I know okay we plan a trip where we go we do one

522
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,200
night at Universal then we do one night in Las Vegas and then we go back to

523
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,180
to Universal and we go back to Las Vegas and then back to Universal and then we go

524
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,880
home. Yes we can do that. Okay yeah that's what you want to do we could definitely

525
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,560
do that. I think it should be one day. Different mindsets. One day each, one day each.

526
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:15,400
Can we go to Cuba? Yes. Different mindsets. I think if you go to if you go to

527
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:20,000
Universal then Vegas then you if you go to Vegas and you lose your money you

528
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,240
won't have enough money to get funny photos. Well I think well okay but I

529
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,720
think that if you go if you alternate days between those that is not something

530
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,840
that people I don't think I would say that maybe we could be the first people

531
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:36,280
ever to do four days of alternating Vegas and universal isn't like a like a.

532
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:39,520
Oh, this is like I'm going to go have the time of my life. Vegas is like a job

533
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:44,960
like you're on the clock. I think that we could create a completely new brain

534
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,800
mindset by doing that. I don't think anybody in history has ever done that. I

535
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:53,080
think it would nobody's right. I think something would happen to Vegas every

536
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,920
like to Vegas, then to universe and that's like the only world you knew for

537
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:59,720
days. I think you would actually like you

538
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,680
transcend. Yeah, you're right. Something would happen. That would be so

539
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,640
fucking insane. I don't think it would necessarily be good, but I think that

540
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,640
that would be like a new type of brain experiment. Yeah, that nobody's done. It's

541
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,680
like, oh my god, I'm leaving universe. The feeling of leaving vacation and then

542
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:17,320
touching down in Las Vegas, that's so crazy. And then knowing that

543
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,760
you have to go back to the universe. Yeah, and then you gamble, you stay up all

544
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,300
all night you gamble, you lose all your money and then you have that kind of

545
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,600
like hangover feeling where you're leaving a casino. You don't want to go

546
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,780
on a you don't want to go on a roll and you're like you're like oh my God, my

547
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:33,560
life, what the fuck I don't want to get to this point, okay and the flight

548
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:38,860
non stop flight between Orlando and Las Vegas is only five hours. So that's not

549
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:42,600
that bad. No yeah, so if you go, I mean you just do red eyes, you're going to

550
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,600
see to maximize the time yeah. So you do read every time you would be sleeping

551
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,640
you you go on the plane. Well, you try to sleep on the plane. I guess yeah,

552
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:50,500
- Well, I mean, that's what I mean.

553
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,420
Like, every time you'll be sleeping in a bed.

554
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,260
- Yeah.

555
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,100
- Different hotels every time, too.

556
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:57,740
- Look, if we can make this mindset happen, I--

557
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,060
- Oh my God, oh my God.

558
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:03,660
I just figured out the high roller coaster mindset.

559
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:04,500
- This is the--

560
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,340
- High roller, roller coaster.

561
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,160
- Oh my God.

562
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,060
- You could also, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

563
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:11,420
'Cause you could do it in, you could do Disney--

564
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,340
- This is the movie.

565
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,700
You could do Disney Land-- - Leaving Las Vegas

566
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,540
and going to Orlando and then leaving Orlando

567
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,380
and going to Las Vegas.

568
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,180
- If we're trying to maximize time here,

569
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:24,780
you could go Disneyland. I'm not trying to maximize any time I'm trying to create a

570
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:31,020
new brain experiment. Yeah we're trying to actually induce psychosis.

571
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,780
I thought that you wanted to, but if you keep taking flights from Las Vegas to LA

572
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:41,220
back and forth, because if you're trying to induce psychosis,

573
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:46,380
one ride back to LAX. He just sat up in his chair, he's got some serious points. One

574
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:54,880
One ride back to LAX, Vegas airport, gamble for like three hours, back to the airport,

575
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:59,640
back to LAX, universal, two rides, back to Vegas.

576
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,640
But here's my-

577
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,800
Wait, are you saying go to Florida and then Vegas and then LA and then Vegas and then

578
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,800
Florida?

579
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
Because that's actually crazy.

580
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,800
I was thinking about now about-

581
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,560
I was saying LA, but if you do that-

582
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
That's crazy.

583
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,960
But LA to Las Vegas is only an hour and 15 minutes flight.

584
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:13,960
Well, that's what I mean.

585
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,800
It would completely warp your perception of time if you were going to Disneyland

586
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,640
and Disney World which are almost identical.

587
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
Okay, but here's the thing I have to...

588
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,280
But you're only seeing an hour difference between Vegas and Disneyland

589
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,640
and a five-hour difference between Vegas and Disney World.

590
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,240
So you're seeing the same thing. You're like,

591
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,680
"Am I time-traveling when I go to Disney World?"

592
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,440
If only both Disney parks had an airport.

593
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,120
If they had a landing strip, that'd be huge.

594
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:42,320
That might tip the mindset, though, into being too much about amusement

595
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,120
and you might need to add a second a second las vegas style stop in there but

596
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,680
here at top show

597
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,280
like maybe like you go to like a business summit

598
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,080
but you're doing it every other time anyway for both of them so really as

599
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,440
long as you start with a guess you could have in with the same thing is i just

600
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,160
want to do it will do a patient

601
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,280
yeah i just want to learn all time you're on blow

602
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,120
yeah i don't think the drug should be involved i think it's a pure is it

603
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:11,520
really good drinking as a drinking is insanely involved drinking you're

604
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,480
drinking the entire time. We're trying to, because it is, you're trying to like,

605
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:18,880
What if you just need like a just a bump to keep you awake at Vegas? I think you're really

606
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,920
trying to hurt whoever you are subjecting this to. Okay, here's my new pitch.

607
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,880
Okay. This is like that movie The Game. Uh-huh. This is kind of what you're doing.

608
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,640
It's called The Park. Yeah, the Michael Douglas movie. Yeah, yeah. It's like that.

609
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,400
You're doing it to somebody. I think it's Disney World to Las

610
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:40,880
Vegas, Las Vegas to Disneyland, Disneyland to a zero-gravity space flight

611
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,320
where you go up out of the atmosphere you hang in so you get that zero gravity

612
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,760
thrill yeah and then you're back down also your bones separate a little bit so

613
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,600
every day you're getting like an inch shorter yeah this is like that movie

614
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:56,160
phone booth where the guy is like if you don't do this I'll fucking kill like mm-hmm

615
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:00,080
so you tell you're you're doing like a phone booth style thing this guy's got a

616
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:04,320
Bluetooth headset on you're actually is a razor headset yeah so you're calling him

617
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:09,600
you call him and say like if you don't go to Disney World Orlando right now yeah

618
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,160
I'm fucking killed I will fucking kill the president's daughter or whatever that

619
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,000
movie was well he's in love with the president that's another part of me this

620
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,720
guy's in love with the president's daughter or maybe he's going on a date

621
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,320
with it's the guy from my day with the president's daughter or it's maybe it's

622
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,280
the guy from Resident Evil 4 who's trying to rescue the president's

623
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:32,120
daughter or maybe it's Jon Favreau and he's saying I will I will become a big

624
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:37,840
show I will become an even better chef than you if you don't go

625
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,440
Orlando, then Las Vegas, then Universal Hollywood, then Zero Gravity Flight.

626
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,080
There's no need to kill any president's daughter or anything.

627
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,320
This is just, you ask somebody, you say, "Okay, I'm going to give you a million dollars to

628
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,840
be a slave for a year."

629
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
They agree.

630
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
This is what you force them to do.

631
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:54,840
Holy shit.

632
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
They are a pleasure and business slave.

633
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,840
They literally just brought it completely back to that.

634
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
Well, that's it.

635
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,840
We can end the episode now.

636
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:01,840
Well, that's the thing about if you do-

637
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Just play 30 minutes of an album.

638
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:10,260
in the episode here play fucking play Dark Side of the Moon synced up with I feel

639
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,000
like this is the last 10 minutes has been some of the densest this podcast has ever

640
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,480
been as far as like just pure ideas yeah I think that is like one of our

641
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,540
smartest more time yeah speaking of fascinating high roller coaster slave

642
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:28,920
well the thing is I would that is that if someone says I'll give you a million

643
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,440
dollars bf2 my my slave for an entire year you expect to be working you don't

644
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,840
don't know what kind of slave you could be yeah. You know you to be my high

645
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,440
roller coaster slave who goes from Disney land to Disney world to Las Vegas

646
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,340
to space and then back for a year. Then you say yes, I think yeah because that

647
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,440
will do so much psychic damage to you. Can you imagine even going to Disney

648
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,640
world every day for a month? How fucking insane your life would be? Oh my God,

649
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:57,640
can you imagine the the movies and art that we would get if we did that to

650
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,440
hundreds of thousands of young men in this country? Absolutely like just like

651
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,360
just like a generational trauma. I feel like we could get better stuff than

652
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:10,160
Vietnam movies. Definitely, yeah. We don't have a war right now. Yeah. It's at all

653
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,720
interesting, right? There's no kind of like mass like violent movement for everybody to rally behind.

654
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:22,600
This is not, this is a movie idea, what we've come up with. It's not an idea for a movie.

655
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,960
It is an idea for a way to make movies be great. Yeah, which is that we take a

656
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,920
bunch of people who are like, you know, kind of their brains are like right on

657
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:35,400
the edge of development, early 20s, like late teens.

658
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
- 18 to 22.

659
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,560
- Yeah, and we're sending them--

660
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,400
- Mail.

661
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,480
- In droves.

662
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,320
- Drove.

663
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,140
- To--

664
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,600
- We are chartering flights that's just full

665
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,680
of only these people.

666
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,520
- Exactly.

667
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,840
- And they are not allowed to talk to each other.

668
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,280
- Well, we time it perfectly, so as soon as one leaves,

669
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,240
another arrives to each location.

670
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,080
- Yeah.

671
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:51,900
- Oh my God.

672
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:52,920
- And they have a circuit that they have to follow.

673
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,720
- And the Disney parks will pay for it,

674
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,280
'cause we're driving so much traffic to their parks.

675
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,660
- Exactly, 'cause they do have to pay for their own food.

676
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:04,700
yes and their own drinks because you know what there's and they have a for photos

677
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:08,660
with with Mickey and sting goofy and sully because they have to prove that

678
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:12,420
they went every single time yeah they have a punch card yeah exactly they put

679
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:18,860
they tape a photo yeah of them with and also we give them a virus that kills

680
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,540
them in 24 hours if they don't get the antidote yeah and the antidote it's like

681
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:29,380
a what's the antidote it's in space it's maybe it's under 24 hours they do go to

682
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:34,320
space. Maybe it's at the core of the earth. That's too hard to get to. Yeah, space is easier

683
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,340
to get to. In Florida, space is easy to get to. That's true. Yeah, because it's hanging

684
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:43,620
off of the earth. Yeah, that's a good point. I am trying to think of how we can involve

685
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:51,220
the center of the earth though. Maybe that's where we hang out. We can't go to the center

686
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:56,180
of the earth. I think we just need to buy a new XLR. Should we replace it right now? Yeah.

687
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:02,800
Yeah, I'm gonna do that. Okay, wow. It's serious, but I think okay so back to what we were saying before

688
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,620
I think maybe that our control center is at the center of the earth

689
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:07,900
hmm

690
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,540
Like our command center where we're watching everyone on screens

691
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:15,820
I just think you're getting so caught up on this whole like center of the earth thing and I feel like being in the

692
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:21,620
Controlling aspect of it. Yeah, why do you mostly about control of a Nathan Fielder type this one? Yeah?

693
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:26,320
I'm not anything like neurodivergent. Oh, I'm gonna be like the famous fucking

694
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,420
manipulator Nathan Fielder. Okay, first of all, he's not that famous. He's mad.

695
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,020
He's pretty fucking famous. No, but he's an alt comedian. Okay, if he was, if he was,

696
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:39,380
if he was famous, he'd be called a mainstream comedian. That's true. I don't

697
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,740
think, I think he's pretty fucking like Brad Pitt level famous at this point.

698
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:47,420
Every woman wants to have sex with that guy. Brad Pitt is not that famous. I think every woman who has it.

699
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:52,580
is really not fit that famous at all really yeah he's fair fame just dropped.

700
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:55,220
I did see a picture of Brad Pitt the other day and I could not believe that

701
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:59,580
he's like 55 years old. He's one of the hottest people I know it looks damn good.

702
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,700
Yeah yeah he has such a good actor - I can't believe if you should be that good

703
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,980
at that good girlfriend ever said that she would have sex with Nathan Fielder.

704
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:17,260
No no she has insurance insurance she's not like us like one of these scumbags

705
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:21,840
with no insurance talking about yeah I'll fuck Nathan Fielder I'll do anything for

706
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:26,060
insurance yeah yeah health insurance oh that's a weird you know everyone

707
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,660
complains about that everyone's like oh why does why do women think he's hot and

708
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,380
then it's like who complains about that other men and it's like well if you're

709
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,540
a man you know he's the most normal-looking guy so if you look if you

710
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,460
look anywhere near that guy I feel like I don't know I feel like people

711
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,780
shouldn't be complaining about it I feel like people should be celebrating I

712
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:50,660
I don't think that I think that women are more attracted to his sarcastic mind

713
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,980
than anything else. Exactly. Not really his physical body. Yeah. Yeah.

714
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:56,620
They're looking at him they're like okay this guy's fucking next level at

715
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,340
sarcasm let's try to learn let's try to learn from the best. That's the

716
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:05,620
point I was trying to make. I've talked to plenty of women, tons of women and they're all like I'm sarcastic.

717
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,420
There's also a thing of like you know your girlfriend was watching a movie and

718
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:13,060
there's like a slime monster in it and she's like that is the hottest guy I've

719
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,860
ever seen and you're like well that's like the hottest guy ever seen then what

720
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:21,500
the fuck am I what what's going on here yeah I don't really something about me

721
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:26,620
I'm like I'm like I'm I'm not slime monster enough yeah yeah if that's the

722
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:30,460
hottest one yeah the slime everyone has the slime monster experience isn't it

723
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:35,860
great to feel inadequate yeah but I'll never feel inadequate again once I have

753
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:07,340
living room so he can like recover," because he was like living with us at the

754
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:12,480
time. And then I found out later he just got fucking veneers. What? My uncle got

758
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,280

00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,320
trying to get surgery yeah yeah no you just why do you keep saying my big and

762
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:47,240
soaked in urine yeah while he had a woman an open wound on his wound he of

763
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:52,280
wreck a raccoon soaked in urine was the rabies is honestly exact reason I was

764
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:57,880
funniest things like seeing I saw video of a guy with rabies. It is so funny.

765
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:02,840
Can you imagine if my uncle died from rabies and the like lead up to that was I

766
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:07,240
got a text and said hey your uncle picked up a raccoon soaked in urine and

767
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,720
then I just had that was like a part of my like psyche that was like shattered

768
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:16,800
forever. Yeah. Does he seem like a kind of a wild card this uncle or does he

769
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:22,080
has he ever been cursed with bad luck? No that's my dad's cousin. Okay. That

770
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:28,080
that guys. I don't even know what he's up to. So he's not the most people in my

771
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,880
family. I don't know what what's going on. They're kind of just doing their

772
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,960
crazy. I know what every single actually never mind never mind. No, I don't know.

773
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,200
I was thinking about that and then I was like I have no fucking idea. I have I

774
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,600
have coming for the mind my close family. Obviously, I know what's up, but

775
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:48,720
like you know my like some of my cousins and stuff. I'm like I was families. I

776
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,200
grew up next to all of my cousins.

777
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,520
- Yeah. - I have cousins that I knew,

778
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,780
that I met, I saw a lot growing up.

779
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,680
Like, they're like second cousins.

780
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,320
And I saw them a lot growing up,

781
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,200
and we were pretty close,

782
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,360
and our families had like kind of a falling out.

783
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,520
And I haven't seen them in a little while,

784
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,280
and I asked my grandmother about them.

785
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:09,120
And that's when I learned, at 25 years old,

786
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:10,880
I learned that my cousins were twins.

787
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,400
- Whoa. - I had no idea.

788
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,360
I didn't even know as a kid they were twins.

789
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,960
- That's crazy. - Which was a real,

790
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:23,140
of an atom bomb. Yeah. Right on my brain. Yeah. Yeah. My mom told me I have like

791
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:26,680
medical mesh in my stomach or something like that because I got umbilical

792
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:32,020
hernia surgery when I was a kid. You had a hernia? I had an umbilical hernia. You

793
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:35,520
have mesh in your stomach because you tried to chew through a net when you're

794
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:41,100
in the ocean? Yeah. No. You were trying to get... I could see you dying with a six-pack ring on

795
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:45,840
your neck. Yeah. Yeah. You can see right around there there's a scar. Why are you showing me

796
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,360
your belly button because I had an umbilical hernia. You're so big dude

797
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,640
because yeah cuz I look how big his belly button is. It's so deep. I got surgery on it.

798
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:00,800
Stick your finger in there and then smell your finger right now live. It

799
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,360
smells like dr. Bronner's. Really? Wow. Mine is bad if I do that. Yeah. And also like it

800
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:10,520
smells like I wash the shit out of it. I know that. Yeah you probably have to. I know most of my holes

801
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:15,320
on my body smell. I hate a belly button gives me like body horror. Yeah I don't

802
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
I fucking hate it.

803
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,320
Well you should have seen my, because my

804
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,320
I don't want to see it.

805
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,440
An umbilical hernia is when part of your intestine pokes out of your fucking belly button.

806
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,000
Yeah I know, that's why belly buttons scare me.

807
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:27,480
So I'd walk around with a little fucking like penis on my stomach.

808
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,480
That's exactly what

809
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,480
I know there's a penis on your stomach.

810
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:33,280
When you put your finger in your belly button it feels like you're touching your stuff.

811
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,280
What stuff?

812
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:35,280
The inside.

813
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,280
The skin is so thin.

814
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:38,720
I don't really know what a belly button is and I really don't care.

815
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:39,720
Do you not?

816
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:40,720
That's where the umbilical is.

817
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,720
Can I see your belly button?

818
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:42,720
The umbilical cord.

819
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,720
No.

820
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:44,720
Are you an outie or an innie?

821
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,820
many who's in who's an out. I know it can you imagine if you said out. I think

822
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:51,320
they thought I had an out and then they realize it's

823
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:57,660
an out belly button like a like an anime belly, but that's like a really big one

824
00:48:57,660 --> 00:49:01,020
that has like the like bandages over it like that one did you mon

825
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:05,620
and how do you battle like any adults have? I think you're an out e belly

826
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:08,520
button because you won't show it. I'm not an out, but I'm not he's literally

827
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,480
he has an out e belly. Now I really don't know. I'm very protective over my

828
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,880
delightful little white body. Can I see it? I showed you my, I showed everybody my belly

829
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:22,800
button. My alabaster torso will never be shown to you guys. You will not see my belly button.

830
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,000
Let me see your belly button. There's so much hair inside of my belly button. Well then

831
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,280
let's just get it out of there. It's so crazy. Let's get that hair out. It's so crazy that

832
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,920
I look like a. Get that hair out of here. I wore like an undershirt the other day. Just

833
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:41,840
out and like I sweat a little bit and then all you could see was just like my chest hair

834
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:48,680
pattern like said under showers you said undershirt undershirt that's right I said

835
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:55,840
it oh and I fucking said it bro we all said undershirt dude stop saying it

836
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:04,040
you're doodoo I just said doodoo shit god damn it dude there should be I almost

837
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:08,160
just said do Kyle XY not have a belly button yeah that's how they knew he was

838
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:11,680
an alien yeah this guy's such a freak that he didn't have in a belly button he

839
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,680
He wasn't an alien, right? He was born an alien.

840
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,680
What would you do if you saw someone without a belly button?

841
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,680
Make one.

842
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,680
I guess that would probably get...

843
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:21,680
Draw one on them.

844
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,680
Do you know sometimes when you see someone without eyebrows

845
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,680
and you can't really tell what's wrong with their face at first?

846
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:27,680
Yes.

847
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,680
Like you can't and then you go, "Oh, of course, it's the eyebrows."

848
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,680
Why do people shave their eyebrows and bleach their eyebrows?

849
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:33,680
Sometimes it looks good.

850
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,680
It depends on who it is.

851
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,680
If strange females nowadays had the option,

852
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:39,680
they would shave their belly button to make it disappear.

853
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:46,080
Probably true because I want to be like the strangeness of the other day.

854
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,280
We're sick from sick of X. Oh yeah, Mia goth. She's got no eyebrows. She has no

855
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:55,980
belly button either. Really camera. We're talking the other day about how to feed

856
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:01,080
her hands. Me and him saw who has no feet or hands or a hair. It's got him

857
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:05,380
removed. No hair or feet or hands or belly button or eyebrows. I'm sick of

858
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:10,180
Alternative O types do I know and her at the hair and her scalp is blue because

859
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,460
she doesn't have hair so she colors her scalp blue that sounds for the movie

860
00:51:13,460 --> 00:51:18,260
they had to CGI Bushwick 10 I saw a guy I saw a guy the other day he had

861
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:22,740
freckles all over his body fucking disgusting I got covered in freckles do

862
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:25,460
you guys I get you said you and came we're talking about we saw an

863
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:28,860
alternative O type walking across the street very slowly the other day well we

864
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:34,420
were in a car oh yeah I do remember this poor this poor bastard was just walking

865
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,500
he had tattered jeans on. He walked towards the car as if he wanted to get in. Yeah,

866
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:42,060
and his clothes were completely tattered and he's walking across the street and

867
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:45,780
just looking like and he had piercings on he had two piercings both on his ears.

868
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:49,500
He had a beard like a ruffian. Yeah, and he was wearing some kind of rock and roll tee

869
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,140
and he had no sleeves on. We locked the doors. Really? Yeah, we locked the doors and I

870
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:58,460
also put the I put the sunscreen on on on my front windshield because I was like I

871
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:01,060
don't I don't want this guy to see me. I want him to think that maybe we're

872
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,300
we're sleeping in this car and then me and him started rocking the car back

873
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,360
and forth to make him think we were having sex in the car, so he wouldn't

874
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:11,120
come knock on it. If my Ford Focus is okay and then I and then I was and then

875
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:14,420
I was like and then the reason I knew he was coming when we're in the car is

876
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:17,320
because I was like looking at like the Starbucks you had in the car and I was

877
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:23,460
like oh this pink the pink whipped cream drink that we have yeah, it's me it's

878
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,700
like in Jurassic Park and there's ripples going through it because he's

879
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,660
walking because that's what it would make a best part is this this fucking

880
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,200
piece of shit probably works at a starbucks or another kind of indie

881
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:34,720
coffee roastery and he's too busy making some kind of fucking

882
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,920
something with a ristretto shot yeah to read a ristretto. What is it? What I

883
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:45,560
don't know what you're making an Aleppo shot ever at starbucks yeah and he's

884
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:49,440
probably doing a mobile order also probably on an iphone instead of an

885
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,040
android yeah or maybe on an apple watch, which I recently bought one by the way

886
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:56,560
to he's making and then you go up and you're like can I get a large like

887
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,100
sorry, we don't call it that here. We call it a boloco. It's like what are you

888
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:05,300
talking about? Yeah, yeah, I can yeah shit. And then I'm like pants. I'm like

889
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,000
okay, fine. I don't want a large than give me just a small and they're like a

890
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:12,100
small we call that a cheapotle. Yep. Yep. Yep. I hate you go ahead and just

891
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:17,100
guess what the giant size is called. It's called a Qdoba. When you go to the

892
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,300
when you go to the indie coffee shop, you say let me get a large. I say sorry,

893
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:24,200
we don't call that a large. We call it a super size me. Yeah, okay, fine. Then I

894
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,360
small and they say we don't call it a small we call it a kids meal and all of a

895
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:31,720
sudden you're eating two nuggets so that's pretty interesting. It's funny they

896
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:37,240
sell those in twos. Have you seen the tiny fries? I can probably imagine what they look

897
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:42,400
like. Yeah. Yeah. Just imagine. Yeah when I'm watching Futurama on my phone I see

898
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,280
tiny fries. Yeah on my iPod video. My iPod phone. I've been thinking about getting an iPod.

899
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,400
iPod phono. Like an old iPod? I already said I wanted to get an iPod shuffle like a

900
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:55,520
while ago you're copying me an iPod video so I can watch my movies you can watch

901
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,760
your movies it's funny I feel like I maybe maybe not you guys I feel like

902
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:03,600
most people have like one movie that they bought in 2009 on I iPod that's

903
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,120
just like they just have permanently or like a music video or something I have I

904
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:13,320
have a I have a censored version of shootouts by Jadakiss and Stiles P on my

905
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:20,480
iTunes and then I have five premium episodes of WTF with Mark Maron I know I

906
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,200
I know I have a movie on there, but I can't remember what it is. I haven't opened iTunes

907
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,880
in so long. I'm going to see what it is.

908
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:32,880
I think I have... Oh, you know what I have? It's on my mom's iTunes, though. I have...

909
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,160
Come on, you got this.

910
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:37,800
Yeah, come on.

911
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,640
What it is is like...

912
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:39,240
You don't remember.

913
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:46,240
I bought three of the... because I already downloaded a bunch of that fucking Ariel Pink

914
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:50,320
album. I have three Ariel Pink songs on my mom's iTunes.

915
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,320
That's pretty tight.

916
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:52,320
That's dope as fuck.

917
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:55,920
They changed the name of iTunes on my computer to "Music."

918
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,080
Yeah.

919
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:58,480
They're trying to get rid of iTunes.

920
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:59,480
What the hell?

921
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:00,480
Just like they did Napstar.

922
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:01,880
They're making this all PC.

923
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,880
It's all PC.

924
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,240
It's like, you can't call it iTunes anymore.

925
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,240
It's Weetunes.

926
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:12,400
When they were trying to, like when LimeWire and they were cracking down on all the torrenting

927
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,440
stuff, you used to be able to buy the LimeWire software at Best Buy for like 20 bucks.

928
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,440
Yeah.

929
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,880
crazy that they would sell LimeWire on a disc.

930
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,880
They need to do it again.

931
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:25,400
They need to bring it back.

932
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,160
I think you can still download LimeWire.

933
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,480
I don't think there's probably all that much good stuff on there though.

934
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:32,960
I have some good stuff on my iTunes.

935
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,440
What do you have?

936
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:39,680
Got some Tyler the Creator, got some Korn, some Wimp Bizkit, some Symphony X.

937
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:40,680
That is ill.

938
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,360
That is seriously the soundtrack of the summer.

939
00:55:43,360 --> 00:55:44,360
That is ballin' folks.

940
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,360
Some Five Finger Death Punch, some Green Day.

941
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,360
Oh wow.

942
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:47,360
Damn, Green Day.

943
00:55:47,360 --> 00:55:48,360
Some Jonathan Colton.

944
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,360
Green Day.

945
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:54,160
hell yeah dude. One Jonathan Coulton song still alive. We're going on the, we're

946
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,680
going on the, got some fallout boy. They might be giants. Disturbed. What's it

947
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,160
called the cruise ship they do? Oh my god I would love to. We're doing that. That's

948
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:09,600
funny that they do a cruise ship. That have cardiacs on it. Yeah they do a cruise, we should do a cruise ship. All American

949
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,120
rejects, we should do a cruise ship. That is a genius idea. Let's do it. I feel like.

950
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,280
Do you think we could hop along on some cruise ship tour? What do you mean? Hop

951
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,480
hop along. I feel like our audience doesn't overlap with hop along. Yeah, I

952
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:27,920
don't think so. We could do a personal cruise ship trip. We could do yeah, a

953
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,200
cruise ship. It's like a small, just a small boat. I don't think so. I think I

954
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:36,240
would hate it. When my parents first got divorced, my dad was like, "Merry Christmas, we're going on a

955
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:40,480
cruise ship," and it was the worst. It was one of the worst week or weekend. Yeah, I

956
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,320
think I would absolutely hate being on a cruise ship. Yeah, it was really, really

957
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:49,440
I wasn't old enough to do any of the gambling. I was vegan so I had to eat the worst

958
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,680
I'd eat just salad the entire time. I couldn't smoke a cigarette.

959
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:55,680
Isn't it just for like weird people to fuck in the water?

960
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,180
Yeah.

961
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:56,680
Huh?

962
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,680
Isn't it just for oldies?

963
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,680
It's for swingers. Every cruise ship is for old swingers.

964
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,680
No, the bedrooms are too small for that.

965
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,680
No, that's not true.

966
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,680
We had four bunk beds that were like...

967
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:08,680
Yeah, you had four bunk beds because you were a kid.

968
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,680
No, we had like, me, my dad, my brothers.

969
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:15,320
dad my brother's yeah I don't think your dad was paying for the swingers package

970
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:20,100
well he was doing it though but we only had four bunk beds your dad was swinging

971
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:25,640
single swinger one man swinging team was jacking off in the same room as you on

972
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:34,760
to a woman and her brother that's a true story I think that's how crazy Jamaica

973
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:41,620
America is that's a true story. Yep, my dad jacked off on a woman and her brother

974
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:47,560
and we'll just say yeah me too. I was there he jacked off on to me okay and my

975
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:51,200
two brothers. My girlfriend's watching this video series of this Australian

976
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:54,240
family who just goes on a bunch of cruise ships and it makes videos of like

977
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:59,040
this cruise ship is amazing and it's they always it's fun. Just the thing I

978
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:02,440
you always see on cruise ship is the big water slide that goes all around the

979
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:06,280
like top of the ship. I think it'd be so funny if they like installed it wrong

980
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:09,360
and this everybody like just the first day everybody gets in the water so they

981
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:11,360
all just shoot off the side of the ship.

982
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,520
They just launch into the ocean. See we did. They just lose half the passengers

983
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:18,600
immediately. I remember when my dad showed us the video for the cruise ship.

984
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:24,040
It was like the video was like he just a video he found on YouTube of like a

985
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:27,440
trailer for a cruise ship and he was like look at this and there's people doing

986
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,440
like this the like surf surfboard simulator and stuff. Yeah, yeah. It was

987
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:35,680
like a thing. There wasn't even a pool on this cruise. It was it was a top deck

988
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:40,000
that had like a shuffleboard and that was about it. I would get terrified that

989
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,640
the cruise ship would leave me behind on stops like I already get scared of that

990
00:58:43,640 --> 00:58:47,000
when I'm going on the bus from like Boston, New York. I get in Burger King

991
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,300
and I'm there for one minute. I can see the bus yeah, but if they're letting me

992
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,500
off in Italy and I'm going to like I'm climbing a mountain and eating at a

993
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:58,360
restaurant. Yeah, you have a lot of big plans. Well, we don't have so many big

994
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,380
playing climbing a mountain eating at a restaurant and then I have to like I'm

995
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:06,280
starting a company and opening my factory. I'm worried that they might leave

996
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,880
me behind too much stuff you're gonna miss your cruise. I might be too far

997
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,680
exactly I might miss it and I'm afraid of that and it's like I mean I have to

998
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:18,080
train these employees. Don't go there then. I have to there's a lot of

999
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,980
fabrication and like machines I have to assemble. You have enough money if you're

1000
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,480
opening a factory. I don't have enough money because I spent it all on the

1001
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,680
cruise ship. You bought the cruise ship or the the the ticket was really expensive

1002
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,280
and the only way building a factory and hiring employees. Well, I offset the cost

1003
00:59:34,280 --> 00:59:39,580
of the of the factory by selling my room on the cruise ship. That was funny when

1004
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:44,580
like pandemic first started and like we all over factories. Everybody opened up a

1005
00:59:44,580 --> 00:59:48,680
factory. Remember we all had to shut our factories down. Yeah, my god, the fact is

1006
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,980
for a couple weeks and then you know it started right back up. You guys remember

1007
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:52,980
this

1008
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:56,160
seems like almost at the beginning of the covid pandemic that a lot of people are actually

1009
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:57,400
making sourdough bread yeah

1010
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:03,500
yeah the pandemic first i was and meanwhile at the beginning of covid to each other that

1011
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:09,580
was cool beginning of the um of the pandemic i was making sour doo doo in my head bad thoughts

1012
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:14,700
i was making it in the toilet yeah that too the head oh the head like the toilet on that

1013
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,500
sound cool go back to the cruise ship you can we're doing kind of like dense references

1014
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:24,660
to the loopback. Yeah it sounds interesting. It sounds like there's an effect. So in the

1015
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:31,380
end. Okay. It doesn't even matter. It doesn't even matter. There's been a guy going around

1016
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:36,260
Maria Hernandez Park with a big Puerto Rican flag speaker and he's just blasting Lincoln

1017
01:00:36,260 --> 01:00:39,700
Park. It's been so sick. Good taste. That's dope. I'll go there just to listen for free.

1018
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:44,500
Yeah. It's cheaper than a title subscription. Yep. Yep. And you know what's cheaper than

1019
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:50,620
a title subscription tickets to our shows in the Pacific Northwest which actually has a

1020
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:51,620
lot of big shows.

1021
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:52,620

Adrian Brody will be at our Portland show.

1030
01:01:02,980 --> 01:01:04,140
That's just the truth.

1031
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:07,780
We have so many insane things that we're doing before the end of the year.

1032
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,020
This is probably going to be the last time we're going to be doing any kind of tour show

1033
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:12,320
for a while.

1034
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,020
So just come on out, man.
