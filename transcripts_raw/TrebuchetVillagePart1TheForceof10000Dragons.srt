[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Once upon a time, on the planet Ebon,

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
long before Gun City and the arrival of Earthlings,

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
before the Tamagotchis and the Crayolas,

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Before the void and the cataclysm, there was a great war between the police, the ultimate

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:46,840
good, the light of the universe, the saints of decency, joy, and love, and the terrifier,

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,400
an ancient evil, unknowable and untraceable, the thing that goes bump and grind in the

8
00:00:53,400 --> 00:01:00,680
night and bump and grind in the day. The war lasted almost a day, but everyone's tummies

9
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,360
started to hurt, so it really needed to end so people could go home and watch TV. And the

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:16,840
terrifier won. Elves, men, dwarves, gnomes, all manner of mortal creatures of decent disposition

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:23,160
were forced into slavery, or killed, or eaten, or all three.

12
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,360
But just as quickly as the Terrifier won, he vanished, presumably to terrify some other

13
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,600
suckers.

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,600
In his stead, he left the Terrifier's kingdom to his Gnars.

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:42,840
Furry monsters with a gnarled underbite, bulging yellow eyes, a bat's nose, six legs like a

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:50,040
mutated tripod with talons on the ends, two arms, and a penis that acts as a scorpion tail

17
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,240
that whispers dark thoughts into their weird little ears.

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,440
They did their best to rule over the orcs, goblinoids, and other nasty creatures who could

19
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,560
finally live the brutal, bloodied life of their dreams.

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,360
For years, however, these nards battled one another for supremacy as they always did,

21
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,560
killed one another, drank, fought, started wars, enslaved the conquered, and did it all over again.

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,840
Eventually, even some of the unruliest of Nards grew tired of the ceaseless fighting.

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,680
But it was all they knew. The Terrifyer made all these horrendous monsters to do one thing,

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,000
terrify. But without their leader, they were aimless, self-destructive, and soon possessed

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,440
by the worst of things, ennui. They began to turn to literature, of how things once were,

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:43,120
but none of them could read. They cautiously approached their learned slaves, and asked

27
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:50,560
them for guidance. "We want to be normal," said King Nardwaur. "We want to not kill each other.

28
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:57,280
We want to use soap and be nice. We want to see if plumbing would be good for us. If not, just

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,040
Maybe pick a place to shit, rather than just wherever we're standing."

30
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:09,600
"And I want to sing!" said one Nard. "Shut up!" And King Nardwar swallowed this Nard whole,

31
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:16,560
and slapped his belly and said, "Ooh, you betcha." Then, possessed by lucidity, he said, "See? That's

32
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,840
not how we should solve problems. I have eaten too many guys. I don't wanna eat guys." And so,

33
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,200
Over time the slaves were freed. Elves, humans, dwarves and the like were able to live amongst

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,800
the Nards to help show them how to be regular. This did not sit well with all the Nards or other

35
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:42,480
denizens of the Terrifier Kingdom, but so the threat of a greater war looms.

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,000
One of the cornerstones of this growing trend of teaching Nards how to be regular

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,760
was adventuring. Adventurers from far and wide scoured the kingdom for lost treasures of being

38
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,080
normal or a free community still under the tyrannical rule of slavers.

39
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,840
They sought ancient magics, fought dark wizards, and befriended beasts that lurked beneath the

40
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,800
planet and ruled its skies.

41
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,820
Such adventurers were few and far between.

42
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,520
But there were three such intrepid fellows, nestled into the armpit of the kingdom.

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:19,360
A small village that rests outside of King Nardwuar's Claw Castle that's shaped like

44
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,840
a claw.

45
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,960
Trebuchet Village.

46
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,080
Trebuchet Village is a bleak and vile little place filled with nasty peasants and monsters

47
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:31,280
and evil magic and a remarkable, peerless cruelty extended towards anyone unfortunate enough

48
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,200
to live in the damn place.

49
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,900
The stench of death and shit hung low and heavy, followed by the stench of foot, then the stench

50
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,080
of death, then the stench of shit and death again, rounding it out.

51
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,720
The town has all the trappings of a real place though, including a lovely little general store

52
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,520
run by ye old Sullivan the Frog.

53
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,260
This trebuchet village is first in hundreds of years, and it gets robbed only bi-weekly

54
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,680
by orcs, nards, and the like.

55
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,580
To run such a general store and protect it, ye olde Sullivan hired three expert retail

56
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:08,560
sales associates, each of whom, unbeknownst to the other, moonlight as adventurers themselves.

57
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,080
Who are these three adventurers?

58
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,480
Well that's enough out of me, at this point I'll let them speak for themselves.

59
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,640
So, who are each of you?

60
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Let's start with you, Dogen.

61
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:27,040
Hello, everyone.

62
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,340
My name is Dogen the Dirt Goblin.

63
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,240
My whole life I've loved dirt.

64
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,940
I was born as an orphan with no mother or father

65
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,840
and I grew up on my own dirt farm,

66
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,340
tending to my crops and selling dirt at the local farmer's market.

67
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,840
It was a boring but fulfilling life and one filled with dirt.

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,040
One day though, I was struck with a vision.

69
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:48,340
I walked out to my fields and saw a burning dirt bush.

70
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,260
A voice boomed forth from it.

71
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,020
"What's up?" it said.

72
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,500
This was the voice of Dogen the Dirt God, my namesake.

73
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,380
I swore devotion to him immediately and became a paladin,

74
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,180
a bold warrior spreading the gospel of dirt.

75
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,860
I left my dirt farm under the care

76
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,600
of my adoptive little brother, Dogen the Dirt Kobold,

77
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,060
and moved to Trebuchet Village,

78
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,260
where I took the first open room I found on Craigs Scroll.

79
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:12,420
This room happened to be the cramped basement

80
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,660
of a minotaur hype house,

81
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,620
which has led to a lot of comedic and silly,

82
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,980
almost Animal House-esque situations

83
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:20,020
that maybe could be explored in the future,

84
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,420
but also could just be left alone.

85
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,100
By day, I work at Ye Olde Sullivan's General Store,

86
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,580
where I sweep dirt onto the floor from outside.

87
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,860
My boss is awesome.

88
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,060
He is so nice, and I respect him deeply

89
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,960
because he has years and years more experience than me.

90
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,100
I can't see that ever changing.

91
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,900
By night, I'm a daring adventurer,

92
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,320
striking the fear of dirt into the hearts of monsters

93
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,380
with my trusty shovel,

94
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,660
which is named Dogen the Dirt Shovel.

95
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,180
By the time between day and night,

96
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,540
I sleep or something, I guess.

97
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,540
Thank you, Dogen.

98
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,180
Yeah, right now, are you just sweeping dirt then in the general store?

99
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,660
Yeah, I'm sweeping dirt, but I'm also not satisfied with how much dirt I'm bringing in.

100
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,580
So I'm also like picking up dirt and putting it in my pockets and sprinkling it around

101
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,580
the floor too.

102
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
Yes.

103
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:09,700
And you are a paladin, a level one paladin for folks who that's important for them.

104
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,260
And it's just some of them, right?

105
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,260
You wield a war hammer.

106
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,260
It's a shovel.

107
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,260
Yeah, it's a shovel.

108
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,260
It's a war shovel.

109
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:39,260
It's a war shovel. I apologize. Right. You're yeah and you have a one other item. That's pretty interesting, which is a pouch of forever dirt. We don't have to get into that now if you don't want to but it's pretty pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah. It's your secret. I apologize then for even saying anything.

110
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:47,060
Yeah, it's a now we'll we'll sort of look over in the store in the in general general store.

111
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Maybe hanging out by the dougla burgers deli counter is a Patrick you dark.

112
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,660
Patrick Patrick you dark Patrick you dark.

113
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:14,660
What's up? Hi, how's it going? My name is Patrick Yodar. I'm the nephew of Trunchbull Yodar, one of the most famous explorers in all of Trebuchet Village.

114
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:23,660
And I am riding that out until I eventually die. How do people get famous in these times? I actually have no idea.

115
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:28,020
I have no idea how somebody becomes famous nowadays.

116
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,340
Basically you just walk up to somebody and say something like, "Hey, I'm a famous guy."

117
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
And they believe you?

118
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:37,060
I really have no idea.

119
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:41,060
I've seen Uncle Trunchbull do that a few times and it's worked.

120
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,260
I mean really there is no way for you to prove whether or not somebody is famous in these

121
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,580
times.

122
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:54,900
My uncle could just be taking credit for some other verdan, and I would be none the wiser,

123
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,900
honestly.

124
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,700
I live a pretty lavish life in the shadow of my uncle, and it's taught me one very important

125
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,900
life skill, and it's shoplifting.

126
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,780
God damn, god damn do I love shoplifting.

127
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,660
Oh man, you know, I could walk into any shop in Trebuchet Village and just say, "Hey, I'm

128
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,140
Trunchbull Yodar's nephew," and they would at least give me a free fruit or something.

129
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,340
but uh...

130
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,820
no i think it's funny to shoplift

131
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:23,020
that's my thing it's awesome

132
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,620

absolutely absolutely huge balls very comical

135
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,940

i've been working at Sullivan's General Store because uh... i think it's funny

138
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:45,140

139
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,400

uh... we have to hear of her dan uh... river ever done actually

146
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,960
don't know that technical media the pronunciation of that here

147
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:16,280
They are a goblinoid race.

148
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:22,920
I think they're in Acquisitions Incorporated,

149
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,280
is the source book they're from.

150
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:29,240
So I don't know if that's, I don't know much about

151
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,120
Acquisitions Incorporated, but it's a cool looking race.

152
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,200
They're sort of like smart, inquisitive goblins.

153
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,880
And yeah, they also have,

154
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,840
What's interesting is they have a weird growth spurt that they go through at some point. So

155
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:51,880
they start goblin-sized and then grow bigger when they're going through puberty or something.

156
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah. And so you're hanging out by Doug LaBerger's deli counter. Is he serving you up a flesh burger?

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,920
Hey, Doug, how about you just slide me one of those burgers right there?

158
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, no problem, Patrick.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,240
Oh, great. You're one of the best guys that works here. I absolutely love you. You're one of the-

160
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,000
I mean, no, I love you too.

161
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You're one of my favorite employees here.

162
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,680

He sort of like laughs to himself and like shuts down the conversation.

176
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,360
Don't you just love it? Don't you just love it when you're playing?

195
00:12:55,140 --> 00:13:02,300
Better than a beaver that's a cheater better would then a threesome with a cheetah better than a pizza on a pita

196
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,300
That's why they call me Steve

197
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:11,160
Or or evil. I'm a hill dwarf cleric. I'll use my magic to deceive you

198
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,740

Evil Steve all is a cleric an evil cleric of the death domain. Yep

205
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:51,260
So death domain is pretty cool. They have sort of take and invert the life domain

206
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:56,780
Yeah, all right. They do necrotic damage. They don't really do too much healing. It's sort of a

207
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,520
damaged healing cleric type

208
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,060
And yeah, he's a dwarf a hill dwarf. So it's pretty cool

209
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,620
So, what do you what do you what do you do in the store evil Steve? Like what's sort of your I knocked the cans off

211
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:18,820
Yo Sullivan pick these up man

212
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,700
Sullivan I think I think yeah, I think some of them are broken. I think you might have to put that in the inventory

213
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,060
You don't do it now. I'm knocking more cans over

214
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:31,380
You don't want it. You don't want to see this guy knock any more cans

215
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,180
I mean, it's just one of the only three guys in the town who won't just try to eat me

216
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:44,660
So there go the fried beans, please stop. Okay. Oh, no. Oh, I think that was the one and I respect so deeply

217
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,780

And I'm out.

220
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,200
There are actually seven aisles in Sullivan's Deli store.

221
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,200
[Laughter]

222
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:19,200
Produce, flesh, tools, alcohol, alcohol, and knick-knacks, and then Doug LaBurger Deli Fresh.

223
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,200
Which I guess isn't an aisle, but more of a station.

224
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:28,200
So yeah, you guys are sort of, it's sort of towards the end of the day.

225
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:33,200
You know, you're kind of eager, all of you are eager to get out for a couple of reasons, which we'll get into.

226
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:41,200
But one of which is today's a big day in the kingdom of the terrifier.

227
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:56,200
It is the murder celebration because the prince, Prince Jumanji, is turning five, which is the age of murder.

228
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:08,740
So you're all eager to get out and there's festivities but also each of you have sort of a job to do with the festivities which will get into but before you can do that and while solving is sort of a.

229
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:21,400
Try to stack the shelves stack the cans back up but evil steve was just a few inches taller than him so he just able to like sort of like stuff it in his face like that.

230
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:26,440
he doesn't like it. No. I can tell. I can tell looking over here that he does not like it.

231
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,400
There's something about you, Patrick Yodar, is just just so serving. I have to say.

looking at you like expecting you to say something good the

283
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:41,860
the bigger, dumber one goes, "What?"

284
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,780
What do you want?

No. Hey look, there's a little bit more room in the front. I think I can get one or two of you

288
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,340
right here and then I think around the back.

289
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,220
Roll up, roll up.

290
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,820
Are Grimlocks tall or are they goblin size or how big are they?

291
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,620
They're like medium size, a little bigger.

292
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:19,300
if

293
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,500
Come on now, come on now, why you gotta throw that at me?

294
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,260
Excuse me, gentlemen.

295
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,620
Nasty.

296
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,940
When you guys came in here looking to cause trouble,

297
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,740
it seems you may have already caused a little bit

298
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,540
of trouble with me without even realizing it.

299
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,860
Did you notice that beautiful pile of dirt

300
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,780
that you just knocked out of the way?

301
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,380
I'm gonna need you guys to go back outside,

302
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,260
take some trowels, and put that back to how it was before,

303
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,540
'cause I will not be having this.

304
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,460
You don't wanna mess with that guy's dirt.

305
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,820
Oh yeah, what you gonna do about it?

306
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,100
(mimics babbling)

307
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,260
- Hey, hey, come on, come on now.

308
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,100
Let's not use that language in here.

309
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,920
- What did he say, what did he say?

310
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,760
What did he say to me?

311
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,260
- Look, I'm not gonna repeat what he said, but--

312
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,640
- Okay, can you, all right, well,

313
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,480
write it down and tell me later.

314
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,180
- He says that your dad's fat.

315
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,780
And you see him shaking his head no and going,

316
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,620
(mimics babbling)

317
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,420
(laughing)

318
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,820
- Oh, come on, come on now.

319
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,580
You don't say that about any of our fathers.

320
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,540
- I don't have a dad.

321
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,060
I was born an orphan.

322
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,900
- Yeah, he doesn't have a dad.

323
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:14,720
- I said that, I said that.

324
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,980
Didn't you guys hear me monologuing that

325
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,700
while you were waiting outside?

326
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,420
No, we weren't listening.

327
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,180
I hit him with my shovel.

328
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,620
All right, roll initiative.

329
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,460
Four.

330
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,020
It's a bad start.

331
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,900
14.

332
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,860
It's a better start.

333
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,740
That's an intelligence saving throw.

334
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,400
Nope, that's wrong.

335
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,540
Initiative doesn't start with an I-N-T, I guess.

336
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:43,500
It's a walking speed, if you have it, yeah.

337
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,300
Nice, okay, cool.

338
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,600
All right, cool.

339
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:50,300
So yeah, uh, yeah, the battle, the battle's about to begin.

340
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,900
I'm going to position you guys to probably where you are at this point.

341
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,800
You offered him to sit on your balls.

342
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
So probably kind of closer.

343
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,900
I sat on his balls.

344
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,600
You sat on his ball.

345
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,900
So you're still on him and you're still on his balls.

346
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,300
So yes, you'll take three feet of your movement speed to get up.

347
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,900
Deep down are these damn balls.

348
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,300
Dude, I'm four feet tall.

349
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,300
There's no way.

350
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,600
I'm three foot eleven.

351
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,500
You're all really small.

352
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:19,900
Yeah.

353
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,100
Okay.

354
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:26,000
So first in the order is actually Patrick Yodar as the

355
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,300
goblin that they

356
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:31,100
is in front of you.

357
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:34,880
Look, I don't I don't I don't want to cause any problems, but

358
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,400
it seems like you already have caused some trouble.

359
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,900
So I'm going to have to get involved.

360
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Okay, is that all right with you?

361
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:45,300
I'm going to take that as a yes.

362
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,100
Okay, cool. What do you want to do?

363
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,500
Um, I'm just gonna... hold on.

364
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Um, yeah. So, you can go to your actions and just look at your actions.

365
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,600
It's under actions, okay.

366
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Yeah, that's gonna be the most helpful.

367
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:08,800
Um, I'm sitting on my balls and I pull out, I pull a bow and arrow out from my back.

368
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,300
My back pack.

369
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:16,800
I'm like alright well let me hold on okay there we go and I have the arrow in there.

370
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Alright I'm gonna shoot you with this.

371
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,800
Okay roll the hit.

372
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,800
Nine.

373
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:28,300
Nine yeah it's just like you shoot it, it just like sails past him.

374
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,300
Ah Christ, Sullivan look out.

375
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:35,800
Sullivan ducks underneath.

376
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,300
Um, uh, and, uh, it's like, "Please! There's a whole fighting!"

377
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,500
There's a tip jar on the counter of, like, doubloons or whatever the fuck the money is.

378
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
-Yeah. -And I just destroyed it.

379
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
[laughter]

380
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:52,000
Uh, and it is now your turn, Evil Stevel.

381
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,300
Alright, I'm going to cast Chill Touch.

382
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,300
-Mmm. -Can I do that?

383
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
-Yeah, you can. -Yes!

384
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:12,020
Okay, cool. So with with a chill touch, you have to get in touch range. So you get up and you walk towards Oh, wait, actually, no, I forgot. Wait, chill touch.

385
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:16,340
Do I have a ghost hand? It's a ghost hand. I forgot. Yeah, actually, I would describe chill touch.

386
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:28,980
So I create a ghost hand made of probably bones and blue, blue. It gets it gets a I can touch somebody with it. Yes, it does damage

387
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,120
the blue blue ghost and sort of like source for which one which one of them

388
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,760

389
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,060
my right hand

390
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,960
yet and uh...

391
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,600

the okay so one is going to be a good idea just a lot of your going in your

395
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,120
mouth

396
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,360
and uh... i felt a small like a little bit of cold in a uh... yeah that's what

397
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,960
i call it chill touching funny and a and that these things are gonna shrink

398
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,340
and that i was getting a member of the that i don't think they'll ever shrink

399
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:03,320
and that thirteen is enough to hit

400
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,000
and so you uh...

401
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,520
uh... you dislike

402
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,380
hit this guy for eight damage

403
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,380
and uh... he's just like

404
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:16,280
it goes into his mouth it was a little bit

405
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,580
now we've got something

406
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:19,820
they treats it like a pacifier

407
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:25,360
but it's just like hurting him really bad no home can i take his voters to

408
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
You do that, you get like a pinky in there.

409
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,260
Make him eat his own boogers.

410
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,460
Oh, God, that's got to be some other kind of damage, right?

411
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:35,060
Yeah. Yeah. No, he Grimlocks love love boogers.

412
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,660
I take him back out of his damn mouth.

413
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,660
Do you think he's like upset?

414
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,960
Now it's going to be the Grimlocks turn.

415
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,160
So that one who you did the chill touch to he's going to sort of like lumber over to you too.

416
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:53,360
And he's going to try to swing at you Patrick Yodar.

417
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,640
which let's see how he do it that uh... who i have the new encounter thing

418
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,240
we're going to have a new encounter thing

419
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,600
so let's see how this goes

420
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,760
was that work

421
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,360
it does work okay

422
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,320
is a fourteen hit patrick

423
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,120
well come on now

424
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,000
it does

425
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,840
why did you

426
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,320
well you know he doesn't know what that question means come on to be a c

427
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,800
it's a way you can ask patrick for the first time does a fourteen what is your

428
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,280
armor class. Oh sorry. Yeah, what's your armor class? My armor class is 14. Okay, so it does

429
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:32,480
beat you because the way it works in this is, it's when you meet it, you got it. That's

430
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,520
the saying. Simple as that. Yep. When you meet it, you got it. Hey, when you got it,

431
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:43,160
you get it. Yep. When the number's there, the number's where. You got it good. Yeah,

432
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:50,240
and so it does, he does like two damage to you. These guys are pretty weak. They're weaker

433
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:57,240
and

434
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,340
and just like bounces in on one of your balls.

435
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,040
So I do.

436
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,140
So you take two HP.

437
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,440
Yeah, you're down to HP.

438
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,140
This other one is going to go for you Dogen.

439
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,120
He's like, let's see how tough you are because you want a

440
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,340
piece of me, huh?

441
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:14,340
Yeah, you were going to swing that shovel at me.

442
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,640
Huh?

443
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,640
You want a piece of this?

444
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,140
You want it?

445
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,040
You're going to swing that.

446
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,540
Hey, I can barely see.

447
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:23,940
And he's going to try to attack you.

448
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,620
Does the 12 hit probably not no you're paladin, right? Yeah, so he tries to attack you with his club

449
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:33,420
And you just like you're a little goblin

00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,780
You just like fucking like do some matrix shit off the aisle like just like kicking back and forth

451
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,660
And you're knocking over different products and so i was like no

454
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,620
And uh now the other one's gonna go and he's just gonna sort of move

455
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,940
towards uh

and

460
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,260
now when you get this

461
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:11,500
uh... he hits this year twenty one you may have to uh... this is just no way

462
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500

uh... this

467
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,140
you know i think that i think that i i mean the uh... the damage reverberated

468
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,340
through his body and i felt it my ball

469
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,220
the

470
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,240
and

471
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,540
the year just a bit of a bit of a bit of a bit it felt uh...

472
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,340
felt okay

473
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,940
yeah

474
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,860
this is the

475
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:36,780
here

476
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,580
it is now dole did

477
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,980
your turn

478
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,860
that's right

479
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,020
uh... i'm just gonna stand and i'm gonna hit this grimoire with my shovel

480
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,780

481
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
Sixteen. Oh that hits.

482
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:53,560
So is the top damage for one handed and the bottom damage is for two handed?

483
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,360
Mm-hmm.

484
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,100
Okay, I'm using a two handed.

485
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,100
Yeah, do it.

486
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,460
Wait, oh I do it over here.

487
00:28:59,460 --> 00:28:59,960
Yeah.

488
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,200
It's confusing.

489
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,700
Three.

490
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,200
Yeah.

491
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,200
That's not how that does it.

492
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,940
No, I don't, I reject that.

493
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,640
I reject the way they do this.

494
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,940
So we'll take the, the, the, uh, we'll take the, yeah, no, I, that's ridiculous.

495
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,680
I'm very confused by this.

496
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,180
Because what it's-

497
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,180
It's a nine, it's a ten.

498
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,380
Yeah, no, no.

499
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:22,580
What we should do is take the the yeah,

500
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:24,980
let's take the five and have the two.

501
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,880
Yeah, let's take the seven because that's that makes more sense to me.

502
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,780
So yeah, you just like whack this guy in the head with the shovels.

503
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,680
You dodge off him off the like aisle walls and then just like

504
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,080
punk just like bonk him on the head with the shovel like shovel night

505
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,480
and just you see him like he's like reverberate like vibrating through

506
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,780
his body like a cartoon.

507
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,180
You will respect dirt.

508
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,480
Bye.

509
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,880
Like he's trying to like talk and it's back to the top of

510
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,380
the order.

511
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,680
So it's your turn Patrick.

512
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,280
Yodar.

513
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,480
All right.

514
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,280
Well, I'm a little bit upset at your actions from earlier

515
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:07,880
and it looks like you're close enough.

516
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,080
You're close enough now for me to use my to poke you with

517
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,880
my long sword.

518
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,480
I'm going to see.

519
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,480
I'm going to see if I can do that.

520
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,840
and let's see

521
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,880

00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,540
He's like, "Ohhhhhhhhh!"

569
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:32,980
Yeah, you're probably dead now, huh? If we waited a couple hours, you'd be so dead.

570
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:39,020
Yeah, and also everyone, we are using new character sheets.

571
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:44,500
That's why they're having a little bit of trouble right now.

572
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:51,100
Without no other reason. And it is now that guy's turn, and he's like,

573
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,660
He's gonna try to attack you

574
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,660
Again with his club. He is not very inventive

575
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,620

00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:07,860
He just sort of like tries to wind up to attack, but he misjudges a distance

578
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:13,320
So he just sort of attacks behind you with the club and bumps his stomach into your face

579
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,780
Got blood on my damn face. Oh

They actually taste quite good!

615
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,720
And he dies.

616
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,920
Look at that, he died learning something about himself.

617
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,680

00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680

00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,400
Yeah, opens the door for him, pats him on the back.

630
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:31,600
Yeah, but as it pats him on the back, what goes through your ghostly hand is a bow expertly

631
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:34,500
aimed at this guy's lung.

632
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,500
And he's like, "Urgh!"

633
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:38,760
And he just fucking falls and collapses on the ground.

634
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:42,040
See, that is one of the best feelings in the world.

635
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,320
When you set out to do something and you hit your target, that is just amazing.

636
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,240
I love that.

637

yourselves in a fight. You guys have seen your fair number of fights here, but

644
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,760

673
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,680
Very important age.

674
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,600
He's going to do his first kill today, allegedly.

675
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,080
It's a very big deal when you do your first kill as a Nard.

676
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:14,400
However, something that you would know, but only you would know, Dogen, because you are

677
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:23,380
a paladin hired by one of the warlords under King Nardwuar to protect the ceremony, is because

678
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,840
King Nardwuar is doing some changes to the murder ceremony, because he's trying to show

679
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:33,540
good faith to this idea of "we want to try to be normal."

680
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:40,500
And so he wants to hire a group of paladins that serve many different faiths, you know,

681
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,420
different values, you know, he sort of sees them all as just sort of pussy goody goodies,

682
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:48,060
you know, like he's just like, Oh, these guys are protectors.

683
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,580
They're basically dogs.

684
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,240
I'll hire them all for this affair.

685
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:57,380
And he's hiring extra security though, because you know that he's changing some of the ceremony.

686
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,900
You spend some time with this group of paladins now like some nights and some weekends with

687
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:14,580
them

688
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:26,960
the

689
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:36,960
Dan

690
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,200
is just your race doesn't mean you're you're like faction doesn't mean you're

691
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,680
a cat well because terrifier the terrifiers means like your character is

692
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,120
lame and like we'll die it's not like the terrifier kingdom the terrifier

693
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:59,240
kingdom looks at any elves humans etc as people that the terrifier beat and so

694
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:03,040
they're called scaredy cats where if you're something that the terrifier

695
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,440
didn't beat and serve the terrifier in the great war.

696
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,440
Okay.

697
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,660
In the past, they're called terrifier born.

698
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,240
So you're not, you're not scared.

699
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,800
Don't you don't have to worry about it.

700
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,520
You got damn right.

701
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,440
So and you see that the you're terrifier born though, Dogen.

702
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,440
So a lot of the paladins aren't there.

703
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,460
A lot of them are guys who came back into the paladin fold after they were freed as

704
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,460
being slaves.

705
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,440
So they're not too crazy about you.

706
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:37,560
But the head of the paladins has taken a liking to you, and yesterday he came up to you on

707
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:43,160
your final run-through of protection, and he said, "Howdy doody!

708
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,480
How you goin', bucko?

709
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,160
I've got a task for you, a special job.

710
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,360
Come over here, I need to tell you as an honorable paladin what you have to do.

711
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,360
It's very, it's very, a very secretive task, please.

712
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:03,280
And he's trying to lead you away from the other paladins who kind of like all glare at you

713
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,280
a little bit.

714
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:07,320
Yeah, I give them a middle finger as I'm walking away.

715
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Yeah.

716
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,320
And there you see one of them like spit on the ground.

717
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:14,080
No, you fucking spit on dirt.

718
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,600
And you see one of them like, oh, like just like look at you confused like that sort of

719
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,840
changed the tenor of the fight.

720
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:27,700
So the paladin says, "So, so, uh, uh, I, uh, the task for you is that you will guard the

721
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,200
young Jumanji himself.

722
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,320
See, the king has taken a liking to you because you're a terrifier born and he loves that

723
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
stuff.

724
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,200
Oh, and, and, and he's a, he's a huge racist.

725
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,000
So, um, all you have to do is make sure nothing happens to the boy during the ceremony.

726
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,000
All right?

727
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,280
It's an easy task, I think.

728
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:49,800
After all, if anyone ever did anything to Jumanji, they'd have to deal with the entire kingdom.

729
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,740
So who would want that?

730
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,740
So are you up for the task?

731
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:56,000
I promise there's a huge reward in it for you.

732
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,520
A worthy award of a paladin.

733
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:02,200
And besides me getting my balls, not getting my balls chopped off.

734
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,000
So if you refuse.

735
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,640
You are or you aren't?

736
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:09,480
I sort of stumbled there.

737
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,920
So you, you, well I'll do it.

738
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:13,920
Okay good.

739
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,080
I'm just unclear on the balls part of it.

740
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,800
My balls will get chopped off if you don't do it.

741
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,360
that's bad. Yeah. Alright. Okay. Yes.

742
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:31,040
So, you'll do it. You'll do it. You'll do it. What? Yeah. Yeah.

743
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,240
Yeah. I said, yeah. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Standing there and

744
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,560
sitting there for like 10 seconds. So, you agreed to do

745
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,840
this and so now, you're returning back to the summit

746
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:52,560
tonight to complete the job and to watch over the boy and we'll get to that in a second.

747
00:43:52,560 --> 00:44:00,800
Patrick Ciodar, after work you headed over to the orphanage for old guys, which is actually

748
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:07,080
just a front for Sticky Fingers Joint, the premier thieves guild in Trebuchet Village.

749
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:12,200
All the old guys at the orphanage are just thieves, they're not orphans.

750
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,840
So earlier this week you went to one of Sticky Fingers' after hours hang sessions, right?

751
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,320
So it's another flashback here, where everyone traded stories about their latest exploits

752
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,800
in thievery or just general roguish behavior.

753
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,200
Sticky Fingers of course provides the biggest and best stories the gang plays games together.

754
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,760
One is Rachel Chess, just a version of chess that was made by someone named Rachel.

755
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,760
There's a few classic card games like Dusty Gomer and Wave Race 64.

756
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:49,760
Patrick, you've been playing, you were playing that night Wave Race 64 on a team with Sticky Fingers, which is pretty cool.

757
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
Sticky Fingers kind of likes you.

758
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,760
And it's a 2v2 trick-taking game where the goal is to advance gold pieces you bet.

759
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,760
So you pick them out you want to bet, and you have to advance them across the river by taking tricks in the suit you're assigned.

760
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:16,760
So you had diamonds, Sticky Fingers had spades, and you guys had bet a certain amount and you're trying to do this sort of trick-taking game where it's like, "Oh, that's a spade, I'll try to make sure Sticky Fingers gets it, but maybe I'll get it just in case to build up my side deck."

761
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:29,760
It's a very fun game. And whoever advances all their gold pieces across to the river gets everything that's over there, plus 64% of the opposing team's stash that they didn't bet.

762
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,760
So that's the uh, the 64.

763
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,760
Um, now worth noting here is that you're in a thieves guild.

764
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:40,760
So, everyone's twirling their mustaches, they're making sneaky gestures.

765
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:44,760
Cheating is always fair, as long as you don't get caught.

766
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,760
So, we're in the midst of the game.

767
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,760
Uh, you see Sticky Fingers, and he's a gnome, he's a little gnome.

768
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,760
And he's like, he's like, "You ready for this Patrick?"

769
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:56,760
He's a scaredy cat born?

770
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:00,280
I'm scared cat. We're gonna wipe the floor with these guys

771
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:04,440
We're gonna crush him yeah, absolutely absolutely

772
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:08,880
I mean I have a few as they say tricks up my sleeve hey

773
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:11,980
Keep him up there, but then don't keep him up there

774
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,720
Them I was gonna show you I was gonna show you the the cards that I had

775
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,780
Hidden you know in the pockets of my school look nobody can hear me nobody can hear me right now

776
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:25,900
now. I'm actually whispering this is just how uh...

777
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,620
This is just how you give just the right general frequency. Yeah, this is I just uh...

778
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:34,060
even when I'm whispering I talk like this. Of course.

779
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:38,860
Yeah, I have a few cards up my sleeve. I have a lot of uh...

780
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:43,220
I have a lot of them. I have very big sleeves. Yeah, your sleeves are incredible.

781
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:47,780
I love them. I could fit almost anything in these sleeves.

782
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:51,100
Except maybe your balls, right?

783
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,100
Come on now, that's why we're best friends.

784
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,100
Yeah, you know it.

785
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,100
Casual acquaintances or something. I have no idea.

786
00:46:57,100 --> 00:46:59,100
I mean our relationship is kind of

787
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,100
it's up in the air right now

788
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:03,100
but maybe we'll be better friends

789
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:05,100
at some point. Hey, who knows?

790
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,100
So we're gonna do three intelligence

791
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:09,100
contests between yourself

792
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,100
and the other team.

793
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:13,100
And of course,

794
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,100
you have an opportunity in between those checks

795
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,100
to do other means of trickery.

796
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:19,100
You know, charisma checks

797
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:43,100
It's

798
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:48,540
Picking up on all sticky finger signals. He's giving he's giving you when he shows two fingers sticking together than three

799
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,940
And then you know what that means under the table

800
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,580
He's doing like doing complex shit and you guys are crushing it. You guys have won three rounds already

801
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,180
And so that was one round left

802
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:00,180
You could do another intelligence check

803
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:05,100
19 I mean, yeah you won. Yeah, I mean you don't even need to do I was gonna say like

804
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,300
Oh, you want to try this trick?

805
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,420
You want to try this trick or you could try to do this?

806
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,280
No, you just like outplay them fucking purely outplay them

807
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,780
And they're just like, "Oh man, that's pretty good, Patrick. Gotta say."

808
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:22,280
Yep, that's the real nephew over there. That's the nephew of the great Trunchbull, you know.

809
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,780
Yeah, that's, uh, that is my uncle. That is his portrait on the wall over there.

810
00:48:26,780 --> 00:48:31,780
Mm-hmm. One of the finest members of Sticky Fingers Joint ever.

811
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:32,780
Mm-hmm.

812
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:37,780
Yep, that's actually him sitting under the portrait, too.

813
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,780
[laughter]

814
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:41,820
he's just so i think it's

815
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,300
it's not a good thing

816
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,260
the a_t_r_ and well you do it

817
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,900
you'll do it

818
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:49,700
well you know it

819
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:51,180
the airway

820
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:51,860
the

821
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:56,780
yet there is a simple well-spoken and i had a stand like this because it's

822
00:48:56,780 --> 00:49:01,060
c_n_n_ i get i get all of my head all of my weight from him

823
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:06,500
you can really hear the star power

824
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:07,880
well you know

825
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:11,580
i heard old cool dot dot i guess this is his voice

826
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,780
loops

827
00:49:12,780 --> 00:49:14,660
it's important to

828
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:15,500
the

829
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,820
he sold

831
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:24,380

I think I might keep working there.

852
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,520
I didn't know that about you.

853
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:31,520
That's interesting.

854
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,680
Yeah, it's fun to work with poor people.

855
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:36,040
Oh, well, heavens.

856
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,240
So as of Verdant, you have a unique capability.

You're terrifying.

00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,280
See, most of the guys here, we aren't.

Some of us are.

860
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,320
You know, your uncle is, but he's, you know, sort of passed his time.

861
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:51,920
And then we got Doo-Doo the Goblin, but you know, Doo-Doo.

862
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,920
Oh, I know.

863
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920

Well, I will hold on first of all

907
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:30,920
Why would we get sticky fingers joint on the map if we're supposed to be thieves and we're not used to time for prime time

908
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:38,360
The terrifier Kingdom is a mess. He's trying to appease us and appease other people. This is the time to strike

909
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:43,960
We can we can upset the whole power balance me and you you could be on my left hand and you know

911
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:55,740
I know about sticky fingers he holds up his right hand and it is a hook you got

912
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:06,560

hooker then I did something I shouldn't have done you stole her money yeah

914
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,960
That's right. Thank you for rescuing me from that.

915
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:22,640
Yeah, you know, she, you know, and I mean her job putting hooks in people's hands.

916
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:30,000
It's kind of like kind of ironic that it, uh, that was your fate.

917
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,240
Yeah, well, you know, I shouldn't have, uh, you shouldn't have stolen money from

918
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,600
a hooker. I shouldn't have stolen from a hooker, you know, and then, then, then,

919
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:39,600
Then she said, "Well, now you're gonna be a hooker."

920
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,600
And look at me now.

921
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
That is exactly what she said.

922
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,600
I'm a hooker.

923
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,600
[laughter]

924
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:49,600
Anyway, look.

925
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
I think if you kidnap this kid,

926
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:53,600
look, it's not gonna, we're not gonna do anything to him.

927
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,600
We're gonna kidnap him.

928
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
Just show our strength.

929
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:59,600
You know? Bring him back.

930
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:01,600
At this point, we'll have so many people flocking to Sticky Fingers Joint.

931
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,600
We could be our own, like a nation of thieves.

932
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,600
Imagine.

933
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:10,960

947
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,200
meanwhile

948
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,920
evil Steve'll

949
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,360
You arrive at the pool of blood that sits at the bottom of sin Gulch. I love this shit

950
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:44,440
You were here as you dip your toe in it into it

951
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:48,840
But once again you get sucked in appearing on the other side of this pool into a bizarre

952
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,200
labyrinth where the walls are made of flesh.

953
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:52,800
I hate this shit!

954
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,240
Filled with holes to fuck and things to suck.

955
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:59,400
You accidentally wandered in here the other day when you were looking for something evil

956
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,760
to do during your lunch break.

957
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:07,440
After wandering through the labyrinth for far longer than 15 minutes that you were allowed,

958
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:12,240
you stumbled onto a vast ceremonial room where a strange ritual was taking place, involving

959
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,880
bloody bald men fingering each other wherever there were holes.

960
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:18,880
ears, wounds, and even noses were getting plugged.

961
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,880
Not knowing exactly what to do, but sensing this was evil,

962
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,880
you joined in for a little bit.

963
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,880
Afterwards, they made you an honorary associate of the Pleasureman's Club.

964
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,880
And the dark priest Poonhead of the Trebuchet Village chapter

965
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,880
wished to assign you an evil task.

966
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:41,880
Poonhead is notable for not being covered in blood,

967
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,880
instead just being a half-elf with a vagina on his forehead.

968
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:53,480
forehead. You were excellent tonight at the ritual. Thank you I got a third hand.

969
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:57,960
That's that's what they're calling it now what you did back there the third

970
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:03,720
hand. No yeah I'm out with my with my chill touch hand. Oh that rest it was

971
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:10,240
pretty oh yes some people you know some girls like when you put like ice on the

972
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,240
You know that?

973
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,240
What?

974
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,240
No, never mind.

975
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:16,240
What the fuck are you talking about?

976
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,240
Anyway, girls?

977
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:19,240
Nah.

978
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,240
They're called maidens.

979
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,240
You ain't in this scene, dog.

980
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:33,240
You'd make a fine pleasure man, but your time is yet to come.

981
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,240
But this bodes well.

982
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,240
Come, follow me.

983
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,240
You said come?

984
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:39,240
Okay.

985
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:40,680

986
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,020

988
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,920

makes you useful though

996
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,720
you see

997
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:07,720
as pleasure men really show ourselves in public

998
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,720
We are too disfigured, aka bald and horny,

999
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:17,920
and we need to take precautions to ensure that a plan works.

1000
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,920
You see, as you know, in a couple days,

1001
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,320
it's going to be murder day.

1002
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:28,680
And what those imbecilic nards do not know

1003
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:33,480
is that their precious mountain, Mount Honest Doodle,

1004
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:35,460
where the ceremony will take place,

1005
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:41,060
is actually a volcano long dormant.

1006
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:48,060
We can't make it erupt, but we can deceive the foolish Nards into believing it has erupted

1007
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:52,900
and cause massive pain.

1008
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:58,540
So we need someone who can walk through the village undisturbed, take the secret path

1009
00:59:58,540 --> 01:00:04,100
underground up your button around the corner and lie in wait at the heart of

1010
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:10,180
the volcano once the murdering begins we will tell you through this device and

1011
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:17,820
he hands you sort of a stone and once what's a device we're in old times a

1012
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:24,820
A device isn't necessarily, you know, it could be used.

1013
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:26,820
Oh, this is a talking rock, okay.

1014
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:30,820
I've seen these before.

1015
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,820
A rocky talkie, dude.

1016
01:00:34,820 --> 01:00:36,820
That's right, a rocky talkie.

1017
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:44,820
Now, it will, I will communicate with you through that rocky talkie.

1018
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:53,980
And once I do, the scroll that I shall hand you now will reveal itself, and you will be

1019
01:00:53,980 --> 01:01:03,220
able to cast a very, very powerful spell that shall shoot lava through the dormant volcano,

1020
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:11,140
erupting the calcified core on top of it that is built over the years, making it seem like

1021
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:16,100
Like a lava flow is, you know, coming out, but it's magic.

1022
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:17,860
And then you will kill them.

1023
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:18,860
All of them.

1024
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,740
The Nards will die.

1025
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,540
The boy will die.

1026
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:29,740
In the time of the Pleasuremen, the true rightful place as rulers of the Terrifyer Kingdom.

1027
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,740
Goddamn.

1028
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,820
Got some blood in your throat?

1029
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:36,180
It's like the fourth time that's happened.

1030
01:01:36,180 --> 01:01:41,340
I took my allergy pills, but it just doesn't seem to fucking matter.

1031
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,500
It's like a fucking placebo.

1032
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,500
I'm a fucking...

1033
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:48,500
Alright.

1034
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,500
Um...

1035
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:54,500
If you do this for us, you shall be rewarded.

1036
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:56,500
Pleasurably.

1037
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,500
Incalculably.

1038
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,500
You shall be a lord unto yourself.

1039
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,500
You'll have whatever you desire.

1040
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,500
In the Pleasureman's kingdom.

1041
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:08,500
Do you wish to do this?

1042
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,500
Sure.

1043
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,500
Can I keep the Rocky Talkie when it's over?

1044
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,500
Absolutely. You'll get more than a Rocky Talkie once this is over.

1045
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:19,500
TWO ROCKY TALKIES?

1046
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,500
Now we're talking.

1047
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,500
And you've returned again.

1048
01:02:25,500 --> 01:02:30,500
And you return, and he gives you the scroll now.

1049
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:38,180
scrolls now sound that day and he says go up your button around the corner and you'll find

1050
01:02:38,180 --> 01:02:47,280

1054
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:09,740
Unless you got a pussy on your damn forehead. Oh yeah. It's gotta be hard. It sucks. Anyway,

1055
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:17,420
I'm gonna go blow up this volcano. You stay sexy. Okay. Hey, you stay sexy. Okay.

1056
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:23,420
And, uh, you know, we cut away from that. Uh, Lorne Poonhead returns to, uh, uh, or

1057
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:32,700
priest who had returns to worshipping his uh his uh king the discharge and uh we go to we're cutting

1058
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:40,060
backwards now in order patrick yoder you're back in the thieves guild and uh you see uh there's a

1059
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:46,700
little crew gathered uh one of them being uh your your friend sticky fingers he says okay patrick

1060
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:53,900
So, there's a goblin in the group, in the ceremony group, named Evan.

1061
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,020
He owes me a favor.

1062
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,980
Just say you're here to see Evan, he'll know what that means and he'll get you in with

1063
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:01,380
the in-crowd near the King and the Prince.

1064
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:05,340
But he doesn't know about the job, so don't tell him what it is, but we're just trying

1065
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:07,120
to get you in there, okay?

1066
01:04:07,120 --> 01:04:10,540
Is there anything I should tell him?

1067
01:04:10,540 --> 01:04:16,580
Just say, "I'm here to see Evan, he's a good friend."

1068
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:19,580
He'll know that that means I'm calling on his favor.

1069
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,460
And then if he doesn't, call it through.

1070
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:27,940
What if I just tell him that I'm here to kidnap a child, but I don't say which child?

1071
01:04:27,940 --> 01:04:30,340
Uh, well, that's fair.

1072
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:36,040
To some extent, a lot of nards overlook kidnapping, but I would really recommend you don't bring

1073
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:39,620
up the kidnapping as much as you can.

1074
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,380
What if I, okay, here, let me try this out on you real quick.

1075
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:48,500
What if I say, "I'm here to see Evan.

1076
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,060
He saw a kid napping."

1077
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:57,860
I-I-I-okay, I mean I- Like a child, like a child sleeping.

1078
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:02,980
So he has like a code word that lets him know that like I'm calling a favor on him so if

1079
01:05:02,980 --> 01:05:07,900
you just say some weird shit about kids sleeping, he's not gonna do anything.

1080
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,820
Do you understand?

1081
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:10,820
I think I understand.

1082
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:14,140
I can write it down so you have it so you'll know what to say.

1083
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:16,140
Yeah, maybe write this down for me.

1084
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:18,140
Okay, I'll write it down for you.

1085
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,140
And just put it under that fold there.

1086
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:22,140
On my balls.

1087
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,140
Oh, right, that's where you got stuck last time. Okay.

1088
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:26,140
Yeah, there seems to be...

1089
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,140
Oh, it's still stuck. Okay, it's still sticking.

1090
01:05:28,140 --> 01:05:30,140
Some of the glue has

1091
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:32,140
warped around

1092
01:05:32,140 --> 01:05:34,140
my nutsack. Yeah, I can see that now.

1093
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:36,140
And it has created kind of like a kangaroo pouch

1094
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:38,140
in which I can

1095
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:40,140
put items. That's good.

1096
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,140
That's exciting. That is where I've been putting

1097
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:46,780
of my small things like ball bearings.

1098
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:48,780
Okay, like ball bearings.

1099
01:05:48,780 --> 01:06:02,620
And now we're back to the day of the event where you, Dogen, have arrived.

1100
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:05,660
And it begins, of course, with a feast.

1101
01:06:05,660 --> 01:06:12,580
You see King Nardwuar stroll up with his massive posse of chieftains of nards and orcs and goblins

1102
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:14,820
and they're all like "Rawr, rawr, rawr!"

1103
01:06:14,820 --> 01:06:19,360
You see on the shoulder of Nardwuar is his son, who's sort of a smaller nard, he doesn't

1104
01:06:19,360 --> 01:06:22,020
have the penis scorpion tail yet.

1105
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:28,100
He's sort of just sort of like cheering also like "Rawr, rawr, rawr!" on his dad's shoulder

1106
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:35,420
and he gathers everyone around and the beginning, the first phase of the event, the murdering,

1107
01:06:35,420 --> 01:06:36,420
is the feast.

1108
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:41,320
And you see King Nard sort of taking our war sort of takes

1109
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,520
the stage sort of like the Lou says.

1110
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:49,120

01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:50,300

1132
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,220
and he takes a skull any sort of

1133
01:07:58,220 --> 01:07:59,220
sips it

1134
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:02,720
And he says it's awesome and then just eats the head

1135
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:05,720
completely and then the feast begins.

1136
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,920
So everyone's feasting.

1137
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:08,120
Everyone's having a good time.

1138
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:15,420
Dogen you see you feel someone tugging at your you're kind of

1139
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:18,420
like fully encased in your paladin armor right now, but you

1140
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,420
see someone tugging at sort of your little like like cloth

1141
01:08:22,420 --> 01:08:25,220
that's sticking out between your like metal gear right and

1142
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:31,160
and you see it's little Jumanji.

1143
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,720
And he says, "Hi."

1144
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:35,320
- What's up?

1145
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:37,960
- I'm supposed to stick by you.

1146
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,800
So nice to meet you, I'm Jumanji.

1147
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,820
- Hey, great, I'm Dogen the Dirt Goblin.

1148
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,240
It's really nice to meet you, Jumanji.

1149
01:08:45,240 --> 01:08:47,120
I'm gonna protect you tonight.

1150
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,040
Nothing bad is gonna happen.

1151
01:08:49,040 --> 01:08:49,920
- Awesome.

1152
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,760
I like to hear that. - So basically,

1153
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:53,840
there's several different types of soil

1154
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,740
that I wanna teach you about tonight.

1155
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:59,380
- Okay, I'm a kid, so I won't mind for a little bit.

1156
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:00,220
Go on.

1157
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,740
- So there's sandy soil, there's clay soil,

1158
01:09:02,740 --> 01:09:06,140
there's silt, peat, chalk, and loam.

1159
01:09:06,140 --> 01:09:08,220
You're gonna wanna get a good mix of these

1160
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,900
if you're gonna have a successful--

1161
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,860
- Let's go back to loam.

1162
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:12,980
What's loam?

1163
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:17,920
- Loam is a mixture of sand, silt, and clay

1164
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:21,820
that is combined to avoid the negative effects of each type.

1165
01:09:21,820 --> 01:09:23,520
It is fertile, easy to work with,

1166
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:25,120
and provides good drainage.

1167
01:09:25,120 --> 01:09:29,820
As this is happening, you just hear like so it's like

1168
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:32,120
you're rattling this off and you have like a helmet on so

1169
01:09:32,120 --> 01:09:34,420
it's like going out.

1170
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,920
Yeah, Patrick Yoder.

1171
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,820
You are now sort of Stroud like sauntering up to the festivities

1172
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:43,820
you see like lots of like, you know displays of past murderings

1173
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,020

1183
01:10:06,340 --> 01:10:08,540
- Oh yeah, wasn't it just amazing

1184
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:10,980
when the wheels came out

1185
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:14,100
and people just started getting rolled over

1186
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:17,980
and their skulls were going out their mouths.

1187
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,660
- My cousin got rolled over.

1188
01:10:19,660 --> 01:10:21,140

01:10:32,220 --> 01:10:33,340

going into this

1242
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:17,520
Oh just watch out the trolls will sit on you.

1243
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:19,160
Ah right I think uh...

1244
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,080
They will try to sit on you.

1245
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,760
They will use you as a throw pillow.

1246
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:26,920
Well they I I actually I have enough uh I don't think that'll be a problem for me.

1247
01:12:26,920 --> 01:12:31,320
Yeah and I slap my balls.

1248
01:12:31,320 --> 01:12:33,840
There's plenty of room if you want to hop on actually uh.

1249
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,600
Oh okay man fine fine sure sure.

1250
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,040
Just hop on the front there.

1251
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:40,400
Okay tell tell Sticky I hopped on your balls.

1252
01:12:40,400 --> 01:12:41,400
Oh yeah absolutely.

1253
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,320
I'll let him know.

1254
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:47,320
And yeah, and you sort of you waddle in on him on your balls.

1255
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:56,320
And yeah, you see like orcs are like wrestling while they're eating flesh and trolls are like sitting on goblins and laughing as they watch their eyes pop out of their heads.

1256
01:12:56,320 --> 01:13:07,320
You see, you see like hobgoblins like stringing up like corpses and just playing treating it like it's a pinata and just like laughing.

1257
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:10,520
It's just like a completely debauched festivity.

1258
01:13:10,520 --> 01:13:17,520
And now, up your button around the corner, we have our good friend Evil Stevel.

1259
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,220
You found the cave. You managed to make it through town.

1260
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:25,020
There's no issue there. You're just a regular-ass dwarf as far as everyone's concerned.

1261
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,320
And the mouth of the cave, as you walk in, it gets like hotter and hotter.

1262
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:36,920
Basically, you can play like kind of like hot and cold to figure out where the center of this dormant volcano is.

1263
01:13:36,920 --> 01:13:43,160
You're able to sort of like navigate through but I'm sure I've stripped down all my way to a white wife beater and

1264
01:13:43,160 --> 01:13:46,680
Boxer shorts with little hearts on them. Yeah

1265
01:13:46,680 --> 01:13:50,360
Yeah, like a volcano. Oh, man, I get okay

1266
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:57,400
You're like you're like it's it gets starts to get so hot you like unbutton the your boxers, uh, also

1267
01:13:57,400 --> 01:14:01,800
Just love my penis. Yeah, it's just hanging out. Ah, that's much better

1268
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:05,800
And uh

1269
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:12,760
off in the distance of the uh this place you see a you see something that that that looks like

1270
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:18,600
is blocking your way from what you could tell is basically the center of the volcano um it's this

1271
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,760
you can't quite make out what kind of fiend it is but as a cleric you're pretty familiar with a lot

1272
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:27,560
of fiends and demons you've had to study you know it was sort of at one point a know your enemy

1273
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:34,320
death domain and you hear it it's going

1274
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:45,120
will you shut up I'm trying to blow up this volcano and you see it pop out and

1275
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:53,080
it's this little hairy thing it's like medium-sized my PC froze whatever

1276
01:14:53,080 --> 01:15:06,760
scream you did but so it did do that it was and it's a little it's a cackler and

1277
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:18,280
he he looks at you and he's like you're gonna blow this place up yeah this place

1278
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:21,040
Let's go boom boom.

1279
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:24,680
This place go boom boom anyway.

1280
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,680
All right crazy guy.

1281
01:15:25,680 --> 01:15:27,760
Well, I got something to do.

1282
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:31,960
So if you could move out of the way, stop being so weird.

1283
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:33,760
I can't move.

1284
01:15:33,760 --> 01:15:35,000
We really not that big.

1285
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:37,640
I guess I'll just walk around you.

1286
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:39,760
And yeah, he puts his hand up.

1287
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:41,200
High five.

1288
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,200
All right.

1289
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,200
Good talk.

1290
01:15:43,200 --> 01:15:52,520
Good talk. I just gotta let you go through I guess. It's too funny. He's like, "Hey, wait!"

1291
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:54,960
He starts like trying to rush back towards you as you move towards the

1292
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:59,320
center of the volcano. So now we move back towards the feast and the

1293
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:05,720
celebration is kicked off and now it's the procession. So the procession

1294
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:11,040
involves a long climb up to the top of a mountain, in this case Mount Honestoodle,

1295
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:17,600
which is lined with 1,000 conquered slaves crucified but kept alive so that

1296
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:25,080
everyone can behead each one as they go out. But King Nardwar says something else.

1297
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:33,040
This year things will change instead of beheading slaves that are dead, you know

1298
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:38,640
that are almost, that are almost dead. Speech, speech, speech, speech. This year

1299
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,720
they shall be fully dead so we do not have to we can spare them the agony and

1300
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:49,960
you see everyone oh how could he do that I love killing them when they're barely

1301
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:57,120
alive I like listening to them scream while we do this and you know they're all sort of hubbub

1302
01:16:57,120 --> 01:17:01,560
hubbub hubbub and meanwhile Dogen so you're walking with the boy and he's like and so

1303
01:17:01,560 --> 01:17:08,000
tell me more about so you have to till you till the soil but what's tilling right like what does

1304
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
that mean? Who knows?

1305
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,400
Yeah, you can take it out.

1306
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:14,200
Look at it.

1307
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:14,900
Okay.

1308
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:19,500
And Patrick Yodar, you're hanging out with the goblins.

1309
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:22,000
You're walking up with them.

1310
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:23,300
You see Evans.

1311
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,200

Wow, that's a good.

1320
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:41,940
weeks

1321
01:17:41,940 --> 01:17:44,940

all right, I'm not actually going to prod about that.

1332
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:15,720
I'm just here to do a job.

1333
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:18,180
Okay. Sorry. Yeah, of course.

1334
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:21,820
And yeah, so you keep going up and meanwhile you.

1335
01:18:21,820 --> 01:18:30,020
Evil Stievel, you approach the center of the cave and you see the cackler.

1336
01:18:30,020 --> 01:18:32,540
He says, no, no, no, no.

1337
01:18:32,540 --> 01:18:35,500
You see, you have to leave this place.

1338
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:38,020
This place is going to blow.

1339
01:18:38,020 --> 01:18:42,060
What are you not getting funny, man?

1340
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,780
I'm here to blow it up.

1341
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:46,100
That's the whole point.

1342
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,380
Oh, no, no, you're not supposed to be here.

1343
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,740
Oh, no, no.

1344
01:18:51,740 --> 01:18:57,300
And you guys reach the top of this volcano of Mount Honest Doodle

1345
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:59,900
that nobody knows is a volcano.

1346
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:04,400
And you see the man that has been chosen to be murdered.

1347
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:11,000
None other than solving the frog tied up in the center on top

1348
01:19:11,000 --> 01:19:16,800
of the volcano and he's like, this is I mean, I wouldn't I

1349
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:17,800
should have known.

1350
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:26,500
You see as you approach this whole is massive like top of

1351
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:27,200
this volcano.

1352
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,300
It's just looks like an indent of a mountain, you know, they

1353
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,180
don't really know but it's like what a volcano looks like when it's sort of

1354
01:19:32,180 --> 01:19:38,060
like you know stops being active and you see them all look down at this crater

1355
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:43,140
and it's like this like giant sort of like you know gathering of these these

1356
01:19:43,140 --> 01:19:50,220
beasts and you see the King Nardwaur go to his son and he looks to you Dogen and

1357
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:56,500
he says hmm good job and you know thinking you know his boy safe a good

1358
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,920
And you see the boy turn to you

1359
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:04,120
Dogue and he says I don't know if I want to kill this guy you really have to kill him

1360
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:08,500
Okay

1361
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:13,860
Just gets brought down and

1362
01:20:13,860 --> 01:20:18,900
You see

1363
01:20:18,900 --> 01:20:23,740
It's brought down the Sullivan and you see the king to dress everyone

1364
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:31,580
After this we can party. So let's make this quick. All right. All right kid. So look everyone I

1365
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:41,260
Know I've done some controversial changes. Now. We're trying to learn how to be normal. We're trying to learn how to eat cheese and

1366
01:20:41,260 --> 01:20:46,020
You know drink drink wine and

1367
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:49,760
Maybe play backgammon or bridge

1368
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:52,480
something old people do I

1369
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,560
Don't know go for a walk

1370
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:59,160
Something besides the killing and the eating of flesh

1371
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:02,280
though always fun

1372
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,600
But just not fulfilling

1373
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:08,880
We have learned this and so today

1374
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:12,080
This

1375
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,840
frog man

1376
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:20,720
Shall not be killed. Hmm. Everyone's like gasping. It's like insanely instead. He will be stabbed in the leg

1377
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,080
500 times

1378
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:30,960
What the shit what

1379
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,800
and

1380
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,160
Now my son here take the ceremonial knife

1381
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:40,520
You can do it Jumanji and he gives him the knife

1382
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:46,260
and Jumanji looks towards Sullivan who's like sort of pinned down to the ground and

1383
01:21:47,200 --> 01:22:08,280
and

1384
01:22:08,280 --> 01:22:10,720
and gentle shakes after that first impact,

1385
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:12,660
enough to knock some of the less sure-footed

1386
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,820
and inebriated folks on their ass.

1387
01:22:14,820 --> 01:22:16,060
But then the rumbling grows,

1388
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,260
and its trembles become shakes,

1389
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:21,140
and its low rumbling a shattering hum.

1390
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:21,980
And it comes on,

1391
01:22:21,980 --> 01:22:24,940
it comes on like a parent storming up to your bedroom.

1392
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:25,940
You hear their footsteps,

1393
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,500
dum, dum, dum, dum,

1394
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:30,580
like they're gonna about to fucking tear your head off.

1395
01:22:30,580 --> 01:22:32,100
And you, Evil Stievel,

1396
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,780
you get, you hear your stone,

1397
01:22:34,780 --> 01:22:36,780
it goes, "Now, Evil Stievel."

1398
01:22:36,780 --> 01:22:38,700
And you watch your scroll, it appears.

1399
01:22:38,700 --> 01:22:39,700
It's a spell.

1400
01:22:39,700 --> 01:22:41,540
A wall of lava.

1401
01:22:41,540 --> 01:22:43,460
It's a very powerful spell.

1402
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,700
And you can now cast it.

1403
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,420
And make lava flow from where you are.

1404
01:22:48,420 --> 01:22:55,180
But before you could even do that, all this is happening within like a few seconds, you

1405
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:58,100
know, and you look below you, Evil Stiefel.

1406
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:01,340
And you look at the cackler, and the cackler's like, "Heehahahah!

1407
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:02,340
Hoohoo!

1408
01:23:02,340 --> 01:23:03,340
Hahahaha!

1409
01:23:03,340 --> 01:23:04,340
Hahahaha!"

1410
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:07,940
smog forcing itself through a pool of lava down below.

1411
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:11,540
Its speed and force makes all sound to you deaf.

1412
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:12,840
It's just gone.

1413
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:16,140
And then it washes over you and lifts you skyward,

1414
01:23:16,140 --> 01:23:18,740
rattling your skull until you're a brain-dead puppet

1415
01:23:18,740 --> 01:23:19,940
almost immediately.

1416
01:23:19,940 --> 01:23:21,240
Geronimo!

1417
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:25,040
And then a primordial pop as the ground below Jumanji,

1418
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:29,240
Sullivan, and everyone else explodes with the force of

1419
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:31,740
10,000 dragons.

1420
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:38,640
sound of it's fantasy.

1421
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:39,840
Very cool.

1422
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,540
I had to make sure it was in there.

1423
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:47,640
I'm going to I'm going to die the sound of which turns the

1424
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:51,940
rumbling into like it's a just a gentle coup, you know, it

1425
01:23:51,940 --> 01:23:55,240
sends all of you so far into the sky so fast you reach what

1426
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:59,040
must be the top of all things the crest between the atmosphere

1427
01:23:59,040 --> 01:24:08,560
in space, you swear, but before the drop, pure blackness as your brains completely shut down

1428
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:14,240
from the sheer awe of the force and all that's happened.

1429
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:21,160
Then from the darkness, only a moment later, you hear the familiar nagging voice of life

1430
01:24:21,160 --> 01:24:23,160
beckoning you forth.

1431
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:28,160
Guys, guys, hey guys, guys, guys, guys!

1432
01:24:28,160 --> 01:24:31,160
And you see a frog shaking you awake.

1433
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:32,160
All three of you.

1434
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:37,160
Guys, guys, guys! Wake up! Wake up!

1435
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:41,160
I press the top of his head like a snooze button.

1436
01:24:41,160 --> 01:24:43,160
He's like, ah!

1437
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,160
I don't work for a second, what the, hey!

1438
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,160
I do that too.

1439
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:51,920
You gotta stop! You gotta stop doing that! Please! I'm sorry! I'll stop yelling!

1440
01:24:51,920 --> 01:24:52,420
I'll stop yelling!

1441
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:54,420
I just start kinda hovering my hand over his head like...

1442
01:24:54,420 --> 01:24:54,920
What's up?

1443
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:55,420
What's up?

1444
01:24:55,420 --> 01:24:55,920
What's up?

1445
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,420
What's up?

1446
01:24:56,420 --> 01:24:56,920
What's up?

1447
01:24:56,920 --> 01:24:57,420
Okay!

1448
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:05,420
Can you... Can you... Can you press down on that real quick? I was actually having... I was having a wonderful dream. I was... I was on a gondola.

1449
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:06,920
*laughs*

1450
01:25:06,920 --> 01:25:09,420
Aw man, you pissed yourself, dude! What the hell?

1451
01:25:09,420 --> 01:25:10,420
I think this is...

1452
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,920
Ah, well... That happens.

1453
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:16,920
This is probably a part of the concussion. I hope this isn't forever.

1454
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:21,080
Wait, who, hold on, I'm a little bit disoriented here.

1455
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,720
Which one of us peed ourselves?

1456
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:31,140
You look around and you realize you're in some sort of weird fucking forest.

1457
01:25:31,140 --> 01:25:37,780
You see, you know, like squiggling little plants poking it out of the ground, almost

1458
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:38,780
coordinated.

1459
01:25:38,780 --> 01:25:41,300
It looks like they're almost like singing little tunes.

1460
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:46,660
Strange bugs fly by, they land on a tree, and a tree opens up its mouth and eats it.

1461
01:25:46,660 --> 01:25:50,140
you see a nest of birds and one of them cracks open and becomes an egg that

1462
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:52,100
just sprints down the tree

1463
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,300
uh...

1464
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:56,420
you see a distant in the distance a rock with a sword in it

1465
01:25:56,420 --> 01:26:00,860
and as critters walk by it says come on maybe you're the true king give it a tug

1466
01:26:00,860 --> 01:26:04,580
come on who knows what will happen

1467
01:26:04,580 --> 01:26:09,340
uh... and you see sullivan's eyes go wide as he starts to realize

1468
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,560
oh god

1469
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:12,460
we're in whip it woods

1470
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,780
oh god

1471
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:18,600
all god we gotta be two weeks from the village bike carriage

1472
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,020

1473
01:26:21,020 --> 01:26:25,020
what are we going to eat i had a set

1474
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,500
all cattle cattle cattle cattle

1475
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:31,220
i think real quick and then a and the train to get that sort

1476
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:34,740
unit and uh... you also see

1477
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:36,220
another person

1478
01:26:36,220 --> 01:26:38,020
the prince

1479
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:42,060
princeton monty staring intently a small furry creature

1480
01:26:42,060 --> 01:26:46,500
that exposes its throat where another set of eyes pokes out of it.

1481
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:50,940
He grabs it quickly and just with one of his six legs and just eats it.

1482
01:26:50,940 --> 01:26:55,340
And he says, "I guess we'll have to make do."

1483
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:03,740
And you realize that the five of you somehow launch from whatever eruption that was into

1484
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:11,100
the Whippet Woods, far, far, far away from Trebuchet Village, far from the Claw Castle

1485
01:27:11,100 --> 01:27:14,140
where the terrifier kingdom is.

1486
01:27:14,140 --> 01:27:17,260
And you're sort of without a paddle.

1487
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:19,060
But the three of you have known each other

1488
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,180
from work for a while, and you kind of probably

1489
01:27:21,180 --> 01:27:26,940
got the sense that you all can handle a blade or two, you know?

1490
01:27:26,940 --> 01:27:33,460
So yeah, your adventure begins.

1491
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,900
Patrick, you want to grab the sword from the stone?

1492
01:27:35,900 --> 01:27:38,260
Yeah, I'm going to take a look at it.

1493
01:27:38,260 --> 01:27:38,860
Oh, come on.

1494
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:40,940
I know you look strong, buddy.

1495
01:27:40,940 --> 01:27:46,340
Hey, thank you so much for saying that. I'm actually, uh, I'm gonna actually I'm gonna give this a go real quick. Oh, hey

1496
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:51,040
I I know you're gonna do it. I know you're gonna do it. Okay. Oh, I'm gonna do it and

1497
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:55,220
You grab the sword back up a little bit you guys

1498
01:27:55,220 --> 01:28:01,300
And as you pull it you see the face on the rock that was chatting you up turn just

1499
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:04,340
Demonic and as you pull the sword

1500
01:28:04,340 --> 01:28:07,020
You pull up this giant

1501
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:09,380
fucking nasty

1502
01:28:09,380 --> 01:28:12,940
worm, slug, rock monster.

1503
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:16,980
And he says, "Thanks, I'm hungry."

1504
01:28:16,980 --> 01:28:19,180
- That is not what I was expecting to happen.

1505
01:28:19,180 --> 01:28:21,220
(laughing)

1506
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:22,900
- And we'll roll from initiative.

1507
01:28:22,900 --> 01:28:23,940
- I knew it. - Nope.

1508
01:28:23,940 --> 01:28:28,780
Roll initiative and take it from there next to seven.

1509
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:30,200
- Nice. - Perfect.

1510
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:32,780
(upbeat music)

1511
01:28:38,140 --> 01:28:43,900
Now, having been launched mysteriously from Trebuchet Village, and even more mysteriously

1512
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:51,260
survived, our hero's adventures can begin in earnest. With a lost prince and a weird frog,

1513
01:28:51,260 --> 01:28:58,380
who knows what lies in wait for the gang. Oh, and what's that in the oh over there?

1514
01:29:00,780 --> 01:29:08,140
Is that the big bad? Is that the evil, the big evil man who's lurking over there? What's that?

1515
01:29:08,140 --> 01:29:18,060
Is that their hand hovering over all of planet Ebo? Oh, is that a little ratty attendant going,

1516
01:29:18,060 --> 01:29:25,260
"Yes, master!" Oh, who could that master be? I guess there's only one way to find out.

1517
01:29:27,220 --> 01:29:34,220
Listen to the show, Trebuchet Village!

1518
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:37,580
[MUSIC PLAYING]

1519
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,640
you
