9
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,080
- Shout out to the stand up shot subreddit.

- Yeah, we need to talk about this.

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:21,920
- First of all, we gotta pay respect

12
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,760
to the stand up shot subreddit.

13
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,840
- Pay respect to the real ones.

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,640
- I mean, I remember getting, I used to watch,

15
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,720
I mean, I remember the first time I ever heard George Carlin, it was him posting his jokes

16
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,300
on the stand-up shot subreddit.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:38,200
Over a picture of him like looking at a cup of coffee.

18
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,340
Remember when Lenny Bruce got banned from Reddit for saying damn much truth?

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,840
In the 60s, yeah, he got thrown out of the stand-up shot subreddit.

20
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,800

00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,800
and just every post is like people asking why they're not funny and why

29

46
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:20,160
iPad in the bedroom. Yeah that just this just reminded me of one of the all-time

47
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:28,960
grades which is I have a time-based pie eating disorder I eat pie all the time.

48
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:36,960
I forgot about that. One of the best stand-up shots of all time. We have spent so much time on that subreddit.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:42,520
I have a time-based pie eating disorder. The best part of that stand-up shot that

50
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,720
that joke that I have a time-based pie eating disorder I eat pie all the time is

51
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,960
it was there were three different jokes on one stand-up shot like that was

52
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,720
It's like the middle joke in like three nonsense.

53
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,120
Is that Scott Walker?

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
No.

55
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,120
Who did that one?

56
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,120
I don't think so.

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,120
That's a different, yeah.

58
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Scott Walker comedy?

59
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,560
We're at a point where we know their fucking names.

60
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:09,680
Scott Walker is the one who did like, "If I see a dog and I can't pet it, I die."

61
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,680
He does stuff like that.

62
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Oh yeah.

63
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,880
One second, I'm going to look up, I have a time-based pie.

64
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,960
The picture of him is like, is like him screaming.

65
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,680
Yeah.

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,240
I need to find... I think this picture might be lost to time to be honest I have a time

67
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,160
based pie eating disorder.

68
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,320
Lost to time, lost to pie. Yeah.

69
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
I was lost to pie eating.

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,620
Yeah the only thing that comes up when I google the phrase I have a time based pie eating disorder

71
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,620
is our podcast.

72
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:42,000
Nice, we've claimed that joke. We've stolen it.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,680
I didn't know that we had that anywhere.

74
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,160
It's in the description of episode 39.

75
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,800
We must have talked about stand-up shots in the past.

76
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,800
I'm sure we have.

77
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Because that must have been the time.

78
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,800
That must have been the time we were done.

79
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,800
It's pretty fun.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,800
I think we definitely talked about that joke on a podcast before.

81
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Yeah, that one, but at the time when you posted that one where it's just the really long text

82
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,160
and it got downvoted a lot.

83
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,160
Oh yeah.

84
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,160
Oh yeah.

85
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
That one was the best.

86
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Man, people hate good comedy.

87
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,160
That is good.

88
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,160
I know.

89
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,160
It's true.

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
Also, the best part about that one is that the photo that you had on it was you doing

91
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,120
that joke, right?

92
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
Yeah.

93
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,120
It's a real joke. It's funny as hell, they just don't understand me, you know?

94
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,120
It's kind of one of those situations where I've got too many kind of depths in my brain and different lengths and widths that kind of go on and try to...

95
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
You're like Dangerfield.

96
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,120
Yeah, I'm like... I'm exactly... I'm kind of the dangerous comic, is that what you're saying?

97
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,120
No, no, no. Rodney... Yeah, you're Mr. Dangerfield.

98
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:40,120
I'm like Dangerous Neil, you know? I'm like Rodney Dangerous Neil, 'cause I kind of tell jokes that are so dangerous they make you kneel during the anthem.

99
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
'Cause you're so twisted.

100
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,920
- I thought you were talking about Neil.

101
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,920
- No, no, no, that guy on Twitter, Dangerous Neil.

102
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,760
I thought you were talking about him.

103
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,580
- I don't know who that is.

104
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,420
- Is that a guy?

105
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,460
- Yeah, that's a guy.

106
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,300
- No, it's not.

107
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,820
- I just made that up.

108
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,660
- No, that's a real guy.

109
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,800
- You just think that's a guy

110
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,360
'cause you think that everything you hear is real.

111
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,120
- Cam, you just manifested that, brother.

112
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,680
- Yeah, I'm manifesting energy.

113
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
- Shout out to Dangerous Neil, I guess.

114
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,700
- I just hex Dangerous Neil.

115
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,880
- No, don't hex him.

116
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,400
- Dude, take it back.

117
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,240
- He's a good dude.

118
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,060
- Okay, take it back.

119
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,900
- Take it back right now.

120
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:11,740
- I take it back.

121
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,740
I take it back.

122
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:19,240
But yeah, Patrick, what the results of this, of the, so yeah, everyone was posting the fucking...

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:25,340
I didn't know all of you were going to go Operation Crapstorm on our standup shots.

124
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,220
Yeah, that shit was crazy.

125
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,580
I was just refreshing the new page on standup shots and literally like every time I refreshed

126
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,020
there was one or two new ones.

127
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,100
Like they were going faster than the mods could delete them.

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
It was incredible.

129
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,100
Yeah.

130
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,400
one like lonely guy who made the fucking subreddit so he could post his stand-up

131
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:45,660
shots I thought it started out reason he posts he made the subreddit I thought it

132
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,580
would start it out as like stand-up shots from like specials that people were

133
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,940
watching like oh look at this joke and then it turned into just open mic guys

134
00:06:54,940 --> 00:07:00,080
being like oh no okay well I don't I don't know anyway yeah back in the day

135
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,340
it was it was you know it was like Patrice and Louie and they were posting

136
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,440
their stand-up shots on there. Patrice and Louis posting their stand-up shots we had

137
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,020
Greg Giraldo RIP he was doing roasts in the comments of the post.

138
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,860
Yeah he would roast Patrice and Louis and Lisa Lampanelli would too but

139
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,780
then they would say that Lisa Lampanelli had sex with a black guy once.

140
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,740
And then well anyway I got a got a DM from the moderator and I didn't know

141
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:43,980
that he followed me and he follows me yeah he was pretty I mean read the DM

142
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:51,060
if you don't I will he said did I do I feel kind of bad reading it now come on

143
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,780
to fuck this guy you fucking come on. This is not the yeah. I'm gonna read it if you don't

144
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:03,260
read it. I'm sorry that you actually had to. You fucking up my subreddit today.

145
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:11,580
Yeah this has to be personal. It's sick because I mean it's such a cesspool to begin with

146
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:15,740
like every post is like yeah I saw my Chinese neighbor out the other day I

147
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,020
hope he doesn't eat my cat. Right. One of the top posts when one of the top

148
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:24,660
One of the top posts when we posted that was like, "I learned today that Israel is in Asia,

149
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:29,520
so now whenever I see the Jewish guy who works at the store next door, I bow and say thank

150
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,760
you very much to him."

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,760
Yeah.

152
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,460
Doug is like, literally just sit like that.

153
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,220
Thank you very much, Mr. Goldstein.

154
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
That was the punchline.

155
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,220
Is there a stereotype where you-

156
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:43,780
But you know that there was supposed to be, "Thank you very much, Mr. Goldstein," was

157
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,580
supposed to be read in a voice.

158
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:47,020
Yeah, and a very specific accent.

159
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:53,500
My question is do, is there a stereotype that Asian people say thank you a lot?

160
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,860
Well they bow.

161
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,620
They say thank you and bow.

162
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Oh, okay.

163
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
That's the stereotype.

164
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,620
That's what they do.

165
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,900
Maybe I'm just so anti-racist I don't know any of the stereotypes.

166
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:09,800
If you watch South Park in the early 2000s, there's an episode where Cartman dresses up

167
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,220
like a Japanese person and says thank you a bunch.

168
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:14,220
So I think he got it from there.

169
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,780
Wait, Cartman did that?

170
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,780
Yeah.

171
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:21,580
fuck I I didn't be I didn't want to have to cancel oh my god I had no idea that

172
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,120
Cartman did that early in his career that's really fucked up yeah it was

173
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,900
early enough in his career it was bad guys it was a long time ago he was in

174
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,940
third grade he was making fun of fat kids who dress up like Japanese guys

175
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,780
grade yeah I don't know I feel like we got to cut him some slack mm-hmm also

176
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:41,060
think about the people who are around you know he's like I can't even cut it

177
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,060
Kenny can't even step up to him and confront him because he can't talk he's

178
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:51,340
He's like a friend of a friend I guess so I feel kind of bad for bringing that up.

179
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:56,860
Carmen? Yeah. You know someone who knows Carmen? Every fat guy knows each other.

180
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:03,180
Wait, are you guys like cousins? Carmen is a friend of Ralphie May who is a friend of Patrick.

181
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,940
Uh-huh yeah another rest in peace. Pat you should just get super fat dude.

182
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:15,620
I think I'm gonna get thinner living here. No no you no get really fat. Why?

183
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Why? Why would I want Patrick to get thin? I want him to win.

184
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,620
That's losing.

185
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,620
If I, yeah, it would be losing.

186
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,620
If I'm winning, I'm gaining points.

187
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,620
If you're winning, you're gaining.

188
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,620
Okay, fine, Patrick, I want you to get fat then.

189
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,620
Now I don't want to, now I want to get thin again.

190
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,620
Okay, I want you to get thin.

191
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,620
I think because I don't have a car or a license, I'm gonna have to...

192
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,620
I'm gonna start sending you edible arrangements.

193
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,620
Oh, I gotta fucking, god damn it.

194
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Oh, I gotta eat that edible arrangement.

195
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,220
I got so mad. Oh my god.

196
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:50,780
No, I have to... I forgot I have a frozen Snickers bar that I have to eat so soon.

197
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,180
I took it out of the freezer to thaw and forgot about it.

198
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,540
I have to renew my license.

199
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,820
Oh shit, yeah.

200
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:58,460
I was supposed to do that. I was supposed to call the DMV,

201
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,220
like, before this and I didn't because I was setting up a table.

202
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,180
You got two days.

203
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,100
You have two days?

204
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,180
Yeah, I have two days to do it but I have to... it expires on the 23rd.

205
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,220
You don't drive, it doesn't matter, right?

206
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:11,580
Well, I still need a license.

207
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:13,500
For what?

208
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:21,100
buying cigarettes. Nice. They're six bucks here. Are you back on cigarettes? I don't know, I might.

210
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:31,820
Big and fat guy, hamburger Patrick, smoking a cigarette. I don't know, I feel like this could

211
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,580
be a huge, a huge new era for you. I don't even know. I don't, I think, it's either I'm gonna get,

212
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:41,740
I'm gonna be so bored here that I just eat myself to death like Orson Welles

213
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,740

you know. In what ways? I mean you're just super, you're super fat.

215
00:11:55,660 --> 00:12:05,980
Like Orson Welles. Yeah. Yeah. You're a great actor. Thank you. I've not had my shot at um,

00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,780
Wait, do the... Let's do the War of the Worlds.

224
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:22,780

- Michael, stop the car, get out now.

238
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900

I think it yeah, it's pretty hot here too.

272
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,620
We've had this horrible three month heat wave.

273
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,780
I think we've literally already made this joke on the last episode.

274
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,980
No!

275
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:24,980
I don't even know, I fuckin'...

276
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,580
Man, I went on a two-mile walk today.

277
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,860
I went to...

278
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,300
What are you creaking around?

279
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,500
Nothing, that's the cat.

280
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,740
His old antique chair that he lives in.

281
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,340
Yeah, was the cat playing on a rocking horse or something?

282
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,340
The cat was playing on a rocking horse.

283
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:39,840
Okay.

284
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,340
Exactly.

285
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,940
I'm so smart.

286
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,480
Yeah.

287
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,820
What was I gonna fuckin' say?

288
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,860
Two-mile walk.

289
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,900
Two-mile walk.

290
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,220
Two-mile round-trip walk.

291
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,100
I went to...

292
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:55,660
'Cause I wanted to see, I've driven by it a bunch of times.

293
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:00,860
It is, there's a castle that says Candy Kingdom on it, but I found out this morning, I was

294
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,200
like, "Oh, what is that?"

295
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,020
So I wanted to see if it was a candy castle.

296
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:12,940
Turns out it's a therapist's office that is inside of a castle.

297
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:21,020
it is across the street like diagonally from a shack that is a chili dog stand

298
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:28,860
and a notary public that's so sick so awesome and I'm moving to New Hampshire

allowed one person in the store at a time where that was the rule before COVID.

303
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:19,400
Every town in New Hampshire like grew around just a shack that is two unrelated things

304
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,500
in the same building.

305
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Yeah.

306
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,660

sentence and then we'll release that the dark sentence yeah sentence and then we

329
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:28,400
can we can put all of them on a thumb drive and sell it to we can put him on a

330
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,320
thumb drive and just throw it into the sewer somewhere what if I what if I I'll

331
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,600
put it on I'll put the first 31 episodes on a thumb drive in a manila envelope

332
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,920
and hide it somewhere in New York City and you can somebody has to I will give

333
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,920
I will give cryptic clues once a week as to where it is.

334
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,320
Stuff like, uh...

335
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,320
McDonald's.

336
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:56,520
Yeah, stuff like, you might be loving it when you find this envelope in a hamburger...

337
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
In the bathroom of McDonald's.

338
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,520
In the bathroom of your loving it here.

339
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,520
And they'll be like, "You might pick two."

340
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:08,520
This is like Cicada 3301, I just can't do this.

341
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,520
We should, we should, um...

342
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,520
I feel like it would be funny if we did do a scavenger hunt.

343
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:24,760
When you find this thumb drive, you're gonna want to Taco Bell-bout it to all of your french

344
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:32,240
fries pizza ice cream.

345
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,100
We will be the only podcast to do a scavenger hunt.

346
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,680
That would be another feather in the cap.

347
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,800
I feel like we can do it.

348
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,320
I feel like we're the ones pushing the boundaries.

349
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,400
We're changing the form.

350
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,840
- I mean, that's probably the easiest thing to do.

351
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,960
You just take an object and you put it somewhere.

352
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,480
- Also, we're just good at clues.

353
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,240
We're like three of the top clue masters that there are.

354
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,960
- Yeah, we've worked with clue masters before.

355
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,160
- We have, we've worked with the supreme clue master.

356
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,640
So I feel like we could do it, you know?

357
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,600
Like hide it, like where would we hide it?

358
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,760
We'd hide--

359
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,360
- Well, we can't say it on the podcast.

360
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,080
The belly of a whale.

361
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,760
What about the center of the earth?

362
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,520
What do you guys think about that?

363
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:29,100
And then for the clue, we can say, even if you're in the middle of nowhere, you'll find

364
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:31,400
this clue the middle of somewhere.

365
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,200
And you can write that in a quill on a piece of parchment and then upload it online to Twitter.

366
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,840
I'm gonna put it in a bottle and put do a message in a bottle and send it in

367
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,340
We could put it in the ocean.

368
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:48,320
It lands on the shore of one of those those tribes that is like never had any contact with the outside world

369
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,240
And then they develop a list based society

370
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:58,920
Oh, yeah, six months later somebody some other fucking Christian missionary tries to go there and they've all they live in a future technology paradise

371
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,920
Yeah, six months later

372
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,920
There's a knock on your door and you open your door and just a hundred tribes people just just bow

373
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:09,760
turn you into a pincushion with arrows.

374
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:22,480
Yeah. All standing in the hallway of your apartment. They just take over your

375
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,560
apartment they're living there. They take over the podcast. Yeah. We each. We still

376
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:33,480
make the money. Now that's ideal. It's you two and a hundred tribesmen. Yeah.

377
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,840
and they're like the... Hold on, hold on, you hold no no one of you hold the fucking mic all right

378
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:46,400
look I thought I was bad with it. No that would be the best is if they had perfect form yeah

379
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:53,320
they're audio always sound... We have like a guest on. They just send flack files yeah I mean it's unbelievable we have a guest on

380
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:59,280
I mean podcasting... They're like making him ride the Sibian. Yeah. Podcasting is a primal instinct you don't have to know how to do

381
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,140
anything to do it you know it harkens back to back in the cavemen days when

382
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,720
when you know one one caveman would sit would gun caveman would sit in his cave

383
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,380
and he would draw you know kind of like a racist caricature but like ironically on

384
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,600
the wall then all the other cavemen would come in the next day and look at it

385
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:21,760
while they are on their way to work and then yeah and go on Gabunga and then go

386
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,520
yeah and then go and kill whoever looks like that and then back in the day they

387
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,880
would they would string up two rocks with one with whoever was the most blessed

388
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,360
caveman had one very long pube they would cut it off and tie it to each rock and

389
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:39,320
then they would talk into it like a telephone yeah that's true

390
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,240
Alexander Graham Bell was actually a caveman who just lived that long he was

391
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:49,040
just yeah he's just gonna recreate his old technology that he he also invented

392
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:57,360
Yeah. One of the best. All right, top five inventors go. Okay, Tesla. Dr. Tesla. Elon

393
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:02,480
Musk. Dr. Musk. Bob Steve Jobs. Dr. Pepper. He invented Dr. Pepper. Dr. Pepper with his

394
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,440
30 flavors. Dr. Thunder. Dr. Pepper's brother. 30 flavors, man that's some bullshit.

395
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:13,960
32. Give me one flavor, vanilla. I thought. How about that? John Battery, the

396
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:21,720

397
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:28,700
Exactly. Steven the car. Steven University inventor of the universe. I feel

398
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,800
disrespected. Yeah, Justin Roiland. Justin Roiland has actually come up with so many

399
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,800
incredible inventions for that show. You know, the time gun, the wet gun, the super...

like what if there was a different kind of guy yeah what is there a scary guy

403
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:05,120
what if the scariest guy ever was in the scariest place ever outer okay so okay

404
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
So I found a new type of guy.

405
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,120
(laughter)

406
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
It's a xenomorph.

407
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,120
It has a mouth in its mouth.

408
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,120
Yeah, super normal.

409
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Yeah, that's normal.

410
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,120
I found an alien wife guy.

411
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Love to have a penis mouth that impregnates a woman on a spaceship.

412
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,120
I seriously love that.

413
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,120
I love being that normal.

414
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Yeah.

415
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,120
(sigh)

416
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Why the fuck do they only sell mental

417
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,520
mint all jewel pods now.

418
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,160
- They got rid of mint 'cause of fucking teenagers.

419
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,000
- Yeah.

420
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,840
- Teenagers like mint too much.

421
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,400
- If you have a nicotine addiction,

422
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,080
you have to smoke a poop flavored air

423
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,680
because poop is a heroin. - That is gonna be

424
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,600
the next step.

425
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,640
That's 10 years from now,

426
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,160
the government's gonna make all cigarettes mandated

427
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,800
they're either poop or pee flavored.

428
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,280
- They will have a poop jewel.

429
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,120
- Yeah.

430
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,400
- And it's the only one that companies are allowed to make.

431
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,000
- I mean, all they have to do is put the nicotine salts

432
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,400
and a little bit of glycerin in it.

433
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,400
and they put a little bit of pee in there.

434
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,240
I mean that--

435
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
- Just a little sprinkle of tinkle.

436
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,280
- A little sprinkle of tinkle in that Juul pod,

437
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,980
you're good. - Who's gonna care?

438
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,540
- Yeah, people are still gonna smoke 'em.

439
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,960
- I like your cool guitar in the background, Pat.

440
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,160
- Oh, thank you.

441
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,000
Thank you, I have many guitars.

442
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,580
- You're just turning in your chair

443
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,040
just to show us the guitar.

444
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,160
- Do you like it? - You suck.

445
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,240
You can't play that.

446
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,320
- I can play it.

447
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,320
- Do it, Slash.

448
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,600
- I've played it on the show before

449
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
and you got mad at me.

450
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,920
- My boy Patrick liked the white Slash.

451
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,920
I have the same birthday as Slash.

452
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
Yeah?

453
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,920
Yeah, uh, 23rd.

454
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,920
1488.

455
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,920
No.

456
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
That's your birthday, you Nazi?

457
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,920
No, I'm not born in '88.

458
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,920
Yeah, your birthday is, your birthday was HH.

459
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,920
No.

460
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
Yeah, that's right.

461
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,920
It is.

462
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:45,920
Happy Happy.

463
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
You're, you're, yeah.

464
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,920
That's what it stands for.

465
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,920
Your birthday's 6666, you fucking monster little demon bitch.

466
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Yeah.

467
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
You fucking weird ass freak.

468
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,920
I'm the devil.

469
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
I'm not a freak if I'm the devil.

470
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,920
I'm actually being-

471
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,920
The devil is, the devil is God's freak.

472
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
The devil is the freak.

473
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
The devil is-

474
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:04,920
The devil is basically the weird kid in God's class.

475
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Yeah.

476
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,920
Right?

477
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,920
That's you.

478
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
You're the weird kid's class.

479
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:09,920
I'm not the weird kid.

480
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
I never was, dude.

481
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
You were the weird kid.

482
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
I was a kid.

483
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
No, I'm not.

484
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
I was a kid when life was a nightmare.

485
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
I was a kid.

486
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,200
I was a kid and life was so unfair.

487
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,880
Yeah, nobody cared, dude.

488
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,880
I was alone in the world.

489
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
I woke up at seven.

490
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:26,000
Everybody else was having fun except me.

491
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,520
I went to bed at 7 and woke up at 11 just to see if anyone would call.

492
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,760
Nobody did dude.

493
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,760
No one called.

494
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,760
No one fucking did.

495
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,920
Alright, y'all wanna hop into this list?

496
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Sure.

497
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,920
Here wait, I have to pee.

498

Yeah, me too.

499
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,920
I gotta...

500
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,920
Oh my god, are you kidding me?

501
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,920
Yes, 26 minutes in.

502
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:43,920
Pee time.

503

Ooh yeah.

505
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
Alright, are we back?

506
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:47,920
We have to edit this out.

507
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,400
I had to get a soda.

508
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,840
A drink.

509
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,080
Alright, we got this list.

510
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,120
I need to go destroy the world real quick.

511
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,960
This list is-

512
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,480
Yeah, 'cause you look like Stewie Griffin, bitch.

513
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,320
No, I don't.

514
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,160
Oh, no, no.

515
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160

516
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,000
No, no.

517
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,820
Yes, yes.

518
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,660
Yeah, you do.

519
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,500
I have no idea.

520
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,320
Yeah, you do.

521
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,320
You both look like the dog and the girl combined.

522
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,320
I don't look like Meg, you look like Stewie.

523
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,320
You look like Meg, dude.

524
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,760
No, no, you look like Bertram.

525
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,400
You look like Stewie's, Nenemesis.

526
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,200
You look like Stewie's evil twin, Bertram.

527
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,440
He said Nenemesis.

528
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,260
Man, shut up.

529
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,100
I said Nemesis.

530
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,400
You ain't Nemo.

531
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm Nemo.

532
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,360
You ain't Nemo?

533
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
I'm Nemo.

534
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,800
Nah, you look like all the Rugrats combined.

535
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
That's fine.

536
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Yeah.

537
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,520
One inch tall and two.

538
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
That's fine.

539
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
No, it's not fine.

540
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,360
Because then I'm the same height as you.

541
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,360
Stewie the baby.

542
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
I'm huge, dude.

543
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
I'm not Stewie the baby.

544
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,360
No, you're Rugrats the kids.

545
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,360
Rugrats the kid?

546
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,360
Rugrats the kid.

547
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,960
You're the famous outlaw.

548
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,240
I'm Rugrats the kid.

549
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,020
No that's what you are basically.

550
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,340
You're basically Stewie.

551
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,200
You're basically, now that I look at you, you're pretty much a poo.

552
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,660
Do your Stewie impression.

553
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:02,660
I don't have one because it's so far away from who I am.

554
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,220
It's like me trying to do an impression of like Jackie Kennedy.

555
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Like it's impossible.

556
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,620
I thought you were going to say Jackie Chan.

557
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:12,500
Caleb, you're like if Caillou learned crime statistics.

558
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500

Wanted to eat food the other is to drink a soda yeah, that's pretty good to me

575
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:38,380
What's this list man top 10 reasons the world today sucks by superior?

576
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:44,420
77 the description of the list is it is self-explanatory. Please do not bring celebrities into this either

577
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:47,140
Number one Bieber number one

578
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,580
Yeah, number one is war

579
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:57,220
And the creator of the list superior 77 says there is so much war and conflict going on today my home country

580
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:59,700
Afghanistan was destroyed by conflict

581
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:05,540
This is a this is I think our first Afghani list

582
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,420
Yeah. Oh, oh, speaking of the Justin Bieber thing.

583
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:15,140
How many of the, uh, of Afghani top tens list do you think are about how bad war sucks?

584
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:19,700
I know, okay, I said that without reading the Justin Bieber thing. I said it without reading

585
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,820
this person's bio because their bio, their about thing just says, "I am personally not a fan of

586
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:31,540
Justin, but I feel that people are really beginning to take everything too far, especially when people

587
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:34,100
People hate the song purely because Justin is in it.

588
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,860
And if you want to put him out of business, stop talking about him.

589
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
Whoa.

590
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,860
So.

591
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,860
That's right.

592
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,580
Don't give him the time of day.

593
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,060
Yeah, don't even give Justin the time of day.

594
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,220
Saying his name gives him power.

595
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:51,140
There's a comment, these comments are not very funny on the war one, but they are funny

596
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:57,020
in how different they are from what we're usually accustomed to from the top tens.

597
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,140
comment says "my grandfather and grandmother were brutally slain in a

598
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,780
massacre 20 years ago" which I just get that's an insane comment to see on this

599
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:12,260
website. Someone says "this has been a very horrible issue ever since ancient

600
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:17,060
times and still keeps going on today" That's from Joe Boy. That's from Noam

601
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:22,700
Chomsky. Yeah. Wow. Wow. Thank You Professor Chomsky. Number two is "corrupt

602
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:29,420
leaders that's right mean parents mm-hmm horrible teachers grow school lunches

603
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:35,260
yeah yeah there's a comment on this this is my one rules yep I wonder why this is

604
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:39,780
a head I wonder why this is a problem cough Democrats cough Obama cough Lyndon

605
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:49,700
B Johnson I'm blaming it all on LBJ yeah it goes all the way back yeah I'm

606
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:53,700
I'm pulling up the US debt clock and just getting pissed off at LBJ right now.

607
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,700
Oh my god.

608
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,700
What did you say?

609
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,700
25 trillion?

610
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:01,860
There's a comment that says, "Especially in Brazil, I hope Bolsonaro will be a good president."

611
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
Oh no.

612
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:06,060
Yeah, and I'm pretty sure this is an old list too.

613
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:07,060
Yeah.

614
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:09,340
Bolsonaro's been great, dude.

615
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,020
He does a funny prank every week where he pretends to die.

616
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,620
Yeah, this list is from 2015.

617
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:18,780
So that person commented saying, "I hope Bolsonaro will be a good president in 2015."

618
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:22,780
Every fucking news article about Bolsonaro that comes out is like,

619
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:26,620
"President Bolsonaro lost a poker game against an evil monkey,

620
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:30,620
and the monkey jacked him off, but not very good, and he couldn't come."

621
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,540
And he's in the hospital right now for that.

622
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,060
He's in the hospital bed just like...

623
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,820
Like he's always got like...

624
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,260
Bolsonaro in the hospital with blue balls.

625
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:44,380
He got such bad blue balls that he had humongous elephantitis yoga ball ballsack,

626
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,700
and now he's in the hospital and they're draining it.

627
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,220
They're draining it.

628
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,260
But for some reason the female nurse can't get anything out.

629
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,420
So they're working on getting him a beautiful man.

630
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,740
- Yeah.

631
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,700
- He's also gay.

632
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:01,540
- What is he?

633
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:02,360
- I don't know, I like him.

634
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,280
I think he has swag, dude.

635
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,260
- Is Bolsonaro gay?

636
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,220
- Yeah, dude.

637
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,140
- Is he? - He's super gay.

638
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,340
- I didn't know he was.

639
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,320
- No, he's not gay.

640
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,980
- He hates and kills gay guys.

641
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,220
- His name is literally short for balls in a romance.

642
00:33:16,460 --> 00:33:23,600
that's think about it yeah think about it and think about chair or Jair how do you

643
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:32,420
pronounce the first name gay exactly yeah the signs are there president

644
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:40,380
Bolsonaro today got stuck in a zip-up bait hoodie and they're having to use

645
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,800
the jaws of life to pry his nose out of the zipper.

646
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:50,940
Ball sack a-hole dude, he wants to do the booyah.

647
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,940
True.

648
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,500
Um, number three is racism.

649
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,840
And the two comments on here are, "Isn't it ironic that white kids are getting racism

650
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,580
upon them?"

651
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,140
And "Everybody can be racist and it's fine.

652
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,140
Unless you're white."

653
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,140
That's true, man.

654
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,420
That's some real shit.

655
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Yeah.

656
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,740
Racism is fine against white people.

657
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,740
That is true.

658
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:13,740
I don't know.

659
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,740
Nobody does care.

660
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,020
I mean, I don't care.

661
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:20,700
Anytime somebody, you know, all the times that I get called a cracker, I barely even

662
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:21,700
blink.

663
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,700
Yeah.

664
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,700
Yeah.

665
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,700
By you too.

666
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:30,060
Every time you two call me a cracker, like it hurts, but I acknowledge that it's fine

667
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:36,220
because I'm white.

668
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:44,460
The reason I wanted to do this list is because at this point it starts to be 50/50 with stuff

669
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:50,620
that's actually making the world suck and some top tens-isms.

670
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,620
Number 4 is immature children.

671
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:56,060
That's true.

672
00:34:56,060 --> 00:35:00,180
Just under war, corrupt leaders, and racism.

673
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:01,460
Immature children.

674
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,180
Immature kids.

675
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:08,840
The creator of the list comments, "At school, kids under 10 talk about drugs and other subjects,

676
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,260
but in an immature way."

677
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:14,620
Yeah, they're talking about drugs.

678
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:20,580
They're like, "I'm gonna do, I'm gonna take a crap on drugs."

679
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:27,060
They're saying freaking goo goo gaga marijuana at school now, and we're just letting this

680
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
happen?

681
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Goo-goo is actually what people in the street call GHB.

682
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:38,180
- Yeah, watch out, your kids are saying goo-goo gaga.

683
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,240
What they actually mean is I'm smoking,

684
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,060
I'm addicted to marijuana.

685
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,620
- I'm addicted to GHB and other research chemicals.

686
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,780
- Yeah, know what your kids are using as shorthand.

687
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,460
Things like mama and dada can actually mean--

688
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,480
- Mama is marijuana.

689
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,660
- Dada is crack cocaine, actually.

690
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,500
- Yeah.

691
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,340
- So just be wary.

692
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:03,340
- If your kid says, "I'm going gaga for PCP,"

693
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,820
they might actually be doing PCP.

694
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:06,660
- Yeah, that's true.

695
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,720
- That's something you should watch out for.

696
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
That's a warning sign.

697
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,420
That's a translation of-- - Mama dada.

698
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,420
I'm addicted to crocodile.

699
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:16,900
They could actually have drug issues.

700
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:19,620
- Bubba, like when a baby wants like its bottle.

701
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,140
No, it's not Bubba.

702
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,740
Bubba actually means barbiturates.

703
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:29,520
Bar-bar-bit-barbituates. They're saying they're gonna take two.

704
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,700
They're gonna take two barbituates just like Marilyn Monroe and they're gonna get

705
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,900
knocked the fuck out.

706
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,980
Yeah. Mama actually stands for Marilyn Monroe

707
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:40,940
who died of drugs and so when they say Mama they're saying that they wanna

708
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:44,940
they say they wanna join the 27 club. They wanna do enough barbituates

709
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,220
to kill an elephant. The 27 month club. Learn the... how about that?

710
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,500
Yeah, that's what they're joining. That's what all these kids are joining now.

711
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,820
Learn the little over two years old. Learn the dangerous

712
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:59,980
acronyms that your kids might be using and abbreviations in their text messages. Like

713
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,700
when a kid says, "Hey, do you want to do LSD?" What they're actually saying is, "Hey, do you

714
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,260
want to do lysergic acid diethylamide?"

715
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:10,460
They're saying, "Let's skate, dude."

716
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,460
Yeah.

717
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,460
That's what they're saying.

718
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,460
Let's...

719
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:20,220
Let's skate, dude. And skating, it means going on the ice. That's cocaine.

720
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,220
Yeah.

721
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,220
Cocaine.

722
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
laid a smelly dump.

723
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,460
(laughter)

724
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,620
That's what they're saying.

725
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,500
Licking...

726
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,700
Yeah, I just LSD'd in the bathroom.

727
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,660
Licking stamps, dad.

728
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,700
Yeah.

729
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,380
Looking secretly at dad.

730
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,060
Your child may be watching you.

731
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,300
(laughter)

732
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,140
Yeah.

733
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:39,980
Your child may be watching you.

734
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:44,220
I plan to put that fuckin' two-way mirror in the office.

735
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,660
The dad takes his son's phone

736
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,500
to look through the text messages

737
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:49,540
and make sure nothing's going on.

738
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,100
They see LSD and he turns around

739
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,540
there's like a hole in the wall and the kid is just peeking through.

740
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:58,100
There's a painting and his eyes are in the painting.

741
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,780
Hey, come to think of it, I don't know, I don't remember hanging this painting up of my son

742
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,100
that has his eye holes cut out.

743
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,700
Did you guys have, did your parents like take your phone and look at it?

744
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,700
No.

745
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,420
A few times, but not, I got very angry.

746
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,020
Dude, I would just go and I'd just nuke my phone, I'd delete everything from it.

747
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,900
As if like, that's less incriminating.

748
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:25,180
like oh my son has never sent a text message. My parents trusted me too much

749
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:31,500
growing up. That is so apparent. Yeah. Yeah. I think we all knew that. How? How is that

750
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:38,100
apparent? You have a guitar and you're addicted to taquitos. What does me having

751
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:44,460
a guitar have to do with it? Bad kids have guitars. Yeah, I see in your room a TV, a

752
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:51,400
guitar there's no TV skateboards well what's that box that's yeah box I see

753
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,640
shoes you know your your parents may not have gone through your phone but I know

754
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,600
who did it was the devil and he liked what he saw when you when you're looking

755
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:04,240
up the tables way to play to play fucking CKY songs I'm converting to

756
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:09,600
Christianity oh yeah be one of those guys now I'm gonna be a trad cat the guy

757
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,880
yeah I think I'm basically gonna be Catholic yeah yeah you're not you're

758
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,720
gonna be one of those Catholic guys it's like well it's fine I figured out how to

759
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:27,600
lower the chair just those guys that be Catholic oh yeah I'm Catholic now

760
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,440
regardless of all the fucking pedophilia whatever being on the left it's it's it's

761
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,920
it you can just be anti-semitic that's why people do it yeah yeah and you don't

762
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,920
you can just disagree with them circumvent having to care about

763
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,360
about pedophilia. Right. Yeah, exactly. You can kind of like if you don't care about

764
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:48,720
the Epstein stuff but you still want to be a leftist, you know, you just become

765
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:53,480
Catholic and then you love pedophiles. Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

766
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,960
Yeah, I know about the Epstein stuff. I love it. I wish he was Catholic too. He

767
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,760
could have done some great work for our church. Yeah, it's really he focuses

768
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:20,880
energy on the wrong place yeah yeah he's he's playing for the other team you meet

769
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,960
another pedophile you really like and you find out that they're a Masai agent

770
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,200
and not Catholic oh I thought no I was thinking like like parents thinking like

771
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,200
"Oh yeah, they play for the other team and it's just like they just go to a different church."

772
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:43,160
Catholic Chris Rock saying there's Catholics and then there's pedophiles.

773
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:51,480
And he's saying it as the pedophiles are the good ones. Yeah. Yeah, because that's funny.

774
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,800
Yo, that's some funny-ass shit, man, for real. Number five is bad music. And the top comment

775
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:02,720
here is music should go back to the way it was in the 1930s and 1940s the era of

776
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,440
proper music and things like electronic dance music should be banned as it is

777
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,120
not music music in the 30s and 40s fucking sucked it was sick dude

778
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:17,360
everything was about playing hopscotch with a girl bird just flying to

779
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:24,080
someone's house what was there a bird in your house? I have a clock that that fuck me dude this

780
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,040
fucking clock you have a bird in your house. Janet got a clock that makes a bird sound on

781
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,920
every hour on the hour and I hate it and I always forget to turn it off before we record it will

782
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:40,720
make me go insane. Caleb that has happened like multiple times during recording and I've never

783
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,760
thought. I know I just forget every single time. That's the first time I've noticed it.

784
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,400
That's happened every. It happens and I'm always like please nobody say anything

785
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,440
Talk about this clock, dude.

786
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,800
It's fucking- I hate it so much.

787
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,360
But it was like- it was like $40.

788
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,840
This fucking stupid clock, dude.

789
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,280
Girls are dumb.

790
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,880
Here's the second comment on this.

791
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,840
Girls are so dumb.

792
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,840
"I used to love rap and pop and then it went downhill on the late 2000s.

793
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,920
More and more bad singers came in.

794
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,360
Hardly any good singers.

795
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,640
From Ralph the Pizza."

796
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,840
Pizza?

797
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
Ralph the Pizza, dude. It's a cool name.

798
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,680
Once we lost Kevin Rudolph, dude.

799
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,320
Yeah.

800
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:22,480
It was basically over. I mean what, everything went downhill as soon as rap and rock and

801
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:27,480
roll combined when Kevin Rudolph made Let It Rock. Bad music. Kevin Rudolph overdosed on

802
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,440
Nas Energy drink. Yeah. He kind of ruined music forever. Have you seen him? Have you

803
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,140
seen him now? He looks awesome dude. He's the best. He looks like he's slowly turning

804
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:45,400
into Blue Strap now. Whoa dude. Yeah, it's awesome. I mean he just looks like every skateboarder

805
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,960
who's like still doing it.

806
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:47,800
- No.

807
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:50,440
- Listen to this comment.

808
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,480
Bad music, the rap genre,

809
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,160
which was considered to be a genre

810
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,000
that would inspire us to problems,

811
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,640
cruelness, helping us going,

812
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:00,440
thought, pain, sadness, pain, et cetera,

813
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:02,720
and rapping about racism, terrorism,

814
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,680
poverty, problems, love,

815
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,120
and that has turned into some really bad genre

816
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,640
that has very similarity to pop music.

817
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,720
I mean like when you hear a new rap song

818
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,680
and then you see there is some girl curvy

819
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,000
and then actually dancing and twerking her ass

820
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
and then literally is mostly made like porn.

821
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,460
Edit, I prefer mostly the old schools era,

822
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:25,580
such as Tupac, Biggie, NWA, Ice Cube, et cetera.

823
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,640
- Kevin Rudolph.

824
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,140
I'm looking at him. - Kevin Rudolph did a new song

825
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,440
with Lil Wayne.

826
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,520
- What? - Whoa, how really?

827
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,200
- He looks like a shitty-- - 2019, whoa.

828
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,880
- He looks like a shitty Hollywood Boulevard

829
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,840
Andrew W.K. impersonator. - Yeah, exactly.

830
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,920
He looks like, actually, yeah, I guess he does,

831
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,800
I'm seeing him with a lot of DC hats.

832
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,680
I guess he does, he looks like Greg Lutska.

833
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,760
- Something about, yeah,

834
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,040
something about these kind of guys,

835

00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:55,960

00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,720

Yeah, that's true.

869
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,880
No, we can get really mad at number seven.

870
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,920
People are too politically correct.

871
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,500
UGHHHHHH!

872
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,360

00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,760
Yeah, it used to be Halo, now it's Call of Duty.

919
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:01,760
Used to be Bam Margera, now it's Pam Margerha.

920
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:07,260
(laughter)

921
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,260

00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:38,260
Kingkos application. I had to get a job.

927
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,260
Yeah.

928
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:44,260
Oh, fuck me, dude.

929
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:51,260
Yeah, it used to be the yin-yang twins.

930
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:55,260
Now it's still the yin-yang twins, but they're Chinese.

931
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,260
So sad. Yeah.

932
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:01,260
Oh my god dude.

933
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:03,260
[Laughter]

934
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:05,260
Ugh.

935
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,260
What did people say about this?

936
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,260
Nothing interesting.

937
00:49:09,260 --> 00:49:11,260
Yeah, it's just basically what we're doing.

938
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,260
People are pussies nowadays.

939
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,260
Yeah. That's true.

940
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:17,260
Number eight is hate.

941
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,260
AGH! You know what I hate?

942
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,260
That it rhymes.

943
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,260
Hate and hate?

944
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,260
That's the hateful eight right here.

945
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:27,260
Yeah, we just found them.

946
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,900
the best answer, says somebody.

947
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,020
- Yeah, I mean, it covers most everything.

948
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,060
- Yeah, you kinda got everything

949
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:34,820
kinda wrapped up into one thing.

950
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,460
Hate is the root of all problems.

951
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,560
Wish I could delete hate from this world.

952
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,580
You basically can.

953
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:41,420
- One of these comments at the end of it--

954
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,980
- Just listen to Crooked Media.

955
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,880
- One of the end of these comments says, "End world suck."

956
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:49,620
- End world suck? - End world suck.

957
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,660
I don't know, I just wanted to say that.

958
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,940
It's a fun phrase.

959
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,360
- End world suck. - End world suck.

960
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,980
number nine is global warming

961
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,900
i'm actually number ten though is what we need to go to a number ten is no family

962
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,460
time

963
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,600
yeah

964
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:09,660
spot on the is for me i hate my family because they treat me like crap i think

965
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:13,960
life wouldn't suck if i never see my family ever again

966
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,880
the internet has taken away all of our family time

967
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:20,000
in the president internet like a l_s_d_

968
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,560
uh...

969
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:27,400
Dude, I love getting together and being on the internet with my four boys.

970
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,400
Really true!

971
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:34,080
We laxually many people out there are born into parents that are not hot and do not have good looking face

972
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:39,640
and then actually their kid are running away and going into people that are more cutier than his or her parents.

973
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,120
That is the problem, dude.

974
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:45,040
The problem is kids think their parents aren't hot and they're running away.

975
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:52,360
Porn has warped the idea of parents so much that we all think we need to have a hot fucking big titted mom and a dad with a huge cock.

976
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:55,800
Look, it used to be modern family, now it's modern taboo family.

977
00:50:55,800 --> 00:51:07,800
[Laughter]

978
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,800
Oh, fuck.

979
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,300
Um...

980
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,160
Yeah, I...

981
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:14,660
I think this is true. No family time.

982
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,200
You know, back in my day, I probably watched the...

983
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,100
Honestly, I probably watched the Italian job with my mom

984
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:26,260
probably 60 times in my life. Yeah. Nowadays kids are going getting the Italian job from 7-11

985
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:33,140
60 times a day. The problem with society now is there's no more Will Ferrell movies to watch

986
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:37,620
with your kids. No, they just put out a new one. I mean what are you gonna do? Is it a Will Ferrell

987
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:43,940
Adam McKay movie? Doesn't matter. It doesn't well that's the problem. It used to matter.

988
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,100
Isn't Chance the Rapper like the biggest fan of the house?

989
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,580
I don't know anything about Chance the Rapper.

990
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:53,380
Patrick keeps track of what Chance the Rapper is a fan of.

991
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:55,300
Yeah, he follows him on Letterboxd.

992
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,060
He checks all his likes on Twitter.

993
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,340
Let's see what Chance thinks about this High Place Part 2.

994
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,260
Chance the Rapper tweeted Chance. I'm gonna call him Chance like he's my friend.

995
00:52:04,260 --> 00:52:05,060
He is your friend.

996
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:07,620
What's his name?

997
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:10,500
Yeah, he's not my friend. I call him Mr. Rapper.

998
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,540
Yeah, Mr. the Rapper.

999
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:16,660
I have to call him Mr. The Rapper when I see him, but when I talk about him.

1000
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:18,180
Mr. The Rapper, I am a huge fan.

1001
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,160
Yeah.

1002
00:52:21,160 --> 00:52:23,700
I don't think he likes the house though.

1003
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:26,580
He strikes me as a Step Brothers fan.

1004
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:27,860
Oh, well, yeah, but...

1005
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,060
Dude, the singing in the sequence.

1006
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:30,100
But who isn't, man?

1007
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,860
That's right, who isn't?

1008
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,740
Who isn't, dude?

1009
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:34,180
I got so much phlegm in my throat.

1010
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:36,260
Sure.

1011
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:36,900
I do.

1012
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,260
Chance the Rapper, yeah.

1013
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,020
Chance the Rapper defends the house against Terrible Rotten Tomatoes score.

1014
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:45,460
He should defend his house against me because I'm gonna come for him.

1015
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:52,580
Yesterday I watched a movie that I never heard of. It had a 17% on Rotten Tomatoes. It was funny as

1016
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:58,820
fuck. I saw the house on on an airplane and I was like, "Oh, that's so weird. They like edited it

1017
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:04,420
so bizarrely for the airplane and it must have been terrible because of that." And then I watched it,

1018
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,380
not the airplane version, it was exactly the same. Yeah.

1019
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:09,780
They just, it's just a crazy movie. I don't even know what it is.

1020
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:12,500
It was probably like, it was probably a fine movie.

1021
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,500
It's basically what my dad does for a living in a movie.

1022
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,900
Yeah, it was pretty, it wasn't very realistic.

1023
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,140
They made a movie about having sex with you, dude?

1024
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,760
No!

1025
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:27,220
No, they didn't.

1026
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:27,780
Yeah, they did.

1027
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:28,920
No.

1028
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,820
Yeah, they did.

1029
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:31,300
Yeah, no.

1030
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:31,780
They did.

1031
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,740
Amateur, amateur cuckoo kangaroo XXX.

1032
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,660
That's what it's called.

1033
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,540
X kangaroo.

1034
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,040
Yeah.

1035
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:41,320
No.

1036
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:41,820
Yeah.

1037
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,280
Dude, we used to all get together.

1038
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,280
There is no website called Xkangaroo.

1039
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,520
Families used to get together and watch home movies.

1040
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,680
Now they all get together and watch X videos.

1041
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
[Laughter]

1042
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,180
That's right.

1043
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:55,480
I'm getting my kids, I'm getting all my kids and my wife together.

1044
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,480
We just got this new flat screen curved LED TV

1046
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:02,180
We're watching E-Fucked.

1047
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:04,480
We're watching The Minion on E-Fucked.

1048
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,080
We're watching E-Fucked penal compilation 13.

1049
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:14,020
That's just how it used to be man. That was what Reagan's America was about.

1050
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,540
Reagan's America was, they were gonna have another, the Minion was gonna continue,

1051
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:24,260
the Reagan was gonna put a bunch of money into the Minion. You guys know the Minion,

1052
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,980
right? I've talked about the Minion. Of course I know the Minion, yeah.

1053
00:54:25,980 --> 00:54:30,700
Beedle, beedle. No, it's not that Minion. Beedle, badabadabadaboo.

1054
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:34,420
They should, someone should put them together. Yeah.

1055
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:40,780
The minion was this video on efooked and it's a fat guy like eating sandwiches while girls

1056
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,620
have sex with him.

1057
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,620
Yeah man.

1058
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:44,620
It's awesome.

1059
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:45,620
It rocks dude.

1060
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:46,620
Yeah.

1061
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,620
Yeah.

1062
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:56,820
Now it's all xhamster and black.com and chinesed.com and hawaiian.com and chinesed.com.

1063
00:54:56,820 --> 00:55:04,320
[Laughter]

1064
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:09,820
Yeah, it's basically the same concept as Blacked where it's super racist and

1065
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,820
everybody watches it but it's a Chinese guy now.

1066
00:55:12,820 --> 00:55:15,320
[Laughter]

1067
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,320
They're breaking stereotypes, dude.

1068
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,820
Yeah, that's true. Yeah.

1069
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:23,320
It's a Chinese guy with a giant dick.

1070
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,280
bask2.com and it's a Spanish guy.

1071
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,520
(laughing)

1072
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,400
- Oh, fuck.

1073
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,440
- Number 11, this is kinda getting philosophical,

1074
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:39,040
anthropological, this is humans.

1075
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:39,940
- Damn.

1076
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,600
- Whoa. - Wow.

1077
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,240
- Holy. - Wow, dude.

1078
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,840
- Holy hell. - Then there's the,

1079
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,960
the lowest comment on this just says, "Muppets."

1080
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,720
- Stupid humans, I'm a alien now.

1081
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,800
- Whoa. - That's a good comment.

1082
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,640
That's like a t-shirt that Patrick would have worn in 2009.

1083
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,480
Yeah.

1084
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,560
I love that, I miss those kind of t-shirts,

1085
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:04,240
but like not the like explicit ones about boobs and beer,

1086
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:07,000
but the ones from Walmart that just made no sense.

1087
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,880
Like I have one, or Jana has one that just says like,

1088
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:12,880
"I hear voices in my head on like a camo t-shirt."

1089
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,280
(laughing)

1090
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,000
Do you guys remember those shirts that would be like,

1091
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,320
it would be like a little stick figure

1092
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:20,160
and it would be like, "Homework? No thank you.

1093
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,720
"I'd rather play video games."

1094
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,720
it was like a diagram of a video game.

1095
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:28,320
The video game, the words video games were like made out of controllers.

1096
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:29,320
Yeah, yeah.

1097
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,320
Yeah.

1098
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,320
It didn't even read as anything.

1099
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,720
It was like joystick, Xbox controller, arcade cabinet.

1100
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:37,720
Yeah.

1101
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:43,720
There was one I had that was just like, I rock, and it was a stick figure.

1102
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:49,520
It was a sleeveless shirt that said I rock, I never wore it, and it was a stick figure

1103
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:50,720
playing a guitar.

1104
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
I miss the Bush era dude.

1105
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,260
What about, they should make a shirt that's like a really buff stick figure and it says

1106
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:01,840
homework I'm gonna kick my teacher's ass and then kids will wear it to school and get in

1107
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:02,840
trouble.

1108
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,840
Yeah.

1109
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,820
If I have to do homework I'll kill myself.

1110
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:11,440
What about like a picture of like FPS Russia blowing up homework with a bunch of thermite.

1111
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,440
Whoa that'd be sick.

1112
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,880
That'd be a good shirt.

1113
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:17,280
I think we're moving into the child's t-shirt market now.

1114
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:18,280
Yeah.

1115
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:19,800
I think we might need to make some kids t-shirts.

1116
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:22,280
Yeah, I mean we already have kill your local griefer.

1117
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:25,080
I have a balloon with poop in it.

1118
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,080
[Laughs]

1119
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:29,080
You know? Stuff like that. Stuff that makes kids laugh.

1120
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:32,080
What do kids... Kids hate homework now.

1121
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,080
Kids love homework.

1122
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:37,080
Yeah, that's the problem with today's generation.

1123
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:42,080
Got these nerd-ass kids like fucking, uh, Ilan Omar's kid.

1124
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,080
Right? Fucking nerd.

1125
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:44,080
Shut up, dude.

1126
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,080
Doing your homework.

1127
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,080
Yeah.

1128
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:48,140
- Man, we used to have homework,

1129
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,720
but now with the freaking pandemic,

1130
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,320
we got to work from home.

1131
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,160
- Right?

1132
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,320
Wow. - Yeah.

1133
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,440
- Wow, dude.

1134
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,000
- It makes you fucking think about shit.

1135
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,160
- It makes you think about life in a different sort of way.

1136
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,560
Man, we used to be kids, now we're adults.

1137
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,400

01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:16,040
I have something wrong with my brain.

1165
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:17,040
Fuck me.

1166
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:18,040
Number 12, feminism.

1167
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:21,000
Someone went Borat on this list.

1168
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,000
Someone went Borat.

1169
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:23,000
Yeah.

1170
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:27,000
Poisonous ideology made by big money eaters.

1171
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,000
(laughter)

1172
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:35,000
Big money eaters? Big money eaters? What does that mean?

1173
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
I want to skip ahead real quick to number 16, which has no

1174
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:43,000
comments and is just a stressful environment. Wait, sorry, the last of feminism

1175
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
is, the last comment is "Gone too far and lies about its past." Like the Jews!

1176
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,000
(laughter)

1177
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:55,000
Number 16 has no comments and is just stressful environment.

1178
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:57,000
That's right.

1179
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:06,000
Now I'm imagining like a group of black guys on a corner saying that black guys used to be the real women of the world.

1180
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
In ancient Mesopotamia.

1181
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,000
Oh like black Israelites.

1182
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,000
Yeah in ancient Mesopotamia the first women were actually black men.

1183
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:21,640
Um, number 19 is clinical depression and the only comment is too much stress and depression.

1184
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:30,760
That's true. Number 43, I skipped ahead a bunch, uh, but number 43 is rule 34. Damn. Whoa.

1185
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:36,440
That's right. That's the opposite, kinda. Yeah. I don't know, I feel like that's actually chill.

1186
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:42,840
I feel like that's not a reason today sucks. Damn, you guys remember how the TSA?

1187
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,040
The TSA!

1188
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,300
Bad sex.

1189
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:50,780
You guys remember how the description of the list said "Please don't put any celebrities

1190
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,780
on here"?

1191
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:52,780
Yeah.

1192
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,700
Number 33 is celebrities.

1193
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,700
Somebody's sticking it to the man, dude.

1194
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,700
Yeah.

1195
01:01:57,700 --> 01:01:58,700
How about rule breakers?

1196
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,700
That should be on here.

1197
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:00,700
Yeah.

1198
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,700
Let's add that.

1199
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,700
Cancer.

1200
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,520
Mumble rap.

1201
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,300
Too many murders.

1202
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:09,980
People not understanding the importance of wearing clothing.

1203
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:13,820
The last one is parents pushing kids around too much.

1204
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:14,940
Facts, dude.

1205
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:15,980
That's seriously true.

1206
01:02:15,980 --> 01:02:17,260
That's facts as fuck.

1207
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:18,260
Facts, no printer.

1208
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:19,260
That is so fucking true.

1209
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,260
Absolutely.

1210
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:21,260
Yeah.

1211
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,660
They basically nailed us.

1212
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,940
Too many murders is right above that one.

1213
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:29,220
It's not murder in general, it's that there's just too many.

1214
01:02:29,220 --> 01:02:31,220
Yeah, if we had a few, that'd be okay.

1215
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,580
Yeah, if there's like 50, 60 murders, you know, that's kind of fine.

1216
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,580
As long as it's state-sanctioned.

1217
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,860
Yeah, as long as, yeah, exactly.

1218
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,860
As long as it's mostly swatting, then it's fine.

1219
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,380
As long as it's mostly Twitch streamers that's dying.

1220
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:44,380
Mm-hmm.

1221
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:47,780
We need to stop streaming on Twitch or someone's gonna SWAT us.

1222
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:48,780
Oh my god.

1223
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,580
Somebody will SWAT Patrick.

1224
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:52,660
I, yeah, I don't...

1225
01:02:52,660 --> 01:02:54,460
Somebody, Patrick is gonna die.

1226
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,940
Yeah, I mean he's done for.

1227
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,940
He's getting SWATed, no problem.

1228
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:58,940
I forgot, I forgot.

1229
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,940
He's also, he's the biggest...

1230
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:01,380
Now I don't wanna do the Twitch stream anymore.

1231
01:03:01,380 --> 01:03:03,420
He's such a big target.

1232
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,420
He's dead.

1233
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,420
Right.

1234
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,420
He's done for.

1235
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,420
You just...

1236
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,420
Patrick's not gonna stream anymore, Caleb.

1237
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,420
You idiot.

1238
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,420
I know.

1239
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,420
That was not worth it.

1240
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,420
I got him scared of swatting.

1241
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,420
Look at his face.

1242
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:16,540
I don't want to do it now.

1243
01:03:16,540 --> 01:03:19,260
Someone's going to swat me as a joke.

1244
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,620
Where do you think, do you think people know where you live?

1245
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:25,020
I don't, can't they trace the IP or whatever?

1246
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,020
Isn't that how they do it?

1247
01:03:26,020 --> 01:03:27,780
Can't they trace the IP or whatever?

1248
01:03:27,780 --> 01:03:28,780
Isn't that how they do it?

1249
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,780
I don't know.

1250
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:31,660
You just ruined Patrick's day, Caleb.

1251
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:32,660
I hope you're happy.

1252
01:03:32,660 --> 01:03:33,660
I am happy.

1253
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:34,660
He looks like he's going to cry.

1254
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:35,780
I don't want to get swatted.

1255
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:36,780
I don't want to get swatted.

1256
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:37,780
You're going to get swatted.

1257
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:38,780
You're going to get swatted.

1258
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,280
- I don't want to get swatted.

1259
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,080
- Here's what you do, here's what you have to do.

1260
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,540
- I don't want to get swatted.

1261
01:03:44,540 --> 01:03:46,820
- First, you have to join the SWAT team.

1262
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,620
So that you, while you're streaming,

1263
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:49,460
you get a call and they're like, we have to go--

1264
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:51,160
- I think my cousin's on it.

1265
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,520
- We have to go kill a guy.

1266
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,300
- I think my cousin is on it.

1267
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,140
So I think I'm safe.

1268
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:55,960
- On the SWAT team?

1269
01:03:55,960 --> 01:03:56,800
- Uh-huh, but he's in a different city.

1270
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,780
- Then you're fine.

1271
01:03:57,780 --> 01:03:58,620
- You should move to that city, man.

1272
01:03:58,620 --> 01:03:59,460
- There's only one.

1273
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:01,740
There's only one, they're like the Avengers.

1274
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,580
- Yeah.

1275
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:04,380
- Yeah, they move around.

1276
01:04:04,380 --> 01:04:06,620
Do the Avengers only protect New York City?

1277
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:08,620
They only protect whites.

1278
01:04:08,620 --> 01:04:09,540
That's true, man.

1279
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:10,040
Yeah.

1280
01:04:10,040 --> 01:04:11,040
That's fucked up.

1281
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:11,540
I know.

1282
01:04:11,540 --> 01:04:12,040
Much like the SWAT team.

1283
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:13,540
The Avengers is racist.

1284
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:15,240
Wow.

1285
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:18,940
The Avengers, if the Avengers were real, they would be extremely racist.

1286
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:19,440
Yeah.

1287
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:19,940
Um...

1288
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:20,440
Explain.

1289
01:04:20,440 --> 01:04:20,940
And that's facts.

1290
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,940
Yeah, you...

1291
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:22,440
Dr. Strange.

1292
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:26,440
For example, Black Panther, extremely racist against whites.

1293
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,940
The Hulk, extremely racist against whites.

1294
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:30,940
Um...

1295
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,940
The Guardians of the Galaxy,

1296
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:35,940
extremely racist against whites.

1297
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:40,940
Doctor Strange, who thinks that all Chinese people are Tilda Swinton.

1298
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:42,940
It's pretty fucked up, right?

1299
01:04:42,940 --> 01:04:44,940
Yeah.

1300
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,940
Yeah. I'm gonna join the Avengers and I'm gonna change it from the inside.

1301
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:49,940
Yeah, I'm gonna make the- we're gonna defund the Avengers.

1302
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,940
I'm gonna be the Chris Dorner of the Avengers.

1303
01:04:51,940 --> 01:04:56,940
Yeah, that's Hawkeye.

1304
01:04:56,940 --> 01:04:57,940
That's not a bad idea.

1305
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,940
No, Hawkeye was bad and then he joined the Avengers and became good and he didn't kill the Avengers.

1306
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:08,260
I'd be hot guy. Yeah? Yeah, pretty much I'd be the hot one.

1307
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:12,820
Yeah, you would. I'd be pretty sick. Yeah, we would do like a... we'd make most of our

1308
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:18,300
money off of calendars. You would be Captain America-ka-ka-ka. Yeah. Yeah, you would.

1309
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:22,820
Yeah, because I'd be taking it down America-ka-ka-ka, Ice Cube style.

1310
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:27,380
No, you'd be the captain of it. You'd be the captain of the America-ka-ka. No, I would change it from the

1311
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:32,700
inside I'm I joined the I joined the Ku Klux Klan so I could make big structural

1312
01:05:32,700 --> 01:05:36,420
changes from the inside of the organization you know it's that the

1313
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:41,540
Avengers still exist in the universe where you join them yeah or did you just

1314
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,180
admit yeah you just said you're joining the

1315
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:51,100
you just admit in yeah Caleb's joy headed to destroy them I'm basically doing the

1316
01:05:51,100 --> 01:05:55,460
I'm like the black Klansman but I'm the white Klansman.

1317
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:59,020
Is that what they- the white Klansman?

1318
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:03,380
I haven't seen that yet, but isn't that- don't they use Adam Driver for that?

1319
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:06,660
So you're saying you're just gonna be Adam Driver?

1320
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:08,060
I'm basically gonna be Adam Driver.

1321
01:06:08,060 --> 01:06:11,340
Alright, then we're- I'm Sexton Gray from Star Wars 100 times.

1322
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:15,460
Then this is great because we have signed you up for the US Marines.

1323
01:06:15,460 --> 01:06:19,540
I'm really excited to start my career as a United States Marine.

1324
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,900
gonna they're gonna everyone got angry at him because he said he signed up for

1325
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:26,220
the Marines after 9/11 because he wanted to get revenge on the Middle East and

1326
01:06:26,220 --> 01:06:29,380
everybody got really mad for like a day and said forgot about it yeah that's so

1327
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,940
fucking funny so awesome dude the thing is like everybody's kind of caught up in

1328
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:37,900
the moment you know I like I probably would have done some dumb shit yeah

1329
01:06:37,900 --> 01:06:40,940
right like you're probably would have liked I probably would have subscribed to

1330
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:46,740
Air America or something that would have been my version I would have I would

1331
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,740
I would have joined the Young Turks.

1332
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,740
Yeah.

1333
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,740
Mm-hmm.

1334
01:06:50,740 --> 01:06:53,740
I would have fought the Young Turks in Afghanistan.

1335
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:56,740
I would have joined.

1336
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:57,740
All right.

1337
01:06:57,740 --> 01:06:58,740
All right.

1338
01:06:58,740 --> 01:06:59,740
All right, baby.
