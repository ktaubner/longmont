9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:13,960
Wee, wee, wee.

10
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:14,800

(singing)

13
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,520
In high school.

14
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,280
We're gonna get DMCA'd for that, Patrick.

15
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,280
In high school, I--

16
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,920
My voice is so beautiful.

17
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,040
It sounds too much like a woman named Mrs. Officer.

18
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,240
It's too perfect.

19
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,280
It's too spot on.

20
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,800
In high school, we got pulled over by a lady cop

21
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,940
and just blasted that song, dude.

22
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,760
We thought it was so fucking funny, too.

23
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,560
We got pulled over, and she gave my friend

24
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,160
a $250 speeding ticket, and we were like,

25
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,120
we're owning you right now by playing a girl cop song.

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,960
Wee, wee.

27
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,320
- You probably made her day, dude.

28
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,940
- That was the thing, she was really hot,

29
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,800
and that was why we started, if she had been like,

30
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,840
just an ugly, normal girl cop.

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,520
if she had been like an ugly if she had been like a Miss Trunchbull you would

32
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,160
have gone to jail for playing that song.

33
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,960
No but I got pulled over by Riley Reid and I started fucking

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:07,960
just blasting.

35
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
Whoa.

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:13,960
Yeah I don't think she was a real cop yeah she was in a golf cart.

37
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,960
That's what you get for driving on a golf course.

38
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,840
I guess you're right.

39
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,720
And yeah we just just blasted you know three or four times Mrs. Officer.

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,720
Damn.

41
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,400
You were pulled over for that long that.

42
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,840
Yeah dude she's got a process on the papers. She wanted to hear the end of the song.

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,080
Yeah she was like "ah" She thought it was all, she thought it was just a long song that repeated a lot.

44
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:40,080
This is a song that we wrote for you ma'am. Yeah right as the as the song is ending you

45
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,280
see her like start to get out of her cruiser and then it starts again she gets back in.

46
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:52,800
She just drives away so slowly. But yeah I respect women cops that are beautiful.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Yes!

48
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,360
Man, I had grocery store sushi.

49
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Yum.

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't know if that's a great idea.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Paws.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What?

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Don't paws.

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Paws.

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't paws.

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You just got paws, dude.

57
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There's nothing you can do.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Oh, no.

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Speaking of paws, I'm neg.

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not.

61
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I still do not have.

62
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,560
Say that one more time.

63
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,920
Neg.

64
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,280
I still do not have.

65
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,680
Okay, you say, your fucking southern accent, you're threading the needle with that fucking

66
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
word.

67
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,920
needle means doing it right and doing it perfectly.

68
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:25,760
That's what somebody says when you do something awesome.

69
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
- You're walking a tightrope.

70
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
I'm sorry, I got my idioms.

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,680
- You're walking on a needle.

72
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,520
- You're walking a tightrope.

73
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,800
- You're walking, you're jumping on a needle

74
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,620
when you say that.

75
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,460
- You're walking the camel through a needle's eye

76
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,300
when you do that.

77
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,920
- Yeah, which is like insanely impressive

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,840
and I'm doing it really well.

79
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,360
- You're like a camel on a string

80
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,000
when you say stuff like that.

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,600
- You're like two camels in a blanket right now

82
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,560
with the way you're acting.

83
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,100
- Imagine a needle that could go through two camels at once.

84
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,760
That's what you're like when you say,

85
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,640
when you're using that word.

86
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:56,120
US military should invest in a weapon like that. A weapon that can go through two camels.

87
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:03,120
I'm sure they've had that problem. I'm sure a lot of their weapons can do that. No way.

88
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,240
ISIS knows to barricade everything with two camels. One camel, a full metal jacket bullet

89
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,240
will just rip through a camel. ISIS is the number one problem in the world I would say.

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,400
doing everything they keep their D dossing all your favorite video games

91
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,140

That's not what happened.

98
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:49,600
He knocks over, he swings his arms around and knocks over the entire display.

99
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,920
He just knocks all the shelves off the wall.

100
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,920
Yo, I'm an influencer.

Yo.

103
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:03,880
No, but if, I think, I'm going to blame that on that guy I met on the train that said he

104
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,880
knew Caleb.

105
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,280

- If I was in a Cypher like that,

144
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,060
I would say the whole,

145
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:09,320
would wrap all of that logic song about the suicide hotline and I'd say I hope

146
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:16,540
you don't do any of that yeah reverse yeah the crowd would go wild at that

147
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,820
punchline once they realized that the whole the whole thing was supposed to be

148
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:25,700

150
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,300

151
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,700
just be up there fucking wrap my address or some I might get it I'll be singing

00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,920
You know, we need to give this kid a lesson.

00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:09,040
I'm gonna take your pants off, lesson number one.

177
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,560
- No, I don't like this lesson.

178
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
- What the hell?

179
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,200
- You're not supposed to like lessons.

180
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,760
- Yeah, dude, learning's hard.

181
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,760

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,360
Take your pants off, show me your butt cheeks.

184
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,360
*laughter*

185
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:20,860
No.

186
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,860

00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,360
I gotta teach you a lesson right now.

189
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,860
You're not making my behind red.

190
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:26,860
I'm your teacher and I'm gonna fucking-

191
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,360
I'm gonna make it blue.

00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
And that's it.

196
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:37,860
It is crazy-

197
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
Pour an acid on your face.

198
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:45,360
It is crazy that like most of our parents did probably get like the shit kicked out of them by a teacher.

199
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,080
I don't think they got the shit kicked out of them.

200
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,880
I don't think they got like jumped in the hallway by the teacher.

201
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,880
I think they did.

202
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,480
I think it's exactly what happened.

203
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,480
Yo, what class you from?

204
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,920

What's your home room?

206
00:08:58,920 --> 00:08:59,920
Yeah.

207
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
You think you can get in this hallway?

208
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
206?

209
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920

210
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
You're in the 400s, motherfucker.

211
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,680
It's 400 block.

212
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,040
It's so funny that it was nuns doing it too.

213
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I know.

214
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,040
A bunch of people.

215
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Well, nuns are the most evil way to moan, dude.

I know.

217
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,040

218
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Dude, New England's a horrible place.

219
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Yeah, nuns beat the shit out of kids and then priests fucking touch the kids.

220
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
It's like, what is going on?

221
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,040
What is going on there?

222
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,040
I mean, that's what happens when you fucking...

223
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,040
A nun is literally just like a witch.

224
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Like it's...

225
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:40,040
It's just a woman who's exiled from society with only one working eye.

226
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,040
It's a witch with a salary.

227
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
Exactly.

228
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:50,000

230
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:59,400
about nuns from like my parents. Exactly. Yeah. The only good story about a nun from

231
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,400
a parent is when your parent says, when your dad is like, "Oh man, you gotta hear the story

232
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,200
about this time that I humiliated the nun in front of the whole class." Or like, "Oh

310
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,520

311
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:31,600

315
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:39,540
tan so you have that olive skin yeah so that's surfing yeah where's a where's the

316
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:42,500
best fuck it where's the best beaches around here I'm trying to forget try to

317
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:46,540
surf where would you go if you were on if you if you got witness protected I

318
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,540
would stay in the same place because they would never expect they would literally

319
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:56,060
never think that right yeah I would just change my name I would change my name to

320
00:15:56,060 --> 00:16:00,500
Cameron better and I would everything else the same live in the same place I

321
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,660
I don't know who you're talking about. I do think the best thing you could do is

322
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:07,700
probably stay in the same place and then if they if anybody ever sees you claim

323
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,740
you were that person's identical twin who has nothing to do with their life.

324
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,940
Because then like like that is such a stupid premise that they would they

325
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,880
would believe it because like why would the government let you do that? You know?

326
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:25,100
You're just like oh no that guy who is ratted on everybody? That should just be the

327
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:28,540
default thing. That should just be what witness protection is. Yeah or actually

328
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:32,460
you know I like art listen you're your twin from I get that a lot actually that

329
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,900
I look like that guy have you ever heard of a doppelganger I think I might be his

330
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:45,100
doppelganger yeah I actually are that or our father donated a bunch of sperms yeah

331
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:53,980
yeah it's one of those it's a Vince Vaughn movie situation and then my mom

332
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,020
- My mom also donated a lot of different sperm

333
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,740
and they mixed the two sperms and they got it.

334
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,500
Like a million clones or something.

335
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,260
- You guys have me totally, totally mixed up.

336
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:04,860
I'm his clone.

337
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,620
They made me in a lab.

338
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:07,460
I'm completely--

339
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,280
- No, you don't get it.

340
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,500
I'm actually his biggest fan and I got plastic surgery

341
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,820
to look exactly like him.

342
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:15,540
And then he just disappeared, so I'm just doing my thing.

343
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,940
- It's a Vince Vaughn situation,

344
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,700
so I gotta go to a dodgeball tournament real quick.

345
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:22,780
I'm sorry to keep you, please don't keep me waiting.

346
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,380
I gotta go to this dodgeball tournament to save my gym.

347
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,220
- Yeah, I'm doing all of the Vince Vaughn movies right now.

348
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,820
- Hold on, I gotta go, there's a wedding down the street

349
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,420
I gotta go to, I'm sorry.

350
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,980
I'm sorry, I can't talk anymore.

351
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,540
(laughing)

352
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,340
Look, I'd love to stay and chat,

353
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,980
but I'm actually a 40 year old intern at Google.

354
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:42,220
(laughing)

355
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,220
- Yeah, no, sorry guys, I heard there's actually,

356
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,260
there's like something going on in cell block 99

357
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,780
that I have to kinda go and figure out.

358
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,180
- My brother's Santa Claus.

359
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,440
(laughter)

360
00:17:54,440 --> 00:18:00,640
No, you guys can totally meet him, if you don't kill me.

361
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,740
You can totally meet my brother Santa Claus.

362
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,340
(laughter)

363
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:08,480
He and he will, if you're nice, get you a present.

364
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,360
So, killing me put you on naughty list automatically.

365
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,200
(laughter)

366
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,620
- Yeah, I think everybody always goes to like,

367
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,240
claims they would go to like Alaska or something, but.

368
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
- I would, are you kidding me?

369
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,900
I wouldn't do that.

370
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,900
fucking then what do you what if the you get in bad with the Bears all of a sudden

371
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:29,220
you're moving back to the store mafia yeah dude yeah what's a bear what if the

372
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,780
Bears think your smell is crazy you get fucking run out of Alaska you're running

373
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,860
out of options dude go to Arizona what if you piss off a cactus you know oh man

374
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,380
you're not drinking water for weeks hell no yeah no more tequila mm-hmm I would

375
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:46,500
move to the if I was in witness protection I would move to the same town

376
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:52,980
is Doug Stanhope and I would befriend Doug Stanhope. Awesome, nice. The town in Arizona that he lives in.

377
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,100
The one that has his like brain-dead wife? Yeah. Then you would just, you'd become his best friend?

378
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,060
I would befriend him and then I would get immediately killed because I would...

379
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:09,220
You'd have one like coarse salt piece of cocaine and just immediately die?

380
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,340
Yeah. I think, I said I would stay in the same place but I'm thinking now I think I might end

381
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,820
end up going to space when I get in witness protection.

382
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,780
Yeah, I'd like to go to Disneyland.

383
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:22,500
No I'm thinking I'm going to go to space and still just live a normal life, like get a

384
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
new identity.

385
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,220
So I'll have a house up on the space station, like the only guy with a house with a picket

386
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,300
fence and just live a normal life while everyone else is doing astronaut stuff.

387
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,420
Like little house just sitting on top of the ISS.

388
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,420
Exactly, yeah.

389
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,700
That's not a bad idea.

390
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,540
I think it'd be nice and quaint.

391
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,820
But yeah, Disneyland's cool too, but nowhere near as cool as space.

392
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,820
could mow your astro turf.

393
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,380
- Y'all mow your ass.

394
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,180
- That's the only joke I thought of for that.

395
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,100
- Mow your astro turf, that's what you got.

396
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,460
- Yeah. - Come on, man.

397
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,720
- I would just yell at the ISS workers constantly

398
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,900
for being too loud.

399
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,820
- Yeah.

400
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,580
- What is Amazon paying you for?

401
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,420
- Yeah, fucking get to work.

402
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,980
- Can you guys play Pac-Man with Rice Krispies

403
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,940
like a little quieter in there, please?

404
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,740
- You know, it's funny that it's one letter off from ISIS.

405
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,100
What are you guys doing in there?

406
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,140
(laughing)

407
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:20,040
guys hiding in plain sight? Clearly they look exactly like ISIS. Nothing! We're doing nothing!

408
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:28,140
We're being very normal in here. We're doing science. Obviously. Yeah, you look and it's

409
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,880
like they have like a laser beam that's beheading like a crash test dummy. Trying to get the

410
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:49,720
most efficient hey man are you a journalist by the way

411
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:59,280
you like a crash test dummy that looks like you

412
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,080
like a tattlet stabbing a model of you over and over you can't say anything

413
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,920
because he looked into his window right you shouldn't have okay it's like it's

414
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:13,920
like a rear window situation like you tore the like a Honda like safety

415
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:22,680
facility and all the crash test like attack of the clones like a pre-programmed

416
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,400
Scream every time I get an accident sounds just like

417
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:34,700
What is that why are they crying before they crash? Oh, we have to see if the crash would make him cry

418
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,800
Why do you keep backing the car up and crashing again?

419
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:47,600
Dummies watching gay porn on the vehicle screen. It's supposed to be accurate simulation real life

420
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:53,260
Yeah, if you if you were you would obviously be distracted if gay porn showed up on your your display

421
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,480
I'm

422
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,760
Do you guys be she eclipse

423
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,640
Do you guys really have to test for the car like the cars for what would happen if a crazy guy was in the passenger seat?

424
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,880
And stabbing the dummy to death. I don't think that that

425
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:12,040
Scientist walks out of the bathroom with a crash dummy zipping his pants up

426
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:16,040
Come on man, that's me

427
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:24,200
What the fuck? How come you made them so short? Why do they all have giant holes in the mouth?

428
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,160
What the fuck is wrong with Honda, dude? Fuck you.

429
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:33,440
Yeah. Yeah. I do think it's funny also just imagine

430
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,720
the people who crash test cars being scientists also.

431
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,520
Yeah. They're just like guys.

432
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,120
Well, they are, right? They're not scientists, dude.

433
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:48,800
Well, there's got to be one scientist. No, they're you what do you see you you they're the fucking mythbusters, dude

434
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:56,480
They're not scientists. They're probably monsters are scientists special-effects people. That's a science. That's not a science. It's an art

435
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:04,120
Art is science. Sometimes Wow, they wear lab coats and TV commercials. So they're scientists. That's the final word

436
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,800
Yeah, if you're wearing a lab coat, you're a scientist or a doctor

437
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,860
Doctors are scientists. What if you're a good sure? Yeah

438
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,520
White Dracula yeah, the white the Gandalf. That's not a lab coat. That's a cape. Yeah, it's true

439
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm gonna tell me what the difference is one's a cape one's a coat. It's pretty fucking obvious

440
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:26,320
Yeah, one's velour ones like cotton. What about a cat and the cowl - yeah a lab now

441
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:32,640
That's a lab coat with a bad idea. Yeah a lab pretty cool. That's a really good idea a lab cape. Yeah

442
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,260
You could have like like a brooch of like a mystical brooch on it

443
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,860
maybe. Also why do scientists and chefs dress so similar? Shouldn't a scientist

444
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,720
be in like a hazmat suit all the time? Aren't you doing weird shit? Chef is like a food

445
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,640
scientist if you think about it. There are food labs in Boston. Jake Kenji

446
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,940
Lopez Alt. Mm-hmm. Supreme food scientist. That's true. He's always teaching me how

447
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,100
to drink and cook at the same time. Make mayonnaise. I love those videos of him

448
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:06,180
when he's just clearly an alcoholic. He's like a chef.

449
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:11,780
of course. Yeah he's just like chugging, chugging fucking like bourbon as he makes a quesadilla

450
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:16,660
at three in the morning and trying to like not wake up his family and then the videos are

451
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:22,340
everybody's like wow this guy's a genius he makes eggs and cheese. Oh yeah dude every scientist

452
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:28,340
every like most chefs are just like I'm sure I'm sure Anthony Bourdain has like skewed my

453
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,500
my perception of chefs. He was sober. He was straight edge famously. No chefs are...

454
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
no of course but he's a fucking what

455
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
degenerative drug addict

456
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I know

457
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
it's not just Anthony Bourdain

458
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
the chefs are like that

459
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
oh yeah there's so many chefs that just fucking

460
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
there's so many chefs

461
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
too many chefs, too many cooks

462
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
I think chef is one of the most

463
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I don't know what it is

464
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
chef is your favorite movie

465
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
it is one of my favorite

466
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
if I had to watch

467
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
like if there was a

468
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:06,260
death row last movie it would be chef. Alex was telling me the other day about like a

469
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,180
time like the first time that you saw it you went to a ccc meeting and you were like you guys i

470
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:21,220
saw the best movie last night. I love it. I love chef. Dude I fucking love chef. Oh no me too.

471
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:26,740
Unapologetically. Me too. Any story that anybody, I don't remember that. I'm not gonna deny it. I'm

472
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,700
I'm sure I fucking did. I'm sure I told everybody. I'm sure that I was I was talking about it at work.

473
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,940
It's the best movie. Oh, it's so good. It's so fucking awesome, dude. Jon Favreau.

474
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,100
It's just a movie about nothing. It's just a movie about like the coolest...

475
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:40,220
It's about a chef!

476
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:45,820
It's a movie about just like a cool guy. Like there's nothing, there's no stakes at all in that movie.

477
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,380
Fucking fat guy, fucking tens, and then he fucks an 11 at the end.

478
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,740
Mm-hmm. And then he fucking best friend John Leguizamo.

479
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,860
Dude, if my best friend was the pest and I can make a Cubano,

480
00:25:55,500 --> 00:26:01,580
It is my life. I'd be the light. He's also making white what he chose Cubano's as like the thing that he makes

481
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:09,020
Yeah, like Jon Favreau making Cubano's for an hour and a half fucking Scarlett Johansson and the mom for modern family and the pasta

482
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,740
Pasta g l'olio make chef - I

483
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,820
Need you to chef in space

484
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:21,860
Chef chef anywhere dude. Do he get hired by SpaceX? I don't care if the second movie

485
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,980
I don't care let's let's fucking let's work this out don't suffer let's

486
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:29,460
franchise it I think - I think - too early for space I think okay yeah space

487
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:43,500
yeah that's a good chef - back to Civil War era he's making like hard tack I

488
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:47,860
still making Cubano's dude nobody knows what it is yeah yeah he's made he's

489
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:54,580
using fucking discarded legs as the pork. Yeah, oh man the letters he would

490
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,540
write to Sofia Vergara. Oh my god. I want to see those. I want to see the

491
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:03,100
drawings that she sends back actually. I'm more interested in that. He still has

492
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,260
his fucking little annoying kid. Yeah, his kid who plays TF2 on his iPad. And then get

493
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:15,200
this right the third one chef three colon three chefs. There's three of them this

494
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,120
time when he went back in time when he went back forward in time there was a

495
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,640
glitch and three of them was created like it's like the movie duplicity mm-hmm

496
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,480
where it's like there's a there's like a smart there's like the normal guy and

497
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:32,680
then there's like a kind of evil one and you can't leave the one lady do chef

498
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:40,200
slitty chef's that's what we'll call it chef chef's lady I thought was chef

499
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:48,900
three three chefs I like that okay okay chef three too many cooks chef three two

500
00:27:48,900 --> 00:28:00,700
one show yeah okay chef three two one yeah three two one black chef three two

501
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,840
one blast off yeah and then chef four is when they fuck in and then they have

502
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,320
Jed Leguizamo is the-

503
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,520
- Jed Leguizamo, John's brother.

504
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,440
- Jed Leguizamo, yeah, and he's playing,

505
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,120
he's doing Sid the Sloth as the captain.

506
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,920
He's like, "Ready for takeoff, chef."

507
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,800
- He's an alien.

508
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,280
He's an alien who looks exactly like Sid the Sloth.

509
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,680
- That's a genius move.

510
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,880
- Okay, then the fourth one is the clones.

511
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,160
- Chef Four, four chefs.

512
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,080
- Four chefs only.

513
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,160
The gimmick is you can only buy a ticket to the movie

514
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,040
if you're a chef.

515
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,880
- Yep.

516
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,720
- Four chefs.

517
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,680
- Oh, it's like the drummers only.

518
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,520
- Just imagine-

519
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,680
- It's like a double meaning.

520
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,200
There's four chefs in the movie and four chefs in the theater.

521
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,360
Imagine that the, so if we're going like with duplicity rules for cloning,

522
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,400
Duchesslity.

523
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,400
Duchesslity.

524
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,200
And the dumb chef,

525
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,320
the food he would make.

526
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,480
Sandwich.

527
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
That's a very... Peanut butter and jelly. There's a lot of, there's a lot of

528
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,120
funny things that we could do with that dumb chef. Water.

529
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,760
Cereal with water. He makes like a,

530
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,080
like an Uncrustable with like salsa in it.

531
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,000
But so wait the original Jon Favreau chef is in the movie right? Yes he's cloned four times.

532
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,040
So are the clones... Three times. Wait yeah hold on hold on hold on. Is he cloned three times?

533
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,280
He's cloned three times there's four chefs. So it's him and then three clones. He's cloned four times

534
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:26,960
and that and every time that he gets cloned it removes a little bit of his cooking ability so

535
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,520
he has to hunt down the clones and kill them to get the cooking he to become a chef again.

536
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,120
it's a horror movie dude and then the fourth chef the dumb chef is now it's

537
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:42,120
action it's action last house on the shelf it's action comedy okay okay all

538
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:48,560
right I'll tell it's a crossover with Barry I'm still Barry involved because

539
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:52,200
it's I don't know action comedy is that show an action comedy I never saw what

540
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:55,040
about it's a crossover with funny John wick the movie that I've been writing

541
00:29:55,040 --> 00:30:01,440
for a while. Okay, you mean Nobody with Bob Odenkirk? No, this is Funny John Wick. That's exactly what

542
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,120
that movie is. No, mine's like a stoner comedy. It's still John Wick. Seth Rogen's in it and he's

543
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:14,880
like, "Ugh, John, you should smoke weed." And John's like, "Will this make me cooler?" And he's like,

544
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,200
"Ugh, you know." Oh yeah, no, he smokes weed and he goes into bullet time. Yeah, oh actually,

545
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,160
how about this? Seth Rogen and John Wick trying to buy alcohol. They're trying to get a fake ID.

546
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:36,080
and they're 26 yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

547
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,000
they're de-aged to look five years old yep yeah they have to buy booze yeah

548
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,280
this is already but they had he's still it's funny John wick has all of his

549
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:49,400
powers still of his assassin ability yeah powers yes he does he does in this

550
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:54,480
one is up his powers a fucking gun okay yeah okay he smokes weed and it gives

551
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:01,360
him a power uh-huh splatter you're right bullet time yeah yeah now he is neo uh-

552
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,960
huh all of a sudden you know what if John wick was in the matrix he was the

553
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,080
John wick tricks what no fancy John wick tricks John wick John day tricks

554
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:18,720
fan theory John wick took place in the matrix if you think about it yep no way

555
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
you could be that good at assassinating. Exactly, because the actors are all the

556
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,480
same. Every actor is in each movie. Both. All right, let's just circle. Caleb, can

557
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:33,320
you explain what Funny John Wick? I told you, dude. Opening shot. Seth

558
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:39,000
Rogen. Can you read some of Funny John Wick? All right. Interior. Seth Rogen's

559
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:47,760
apartment. Night. Seth Rogen lights up a fire bowl, right? Or a bong. Or actually,

560
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,260
know what it's a dab rig you can rewrite it as much as yeah well no this is all

561
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:58,280
in the script mm-hmm he goes to hit it there's a knock on the door who's that

562
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:04,240
he gets up he walks over the door looks into the peephole nobody's there wait

563
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,760
things are getting kind of weird and funny John wick hold on who's behind him

564
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,840
John wick it's not funny yet but he's about to be he goes to slit Seth Rogan's

565
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:22,860
throat Seth Rogen goes no dude I fuck I don't fucking die and John Wick says

566
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:28,560
give me give me one reason why I shouldn't kill your junky ass and Seth

567
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,600
Rogen says how about this dude puts a joint in his mouth lights it John Wick

568
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,400
starts getting high as a hell all of a sudden cut to 30 minutes later they're

569
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:42,800
watching Paul they're fucking laughing their ass off on his couch John Wick

570
00:32:42,800 --> 00:33:06,300
gives up being an assassin and the rest of the movie is pretty much chef we could

571
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:13,780
do that if that could be the chef prequel in our in the franchise uh-huh big

572
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:16,940
restaurant that's how he gets like his restaurant of the crowd it's all that

573
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,900
money yeah Charlie has that nice house in the movie dude he's funny

574
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:25,420
really is a briefcase of pirate coins - yeah true true the Assassin League

575
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:31,980
assassin the assassins families favorite money doubloons silly bucks

576
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:38,180
Fan theory John wick was a pirate he was why does he have all these damn doubloons

577
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,420
it's a really good point me yeah yeah anyway that's pretty much my movie some

578
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,540
fan theories are just lucky genius when you think about them some fan theories

579
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:51,240
just click and make sense you know it's funny it's funny how many fan theories

580
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,340
ruined big franchises like like Star Wars for sure got ruined by every like fan

581
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,280
theory channel that exists I think there was Disney oh no yeah obviously but like

582
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:07,360
every like anybody doesn't want to hear anything about Star Wars by the way just

583
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:13,220
skip yeah okay so probably the goodbyes give one extra give one other franchise

584
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,420
that's been ruined by fan theories we should just play like you know you

585
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:20,860
played me up people play music and podcasts like during the ad so you can

586
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:24,300
just 15 second forward until you skip past it we just play the Star Wars

587
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,540
theme anytime Matt talks about Star Wars so people just skip until it's over. Not really

588
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,180
dude come on I know you love it. I just don't think there's another I don't think he had

589
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:38,540
any I think he just wanted to talk about Star Wars I don't think there's another movie that

590
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:45,500
you could say that about. No there well Indiana Jones. So go ahead. I've been saying it for so long.

591
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:51,020
I'm thinking of one right now but I read somewhere that. I know you only had Star Wars in your head

592
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:58,580
right yeah I I read somewhere that like some producer said like like some of the

593
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:02,500
things that they were thinking of while they were like fans figured it out and

594
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:06,700
then they had to like rewrite it that happened at last right I think so that's

595
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:10,140
what I'm thinking of you should talk about lost instead why the fuck would I

596
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,820
ever talk about law this is not Star Wars did loss is awesome I never watched lost

597
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:20,300
well lost and Star Wars were both directed by JJ Abrams so you just had a

598
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:26,380
nerd voice checkmate JJ Abrams JJ Abrams that's exactly how you sounded when you

599
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:31,340
said that yeah well the two pieces of cinema actually share a common

600
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,100
director sound a bit like you sound a bit like a fool when you bring that up

601
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,100
you know you sound like what a jock and awesome fucking badass who comes up with

602
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,580
cool stoner comedy guy drinking on a John wick I'm not drinking water drinking

603
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,860
red thunder shut the fuck up oh that's facts I should have said something

604
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:50,500
and better I wouldn't have been able to defend himself because he had water in his mouth.

605
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:55,340
Then you could also do like Ghost of Christmas Wick or Ghost of Girlfriend's Wick.

606
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,340
Ghost of Girlfriend's Wick.

607
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:59,820
So this is like so the franchises are together it's all one franchise.

608
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
Well okay so John Wick 3.

609
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,820
Chef and John Wick.

610
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,340
John Wick 3 was pretty cool right?

611
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,340
Yeah.

612
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,140
But you're also like is this all this fucking guy can do is kill people all day because of

613
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:10,140
some fucking dog or whatever.

614
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,660
Well can't he do parkour too?

615
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,780
Well that's a that's a type of killing people.

616
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:18,940
that would have to be more of a web series because they have like cool YouTube

617
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:22,620
videos of John Wick doing parkour you know but I want to see I want to see him

618
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,860
branch out because John Wick what a talent once in a generation you know and

619
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,620
I want to see him do fucking rom-com and I want to see him do a bunch of cool

620
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:35,820
shit not Keanu Reeves John Wick yeah what if John Wick had an excellent adventure

621
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,220
how about that's a really good see John Wick should have popped up in that movie

622
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,500
in the new reboot mm-hmm well I haven't seen it so he could like you could have

623
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,300
killed Hitler dude that's probably what he would have done cuz he's such a good

624
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:50,180
oh dude a time-traveling John wick dude John wick Valkyrie let's go dude that's

625
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,460

664
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:03,220
derailed the entire episode having some genius ideas and being yeah and nobody

665
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:08,960
on this podcast has ever derailed the whole episode yeah this is something

666
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,720
that's right that they thought of doing a fucking 25 minute video essay about

667
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:18,220
wado on the podcast mm-hmm you should start doing video essays yeah you should

668
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:21,580
where I don't know how to do it at all and the whole thing is just me being

669
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:27,020
like and then the fucking uh just remembering names for some reason you're talking about

670
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:31,900
like 70s classic rock at some point yeah just because and you know and you know plo kun he's

671
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:40,460
kind of like a fucking uh what's that fucking that uh it's not yeah not editing at all doing

672
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:44,460
doing the thing that youtubers do where they like jump cut in the middle of a sentence because they

673
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,340
like paused for half a second but just doing just doing it just in between just going like

674
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:54,540
"Oh, fuck, what is-" and then cut. "Oh, man, fuck, what was it called?" Just doing this,

675
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,180
cutting to you being confused over and over again.

676
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:00,860
When did people - when did like every YouTube video become two hours long?

677
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,060
It sucks, dude. It's so evil.

678
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:06,140
It's fucking crazy. I've been stuck inside watching videos, watching like - I'll click

679
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:11,980
on a video and be like, "Oh, that's interesting." Like something so stupid about like half-life,

680
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,540
and then I'll look and it's fucking three hours long.

681
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:20,240
yeah it's cuz of like YouTube only like pays you for the ad monetization if it's

682
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,660
a certain length or something that makes sense because anytime there's one of

683
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,460
those it's gonna be like but before we talk about that we're gonna need to talk

684
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:31,140
about the advent of electricity exactly talk about how video games happened and

685
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:34,160
then they'll talk about half-life in the last it'll be it's always it's always a

686
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,220
13 minute video and the first 10 minutes is just them like just clips from the

687
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,200
other videos on their channel oh man what I don't want to bring up Star Wars again

688
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:49,500
but like every like do yeah no cuz every fucking like Star Wars like I hate to

689
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:55,500
bring up right now I hate it now for me because I know you guys are just gonna

690
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:04,300
make fun of me what what I'm saying is like every Star Wars video at a certain

691
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:07,420
point where it's like a lore explained there's like one guy on you think I

692
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,900
think it's like Star Wars theory or like lore explained or some shit like that

693
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,220
that and he will make like a video where it's like 10 minutes long and then at a

694
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,220
certain point you can tell that he's just repeating himself so he's just like

695
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:23,020
Caleb do you want to start like a second call? Yeah dude that'd be fucking awesome.

698
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:37,940

756
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:35,260
say, "Hey, have you seen this?" And usually it was the same picture of a humongous penis.

I need a slushie from Sonic with a buffalo sauce

808
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,920
and a donut. - And that makes the fist.

809
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:24,600
They also own something called Rusty Taco.

810
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,600
- A rusty taco? - I'm not eating

811
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:28,280
that rusty taco, dude. - Rusty Taco, that is like--

812
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,160
- That's a horrible name 'cause tacos do have

813
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,840
like a rust quality to them, like taco ground beef

814
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:33,680
when it has that like orange shit.

815
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,760
- Rusty Taco sounds like an Urban Dictionary article,

816
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,160
like whatever the fuck, Urban Dictionary page from like 2008.

817
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,160
Sounds like shitting in a girl's belly button.

818
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,160
That, yep.

819
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,160
I was gonna say shitting in a pussy, but...

820
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,160
Oh, what the hell is wrong with you?

821
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:49,160
Shitting in a pussy.

822
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,160
Okay, okay, me saying that if you read some of the things on Urban Dictionary, they're way worse than that.

823
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,160
Have you seen what they're saying?

824
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,160
This dictionary, it's too urban!

825
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,160
This dictionary's too urban!

826
00:49:01,160 --> 00:49:04,160
That was me when I first moved to Queens.

827
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:08,160
I just started walking around, and I was like, "Hey."

828
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,640
- Hey, what up man?

829
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:11,020
You heard of a chili dog?

830
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:15,960
Yo, let me get a rusty trombone.

831
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,560
(laughing)

832
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,920
And he's like, yeah, that's actually urban as hell.

833
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,120
So I will give that to you.

834
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,540
- It is crazy how food chains are just owned

835
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:29,820
by one giant company.

836
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,360
- Yeah, I'm reading about Inspire brands

837
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,680
right now on Wikipedia.

838
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,800
- And I'm fucking inspired.

839
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,360
- All brands inspire me.

840
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:42,040
when they it started as Arby's and they took ownership of Buffalo Wild Wings and

841
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,440
became inspired brands and then they also got the rusty taco chain and then they

842
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:56,680
changed they changed the rest the name of rusty taco to our taco yeah that one

843
00:49:56,680 --> 00:50:02,280
this is what is the only way we really have to the country the Philippines I

844
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:13,080
I think Jollibee... oh wow they own... oh it's called Red Ribbon. It's a bakery chain.

845
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:20,560
It's a knockoff. Yeah I thought I was like holy shit Jollibee owns Red Robin. Jollibee is owned by like a

846
00:50:20,560 --> 00:50:25,480
giant like... No it's called the Jollibee Foods Corporation. A giant monster that lives in a

847
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:29,440
cave in the Philippines. Yeah the bee. It's like a yeah yeah it's the bee it's like Slurm and

848
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,720
Futurama. Oh they own they own Smash Burger. They own Smash Brothers? No way.

849
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:39,160
Yeah. They own Super Jollibee and Smash Brothers. They should have a fast food Smash Brothers.

850
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,200
Where all the fast food people fight. Yeah like food fight. That could be the

851
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,200
name of the game. Yeah. It could be different from the movie.

852
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,480
Mm-hmm. It is funny that that movie the only like brand that stayed in was like

853
00:50:54,480 --> 00:51:03,080
Starkist tuna yeah everything else is just made up yeah yeah yeah wait like the

854
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:07,920
fucking like the the ads for it this summer Charlie the tuna it's gonna Charlie

855
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:13,000
the whale from Starkist tuna it's gonna be fucking in your living room yeah

856
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,800
that's already in my living room in my damn kitchen mm-hmm

857
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:25,240
in my pantry. He's already in my living room smeared all over my couch cushions. Do you

858
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:29,480
think we could do an entire like feature film if we just got like a hundred

859
00:51:29,480 --> 00:51:33,840
thousand corporate sponsorships? We could. And just like put them all in the movie

860
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:37,120
like pay for the entire movie with that like a like a like a twenty million

861
00:51:37,120 --> 00:51:41,520
dollar budget. We should try to do that. Just like get a bunch of

862
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:46,640
companies to pitch in like 50 grand you know and then just every second of it is

863
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:50,880
is an ad. That's what the Marx Brothers did with Love Happy. The Marx Brothers were

864
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,760
idiots. Yeah, that's I think Love Happy is like one of the first appearances of

865
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,320
Marilyn Monroe in a movie. I'm not sure if that's true. We should we can just ask every

866
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:04,840
brand for like $20. Yeah. That's like a gimme. They're like yeah of course.

867
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,680
Free advertisement. And we just ask we just ask a hundred thousand brands. Yeah.

868
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,640
We just do like a full million dollars. We guarantee them like you get a 20

869
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:20,720
second for every for every $20 that you give you get like like a 10 second like

870
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,320
Transformers beats ad yeah you remember those movies oh yeah yeah yeah like we

871
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:31,720
gotta stop the damn Decepticons but first let's listen to this dr. Dre song yeah

872
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,520

873
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:41,680
machine or whatever just yeah just sits there completely still for three seconds

874
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,680
That's a way to make movies, dude.

875
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,680
That's a fuckin' way to make movies.

876
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,680
Scorsese should've... he could take a...

877
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,680
He should've put Charlie the whale from Starkist 2 to...

878
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:52,680
Yeah.

879
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,680
You see this fuckin' guy right here? That's Charlie the whale.

880
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,680
You're gonna wanna fuckin' talk to this guy.

881
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:00,680
Any seafood you need, you fuckin' talk to this guy.

00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
"I heard you eat tuna."

883

"Hey, I'm Charlie the whale. How are you doin'?"

884
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Yeah, he could've been... I mean, Charlie the whale, by the way, great mafia name.

885

888
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:26,360
But I'm gonna tell you this.

889
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,860
You come to the docks. I'll give you a free lobster. You can ride on my back.

890

cancer from all the fatal aids that they're putting into fucking water. That's right.

894
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:58,280
We're doing an environmental message in the Irishman. Do you say that fatal aids? Yeah.

895
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,000
Yeah. That's what they, that's what plastics give you is fatal aids. Fatal aids? That's

896
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,960
so much scarier than normal aids. What the fuck? Especially since it starts with a PH.

897
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,800
(laughing)

898
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,880
It's fat, it's fattle.

899
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:11,000
- Yeah, fattily.

900
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,640
Is it pronounced fattily?

901
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,480
It might be.

902
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,680
- I don't know what that is at all.

903
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,040
I don't care about the environment or anything.

904
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:18,220
I like video games.

905
00:54:18,220 --> 00:54:19,760
(laughing)

906
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,980
It's just the truth, dude.

907
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:23,680
- I like computer monitor and I like webcam.

908
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:25,200
- I used to care about politics

909
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,880
and I used to care about shit like that.

910
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:31,720
Now I'm, dude, just give me that screen.

911
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:33,560
- It's all about sitting down.

912
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:34,400
- I love sitting down.

913
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,280
I want to maximize sitting down.

914
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:43,080
I have the greatest sitting down job that anybody's ever had and yeah I just love it.

915
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:46,120
I want to swim in the LCD swamp.

916
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,040
Until I get taxed for my sitting down job and then I will become a Republican instantly.

917
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,040
Oh me too.

918
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,080
Dude I will be doing the most swagged out Republican shit pretty soon.

919
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:56,280
You guys are not going to believe how Republican we get.

920
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:59,760
Dude we're going to be like culturally Republican all of a sudden.

921
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,920
Another thousand dollars and I think that's it.

922
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:03,920
No turning back.

923
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:04,920
I'm flipping the switch dude.

924
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:08,600
we're all straight I'm gonna become a bowtie guy even though I never leave my

925
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:13,800
house yeah I'm gonna start fucking oh man I'm gonna care so much about gun control

926
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:20,400

927
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,240

928
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:27,920

929
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:37,280
Quincy Beauregard at Turning Point USA. Yep. I'm gonna say. That's right. Well what the

930
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,400
Democrats don't understand is that it's more fun to be a Republican. We need to

931
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:46,200
go back to the poop standard. That's gonna be me. Base everything off of poop. That's right.

932
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:53,120
Republicans can tell jokes too. Yeah exactly. We're gonna say that after every joke we make on the

933
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,400
podcast. It is kind of funny that I think you become a right-wing comedian

934
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,140
instantly you're just like selling out stadiums oh yeah like great like the next

935
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:07,020
day dude it's so late they're so hungry yeah they're I mean literally so many of

936
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,140
them are in it for the money like yeah they'll probably have like some

937
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:13,320
right-wing views but like the way that they just ham it up is just like like

938
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:17,760
dude Nick DiPaolo Nick DiPaolo couldn't fucking sell out Caroline's ten years

939
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:22,320
ago and now he like does theater tours where he's like yeah Barack Obama's a

940
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:35,640
fucking black guy and then everybody's like it is funny just how many of those

941
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:39,080
like like comedians that were on like tough crowd and shit just like weren't

945
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,320

00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:05,440
That's my job. Yeah, that's what I've been doing every night

947
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:13,320
How dare you take the one joy a father has turning his son into a sissy little girl
