00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:07,360
- [Computer] Father God's to the west.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,160
- Crap monster.

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,500
(screaming)

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,340
- Woo!

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,160
- Oh, God.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,000
- Make a noise.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,160
- Pow!

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,800
- Pow, I just shit my pants.

10
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:20,640
- Oh.

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,960
- Oh, that's nasty.

12
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,800
- Oh, hell no.

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,040
- That's what Mark Maron says, come on.

14
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:25,880
- Who?

15
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,360
I don't know who that is.

16
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,480
I'm 15.

17
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
That's father god to you, honey.

18
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:30,980
Oh my god.

19
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,480
Respect on his name.

20
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,180
I literally have never heard of that guy.

21
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:36,180
I know Howard Stern and Man Cow.

22
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,980
And those are the only people I've ever known to pick up a microphone.

23
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,680
Howard Stern, hottest man alive.

24
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,780
Yeah, I said it.

25
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,280
Still.

26
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:42,780
Still.

27
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,780
Yeah, I liked that him and like Gene Simmons just kind of melding into one.

28
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:47,780
Kind of like...

29
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,480
One big pro-Israel...

30
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,280
Candle.

31
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,280
Yeah.

32
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,180
Yeah.

33
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,280
I think they look good, man.

34
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
I hope that that's how I look when I get older.

35
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,080
Somehow I grow like insane hair.

36
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,800
Gene Simmons hair looks like that wind guard on your mic.

37
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,640
Yeah it does, so like frayed.

38
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,040
It looks exactly like that.

39
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,840
And you'd be lucky to have hair like that at an age like that.

40
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,840
Are you serious?

41
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:12,840
If I could get those plugs.

42
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,840
At 110, you'd have that kind of hair?

43
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
It's impressive man.

44
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
I wish.

45
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,120
We're here with Sarah Squirm, the richest person alive.

46
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,800
Mostly the richest person alive.

47
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,800
You see these crocs?

48
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,800
Beautiful hotel.

49
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,800
Oh my gosh.

50
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,800
You see these crocs?

51
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:35,080
in them. Yeah. Where'd you get those? The store, ever heard of it? I thought about getting Crocs the other day, but I

52
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:45,800
wasn't gonna get, I walked by the Crocs store and I was like, I can't. What store? You want them at all? Shut up! You're wearing Crocs, where'd you get them? The store. You're a fucker.

53
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,520
- Come on, were you born yesterday?

54
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,520
- Yeah, I told you that already, I'm 15.

55
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,880
- Oh God, I actually do hate that you guys

56
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,720
are younger than me, I don't like hanging out with anyone.

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,040
- I thought that we were the same age.

58
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,440
- Is that true?

59
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,280
- Yeah, yeah.

60
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,100
- So you don't think I look--

61
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,940
- I thought we were around the same age.

62
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,760
- Really?

63
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,440
Do I look 28?

64
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,680
- Oh, I didn't know you were 28.

65
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,520
- Oh, come on!

66
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,360
- Oh my God!

67
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,180
- What?

68
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,200
- Am I in trouble?

69
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,240
- I actually don't like hanging out with 23 year olds.

70
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,000
- I feel like we're so allowed to be in your hotel room

71
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
right now.

72
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
- Yeah.

73
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
- I got some boys in my hotel room.

74
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,120
It's funny because Pat loves hanging out with 18 year olds.

75
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,120
That's not true.

76
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,120
Yeah you do.

77
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,120
I hang out with people way older than me.

78
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,120
17 year olds.

79
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
So yeah, my bad.

80
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,120
No.

81
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Why do you guys do this to me?

82
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
I actually don't know your guys' real names to be honest.

83
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,120
You guys all have weird names online.

84
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Mine is Patrick.

85
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
No it's not.

86
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,120
Yeah it is.

87
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Mine's Cameron.

88
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,120
No it's not.

89
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,120
My name is just my full legal name on there.

90
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,120
Caleb Pitsch.

91
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,120
I think all of us just have our names.

92
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,120
I feel like you don't.

93
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,120
No we do.

94
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,460
- Don't you have weird little images as your pictures?

95
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:47,120
- Well I have a phrasal impersonator in mine.

96
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
- Of course we have weird little images.

97
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,680
- Do you have a weird little image as your photo?

98
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,640
- Yeah, you better believe that.

99
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,480
- So yeah.

100
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,640
- But that is me, my photo is me.

101
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,560
- Mine is too, unfortunately.

102
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,680
- Yeah.

103
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,880
- I know somebody who said that they blocked you

104
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,240
'cause they didn't like looking at it.

105
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,040
- It's a scary photo.

106
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,880
Yeah, it's a photo of me when I worked at the UCB.

107
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,520
- You worked at UCB?

108
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,520
- I was an intern there.

109
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,520
Yo! For free?

110
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
For free. It was for college credit though.

111
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,520
I know.

112
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,520
I talked about this a lot.

113
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,520
What do you mean? An improv university college credit?

114
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Pretty much.

115
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,520
Yeah.

116
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,520
That was a pretty fucked up life I've lived.

117
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,520
Do you guys like, you wanted to be a comedian

118
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,520
really badly, so you said

119
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,520
I'm gonna work at YouTube for a break?

120
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,520
No, you fucking, no! Fucker, no!

121
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,520
I went there and I fucking ate beef jerky

122
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,520
all day and like burped in

123
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,000

129
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:16,240
another 420 lift sponsored show at UCB. No, did you guys all do UCB? No. Yes and to that.

130
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:20,960
You look like an idiot right now. I'm not an idiot, I'm smart. You were the only one. I

131
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:26,480
interned at I think maybe a worse place, was it Funny or Die. Oh my god. I dropped out

132
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,160
of college, I'm the only cool one here. So, fuck both of y'all. You meet Will Ferrell there?

133
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,480
No. Pretty much every day he would meet Will Ferrell.

134
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,080
Dude, I wish I met Will Ferrell and I could say, "You are so funny, sir."

135
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,720
You know what? He is!

136
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,920
He is so funny. He is!

137
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,040
I re-watched Talladega Nights the other night. So good.

138
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Yeah. Still a very good movie.

139
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,120
I also re-watched that. I don't really like that movie that much.

140
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,560
What? Boris, they talk so stupid.

141
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,160
They talk so freaky and weird.

142
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
Yeah, they're like...

143
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,880
I don't get it. I don't understand what they're saying.

144
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,000
Why do you guys call this pod about list?

145
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We'll get to it. You're the worst guest we've ever had. I wasn't mad at you before this, now I'm fucking furious.

146
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,500
I did, for the listeners at home, I did ask 75,000 times if everyone was mad at me before we started recording.

147
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,000
Because I did feel deeply. That, I think, is a symptom of being hungover.

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're like, "Everyone's mad at me and everyone's thinking about me right now."

149
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yeah.

150
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
"Yep, I'm hungover. Yep."

151
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Be honest, how fucked up did you get last night?

152
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
"So what? I drink beer. So what?"

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's not the song. It's not the song at all.

154
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,500
I went to the same karaoke bar two nights in a row.

155
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah. Which one?

156
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Planet Rose Karaoke for the listeners at home. It's the best.

157
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh, it's called Encore.

158
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
They were clapping and saying Encore, Encore for 24 hours until I came back.

159
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Did you kill it?

160
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
First night, Rob Zombie Dragula.

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wow. Nice.

162
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Immediately convinced myself I gave vocal notes from screaming

163
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,960
everyone said, "Sarah, you can only get that if you're Adele." Okay? And then I, then

164
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:06,940
afterwards I sang "Voices Carry" by Till Tuesday. Wow. And then, what did I sing

165
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:12,440
last night? "Cool" by Gwen Stefani. What did I sing last night? "Magic Man" by Heart.

166
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,600
Didn't go over well. What else did I sing last night? Three songs. Needed it.

167
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:24,240
Needed to sing three songs. And, fuck. What was the third one? I don't know. "Beautiful Stranger" by

168
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,440
Madonna the Austin Powers song. Oh yeah. You know about that boys?

169
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,040
Madonna made that song for the Austin Powers movie. Really? Yes.

170
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:43,840
I don't care. You started it last night. Sing it again.

171
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,840
Oh yeah, that's the second one.

172
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,080
(laughter)

173
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,360
- The music video's awesome 'cause she goes crazy on him.

174
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,040
Like they're in the car driving and he's being Austin Powers

175
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,880
and she's like being sexy, Madonna-grinding all over him.

176
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,000
- Really, Austin Powers fucked Madonna?

177
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,760
- Of course he fucked, he fucked everyone.

178
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,600
- It's true.

179
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,840
- I had these coasters at my apartment,

180
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,340
they're like Austin Powers coasters,

181
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,160
but I think they just ran out of quotes by the third movie,

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,840
so all of the quotes are like,

183
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,960
pictures of like fat bastard,

184
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,960
and it says like there's something wrong with me mentally or something.

185
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Like the picture of Austin Powers says "Core Blimey"

186
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
which is like what the fuck?

187
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,960
When does he like say that? I don't remember it saying it at all.

188
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,960
It says "Why so serious?"

189
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,960
I wish, I wish it just had quotes from like other movies

190
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
but like pictures of like Austin Powers and like maybe...

191
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Get out me swamp.

192
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Get out me swamp?

193
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Oh you're not a Shrek fan?

194
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,960
Oh no!

195
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,960
Yeah I can fucking tell actually.

196
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,960
You've been owned.

197
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:42,960
That's so embarrassing.

198
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I would school you in Cena.

199
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,960
If we're playing Cena right now.

200
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,960
That's a thought that I've been thinking about for forever.

201
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
All Gunners have layers in them.

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,960
Why so serious?

203
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:59,960
I did karaoke recently for the first time in a long time.

204
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
Dude, there's no better feeling.

205
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
There's like no...

206
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
You can't crush and stand up as hard as you can in karaoke.

207
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
Karaoke, people lose their fucking minds.

208
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,160
And karaoke is for you.

209
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:11,960
Yeah, care.

210
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:15,460
You are in service of an emotional need that you need to like

211
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,360
release stand up.

212
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,960
You're in service of your on your hands and knees begging them

213
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,660
to like you.

214
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,360
Yeah, and you're on your hands and knees begging that you're

215
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,260
like, I will do anything to get a laugh.

216
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,960
I need you to have a good time karaoke.

217
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,260
No, see, I'm sorry.

218
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,760
What is your painting of the wall?

219
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,460
My painting is your painting.

220
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,060
You're in the room.

221
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:37,860
It's your painting.

222
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,860
I mean until you check out it's your painting.

223
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:42,860
That's the ugliest thing ever. It's basically up there with tape apparently.

224
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,860
No, it's got hinges.

225
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,860
Wow.

226
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,860
So that people can do that.

227
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,860
They knew that somebody like Patrick was going to come in here someday.

228
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,860
So people can have an affair in the room or something.

229
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
Like yeah, how would that help?

230
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,860
I don't know.

231
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,860
Lift up the painting.

232
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,860
Look at my beautiful art.

233
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,860
You have sex with me now?

234
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,860
For some reason this is like, "Oh, secrets, secrets."

235
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,860
You can hide your wife behind the painting.

236
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,860
[Laughter]

237
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,860
If she's flat Stanley and then fuck somebody.

238
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Yeah.

239
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,860
You can hide behind the painting for like an hour.

240
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,860
For no reason. Can you hide behind the painting?

241
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,860
You can also, if somebody breaks in

242
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,860
Look how big this is.

243
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:24,860
You can lift up the painting and if they walk behind there you can drop it

244
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,860
and hit him in the head and knock him out.

245
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,860
If you were in a casino royale kind of situation

246
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
Finding people in hotel rooms and shit.

247
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,860
Yeah, that's a good idea.

248
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,860
But karaoke, yeah, it's just like

249
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:41,620
up there. Karaoke is like, I think the closest, you're so comfortable in karaoke, it's like

250
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:46,740
the closest a white person can feel to being Dave Chappelle on stage. You walk up, you're

251
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:51,580
in the pocket. And you're jeweling. Yeah, exactly. Okay, what's your karaoke song? 5, 4, 3, 2,

252
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,580
1, don't think about it. Marty Robbins, El Paso. I don't know. Go, go, go, go, go, go,

253
00:09:56,580 --> 00:10:01,820
go. Come on, you have 5 seconds. You're going up right now, it's Planet Rose Karaoke, there's

254
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,820
God damn it, God damn it.

255
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,820
Next on the list is Patrick Doran singing.

256
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,820
Wait, I do have the app that has the list on it.

257
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,820
Wait, hold on, just list the songs.

258
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
It's like a phone book sized book of songs.

259
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
Uh, Toc Toc, It's My Life.

260
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Okay.

261
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
Or Gwen Stefani's My Life.

262
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
Uh, never mind, Patrick Doran's not coming to this stage.

263
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,820
I'm sorry. I'll also do Marty Robbins, El Paso, right after Caleb.

264
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,820
Oh, dude.

265
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,820
But you're in a full cowboy outfit.

266
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,820
I'll do it way worse.

267
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
I don't know the words to the song or how it goes.

268
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,320
or how it goes. I refuse. I'm not looking at the screen.

269
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Don DeChant.

270
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I can't do Don DeChant.

271
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,320
I grew up, I do Don DeChant.

272
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,820
No, that's not on the curiosity list.

273
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,320
You think that's so fucking funny, don't you?

274
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,820
Well, guess what?

275
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,320
That's his dead mother's name.

276
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,820
Oh, I thought it was just... I thought it was something he was saying.

277
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,820
I thought it was just a fun word he liked.

278
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,320
I thought it was like "bubba".

279
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,820
Yeah, I thought it was like that.

280
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,320
You thought he was being random, didn't you?

281
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,820
Yeah, I really did for a while.

282
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Did you guys hear Kanye West's new album, Meep?

283
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:01,620
Yeah, do you hear Kanye's new album RorXD?

284
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:05,660
Yeah, that was actually his dad's name

285
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:14,380
Fuck what does his dad have a weird name Kanye dad I don't think

286
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,940
Kanye East

287
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:24,060
Make on this podcast one way way too much man. Just so much money. Well you

288
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,980
That's an Austin power. Oh that is an Austin Powers clone. Just kidding. I was gonna

289
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:35,100
Get a number

290
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,840
I literally gonna make a joke about like yeah, what did that be a random?

291
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,220
It would be like the one good one for the coaster

292
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,220
Which they probably already had if they had other Austin Powers coasters

293
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:52,100
It'd probably be like the first movie in one second Sarah thought there was a movie called. Dr. Evil

294
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
and it was from that movie.

295
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:56,100
(laughter)

296
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,100
Yeah, the movie Doctor Evil,

297
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,100
it's kind of like that

298
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
hero,

299
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
what's it called?

300
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
Despicable Me?

301
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,100
It's kind of like when

302
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
there's this anti-hero movie

303
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,100
about this guy who wants to

304
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,100
be a stand-up, but he's mentally ill.

305
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Joker.

306
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,100
Yeah, Doctor Evil.

307
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,100
That would have been a good movie. They should have made a

308
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:20,100
Doctor Evil spin-off.

309
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,740
It's like the entertainment.

310
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,740
Like it's like that movie.

311
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,740
Oh.

312
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,220
Where he's like sad and like trying to call Mini-Me the whole time.

313
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:34,780
He's in like a phone booth just like, "You haven't called me in three weeks."

314
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
"Say something.

315
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
Just say anything."

316
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
And Mini-Me.

317
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:41,100
"I still love your mother very much but we're just not together now."

318
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Mini-Me just squeaks.

319
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:43,100
Yeah.

320
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:48,620
Oh my god, this whole time I've been picturing Mini-Me saying, "Mini-Me doesn't talk."

321
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,620
"Are you serious?

322
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:54,500
don't let him talk? It's not that they don't let him. He says "Neeeee" when he gets out of the...

323
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,300
He's too small to have lungs. Oh my god.

324
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
[Laughter]

325
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,420
He's got a bag in there. It wouldn't fit in his body.

326
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:07,540
Give the guy a line. Well... He flips people off. That's his thing.

327
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,940
Are you ser... I literally don't remember that. He flips off Austin Powers.

328
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,460
No. He humps legs. You don't do that. No!

329
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:20,820
He humps legs and eats a bunch of chocolate. That's the beginning of Goldmember.

330
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
And he says, "I'm Fat Bastard."

331
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,620
No, he doesn't say, "I'm Fat Bastard." He says, "It's mini-me."

332
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,620
And he says, "I'm making waffles."

333
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,220
He's not making waffles.

334
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,220
That's Eddie Murphy in Shrek.

335
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,220
It's one of the funniest things.

336
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,500
I'm making waffles.

337
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
It's one of the funniest things anyone's ever said.

338
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,940
Yeah, it is up there for sure.

339
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:40,820
Then he starts talking about parfaits and it's like, "What the hell is that?"

340
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,820
"Oh, it's a parfait."

341
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:45,300
I didn't learn about parfaits until McDonald's put one out.

342
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,780
I think they did that for Shrek. I think they've the uh...

343
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:52,780
Well, the jury's still out on that.

344
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
You're supposed to say yes.

345
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,780
No! I should have never told you this. I fucked up so bad.

346
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,780
I fucked up. I know you've done so much stupid shit in your life.

347
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,780
You better believe that.

348
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,780
You're gonna drag me through the mud for being a part of an evil sex cult?

349
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,780
You better believe I was on an improv team in Chicago.

350
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
Yes sir.

351
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:19,180
And you better believe I wasn't really allowed to do it anymore because I was wearing a weird

352
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:24,100
outfit and it was a quote-unquote ensemble and everyone was supposed to sort of blend

353
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,140
in with each other and wear black and I was being annoying and didn't want to do that.

354
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
Yeah, that's annoying.

355
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,660
I mean, would they say that to Elvis Presley?

356
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,660
No, exactly.

357
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,660
Would they say that to Ellen?

358
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Exactly.

359
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
Hey, Ellen, grow your hair out, sweetheart.

360
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,660
You gotta fit in on the UCB improv team.

361
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:36,660
I don't think so.

362
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Let's see those tits, Ellen.

363
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,660
Yeah, where's your tits?

364
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,800
- The UCB improv team, I don't think so.

365
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,740
- Let's see those tits, Ellen.

366
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,780
- Where's the bikini?

367
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:46,520
Hey, kiss that guy, it's part of the scene.

368
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
Keep kissing him, marry that dude.

369
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,280
That's probably what they would say to her

370
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,120
'cause they're so disrespectful.

371
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,500
- Didn't she, on her show, didn't she,

372
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,140
like, one of her boyfriends on the show

373
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,800
was like Jeremy Piven on the Ellen show?

374
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,300
- What? - Boyfriend?

375
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,720
- Not the sitcom, but like the talk show.

376
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,760
- Yeah, that's how she came out.

377
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,200
- Called Ellen?

378
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,920
- Or the Ellen, I think, Ellen DeGeneres show.

379
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,260
- It was called The Ellen.

380
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,960
Yeah, yeah, no the Ellen DeGeneres show and then she walked out and she was like oops

381
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:21,480
I'm gay in like 1989 and then my grandpa was never the same. Laura Dern was the the girlfriend. Really? I think. Swag.

382
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,640
I don't remember. I wasn't born yet. I

383
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:30,780
Was dead actually. I don't remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it was basically like a fleck of dust

384
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,100
I was basically just poop in my dad's eyes. Yeah. Yeah

385
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:40,140
I was literally just like a sandwich my dad ate. Yeah, I'm yeah, I was just kind of like the earth. Yeah

386
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:44,020
Of earth. Yeah, I was like a spirit or a ghost

387
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:48,540
Yeah, it's pretty much like the wind that a hula hoop creates like that was like all I was at the time

388
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:53,820
But the Ellen show yeah, I was like a drop of rain like falling upward into the sky before I was born. So

389
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,500
It's actually pretty beautiful

390
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:01,780
You - it's like way too like cool and young

391
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,020
for you. Just sit back and enjoy it.

392
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:04,520
Yeah.

393
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Just like you.

394
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,020
Just consider yourself privileged.

395
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Because this is master work.

396
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
This is guy humor.

397
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,020
Yeah.

398
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:14,020
Adam Carolla.

399
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:14,520
Yeah.

400
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,020
That was pretty much just a beautiful

401
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
raindrop on a windshield.

402
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,520
Yeah.

403
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,020
That's the kind of man show stuff we like doing.

404
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,520
You guys are being really diceman on it.

405
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,020
Yeah.

406
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:26,020
Hickory dickory dock.

407
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:29,020
Before time was existing,

408
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,520
there was just a flat line in the middle of

409
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:37,520
It's a ridiculous doc, I used to be a boat at a dock.

410
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,020
Perfect joke, can't go wrong.

411
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,520
Yeah, it works every time.

412
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Yeah.

413
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Is he making a comeback anytime soon?

414
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
The Dice Man?

415
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:49,520
He was Lady Gaga's dad in the Shallow movie.

416
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,520
Oh, what? Really?

417
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Yes.

418
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,520
I didn't see it, but if I had known, I would have gone and seen it.

419
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Honestly, he tore that out.

420
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Yeah?

421
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
I mean, yes he did, bitch.

422
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
He went crazy on it?

423
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:03,000
- He's crazy on it, he's like an old cab driver

424
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,720
and he's her dad and he's just fucking hot.

425
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,120
I love him more than anything.

426
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:06,960
- He's a good looking guy, yeah.

427
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,120
- You ever listen to his rap album?

428
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:09,960
- No. - No.

429
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,200
- Don't do it, bad stuff is being said on it.

430
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,320
- Well now I gotta hear it.

431
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,160
- Yeah, I mean.

432
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,160
- He's doing bad stuff on it.

433
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
- Like what?

434
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,840
- Like saying F-U-C-K and like S-H-I-T.

435
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:22,440
- Does he say all that?

436
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,280
- He wouldn't.

437
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,100
- Yeah, he would.

438
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,480
- I hope he didn't say A-S-S-S, no.

439
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,320
But if he did.

440
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,760
- Dude, why you said it?

441
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,600
- Oh, whoops.

442
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,440
(laughing)

443
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I was saying sass. What the hell dude? He can hear you. Oh shit. Shit man. He's over there.

444
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:43,560
He is looming like Lex Luthor. See Lex Luthor you gotta be not saying all that guy stuff

445
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:50,760
on him. Which one's that Batman? Lex Luthor is the one that's me in Superman. He's the

446
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:58,000
one that's you in Superman. Because he's bald. Oh yeah. Bald and pretty much evil and genius.

447
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:05,280
yeah sure what okay air conditioning pretty cold pretty cool yeah and i do

448
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,440
the rest of my body on it uh i i don't because my dad i saw him like a month

449
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:16,160
ago for the first time in a while and he's like son like you have to you have

450
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,000
to tan your head it's like embarrassing how

451
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,600
so since then i've not put on sunscreen a single time yeah yeah you should like uh

452
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:30,400
you should put bronzer just on the top so like a statue where people rub it for

453
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,320
good luck and it's a completely different color.

454
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:39,680
Yeah that's not a bad idea I'd go to a cake decorator and have them do my hair like a

455
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:45,360
Dominican barber shop. That'd be sick. I would do that too. You should get like

456
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,280
frosting flowers on your head could look really good. Oh yeah that'd be beautiful

457
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,480
some piping around the back, some royal kind of up and down stuff.

458
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
Happy birthday, Mr. President.

459
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
[laughter]

460
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,680
Well, that's a thing I could do every day.

461
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,480
It could be like a new fortune cookie when I tip my head forward.

462
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Oh, yeah.

463
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
You know, I could have a different saying on there.

464
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Oh, what if you get like a magic 8-ball installed?

465
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Installed?

466
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Yo, that would be sick.

467
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
So like you, like, we just ask questions and then install it.

468
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
You definitely have enough room in your skull.

469
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I don't have the room in my skull for that.

470
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:12,680
You definitely, okay, you can just like take out half your brain and put in one of those

471
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,680
triangle things with the words on it.

472
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
I need half of my brain.

473
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,680
You don't need that.

474
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,880
You only need 50% of it.

475
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,240
The reason that the brain comes in two halves is because you can take one off.

476
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:25,120
Yeah, and girls have one side and guys have the other side.

477
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Is that true?

478
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
Yeah, seriously.

479
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,240
That's why guys are good at math and girls are good at, um, bee shopping.

480
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,040
They are good at bee shopping.

481
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,040
Forget about that.

482
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,040
That's true.

483
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,800
That's the thing about the 90, if you only use 10% of your brain, why can't you just

484
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,200
cut the other 90 out and put something funny in there?

485
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
You can, that's what I'm saying.

486
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,200
Yeah, it's true.

487
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,600
Yeah, you just need to get a window in the top of your head.

488
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,800
- Just make it like a, have it open up like a

489
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,040
luggage carrying compartment on an airplane

490
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,480
and let me put Doritos in it.

491
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,680
- I know people like full blown brain damage

492
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,680
and they're like kinda like normal.

493
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:57,520
- Really?

494
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,040
- Yeah, it's like you, it is testament to,

495
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,100
I know this guy, well actually,

496
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,100
well, maybe that's not necessarily true.

497
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,520
(laughing)

498
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,680
Is he gonna hear this?

499
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,520
- No.

500
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,360
- I went to college with a guy,

501
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,120
I went to college with a guy who was a wrestler.

502
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:11,960
- Okay, oh that's my biggest fan.

503
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,800
- And had so many,

504
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,060
(laughing)

505
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,160
little tiny wrestling guys.

506
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:21,720
He sustained so many concussions

507
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,320
that he couldn't wrestle anymore

508
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,040
'cause he basically had brain damage

509
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,360
and he staple gunned his sheets to his bed

510
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,120
'cause he liked the feeling of being tucked in.

511
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,080
So he staple gunned them all around.

512
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,560
- That belongs in an asylum.

513
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,200
- Yeah, absolutely.

514
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,360
As I was saying, 'cause it's like,

515
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,640
I knew he had brain damage,

516
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,400
but I'm like, this guy's kinda like,

517
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,640
he's kinda tearing it for someone with brain damage.

518
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,680
- Really, he's crushing?

519
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:50,880
I think that's a great idea. I don't know about you guys. I've been hit in the head a few times though.

520
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
Yeah I have I had like three rapid concussions in rapid succession as a

521
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,680
child. Yeah. I think I probably would have been like a superhero if it wasn't for that.

522
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:03,000
What'd they do to you? The football team did that to me.

523
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,280
They shouldn't let children do that by the way. I agree.

524
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:13,080
Play football? Yeah. Why not? It's bad for them. Look at this. What happened?

525
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,880
You turned bald. I'm so sick. He lost all his hair. Yeah, they knocked it out of his head.

526
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,920
He got tackled and all flew out. My football coach did tell me as a kid, he was like,

527
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:26,040
"Son, you got a big head. You better be using that on the field. Lead with it."

528
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:32,840
I was like, "Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Chuck." And I just tear kids up with my big ass head. I was

529
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:37,800
like a rhino or a giraffe. I was like a giraffe with a small neck using my head for defense.

530
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,560
Yeah, and also I was big and fat and so that I played center position,

531
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,200
which the center his whole job is just like just yeah

532
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:55,480
I we don't know okay all right have you ever played the game as a kid smear the

533
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:11,200
queer no you never played that yeah I was basically the one who was it all the

534
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:17,280
time. What is smear the queer? So it's just tag but you tackle someone. That they

535
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,660
decide is the gay guy on the team? We didn't even know what queer meant we

536
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:23,500
thought it was we thought I thought the first time I heard the word queer I was

537
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,400
like somebody who's it like what does that mean? Well now that's exactly what

538
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,880
it means. That's right.

539
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,880
friggin let him know this okay checking his watch basically wants to get out of

540
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:44,760
here you see yeah yeah I like of me I just like I like testing myself okay

541
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,680
start singing

542
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,840
(singing)

543
00:22:49,840 --> 00:23:03,600
- Can we sign you a record deal?

544
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,760
- Yeah, I need $6,000 back.

545
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,440
- Sensitive gangster records.

546
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,920
- Yeah, we'd love to sign you.

547
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:10,760
- Yeah, all right.

548
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,440
- All right, we're finally gonna do the list.

549
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,400
- So it is a podcast about lists.

550
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,200
- Do you think this is just like an ominous thing

551
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:21,320
I think you guys gotta get a new name for a podcast.

552
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,480
What? Pod-about-list? What's wrong with that?

553
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,680
You say anything like that and it sucks. Sarah Squirm?

554
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:35,480
McDonald's? These are iconic names that work fine when you say them normal.

555
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,480
The Sarahs were McDonald's meal? What would it be? 5 4 3 2 1?

556
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Poop.

557
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
Come on.

558
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,060
- I got the Saweetie meal.

559
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:51,520
Did you know that when celebrities do their celebrity meal,

560
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,080
it's just a meal?

561
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,180
- Yeah. - Yeah.

562
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,000
- I thought it was gonna be something weird about it.

563
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,720
- Well, they had a weird sauce, I think.

564
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,000
- But didn't that exist already?

565
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,540
'Cause it was Saweetie and sour,

566
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,040
but they already have sweet and sour.

567
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,080
- Oh, wait, that was the Saweetie meal.

568
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,640
- That's all they did?

569
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,440
- Literally, the Saweetie meal is literally

570
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,600
like a burger, fries, and chicken nuggets.

571
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,440
- Yeah, it sounds delicious.

572
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,780
- It exists already though.

573
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,520
- But the BTS meal, all they did was they put like a--

574
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,900
- The BTS meal, what was that?

575
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:20,840
- It was like a Cajun sauce.

576
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,360
- Oh, that didn't exist before?

577
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,200
- Yeah.

578
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,800
- So they made like a, or it might have existed

579
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,280
at like McDonald's Korea and then they brought it here.

580
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,640
- And when I think of BTS, I think Cajun.

581
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,480
- Yeah.

582
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
- I didn't walk no boys down on the bayou.

583
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,480
- I don't know BTS, boy.

584
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,320
Oh, they down there.

585
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,160
- Who like butter?

586
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,240
Who like butter?

587
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:39,360
(laughing)

588
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,600
- Well, I went to McDonald's to get a McChicken one time

589
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,960
and they gave it to me in a BTS meal bag,

590
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,400
and I so wanted to just be like,

591
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,720
can you give me a different bag, please?

592
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,160
Like, I have to walk home with this.

593
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,960
- I had a pink BTS backpack for a little bit,

594
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,200
and I gave it to Robbie,

595
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,600
but that thing, it was a bootleg,

596
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,600
and it did not close at all.

597
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,480
You find the hair on that?

598
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,240
- Yeah, but it was an eyelash, I think.

599
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,080
- Oh.

600
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,680
- It's probably mine, I kinda have Minnie Mouse eyelashes.

601
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,520
Ding, ding, ding, ding.

602
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,360
(laughing)

603
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,180
Ding, ding, ding.

604
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,280
- Okay, what's the list?

605
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,800
- The list is top 10--

606
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,080
- It's about lists.

607
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,920
- Worst things.

608
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,560
- It's not a pod about a list, it's pod about lists.

609
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,520
- It's about lists, yeah.

610
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,760
In like two years, every podcast is gonna be named like this.

611
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,600
This is gonna be the naming convention.

612
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,320
We're way ahead of the curve.

613
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,480
- There's only one list per episode.

614
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,320
- Pod about lists.

615
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,280
- Because if we said lists.

616
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,200
- Sometimes we do multiple lists.

617
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,040
- It's just so clinical.

618
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,280
- I'm defending us.

619
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,400
(laughing)

620
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,080
- Okay, what should we call it then?

621
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Something fun like couple of two guys and one bald guy.

622
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
That's still a guy.

623
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
It's still just a guy.

624
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,080
It's not a different kind of guy.

625
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,080
It's a normal guy.

626
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Bald guys are freaks.

627
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
No, it's not true.

628
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
It's actually not true.

629
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
He has cancer.

630
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Yeah, I bet you feel real stupid now.

631
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,080
He's not even doing his chemo.

632
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
He just has a shaving set.

633
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
I probably do have cancer.

634
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
So I could just start telling people to get away with being bald.

635
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,080
Yeah, might as well.

636
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,080
Yeah.

637
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,080
The heist.

638
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,080
Do you guys know Ben O'Brien of Wim?

639
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Yeah.

640
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
Yeah.

641
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,080
Yeah.

642
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Yeah.

643
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,080
Yeah.

644
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,080
Yeah.

645
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Yeah.

646
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,080
Ben O'Brien of William C. De Calvany.

647
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:12,280
That was my first like concert he opened for Dan Deacon.

648
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,880
Oh doing Earth Universe?

649
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,380
Yeah.

650
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,380
That was so good.

651
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:19,080
You want to hear a really funny thing I say about Ben O'Brien famous bald guy?

652
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,880

00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,880
Ooh.

654
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,380
That's really funny.

655
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,680
What's your full name?

656
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,280
Caleb Michael Pitts.

657
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,580
Huh?

658
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,280
Caleb. Yeah nevermind. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

659
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,240
(laughter)

660
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,160
- Michael, wait, but why do you say it like that?

661
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,960
- Caleb Michael Pits.

662
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,440
- Why do you pause like that?

663
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,560
- But you said Caleb Michael Pits.

664
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,520
- You have to remember his middle name.

665
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,080
- It seems like you're stalling to come up

666
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,520
with a bald version of my name.

667
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,920
Caleb Michael Pits, go, three, two, one.

668
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,160
- Caleb Michael Pits Bald Guy.

669
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,740
- That's fucking sucked.

670
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,580
- Let's go!

671
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,400
- That was terrible.

672
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,960
- Is Michael a middle name or your last name?

673
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,680
- Middle, what do you think Pits was?

674
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,880
- You said it like it was hyphenated.

675
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,340
Caleb Michael pits I have a southern accent

676
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:17,360
Don't ball damage, you know, okay the list is top ten worst things to be magically turned into

677
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
Yes, you have magic is totally awesome

678
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,720
Random thing you guys found on the internet. Yeah, we didn't like try

679
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:29,920
To a podcast no, I'm cool

680
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,920
I listen to music.

681
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:35,920
Oh, what is that?

682
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:41,920
The idea of magic is totally awesome, but the idea of magic being used against you, it's totally not awesome.

683
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,920
One prime example or stereotype of magic is the power of turning an object into something else,

684
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,920
which again may sound very awesome, but you wouldn't want that power being used against you.

685
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:53,920
So, without further ado, here's some of the very worst objects that you could ever turn into.

686
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,920
I hate magical stereotypes.

687
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,920
Yeah, I'm sick of all these fucking magic stereotypes.

688
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
It's really annoying.

689
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,420
You see a wizard, you know he got that wand.

690
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,420
That is a harmful stereotype.

691
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:09,420
Dude, when I see someone on the subway in a blue pointy cap and I tap them on the shoulder

692
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:13,420
and I ask them to do a spell and they turn around and they're a gnome, I feel so bad.

693
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,420
So annoying.

694
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,420
That's a classic New York moment.

695
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,420
Yeah.

696
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:21,420
Come on, oh you're a magician? Come on, do a spell. Come on, turn me into a toad.

697
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:28,420
Is it, it has to be things? Like you can't be like something more abstract or a person?

698
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:34,100
like beauty you want to be turned into beauty yeah like or like turn and yeah

699
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:37,660
like turned into inspiration or something like that happens when you die

700
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:44,420
yeah that's for damn sure I know that's right number one is toilet I mean that's

701
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,420
pretty bad I would say but also like it depends like I'm never gonna be in a

702
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:57,540
situation where if I'm with a wizard and I get turned into a toilet with a wizard

703
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:01,340
It's probably gonna be like in a park or something in the middle of the street something like that

704
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,060
It's gonna be because the wizard is mad at me in a public space

705
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:09,780
I'm not gonna be somewhere where they're even gonna plug in my my body to a toilet hole

706
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,260
Yeah, so it doesn't matter. No, it's gonna take a shit at me

707
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:15,260
There's a point if there's a loose toilet on the street

708
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:19,140
You don't think someone's gonna take a shit in there Dave England shows up. That'd be horrible

709
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:26,700
Walking out the hardware store bump into a fucking wizard and he doesn't even have to have to shit

710
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,220
Yeah, do it on command. He doesn't even you're right. He gets a

711
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:37,040
Toilet, yeah, I mean I guess it's also did my toilet with like googly eyes who can move. Yeah, like the one who's talking

712
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,520
Yeah, exactly. Move my lid. I scared the

713
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,060
Looking toy. Yeah as a kid that scared the shit out of me

714
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:49,460
like I was like scared to go to the bathroom at night because it would happen to me too, even though it's like a

715
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,380
movie

716
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,720
That's one of the most incredible sentences I've ever heard. Yeah

717
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,560
- Yeah, that was brilliant.

718
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,360
- I thought like Mel Brooks' toilet was gonna yell at me.

719
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,800
- Absolutely brilliant.

720
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,240
- And I'll tell you what, there are people who pay top dollar

721
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,200
to be turned into someone's toilet, if you know what I mean.

722
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,040
- That's true. - Absolutely.

723
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,000
- We know.

724
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,600
- Well, yeah, so there's a comment here

725
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,380
from Blue and Black Midnight Rose that says,

726
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:12,400
"Ew, heck no, I would not wanna let people

727
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,200
"let out all their nasty body fluids in me.

728
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,340
"Like what if someone had to take a huge nasty dump

729
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,640
"or getting vomited in, ew, no thank you."

730
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,620
And then Caitlin the Mouse Boy responds and says,

731
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,320
"Um, I have that fetish."

732
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,760
(laughing)

733
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,920
I want somebody to take a big nasty dump and puke in me.

734
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,600
- One of my life's biggest, I truly do desperately,

735
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,660
and I think that I can shit in someone's mouth.

736
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:40,120
I would love for someone to pay me to shit in their mouth,

737
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,000
and I don't think it would count

738
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,500
as cheating on my boyfriend.

739
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,100
- Really, you think that one's fine?

740
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,940
- I think that one's fine,

741
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,940
and I've asked him this before, too.

742
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:48,780
- What'd he say?

743
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,620
- He was like, "I wouldn't love it."

744
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,460
- Well, but also--

745
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,860
- But he didn't say he wouldn't hate it.

746
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:56,260
- He didn't say that, girls gotta eat.

747
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,380
- Like if I could do that without the person like--

748
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,220
- Jerking?

749
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,140
- Maybe they jerk later, but also like

750
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,180
be that close to my butthole, you know?

751
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:08,660
Like if I could do it from like 100 feet in the air.

752
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,500
- That would be sick.

753
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,140
- Then I think that's fine, right?

754
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,180
Like I don't care. - I don't like an airplane.

755
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,620
- If I shit in someone's mouth from 100,

756
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,220
if they're like right under my ass--

757
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,620
- Out of like an airplane.

758
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,580
- Yeah, and hitting, 'cause then I'm like,

759
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,980
it's like sight unseen.

760
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:23,100
- Yeah, exactly, hey, if this hits someone, so be it.

761
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,400
So be it, if I get fucking $5,000 wired to me, then fucking whatever.

762
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,780
You know what they say, if you shit off the top of the Empire State Building, it could

763
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:31,780
cut through someone's skull.

764
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,780
I know they did that on Mythbusters.

765
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,180
It was really good.

766
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,100
That's why they don't, that's what happened to that one guy.

767
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,100
Yeah.

768
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,100
Granny Mahara.

769
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,100
Oh my god, he died.

770
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,100
He died, yeah.

771
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,100
What happened?

772
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:46,580
Well, basically a humongous shit fell out of the sky and cut him in half.

773
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
Like Final Destination.

774
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,580
It was serious.

775
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,580
And then he said, "Ow!"

776
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
and he said okay

777
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,580
imagine if they put that in a final destination

778
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,580
but like all these like crazy Rube Goldberg things

779
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,580
and then one guy just walking around and just a shit

780
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,580
falls out of the sky and cuts him

781
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
just perfectly in half

782
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
a razor shit

783
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
it's like yeah it's

784
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,580
terminal velocity and starts like fraying

785
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
at the front and turns into a perfect spear

786
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
they don't explain it all so it just

787
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,580
comes out of the sky

788
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,580
there's no set up like the other ones

789
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
no no it's not like

790
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:22,140
You just see on the news, "A shit fell out of the sky and cut this guy in half."

791
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:26,940
That's one of the Mortal Kombat fatalities, actually, in the new Mortal Kombat.

792
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:29,900
Just falling out.

793
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,700
Here's another comment. "Imagine having a hot girl poop on you."

794
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,700
Here's another comment. "In Lola Loud voice, gross." I don't know who Lola Loud is.

795
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:44,220
Lola Loud is from The Loud House. It was a show on Nickelodeon.

796
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:44,700
Oh, okay.

797
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:54,140
We've read this website specifically so many times that like I know what the Loud House is now.

798
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,500
Everybody be talking about the Loud House on this website?

799
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,260
It's all kids. Which makes wanting to shit on each other worse.

800
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,780
Yeah. Number one.

801
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:05,420
Number two is...

802
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,700
Kids are talking to adults.

803
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:09,100
True, yeah.

804
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,420
True.

805
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,260
Number two is pinata.

806
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,540
Pinata?

807
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,700
That didn't sound so bad. Damn, I'm full of candy right now.

808
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:18,280
- I think everyone's imagination is limited on this website.

809
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,120
- Yeah, I agree.

810
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,740
- What would your worst object--

811
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,780
- The worst thing to be turned into?

812
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,620
- Yeah.

813
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:28,620
- Like a hospital, some like hospital receptacle

814
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,700
that receives like not only, like a biohazard bin

815
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,220
'cause you're getting shit, piss, like bile, needles,

816
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:43,740
fluids you've never even heard of.

817
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,900
much via is it's true

818
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,340
catheter

819
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,100
the worst thing i would get turned into his probably like a shorter guy

820
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,940
uh...

821
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,100
like a bald guy and uh...

822
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:01,900
uh... and he was a young and he had an international and c_n_n_ one of the

823
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,540
children

824
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,140
sleek

825
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:05,180
because smeared clear

826
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,820
and i didn't get smeared anytime soon

827
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:10,980
uh... actually and i my head is fine and it's bald for

828
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,220
It's actually by choice. I could grow dreadlocks right now in five seconds.

829
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:16,080
Okay. Go.

830
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:21,280
They're really small though. That's like the trick, because they're microscopic.

831
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,880
Especially if it's in the shape of Barney, Elsa, Dora, or Justin Bieber.

832
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:30,040
That's a comic from Super Mario. Well yeah, that would suck to be turned into a piñata and be like,

833
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:35,440
"Oh, swag. I'm full of candy." And then see a glimpse of yourself in a mirror and you're a girl piñata.

834
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,380
That would, yeah.

835
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,120
That's gotta hurt. That's gotta sting. No, thank you.

836
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,920
But also things get hit harder than a pinata.

837
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,420
Yeah, exactly.

838
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,620
Like a jersey barrier.

839
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,420
Like with a car or like...

840
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,920
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

841
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,420
I don't know what to do with my immediate thoughts.

842
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,720
A jersey barrier?

843
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,220
Yeah.

844
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,420
I was thinking like someone in war.

845
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:56,020
Oh, like with a cannonball?

846
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,620
Yeah.

847
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,220
Yeah.

848
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,520
Evil Knievel.

849
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,220
That guy.

850
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,220
Wait, that would be sick because then you could just jump on anything or jump over anything.

851
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,040
You think he had a power?

852
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,040
Yes!

853
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,040
Are you kidding me?

854
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,520
He had the power to jump on anything.

855
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
Yeah, he's like Mario.

856
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,560
If anything hit him this way, he would die.

857
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:18,000
But if he got on top of it, he won the fight.

858
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,000
Exactly.

859
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
That's what he did to all those bosses.

860
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,640
I don't think I've ever been at a party with a pinata there.

861
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,880
I literally, for my birthday, my friends got me a Minion pinata.

862
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,160
Yup, I'm loved.

863
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,960
Shout out to you, Jesse and Scott.

864
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
Love you.

865
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
And there were chips inside!

866
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Chips?

867
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,960
There were chips inside!

868
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:34,960
I love chips!

869
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,960
Bagged chips or loose chips?

870
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:36,800
- Bagged chips.

871
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,640
- Oh, okay.

872
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,460
- What kind of chips?

873
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,300
- Every kind of chip.

874
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,500
I love chips.

875
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,340
- Every kind of chip?

876
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,680
- There's a place down the street from here

877
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,280
called like Chips World.

878
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,120
- Whoa.

879
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:45,940
- Really, wait, are you serious?

880
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,500
- Or it's like Chip City.

881
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,340
- I gotta go.

882
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,880
- Do we have to go there after this?

883
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,620
- I saw this sign from far away

884
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,460
and I said to my friend Peter,

885
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,560
I was like, "Oh my God, it's Chip City!

886
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,020
"We have to go to Chip City!"

887
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,220
And then one of the employees came out

888
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,660
wearing a shirt and I was like,

889
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:00,860
"Yes, chips, chips!"

890
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:02,180
And he was wearing a shirt that said Chip City

891
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,940
and he's like, "Don't get excited, it's cookies."

892
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:06,740
- Oh, fuck that. - Oh my God.

893
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,580
- Come on. - And I was like,

894
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,420
are you serious, it's not chips?

895
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:10,700
- You shouldn't be able to name a place

896
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,260
Chip City if it's not chips.

897
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,820
- Is he talking about like chocolate chips?

898
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,340
- I mean, yeah. - Yeah, or peanut butter chips

899
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,180
or white chocolate chips or macadamia chips.

900
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,820
- All right, okay, okay, Jesus Christ.

901
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,460
- Those should have a different name.

902
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,300
I'm sick of getting excited over chips

903
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,340
and it's like chips ahoy.

904
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:31,700
No, fuck that, it's called something else now.

905
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:32,540
- What's it called now?

906
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,660
- Little Chocolate Guys.

907
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,880
- Little chocolate guys.

908
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,940
- I don't think it's called that.

909
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,460
- Chocolate rounders.

910
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,300
- Oh.

911
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:42,900
- I don't think you can say that.

912
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,740
- Why?

913
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,100
- I think that's a rude word for a type of person maybe.

914
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
- What, rounder?

915
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:47,940
- A chocolate rounder.

916
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,140
I don't think you can walk around the street

917
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:49,980
saying that around here.

918
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,540
- Well, let's go try it.

919
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,780
- I literally can't find proof that this place exists now.

920
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,620
- It's there.

921
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,440
(laughing)

922
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,700
They're hiding it.

923
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:58,940
- Did I make this up?

924
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,780
- Yeah.

925
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:00,600
- Probably.

926
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,440
- Okay, I'm not kidding.

927
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,380
It's across the street and I'm Googling it

928
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,780
and it's not coming up on the map.

929
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,280
- They replaced it with an FAO Schwartz yesterday.

930
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,940
(laughing)

931
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,780
- I saw--

932
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,820
- I see a bunch of umbrellas across the street.

933
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:15,220
I don't think that's Chip Swirl, is it?

934
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:18,460
- I'm not kidding, I can't find it.

935
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,860
- Oh my God, Mo.

936
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,300
- Oh my God. - You're a liar.

937
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,580
- You saw a mirage.

938
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,060
- Were you like really thirsty yesterday?

939
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,300
- I was really thirsty for chips yesterday.

940
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,660
- Oh, that's probably why.

941
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,540
- Favorite chip?

942
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:39,860
potato chips. You're serious? I don't know. I don't know. Salt and vinegar kettle cooked?

943
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,640
Probably like the Zapp's Voodoo, but have you had the fucking...

944
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
No!

945
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,320
It's... the uh... there's this like... this like Lay's, like it's called like "Numb and

946
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,660
Spicy Hot Pot" and it was like... it's from China, but it was so good.

947
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,660
Numb?

948
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,660
I gotta find that. Yeah, I bought it because it said "Numb" on the bag.

949
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:00,220
Oh, cappuccino Lays.

950
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,220
Oh, yeah.

951
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,220
Those are bad.

952
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,220
Yeah, I can imagine.

953
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,220
They're really bad.

954
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:05,220
They made them though.

955
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:11,500
Oh, do you remember in 2016, they had the like the promo thing where you could win like air

956
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:16,460
travel miles for like these specific like they had like four flavors in promotion of

957
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,020
the Olympics and they had these tikka masala kettle chips.

958
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,100
They were so fun.

959
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:24,860
I was like genuinely bummed when those like were like discontinued.

960
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:29,860
When Pat talks about chips, he starts not making eye contact with anyone.

961
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
He's like my weird cousin talking about maps.

962
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:34,620
He's just looking down.

963
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,240
It's beautiful.

964
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,240
You really tap in.

965
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,240
Yo, Ruffles Aldres.

966
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Oh yeah.

967
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,240
That's what I'm talking about.

968
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:44,820
I used to eat the Humpty Dumpty Aldres.

969
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,140
They were like two bucks.

970
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,380
What do you mean Humpty Dumpty?

971
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,460
I think it might be a regional chip.

972
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,940
A Humpty Dumpty?

973
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,940
From where?

974
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:00,420
the candy land but they had those all dress chips and I used to go to this there was like

975
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,660
two bucks and I would just buy that and eat that for lunch at the skate park.

976
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,740
I love chips.

977
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,100
You think they're gonna knock the door down?

978
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,380
I think we might be in a SWAT self-defense situation pretty soon.

979
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:14,220
Yeah could happen that's what I'm saying dude this painting is kind of hinged.

980
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,220
You're gonna hide under the painting.

981
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
What if he can do kick me out?

982
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,140
I don't know we'll fucking I mean no.

983
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,140
No, probably not.

984
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,140
Dude, the room's on NBC.

985
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,140
I'm not gonna get charged for this.

986
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,140
Oh my gosh.

987
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,140
Are you serious?

988
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,140
Wow.

989
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
Yep.

990
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,140
You are rich.

991
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,940
Here's another comment.

992
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,140
I don't want to be a pinata getting killed by that cursed stick.

993
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,140
Okay.

994
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,140
Facts.

995
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,140
Number three.

996
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,980
Why is everyone on this website randoms us?

997
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:46,020
Is there all, this list is probably from like 2014 and they're probably all 11 is my guess.

998
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:48,980
Number three's food.

999
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:51,740
I think technically everybody is food.

1000
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,740
Damn.

1001
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,300
If someone's a cannibal.

1002
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
Yep.

1003
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,300
That's true.

1004
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,300
That's serious.

1005
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,540
Top comment here is from Super Mario Fan.

1006
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:02,880
You get chewed on by someone, go into their body, come out as you know what, and then

1007
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,880
get flushed down the toilet.

1008
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,580
Sorry this is gross, but that's what would happen if you were food.

1009
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:14,220
Honestly, food might be one of the best things you can be because like you permutate into

1010
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,100
different forms.

1011
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,060
like energy never dies it just turns into other things so it's like kind of like

1012
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:27,260
you're chill like you're chillin also you could make somebody's day true I'd

1013
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,220
also be like so delicious - yeah also what if like what if you went into like

00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:39,180
Pam Anderson's mouth maybe clutch social is hero what if you were like oh my god

1015
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:42,380

1016
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:46,620
hot dog and like she was like lady in the tramping it with Julian Assange.

1017
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:52,820
That's fine dude. Yeah? Yeah. Okay you think he's a hero? Okay. He's a beast.

1018
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:59,660
You actually like that guy? Someone can't keep a secret. Somebody else on this one

1019
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:07,780
said imagine being eaten by a hot girl. Yeah. That's the answer to any of these. Imagine being a toilet under a hot girl's ass.

1020
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:11,220
Imagine a hot girl loved candy and broke you into a million pieces.

1021
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Oh my god.

1022
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,220
Yeah, McDonald's comments "vore."

1023
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,220
Where'd you guys get these microphones?

1024
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Amazon.

1025
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,220
D-Store.

1026
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
I don't know where that one came from.

1027
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Yeah, he has a freak one.

1028
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,220
Oh, that's the freak one?

1029
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,220
Yeah, I got like three microphones for like $20.

1030
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
Is that the Radio Shack mic from Moo-Yah?

1031
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,220
Or is that a different one?

1032
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,220
No, I don't think so.

1033
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:24,220
I just ordered these myself because we didn't have mics.

1034
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,220
I don't have one.

1035
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,220
I don't have one.

1036
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,220
I don't have one.

1037
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,220
I don't have one.

1038
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,220
I don't have one.

1039
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,220
I don't have one.

1040
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,220
I don't have one.

1041
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,220
I don't have one.

1042
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,220
I don't have one.

1043
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:39,220
No, I don't think so. I just ordered these myself because we didn't have mics at one point, but then we got the nice ones.

1044
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
Yeah.

1045
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,220
Yeah.

1046
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,220
Yup, you better believe that.

1047
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:45,220
Number four is bubble.

1048
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,220
Wrong! That's one of the most beautiful things you could be.

1049
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,220
It is really beautiful.

1050
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:54,220
There was a guy at Central Park the other day making humongous bubbles with a piece of string.

1051
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,220
And I don't know how he made it.

1052
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,220
Is that his job?

1053
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:00,220
Yeah, and there was like a little kid that he was like clearly super mad at who just kept,

1054
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,780
who just kept as soon as a bubble would be made the kid popped it like he would stand next to it and

1055
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:09,660
just immediately pop the bubbles before they even finish. I mean you can't expect it's a bubble.

1056
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:14,700
Right. Yeah. You can't make it in Central Park and like if you want your bubble to survive you

1057
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:18,540
got to make it at home where no one else is. Yeah. What he could have done is put poison in

1058
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,540
the bubble. That could have been very clever. He could have put ricin in the bubble and kill the

1059
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:25,660
kid breaking that stuff. Or he could have made the bubble like really hot so the kid burned his

1060
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,660
finger when he popped it.

1061
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,660
It's not a bad idea.

1062
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:32,740
The top comment on Bubble is, "This is one of the only items on this rather not very

1063
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,440
funny list I'm willing to vote.

1064
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,060
There is a certain way bathroom humor can be executed and the other entries are how

1065
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,940
you don't do it."

1066
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:41,940
That's just straight up true.

1067
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:45,340
And by the way, Bubbles exist in a bathroom.

1068
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,860
Yeah, true.

1069
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,860
Mr. Bubble?

1070
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,860
Yes.

1071
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:52,940
Taking a bubble bath, bathroom humor.

1072
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,260
What do you think people do in bubble baths?

1073
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:56,260
Mr. Feeny's commenting over here.

1074
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,100
- They're naked in there.

1075
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,520
Bubbles are seeing penises, ass, boobs.

1076
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,360
- Wait, really?

1080
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,380

1081
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:16,700
- Imagine being what?

1082
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:17,540
- Sipped.

1083
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:21,460
- No, Bubbles could be in your drink!

1084
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,660
- True, yeah.

1085
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:23,500
- That's true.

achieve their fitness dreams before my eyes.

1140
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,360

1141
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:49,360

1144
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:07,960
I think that I can't think of anything funny to say because I had three shots

1145
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,920
of tequila last night and I want to say something. Uh-huh. Drinking is bad. It's

1146
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:16,920
It's poison and no one should do it.

1147
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,920
Here's the thing, drinking is driving.

1148
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,920
How about that?

1149
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,920
You ever text and drink at the same time?

1150
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:23,920
Oh yeah.

1151
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
It's disgusting.

1152
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
It's horrible.

1153
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,920
The drink gets all over the phone.

1154
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:30,420
Yep.

1155
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,920
It gets all sticky.

1156
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,920
I can't even type after that.

1157
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,920
I give my phone to the bartender.

1158
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,920
Are you flipping me off?

1159
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,920
What the fuck?

1160
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,920
What are you doing?

1161
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,920
That's so rude.

1162
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,560
- Stop, don't point that at me.

1163
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,400
- Stop!

1164
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,240
- Just flip me off.

1165
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,920
- No, don't crank it up.

1166
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:48,760
No!

1167
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,320
- Crank it back down, crank it down.

1168
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,600
- God, this sucks.

1169
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,000
I'm, God, speaking of freaking punching bag,

1174
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:03,720
- What'd you do to deserve it?

1175
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:04,560
- I don't know.

1176
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:07,960
I have ADHD, so they yell at me.

1177
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:10,280

1189
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,440
- I'm like sexy in there.

1190

you know and i'll say this again one time

1206
00:48:58,860 --> 00:48:59,740
it wasn't

1207
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:04,580
guys be paying a lot of money to be doing being wanting to be dealing with

1208
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:08,820
i i want to have a guy wanted to like my armpits

1209
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,820
this is true

1210
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:13,100
He wanted to pay me to lick my armpits.

1211
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,460
- Is that what you were here for this week?

1212
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:15,940
- That's what I was here for this week.

1213
00:49:15,940 --> 00:49:16,940
- Some guy.

1214
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:21,260
- Some guy, Donald Jason Trump.

1215
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,220
(laughing)

1216
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,300
Ever heard of that?

1217
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,380
This guy was like, "All right, I'll pay you $200.

1218
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,940
"I'll lick your armpits, whatever."

1219
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:33,900
And then we went to dinner and ended up fighting

1220
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:36,020
about Zionism and didn't make it to the armpit party.

1221
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:37,020
- Wow.

1222
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:37,980
- Still got paid.

1223
00:49:37,980 --> 00:49:38,900
- Wow.

1224
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,940
- And dinner.

1225
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:40,440
Yeah.

1226
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,440
And dinner.

1227
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,440
And how, honey.

1228
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,440
Yeah.

1229
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,940
And spirited debate.

1230
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:46,440
Yeah.

1231
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:46,940
Yeah.

1232
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:47,440
Yeah.

1233
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,940
Yeah.

1234
00:49:47,940 --> 00:49:50,440
You don't get that often nowadays, and it's good to--

1235
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:50,940
I know.

1236
00:49:50,940 --> 00:49:52,440
Yeah, exactly.

1237
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:52,940
Yeah.

1238
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,440
Number eight is soccer ball.

1239
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:55,440
Again, this is boring.

1240
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,940
Yeah, it's the same as punching bag.

1241
00:49:56,940 --> 00:49:58,940
It's exactly the same as punching bag.

1242
00:49:58,940 --> 00:49:59,440
It's not.

1243
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,940
You could see the world.

1244
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,440
If being hit by baseball bats and other spiky objects

1245
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,440
wasn't bad enough, imagine being kicked

1246
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:07,940
by 22 professional athletes for 90 minutes.

1247
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:10,340
hitting the crossbar would also result in extra pain.

1248
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,740
Other sports balls would be painful, but the soccer ball is no different.

1249
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:17,440
"Kicked by 22 athletes for 20 minutes? Oh yeah!"

1250
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,340
Imagine being kicked by 22 hot girl athletes.

1251
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,540
Yeah, yeah, exactly.

1252
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:24,940
Imagine it was bikini soccer, though.

1253
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:25,940
Mud soccer.

1254
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,540
Dead or alive 3.

1255
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:29,740
I don't know what you guys are doing with soccer balls,

1256
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,740
but I'm taking a big ol' dookie on those.

1257
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:33,340
Oh, hell no!

1258
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,740
Yeah, but this hot girl, yep, she's taking a dump on her own.

1259
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,260
- She's going through everything on this list.

1260
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:40,100
Like, yeah, but I pretty much dookie on this.

1261
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:41,500
(laughing)

1262
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:44,060
I don't know why you wanna be that.

1263
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,200
- Yeah.

1264
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,980
No, let's see, number nine, balloons.

1265
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:49,780
That's just bubbles.

1266
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,500
That's a stronger bubble. - True, true.

1267
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:53,460
- Yeah.

1268
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:54,780
I just wanted to comment on this

1269
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,020
because people were wondering

1270
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:57,800
where the ballon would stop floating

1271
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,080
or if it would just pop.

1272
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,700
Actually, balloons will stop rising

1273
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,860
once their density matches the surrounding air.

1274
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,940
Then I guess it would run out of helium

1275
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:05,940
and just fall to the ground

1276
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:10,060
burn up in the atmosphere just wanted to say I'll tell you what when they pop

1277
00:51:10,060 --> 00:51:14,820
it's scary yeah it is like a gunshot I was that you know I was at like a dim

1278
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:22,460
someplace with my friend and another fake story with two friends actually

1279
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:27,380
their three names and well a fourth friend showed up so hold on well I'm

1280
00:51:27,380 --> 00:51:31,700
still telling the story but there's like a surprise party and like they pop the

1281
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:36,100
balloon and everyone just thought there was just a gunshot in the restaurant.

1282
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,900
That was it. That's why it's scary when they pop up. I'm sorry I didn't know where that was going.

1283
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:42,940
I think the saddest thing in the world is when like you see in the distance like a

1284
00:51:42,940 --> 00:51:43,900
balloon

1285
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,580
going up into the sky. I laugh.

1286
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:50,340
I know that it belonged to a house with a little Korean boy in it

1287
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,940
and an old man and they're about to go on an adventure. True. That's a good point.

1288
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:57,540
If one balloon goes up they probably couldn't fly anymore.

1289
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,920
probably ruin their whole adventure.

1290
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,760
- Yeah.

1291
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,120
- You better believe that one time my parents' friend

1292
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:04,880
was sick in the hospital, so they went outside

1293
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,080
the hospital building and released a bunch of balloons.

1294
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:07,920
- Yup.

1295
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:08,740
- So they floated off.

1296
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,580
- Yup.

1297
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:10,420
- And they started crying.

1298
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:11,340
- Yup, yes.

1299
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:14,120
- Woo hoo.

1300
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:14,960
- Let 'em know.

1301
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,780
(laughing)

1302
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:18,040
Woo, talk that talk, OG.

1303
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,140
Let 'em know.

1304
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,760
- She really loved to see those beautiful white balloons.

1305
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,340
- She did, she did.

1306
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:27,280
- Outside her hospital window before her dialysis.

1307
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,540
(laughing)

1308
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:33,360
- You better believe that shit, bitch.

1309
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,080
- I love that balloon shit.

1310
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,760
- Motherfucker.

1311
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,080
- I love that balloon shit.

1312
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:40,880
- Yeah, number 10's toilet paper.

1313
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:42,480
This is-- - Enough!

1314
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,720
- Yeah, it's pretty much the same as toilet.

1315
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,000
- It's funny 'cause I usually just dookie on the paper.

1316
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:47,840
(laughing)

1317
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:48,800
It's weird.

1318
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,280
- I usually dookie on the paper,

1319
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,440
wipe my ass on the rim of the seat.

1320
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:55,200
- Especially, oh, you have one of those ones

1321
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,120
they have in Japan that it like--

1322
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:59,120
replaces the liner.

1323
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,120
Really? There's a Japanese toilet here?

1324
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:03,120
Yeah. Where?

1325
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,120
You've never been to a gas station in like, Altoona, Pennsylvania?

1326
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,120
They have the-

1327
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,120
All-Tuna?

1328
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,120
Don't say All-Tuna.

1329
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,120
I mean, it's not just some, but I'll tell you what.

1330
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:17,120
Wait, the ones that automatically replace the liner?

1331
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,120
I've seen those before.

1332
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,120
Yeah, they really- remember we went to that place with-

1333
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,120
Dude, what are you, poor?

1334
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah.

1335
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,120
No.

1336
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,120
What was it like to go to Japan?

1337
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,120
No, we went to that fucking, I don't, it's somewhere around here that like...

1338
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:32,120
Dude, chill, you don't have to do gun fingers at us.

1339
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,120
I'm trying to think of words.

1340
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:35,120
Stop, don't put it yourself.

1341
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,120
AHHHHHHHHH!

1342
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,120
No, that like, that really expensive place that Potashnik took us to.

1343
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:43,120
Oh, they had that there?

1344
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,120
Yeah.

1345
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,120
Did you walk in and fold your poop and put it inside?

1346
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,120
[Laughter]

1347
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,120
I took a video of it.

1348
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,120
I did take a video of it, me pressing the button, because I was excited.

1349
00:53:52,120 --> 00:53:53,120
It's pretty exciting.

1350
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:56,600
exciting. Yeah. You've seen the video of the guy who puts poop on one of those

1351
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,560
and presses the button and it smears the poop all the way around. You haven't seen that?

1352
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:06,240
No. It's so good. It sounds really good. I'm gonna be honest with you, the thought of that just made me sick.

1353
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:10,440
Maybe you shouldn't have done so many drugs last night. You'd kill me eating a piece of crap.

1354
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:22,520
Liquid, so what I drink smoke. No, you're a fool. So what I drink. Me and Jack Benzinger, we sang that for three

1355
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:28,960
and a half hours in the night so what I drink smoke so what I beer weed shout

1356
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,020
out to Jack I love you you're one of my best friends seriously man like I miss

1357
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:42,520
you could you do it without him so I drink smoke so and those balloons floated

1358
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:49,520
right up to heaven. Yes sir! Woo! Woo!

1359
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,520
Ok we got the contenders here.

1360
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:59,520
There's newcomers here, the newcomers to the list are Craig and Sanjay from Sanjay and Craig, which looks like a cartoon.

1361
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,520
Why would that be bad?

1362
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,520
Can you skip number 11? That's like so disgusting.

1363
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:06,520
Yeah number 11 is maybe even too disgusting to look at.

1364
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,060
Yeah, I'm a female comedian so I could talk about this

1365
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:15,840
Tampon oh my god. Yeah again. I'm a female comedian

1366
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:34,580
What's a month once a month Oh

1367
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:36,580
Oh, I thought it was every day.

1368
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:42,580
It's like a faucet that's on and fills up the whole room like the Shining.

1369
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:43,580
What?

1370
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:44,580
Yeah.

1371
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,580
It's true?

1372
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,580
It's like a murder mystery scene.

1373
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:52,580
That scene where there's a room full of blood and a murder mystery.

1374
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:55,580
Who filled up this room with blood?

1375
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,580
That's the mystery.

1376
00:55:57,580 --> 00:56:00,580
Yeah, well it's like when the butler comes in and says, "Somebody filled the room with blood."

1377
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:03,580
And I have to clean that crap? Come on!

1378
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:06,860
It was the guy with the candlestick in the other place.

1379
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,220
Filling up this place with damn barbecue sauce.

1380
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:11,420
I wouldn't want to be a tampon.

1381
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:14,580
I guess unless it was like a really hot girl.

1382
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:18,580
I usually take a doogie on a tampon when I put that in my ass.

1383
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:22,340
Maybe if it was a hot girl and she needed a tampon.

1384
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:27,220
If she needed a tampon between her boobs instead, then that would be the perfect life.

1385
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,620
Dude, that's nasty.

1386
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:31,460
I'm just saying, hey, a guy's gotta be a guy.

1387
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,060
And I want to be a boob tampon for life.

1388
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:36,500
- We gotta go, I'm gonna get kicked out of this place soon.

1389
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,660
- One more, one more, 13 is Ash.

1390
00:56:38,660 --> 00:56:42,060
Imagine being about to be turned into a beauty or a unicorn

1391
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:44,180
or any animal or object of your choice,

1392
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:46,780
but the magic trick fails and you get cremated.

1393
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:49,860
This isn't a magically turned object, this is death.

1394
00:56:49,860 --> 00:56:51,700
This is a badly burnt corpse.

1395
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:54,340
Death by being burnt, one of the worst ways to die.

1396
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,420
- One of the worst ways to die is being

1397
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:58,220
what happened at 9/11.

1398
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:59,060
- That's true.

1399
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,080
- The entire city of New York was covered in this stuff.

1400
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,360
I mean, you couldn't escape this crap.

1401
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:05,200
They were so sick of--

1402
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,040
It was so annoying.

1403
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:08,000
I mean, everybody was fine with ash before 9/11.

1404
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:08,840
Yeah.

1405
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:09,660
They just got too much of it.

1406
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:10,500
Absolutely.

1407
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,320
You know what I mean?

1408
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:12,160
Yeah.

1409
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,000
It's like snow, you know?

1410
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,960
It's like, it's cool.

1411
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:16,480
Like, the first day, it's like, oh, this is beautiful.

1412
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,560
But then after that, it's like, I just want this gone.

1413
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:20,640
Yeah, I just, you know,

1414
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,480
the first few days of ash in New York City--

1415
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:23,320
Exactly.

1416
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,960
It's like, I'm out there playing, sledding,

1417
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,680
making ash man.

1418
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,520
And where were you guys--

1419
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:28,880
There's a lot of ash men, actually.

1420
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,120
Where were you guys on the day of 9/11,

1421
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:38,040
just pre-school. Yeah I was just a beautiful thought in a monk's brain.

1422
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:46,180
That's how you know that guy interned at UCB! Let him know dude. I love them. I was just like a

1423
00:57:46,180 --> 00:57:50,040
sparkle at the top of a rainbow back then. I was actually the most beautiful creature

1424
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,840
of all time back then but you wouldn't know. I was in my mom's

1425
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,360
basement because she put me down there because she was afraid that they were

1426
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:05,840
gonna hit New Hampshire. That would be very funny. They're like Twin Towers, Pentagon,

1427
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:12,040
White House and New Hampshire. Yeah, the Red Arrow Diner got hit. And Adam Sandler's crying

1428
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,560
because he's from New York and New Hampshire and he's just like, "They took everyone, they

1429
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,760
took all my stuff!" Yeah. That would be really tragic. "They took all the things I love!"

1430
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:27,040
him. Whoa, those are really good. Insane. Wait, do it again. Do uncut gems. That's pretty fucking

1431
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:32,480
good man. Another moment of anti-Semitism on podcast about lists. Was that anti-Semitic?

1432
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,040
Tune in for more on the Patreon. That's right. More anti-Semitic moments. Number 200 is a

1433
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,960
Caillou DVD. Oh hell no. Oh hell no. Oh hell no. I'd have to spin around in a DVD player,

1434
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,560
get a laser pointed at me? No. No. I hate that shit. I hate to be an iridescent

1435
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,040
metallic desk that's the most beautiful thing anyone's ever seen.

1436
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:56,480
But at least you'd be like one of the few like bald main characters

1437
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,920
that is actually on television. You know, so that's something to think about.

1438
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,720
They're probably gonna have a lot of, do show a lot of support for Caillou.

1439
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,160
Uh, I follow a YouTube account called Bald Cafe that teaches you how to better shave the top of

1440
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:12,320
your head. Bye. So. Is this gonna be behind a paywall?

1441
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,840
Nope. No. Fuck you.
