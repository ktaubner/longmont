1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,580
- All right.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,400
Well, Julio's not here today.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:13,520
We kind of went at that with different ways.

5
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:15,480
So yeah, hey everybody.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,200
Mommy's gone, so we're changing it up.

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,440
We're doing a little D&D session

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,860
with Caleb and Patrick,

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,360
and not Juvio at all.

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,280
- No, okay, right off the bat,

11
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,600
it's Caleb versus Patrick, is it not?

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,440
- Yes, it is, 'cause it's Spy versus Spy.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,640
So-- - Do they have a theme song?

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,240
- I don't think-- - Yeah, Spy versus Spy.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,120
- Yeah, there's a theme song. - They're a comic.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,480
They're a comic, then they were--

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,800
- Somebody never watched Mad TV.

18
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,000
- I never, I didn't, did they have--

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,720
- I watched Mad TV. - I watched Mad TV.

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,160
I don't remember Spy versus Spy,

21
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:56,040
like interstitial cartoons, they have that?

22
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:01,460
Yep, I guess I didn't watch mad TV that close. Oh, that was like season one though. They got rid of that pretty early

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:08,380
Yeah, I'm lucky you yeah, that's probably why I didn't get to why you saying fuck me cuz it's me versus you man

24
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:13,420
Oh, yeah, that's true. Fuck. They all they did make a spy verse by video game -

25
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,880
Sounds good was it? Yeah guys on PlayStation 1 right? Is it the guys my station - and dango?

26
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,920
I don't think so. It might have been what it kills that that's

27
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,940
Oh, it's gonna drive me crazy. It's a Tim Schafer, right?

28
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,340
- It's Tim Schafer? - Tim Schafer, yeah.

29
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,340
Yeah. All right.

30
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:33,240
I'm gonna pull up the first map.

31
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,340
So, the way it's gonna work is I'm gonna give you guys

32
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,540
three random items that you're gonna roll to see what you get.

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,340
And then you're gonna try to use those items to kill each other

34
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,540
in each of the areas. And then each time it...

35
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,240
And we're gonna do best out of three

36
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,040
or best out of five, really, depending on

37
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,040
sort of how long it ends up taking for you guys to kill each other.

38
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,840
There's other people involved, there's other little things that can happen.

39
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
But we're gonna start...

40
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,840
- over here. - Do they have, like, voices that they do?

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,640
No, they're, like, silent. They're completely silent.

42
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,240
Oh, that's actually...

43
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,040
- Thank God. - Salute.

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,440
Are you setting up any kind of story?

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,240
I mean, did we ever find out through the comic

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,040
why the spy and the spy do not care for each other besides...

47
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
It's like a race thing, right?

48
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
I don't think it's a race thing.

49
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
I would hope not.

50
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Should I not say that?

51
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Maybe.

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
I don't know if we could get sued for that.

53
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
I think you're going to get in trouble.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,040
I don't know if we're going to get sued for that.

55
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Maybe we should think of something to call them

56
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,040
Agent vs. Spy.

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
White vs.

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,040
White vs.

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
No.

60
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
I don't think White vs. Black is going to work.

61
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,040
No, but they're white and black, man. This is tough.

62
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
Oh, yeah.

63
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
Let's just go... I liked your typo that you made when we were setting this up.

64
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Brown versus black.

65
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
You said soy versus spy.

66
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,040
Oh, yeah. I was by accident.

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I like soy versus spy.

68
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,040
Okay, cool.

69
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
So, who's soy?

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
I guess that's different enough.

71
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Who's soy?

72
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:10,040
The white one is soy.

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,040
Right. All right. So, Pat's soy and you're spy.

74
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,040
And I'm spy.

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,040
Okay, cool.

76
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Okay.

77
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,040
And begin.

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,320
So, as far as set up and story,

79
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,760
it's just that you guys are living inside

80
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,600
of a spy versus, a spy versus spy comic.

81
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,320
And the various scenarios that happen,

82
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,980
you're always trying to get at each other.

83
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,560
That's your set up and story.

84
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,280
And we're gonna start with rolling for initiative

85
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,500
to see who goes first.

86
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,760
We're starting in like a medieval, little medieval square.

87
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,200
We're gonna start very D and D E

88
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,600
and then we're gonna veer off from there.

89
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:46,300
So, both of you guys roll your initiatives.

90
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,740
So I 16th. You've got character sheets and everything. Okay, cool.

91
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:59,660
Okay, well, I got a 16 and those character sheets are in one. I know

92
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,380
where they are. You know where they are. We were doing this for a

93
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:07,100
while. Where's the character sheets? Found it. Alright, that's

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,380
a point. That's not a no. No, I found it. Well, where are they?

95
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:14,220
Spies up. Oh, don't give him a hint.

96
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,340
Okay.

97
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,060
Well, no, I got it.

98
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,260
Then we, because then we can't.

99
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,660
He has to give me a hint because yeah, then we can't do anything.

100
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,380
I have to give you a hint. I can't tell you where it is.

101
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,420
Well, I just fired.

102
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,020
Okay.

103
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,220
And I got a three.

104
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,940
Don't fire.

105
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,940
Okay.

106
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,460
Okay. I rolled 11 on initiative.

107
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,260
Okay. So Pat.

108
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,660
Wait, mine says that I'm the black spy.

109
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,740
No, you're the white spy.

110
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,140
No, you can click on white spy.

111
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
I don't I don't see it on my screen.

112
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,260
I could be white spy. You want to switch?

113
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,260
I guess we have to switch.

114
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,660
No, no, I don't want to switch because then I'm soy.

115
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,060
Go to the newspaper.

116
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:54,360
I don't I don't have I don't have white spy on my screen.

117
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,860
Did I give you the wrong one then?

118
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,060
You gave me black spy.

119
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,560
So you're soy Caleb.

120
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,060
That's my bad.

121
00:04:59,060 --> 00:04:59,660
I have both.

122
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,860
Oh, okay.

123
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,460
I will give you black spy Pat.

124
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,760
I mean white spy.

125
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,860
Sorry, I'll fix that.

126
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,260
Sorry, but I'm going to need your kill.

127
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,160
Now I don't want it.

128
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,160
No, you're going to have to have it.

129
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,360
I mean, you have to refresh your browser and everything.

130
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
Just not yet. Don't do it yet.

131
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Oh, man.

132
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
And Caleb, I'm revoking your...

133
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,900
This is too much trouble.

134
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,960
Your soy spice. No, it's too much trouble for me.

135
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,160
You just have...

136
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,760
Too much trouble.

137
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,260
I think we got to just...

138
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,260
We got to reset.

139
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,300
The whole episode.

140
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,360
No, we already had the whole lore.

141
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,300
We did a whole lore background.

142
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,160
Yeah, that's true.

143
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,900
Yeah, you guys remember.

144
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,200
All right. Refresh your screen.

145
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,600
Okay, I just found it.

146
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,200
This is the white spy role initiative,

147
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,800
motherfucker.

148
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,300
Okay.

149
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:50,200
Oh, oh, the first point goes to

150
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,300
Caleb's awesome black spy.

151
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,100
Wait, wait.

152
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,500
I know I rolled and it didn't do anything.

153
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,600
No, no, you rolled a six.

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,300
No, no, because it still it says

155
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:00,800
I'm okay.

156
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,200
Hold on.

157
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,800
Let me fix it.

158
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,100
Now.

159
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,000
The whole world saw this.

160
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,400
He's already trying to cheat.

161
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,700
No, no, hold on.

162
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,100
Hold on.

163
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:12,100
It's confusing now because it said that I was a black spy, but now I'm a white spy.

164
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,300
You already rolled initiative, man.

165
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,300
All right, you got to say it.

166
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
No, because that's under you.

167
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,300
All right, both of you re-roll.

168
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,300
Oh my God.

169
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,300
It made no sense.

170
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,300
I thought that you kept rolling.

171
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
I fucked it up.

172
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,300
I fucked it up.

173
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,300
Caleb, I fucked it up.

174
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
I'm sorry.

175
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,300
This is already going amazing.

176
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,740
All right, we have not done roll 20 in a while.

177
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,020
I have not done roll 20 in a while.

178
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
I got a 10.

179
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,020
I got a 20.

180
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
Caleb and white spy.

181
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
Here, let me change it to...

182
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,020
Here, let me change it to Black Spy.

183
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,020
Maybe that should be...

184
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,020
Caleb vs White Spy.

185
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,020
Okay, I'm fine with my guy being named Caleb.

186
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,020
He's gotta be victorious.

187
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
Yeah, Caleb vs White Spy.

188
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
Okay, cool. White Spy does go first, though.

189
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,020
Okay, so now what I need you to do, White Spy,

190
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,020
is roll that d20 three times.

191
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,020
Okay.

192
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,020
And then I will message you on Discord

193
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:06,020
What items you received?

194
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,020
I got a 12.

195
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
Three times.

196
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:13,020
Roll it three times.

197
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,020
Oh, you rolled a 2, a 5, and a 5. Okay.

198
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
Yeah.

199
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:18,020
Okay, yeah, no, no, no. That's what I want.

200
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,020
Oh, you got two 2s? Okay.

201
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
Two 5s.

202
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Oh, two 5s. Okay.

203
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,020
One 2 and two 5s.

204
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,020
All right.

205
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,020
You said "ooh," so that means it's good.

206
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,020
That means 2 is a good item, which I don't like.

207
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:35,580
Okay, cool. You're gonna get some cool stuff and then, oh boy.

208
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:41,180
Please tell me some bomb, bro. It's like the one way these fuckers die is with a bomb.

209
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,180
Yeah.

210
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,420
Where are you sending me? Where are you sending the...

211
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,420
Where am I sending you?

212
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,420
On Discord?

213
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
Sending you on Discord, yeah.

214
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,420
Okay.

215
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:56,900
Check this out, guys. I'm fucking his... I'm fucking him.

216
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Don't fuck me.

217
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,900
Don't fuck me.

218
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:03,340
We're not even supposed to be near each other right now.

219
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,900
Stop fucking my character.

220
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,060
Don't get inside of me.

221
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,060
I'm out of you.

222
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,060
I'm inside of you.

223
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,060
I'm out of you.

224
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,060
I'm inside of you.

225
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:15,220
Okay, I got good stuff.

226
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,420
He got good stuff?

227
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,620
I'm going back to my corner.

228
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:19,620
Okay.

229
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,620
I'm over here.

230
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,620
I'm next to this guy now.

231
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:24,060
All right, Caleb, now you roll 3d20s.

232
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,060
Okay, here I go.

233
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,500
A 17, an 8, and a 2.

234
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,500
Oh, looks like we both got a 2.

235
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Okay.

236
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
So whatever you got, I got 2.

237
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Alright.

238
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Oh, but now he knows what I have.

239
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Fuck.

240
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
Yep.

241
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
He's cheating already.

242
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
He already cheated once.

243
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,500
Damn, I got bad rolls.

244
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,500
This is not good.

245
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Those are good items.

246
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,500
You're wrong.

247
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Wait, so did Caleb get shit items?

248
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
No, he got a good item.

249
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,500
What'd you say?

250
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Was it 18?

251
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Right?

252
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Yeah, there it is.

253
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Okay.

254
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:58,420
No, he got a good item. What did you say? It was an 18, right? Yeah, there it is. Okay. 17, I mean. Okay.

255
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,900
17, an 8, and a 2. Oh, yeah. I like 17.

256
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:09,940
All right, and then...

257
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,180
an 8.

258
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:22,020
Oh, okay. All right. Yeah, I'm gonna win. You might win. You've only got two items.

259
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:29,060
You also have your rogue your your I put you guys in here as rogue. So you also have just the ability to like

260
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,740
Do basic attacks

261
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,400
Consider any like the rapiers or any of that shit. That's just like

262
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,700
Come on, man. If I have a question if I have a

263
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:47,180
Equipment item am I just wearing it by default or do I need to use it?

264
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,460
Oh

265
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,060
Yeah, you're wearing it by the fall.

266
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
Is it passive?

267
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,060
I know what you're asking about.

268
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,060
Yes.

269
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:03,740
Anyway, also, this, sorry, I haven't used Zencaster in like five years.

270
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:07,180
I'm not seeing my fucking audio thing go up and down.

271
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,340
Should I see that on my end?

272
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,340
We hear you.

273
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,340
You're fine.

274
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,340
You guys hear me?

275
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,340
Alright, I'm terrified.

276
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,340
You're fine.

277
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,340
Okay, cool.

278
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,500
Alright, so you're up now, Soy.

279
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Soy versus Caleb.

280
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,580
So you can go, you can see here that you have a 30 feet of movement.

281
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,820
And yeah, Caleb, take off your headphones.

282
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Because we're, I want you to know exactly until you guys are in eyesight of each other.

283
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,700
Until you guys are in eyesight of each other.

284
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:44,140
So, so, so I, you can see here there's like a stand where people are, there's like a market.

285
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,260
There's a few other places you can go.

286
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,260
What do you want to do?

287
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,260
What are you thinking?

288
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,460
Um, do I know where he is?

289
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,460
Uh, you know vaguely.

290
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,860
Like, am I tracking him down?

291
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,860
Okay.

292
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,860
Yeah, you know vaguely.

293
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:03,460
Then I'm gonna, I'm gonna go, well what's this turtle here?

294
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,140
Oh, that's a frog.

295
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
You see that?

296
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,140
Oh, that's a frog?

297
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,140
Yeah.

298
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,500
I saw a dim, purple.

299
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,180
I guess I have to go and talk to this frog, huh?

300
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
You don't have to.

301
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Okay.

302
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,920
All right, well then I'm gonna climb up to this roof.

303
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,280
Okay, which roof?

304
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,280
I put my guy there.

305
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,320
Okay, that's crazy.

306
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,360
So that's, let's count how many feet that is.

307
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,280
Okay, I put it there then.

308
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:31,640
Okay, so roll an athletics check also.

309
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,520
It might not be bad, oh, he can't hear me,

310
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,640
I just realized.

311
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,480
Yeah.

312
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,320
I just don't want him to freak out.

313
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,320
16.

314
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
Okay, that's fine, yeah,

315
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,960
you climbed that roof pretty easily.

316
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,040
Yeah, okay, and you have a full view of everything.

317
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,160
All right, what do you wanna do now?

318
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,660
So I can see him?

319
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,500
If I have a full view?

320
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,320
You can see him.

321
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
You can see him.

322
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,260
Okay.

323
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Then I am going to,

324
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,620
do I have a disguise kit?

325
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,180
No, you don't.

326
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,380
Okay.

327
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,360
Then I am gonna jump to this building.

328
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,900
Okay, roll another athletics check or acrobatics check.

329
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,420
Acrobatics?

330
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,860
Either one is fine.

331
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,060
Okay.

332
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,900
18.

333
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,340
Nice, okay, cool.

334
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,160
Are you doing a fucking back flip?

335
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,660
That's kind of your movement.

336
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,980
As you jump over, you do hear a dog bark below you,

337
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,820
by the way, and--

338
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,680
I'm 18.

339
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,560
Yeah, no, you just hear a dog bark below you.

340
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,400
You didn't do it stealth.

341
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,220
All right.

342
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,760
You're fine.

343
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,560
Well, now I'm crouched.

344
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,600
Give me a thumbs up-- Okay, cool.

345
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,560
When I can put my headphones back on.

346
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,040
All right, are we thumbs, are you good?

347
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,560
Are you, what are you gonna do?

348
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,780
You got anything else you wanna do for now, Pat?

349
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,280
Anything you wanna do?

350
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,500
I'm gonna go prone.

351
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,920
Okay, go prone.

352
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,420
All right, cool.

353
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,020
All right, it'll be Caleb's turn then, Caleb.

354
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,060
That is so fucking stressful.

355
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:57,900
Yeah.

356
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,580
That really stressed me out.

357
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,660
He did some pretty crazy stuff.

358
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,040
What did he do?

359
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,880
You'll find out.

360
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,560
I can't tell you, yeah.

361
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,860
So now what, is it my turn?

362
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,360
Yes, what I will tell you is that you can see

363
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:16,640
white figure up atop a building across the market. I do see him. But you can't see him

364
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:21,960
as well as you were before. It looks like you could see him for a moment and then he

365
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:31,920
kind of like fell a little bit out of sight. Okay. Hmm. Is it my turn? Oh yeah. All right,

366
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
Take your headphones off, Pat.

367
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,920
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

368
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Okay.

369
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I think that I'm going to hold out my giant magnet.

370
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,920
It's one of the items I bought.

371
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Yes.

372
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,920
A powerful magnet that can attract metal objects from a distance.

373
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
And I think that I... What's my movement speed?

374
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
So, 30. Just typical shit.

375
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
Okay, I think I'm going to move...

376
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Just typical shit.

377
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,920
Basically 30 feet in his direction with my stealth shoes on.

378
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Okay, cool.

379
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,920
Okay, cool.

380
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:02,200
And to see if maybe I attract something with my beautiful magnet.

381
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Nice, yeah.

382
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,320
I would say that if you want to, because he, he, you don't know, but like, I would say

383
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,760
that like he could probably see you from up there.

384
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,640
And like, so I just wanted to let you know that that's probably true.

385
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:20,020
So and like you would, you would know that.

386
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,400
So if you're going to move forward, like he'll know that that's happening.

387
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,120
That means he's doing something, he said something you can't do.

388
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,320
Okay, so I have moved 30 feet.

389
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Do I attract anything with my magnet?

390
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,120
Yes, you do.

391
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,320
So this woman in front of you, she's got a jewelry stand and

392
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,620
some of her jewels just start like flying off and onto your

393
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,220
magnet.

394
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:40,920
And she's like, hey, what are you doing young man?

395
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,420
Young Caleb.

396
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,120
Do I have any money?

397
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,320
I just heard Pat just say, hey.

398
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,720
You have 70 gold pieces.

399
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,020
All right.

400
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,920
How much is it going to cost to buy all this jewelry off of

401
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,120
you?

402
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,840
About 55 gold pieces.

403
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,040
Yeah, here, take 'em. I don't need this shit.

404
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,320
You don't need the shit, the gold?

405
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,200
No, no, no.

406
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,840
Oh, good.

407
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,760
I like bling, bitch.

408
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,080
Is he still moving?

409
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,560
Ugh, okay.

410
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,280
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... I'm just a negotiating tactic, okay? I didn't mean to say...

411
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,280
I'm not like that.

412
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:22,680
Okay, she's walking over here. She's going to accept the money. Okay.

413
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:22,920
Okay.

414
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,240
Cool.

415
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,280
So now I have 15.

416
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,520
Yeah, okay. And you got a bunch of jewelry too. So stuff you can maybe do with that.

417
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,160
She's going to go back.

418
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:31,320
Yeah.

419
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:36,120
So that's what you've attracted so far. That's just, you can use that magnet,

420
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,600
like throughout. There are other things you'll be able to attract as you move through.

421
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,640
Okay. Can I hear, oh, here's what I'm going to do. Can I put on all the jewelry and then also

422
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:50,920
put on the magnet as if it is a piece of jewelry, like around my neck, maybe like a chain.

423
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,320
Sure.

424
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,060
So that it's maybe a little more.

425
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,400
Maybe Patrick doesn't know what's going on when he looks at me.

426
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,660
I like that.

427
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,600
Let's do that with I'm trying to think of what you can do for that.

428
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,440
Let's do that with a

429
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,180
let's do a charisma check on that charisma check.

430
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,240
OK, yeah, it's considered that like it'd be maybe like a.

431
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,220
Yeah, it's a charisma check.

432
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,440
I kind of like that.

433
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,320
And I put my headphones on at 20.

434
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,220
Oh, OK. I like that.

435
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:16,920
All right.

436
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,320
He will not be able to tell that your magnet is an actual magnet.

437
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,660
that bullshit. Okay. All right. Perfect. All right. Okay, cool.

438
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,900
We'll end your turn. Um, wait, let me see. Sorry. Yeah, there's

439
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:32,080
nothing really. Oh, can I? Oh, can I hide the explosive canary

440
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,520
figure in this jewelry stand? Ooh, you can do that your next

441
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,640
turn because you I should have said this up front. I'll say

442
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:43,800
this to Pat, like one item use per turn. Okay. All right. But

443
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,080
okay, that's a bad idea. All right, Pat, you're ready to go.

444
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
And he's looking at his phone.

445
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
He's looking at his phone.

446
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
So he doesn't know.

447
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
He can't know.

448
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
Alright, cool man.

449
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
What happened?

450
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
No, he can't tell you.

451
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
We're not allowed to tell you, asshole.

452
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Okay.

453
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
Piece of shit.

454
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
Now what?

455
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
You gotta take off your headphones, you goofball.

456
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Oh, okay.

457
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Oh, it's just that?

458
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
I just rolled a stealth check and I got a 27.

459
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Yeah, cause you're gonna hide from me, you fucking piece of shit.

460
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
Take 'em off.

461
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,800
Alright.

462
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,800
Okay, so he's...

463
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Can I see him?

464
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
Can I see him?

465
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
Yeah, you can.

466
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
I'm gonna go to the other side.

467
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I'm gonna go to the other side.

468
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
I'm gonna go to the other side.

469
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,800
it.

470
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Take them off. All right.

471
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,080
Okay. So he's... Can I see him right now?

472
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:26,600
You can't really see him now, but he's like kind of in the mix of the market. But with

473
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:31,680
that 27 stealth check, he's not going to really be able to see you. What are you... Are you

474
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,080
hiding behind like a chimney? Like what's your plan?

475
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:40,160
Well, yeah. I'm prone behind a chimney and you can see my arms and legs out the back.

476
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,560
But because I rolled a 27, all he thinks that is, is like a piece of cloth that flew into

477
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,560
the air or something.

478
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
Yeah, I like that as a hide action that you did.

479
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,880
Okay, cool.

480
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,360
So what I'm going to do now is maybe I'm going to crawl across the top of the building.

481
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,160
Oh wait, look right here.

482
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:04,720
There's these like little...

483
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Little goblins.

484
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
These are...

485
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,560
Well, no, no, the string here, that's clothed wire?

486
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,960
Clothing. Yes, that is clothing wire.

487
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,060
That's what is it?

488
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,220
It's not called clothing wire.

489
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,160
What's the word for that?

490
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,460
It's like a laundry thing.

491
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,000
Clothesline. Clothesline.

492
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,500
Yeah.

493
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm going to zip line across the clothesline.

494
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,220
OK, before you do that.

495
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:23,360
With the with my hat.

496
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,760
Before you do that.

497
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,160
With my fedora.

498
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,720
I'm going to I'm going to hide that area.

499
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,160
I'm going to hide the area around you.

500
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,460
So don't be alarmed.

501
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,500
Julio won't be able to see it either.

502
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
Okay. What does that mean?

503
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:43,900
Whoa, you'll see.

504
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,780
And so I'm going to just, I'm going to reveal.

505
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:53,860
The area here, because you got that 27 on stealth, and so I don't want Caleb to be able to see it.

506
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,660
Whoa.

507
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:59,180
So Caleb, don't my God.

508
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,940
So, so he's not going to see it.

509
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,180
And so you're, I guess we tell, should we tell him in the chat?

510
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,700
I moved you over to where you wanted to go, by the way.

511
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,300
Okay, we'll tell him in a second.

512
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:13,400
So you're now hidden over there with that 27 stealth.

513
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,200
There's no way he's going to be able to find you right now.

514
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,900
So that's kind of where I can leave you at.

515
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,800
What did you want to do?

516
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:24,100
Well, I got to see what the building is.

517
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:29,300
I was going to go down the chimney and then sneak in and then get a

518
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,800
disguise from whoever's home.

519
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,700
It was for sure.

520
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,100
This home belongs to an adventurer who often will leave town to go

521
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:41,860
out and fight off goblins. He's right now dealing with them. They followed him back to his home

522
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:46,180
in the front yard here. But you can climb, you can go into his home right now. Nobody's there.

523
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:51,860
So, oh, no one's there? Oh, shit. Yeah, then I'm going in there and I'm putting on his tuxedo.

524
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,660
This adventurous tuxedo.

525
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,620
Yeah, I mean, I'm putting on his tuxedo.

526
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,660
I'm glad you mentioned that.

527
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:08,340
Maybe I just take my no 'cause I need the hat, but I mean, does what he can. Caleb recognize me from

528
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:17,300
my hat or is it like clothes? Does he not? And if I'm not, if I don't look exactly like white spy,

529
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,060
if you if you roll, let's have you roll a charisma to like putting on this disguise.

530
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,180
I wish I had a we. Yeah, I'll tell you about this later, but yeah,

531
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,720
Just roll charisma. Let's see how you do.

532
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,720
23.

533
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,220
Okay.

534
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:31,820
Wow, a crit also.

535
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,820
What the fuck?

536
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:37,260
I don't know what's happening, but my rolls are completely boss.

537
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,200
Yeah, you don't have auto crit on because you got a 13 on animal,

538
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,660
which I don't know why he rolled animal handling, but...

539
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,040
I said I pet an animal on the roof.

540
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I didn't even hear you say that.

541
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,780
Okay, cool.

542
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:47,780
So you are now...

543
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,700
This is going to be crazy.

544
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,040
You're now perfectly disguised as a...

545
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,120
As a butler.

546
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
As a butler adventurer.

547
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,120
- And yeah, are you gonna leave the house?

548
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,120
All right, your movement's kind of up, I think, actually.

549
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:05,040
- Yeah, I'm gonna leave the house as--

550
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,880
- As a butler.

551
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,600
So we're just gonna have you over here.

552
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,440
Here's what I'm gonna do.

553
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,000
- I'm walking around, what's the word for this thing

554
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,440
with the clamshell on top of it?

555
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,020
- Oh, God.

556
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,680
- Butler's food thing.

558
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,880
- Butler's food thing.

559
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,720
- What is that called?

560
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,160
It starts with a C.

561
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,060
I have no idea, but here's what we're gonna do.

562
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,060
I'm going to put in here a different icon

563
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,460
and I will move him for you for now.

564
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,660
And we'll see if Caleb probably won't notice

565
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,120
that it's a different guy.

566
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,660
So just give me one second while I pull out an icon.

567
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:50,700
- What is that thing called that butlers hold?

568
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,900
- I don't know what a butler clam thing is.

569
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,500
We'll ask, we'll ask Caleb.

570
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,060
He'll get, he'll hopefully he won't use that as a hint.

571
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,020
Um, oh, then, then we won't ask him at all.

572
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,260
Okay, fine.

573
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:04,940
Sorry.

574
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,140
Roll 20 is taking about three and a half years to load.

575
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,500
Um, I mean, we can chop this up.

576
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,460
Yeah, I got you.

577
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,460
I'm just going to actually just copy and paste a guy and then put them over

578
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,500
there and that'll be the guy.

579
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,500
Okay.

580
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,780
All right.

581
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,180
and put him over here.

582
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,700
And then I'm gonna take out your character for now.

583
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,300
We'll put him back another time.

584
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,440
And you'll be this character who is here once I reveal.

585
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,620
And I'm gonna give Caleb a thumbs up.

586
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:40,540
- I'm watching a video right now on how to be a butler.

587
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,040
- Okay.

588
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,740
That sounds good.

589
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,500
- Is it a carrying tray?

590
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,500
- Yay!

591
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,820
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.

592
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,820
I'm back guys.

593
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,820
Okay.

594
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,820
Yes you are.

595
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,820
Huh?

596
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,220
I said yes you are.

597
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,220
I am.

598
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,220
Alright.

599
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,380
Okay, hold on.

600
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,380
This should work soon.

601
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,780
Please tell me I'm not about to fucking die, bro.

602
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,660
You're not gonna about to fucking die.

603
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:09,260
I'm trying to just get the fucking...

604
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,580
Roll 20 is the worst fucking thing in the world.

605
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:14,340
Where is this white cracker?

606
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
Where did you go?

607
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
Hold on.

608
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,740
I don't know.

609
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,420
You know, where did you go?

610
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,420
I don't know.

611
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
I don't know where I went.

612
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,940
There's a completely black part of the screen.

613
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:28,220
I leave for one second.

614
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:33,500
I'm trying to unblack it.

615
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:36,780
It's actually, no, go back, go back, stop it.

616
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,480
Whatever, bitch.

617
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,480
Don't call me that.

618
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
Okay.

619
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
I'm a nice guy.

620
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
Dad.

621
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
That's fine.

622
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
There we go.

623
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Cool.

624
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
All right.

625
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
So, you're up now, Caleb.

626
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,980
I still don't see him.

627
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,580
OK, Pat, I got to take my headphones.

628
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,220
Get the fuck out of here.

629
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,720
In the meantime, I'm going to learn.

630
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,780
So here's what I'll tell you what you saw, at least, Caleb.

631
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,060
You saw that white spy kind of disappear even further away.

632
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,460
And you didn't know where he went.

633
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,660
And now he's kind of gone.

634
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:17,560
Does he look at my

635
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,920
Does he...

636
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,880
Here's also... Actually, I will have you do those, sorry.

637
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,760
Roll a...

638
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:29,360
Roll Wisdom Saving Throw. I think that's fair.

639
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,920
Twelve. Okay.

640
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:38,920
I should have really just had you roll Perception, but it's about the same thing anyway.

641
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,560
Okay, cool.

642
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:45,360
You notice something is a bit off in the town.

643
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,320
There's like...

644
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,800
It feels like with the spies,

645
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,440
feels like he's not he's gone, but he's not gone.

646
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,000
I can tell you that he's around here somewhere.

647
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,400
Is he made out of metal or does he like birds?

648
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,560
I can't answer the second one.

649
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,080
The first one, I don't think so, though.

650
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,200
OK, I'm going to wait.

651
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:16,080
Can I is it would you allow me to roll a performance check to see if I could

652
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,640
throw my canary figurine in a way that is convincingly a real bird?

653
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,240
Yeah, of course. Well, yeah, do that. That's going to be,

654
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,680
that's actually more like a sleight of... Is that sleight of hand?

655
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,320
Or what? I mean, let's see. Yes, it's sleight of hand. It is.

656
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,480
Yeah, is it? Okay.

657
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:32,800
It is.

658
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,120
I'll do that. I'll do that. I think that makes more sense to me. It's like more of a dexterity thing.

659
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,280
Okay. Okay, then I... And should I move now or can I move after?

660
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:52,720
You can do either. Here, I'm gonna throw this first. 16. Is that convincing enough?

661
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,840
Yeah, it's very nice. It looks very much like it could be a canary.

662
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,760
At least for a short period of time, I would say that that is believably a canary.

663
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,720
Okay, and I'd like to throw it generally in the direction of that frog.

664
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,560
Okay. Okay, and now I'm going to walk again,

665
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,480
magnet on my neck, walk another 30 feet over here.

666
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:25,040
Okay. Oh, yeah. So, yeah, you start to pull in a couple of pots and pans out of one of a...

667
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,920
more of a general goods tent, and people are a little bit annoyed at you, but nothing else so

668
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,720
far. Okay. I throw him a couple more dollars.

669
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,480
Okay, cool. Yeah, you're fine there.

670
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,480
That's not you using your magnet, I would say.

671
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,820
You kind of used your canary, yeah.

672
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:43,360
So, okay, so the canary is flying in the general direction of that frog.

673
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:44,060
Is that what you're saying?

674
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,560
Yeah.

675
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,620
Are you targeting it for the frog or...?

676
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,760
Just kind of...

677
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:55,120
Honestly, I'm trying to see if I can bait out some kind of utility from him

678
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,880
as he maybe is going to try to shoot this canary and have it explode or something.

679
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
Cool.

680
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,880
The frog will with his gun.

681
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,720
Yeah, or at least maybe he'll make some noise while he's shooting something.

682
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,080
All right. That's it for me.

683
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,180
All right, cool.

684
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:12,720
Pat, you can't hear us, I'm a dummy.

685
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,580
Come on, man. There we go.

686
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,820
His headphones are off.

687
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,980
Mm hmm. Mm hmm.

688
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,980
It's called a cloche.

689
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,620
It's called a cloche.

690
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,520
OK, so now we don't know what him.

691
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,320
So he's over there now.

692
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,380
Yeah. In front of you getting further away from me.

693
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,440
Well, I'm still I'm like outside of this person's house now.

694
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,380
Roll a perception check.

695
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,380
OK.

696
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,220
Oh, I'm not seeing shit.

697
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,260
I got to know.

698
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,980
No, nothing's nothing.

699
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,520
So, OK, I'm you got.

700
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,960
Yeah, you go outside the house.

701
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,900
You hear this adventurer go, stay away, goblins.

702
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,100
Stay away.

703
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,800
And I go, we're going to eat you.

704
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
OK, cool. I ignore him.

705
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,860
So I let him I let him die.

706
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,960
Yeah. OK.

707
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,000
So he goes over there to die.

708
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
And now what do you want to do?

709
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,900
I guess I'm going to.

710
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,940
Where's my because it used to be able

711
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,040
to see to be able to draw the thing

712
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,440
while he's gone, while he's gone,

713
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,300
while he's going pee pee, got it, got it.

714
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,060
I guess it's tell me where you want to go.

715
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:24,140
Where I'm going to go talk to Sullivan.

716
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:24,840
OK, cool.

717
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,160
Have him in the fucking thing.

718
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,440
I see the frog.

719
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,840
OK, cool.

720
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm going to go walk over to Sullivan

721
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,340
and see what happens when I interact with him.

722
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,380
I'm going to try to read his lips.

723
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,020
Cool.

724
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,420
I'm bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

725
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,920
Pat, take off your headphones.

726
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,420
Pat, take off your headphones.

727
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:43,720
Caleb.

728
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:50,560
Yes, he just he you just saw him walk over to the frog.

729
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,560
Oh, shit.

730
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,000
Fuck.

731
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
Did he see my I guess I don't I can't.

732
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,400
You can't answer if you saw the bird or not.

733
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,240
Mm-mm.

734
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,680
I was letting you know that happened.

735
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,760
He rolled a two on perception.

736
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,340
Well, all right then.

737
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,560
What can I do here?

738
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,180
So it says when activated, it explodes.

739
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:18,400
So unless you've, I'm gonna say that

740
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,840
the way we're doing this is like it has to be activated

741
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,420
after you put it in bird mode.

742
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,880
Yeah, I didn't know what, if it was,

743
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,040
I didn't know if it was,

744
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,880
Yeah, I mean, I just like...

745
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,560
Like he activates it or if I activate it.

746
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,680
These are not bespoke items created by me,

747
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,360
so we're playing on the fly here a little bit.

748
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,400
Okay, so I can now activate the bird.

749
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,960
That's what I'll say, yes.

750
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,280
I am going to activate my bird now.

751
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,200
Okay, your bird has been activated.

752
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,040
Pat, get Pat to put his headphones on.

753
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,560
Keep yours on, Caleb.

754
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,400
Okay.

755
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,920
Oh, you're done.

756
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,760
Okay.

757
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,600
Oh, you're done.

758
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,680
You're fucking done.

759
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,360
You walk over to say hi to the frog.

760
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,760
He goes, "Hi, I'm Sullivan."

761
00:29:54,760 --> 00:30:00,760
And then, Pat, a bird explodes in your face that was flying around Sullivan's head.

762
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,480
I am shocked that that happened.

763
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,600
You got baited.

764
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,040
You got baited by Sullivan the frog.

765
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,280
That was a pretty good move.

766
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:16,760
So you're going to take, because I believe it's 1d8.

767
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,760
Okay, cool.

768
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:19,760
No!

769
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Take one damage?

770
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,760
Yeah, Sullivan is cooked. He's dead.

771
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
Sullivan's dead?

772
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,760
Alright, at least we got that out of the way.

773
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,760
I'll say at least Sullivan's dead.

774
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,760
He said, "Hi, I'm Sullivan the Frog."

775
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
At this rate, this is going to be one map.

776
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
Yeah, I think so.

777
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,760
So, Sullivan is dead.

778
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,760
When you get burned...

779
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,760
My disguise is gone?

780
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,760
Yeah, yeah, your disguise is gone.

781
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
Oh, so you were wearing a disguise.

782
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,760
I was disguised as the adventurer's butler.

783
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:49,760
Mm-hmm.

784
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
Okay.

785
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:54,640
Okay. You missed a whole... Wait, what can you tell? You can tell Caleb now too what

786
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,640
it's called.

787
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:05,200
Um... What was it called? Oh, the thing that... The thing that waiters hold. The dome.

788
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
Oh, yes.

789
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,560
On top of the plate. It is called a cloche.

790
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,560
Well...

791
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
We wanted to ask you.

792
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,560
Thank you, enemy.

793
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,080
But we couldn't ask you.

794
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,640
You thought I would know that?

795
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,680
Uh, I don't know what... Your wife has like shit like that laying around the house.

796
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,680
You think I have a cloche in my house?

797
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
That is...

798
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Tell me that...

799
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
There is no way that that is too far off from the shit that you have in your apartment.

800
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,680
Yeah, sorry. That is not too far off, man.

801
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Whatever, man.

802
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Cool. There ain't no fucking way

803
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,680
that you're acting like that's not a thing.

804
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
Here's a little news for the fans of Things in My House.

805
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Today we got rid of the...

806
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
We finally got rid of the bust of

807
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
Michelangelo's David that we had.

808
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
You never had that.

809
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
Yep. We sold that for $20

810
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:51,680
market. So you had that. I didn't know that. Yep. So you guys see each other now.

811
00:31:51,680 --> 00:32:00,180
Uh huh. Uh Pat, you got hurt. It is now your turn Caleb. You see him now. He's

812
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:05,680
on fire next to the alchemist who had a frog that is now dead. He's like my frog.

813
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:14,380
He's very upset. But hmm. Okay, remember you guys. Take your headphones off. You

814
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,700
You do have straight up violence still.

815
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

816
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,900
What, bitch?

817
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,740
What?

818
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,540
Can I do something right now or was that?

819
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,940
Oh, you know what?

820
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,220
That's kind of a good point.

821
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,740
You got hurt, but I guess there's more stuff to do.

822
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,540
Yeah, fuck off. One second, Caleb.

823
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,140
So you got blown up by a bird.

824
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:37,340
Yeah, so I'm just gonna throw my caltrops on the ground.

825
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,180
Okay, nice.

826
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,140
Six, I'm wanting more.

827
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:40,480
Y'all seeing this video?

828
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,740
Yeah, it's pretty good.

829
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,740
What's that?

830
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:50,940
Oh, he was the... it's the... that guy made the video that's like the Eurodance song.

831
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,100
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And then everyone's mad at him because he changed the women.

832
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,620
Yeah, which I thought was actually a good idea. It's pretty funny. I think it's pretty...

833
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,860
I don't think he was trying to be funny, but I like that. So, yeah, you could throw those

834
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:08,940
rolls sleight of hand on that to see if you can kind of disperse them in a neat way.

835
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,940
16.

836
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,100
Nice, very nice.

837
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,100
OK, cool.

838
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:15,940
Not going to be the easiest thing for him to pick up in the world.

839
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:20,140
So yeah, that's kind of your turn at this point then.

840
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
OK.

841
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,340
You've got three of those, you know.

842
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:24,180
So take those off.

843
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,940
Take off those cans.

844
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,860
And Caleb, you'll put your cans on.

845
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
I'm coming back.

846
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,860
Hold on.

847
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,860
He's coming back.

848
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,860
Hold on.

849
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
All right.

850
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,180
Had to put down my kombucha.

851
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,180
Yeah.

852
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:40,940
I watched him like get kind of like burned up and then he kind of flailed around a bit.

853
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:41,940
That's about it.

854
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:45,940
Okay, well, he rolled a sleight of hand and he got a 16.

855
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:50,660
I guess I'm making a whisper roll for those but it's actually almost more fun that you

856
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,340
guys can see but you don't know what it's for.

857
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,100
Yeah, it's kind of a nice clue.

858
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
Okay, Pat.

859
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,220
Oh, Pat doesn't have his headphones on.

860
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,220
Okay.

861
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
I think...

862
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,220
Hmm.

863
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,220
Hmm.

864
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:08,180
Can I throw my magnet at him

865
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:11,260
to see if I could take off any metal that is on his body?

866
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:15,380
Yeah, of course you can.

867
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,700
OK, I'm going to do that.

868
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,660
OK, that's pretty funny.

869
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,500
So you roll a ranged...

870
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,140
Generally at his face, I guess.

871
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,620
Yeah, roll a ranged attack with the magnet then.

872
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,300
So just D20 plus your dex.

873
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,440
Okay, I'm going to roll a D20.

874
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,100
Yeah, we're not going to add your...

875
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,640
10 and my dexterity is 5, so 15.

876
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,840
Add your proficiency,

877
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,580
because you're going to probably be proficient at throwing stuff.

878
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,980
So nice.

879
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:46,120
Oh, sorry, my bonus is 3.

880
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:46,920
My bonus is 3.

881
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,720
Okay, so it's 5 total, still 15.

882
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,060
And then I think, what's his AC?

883
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:53,560
I think you're both, your ACs are the same.

884
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,600
They're pretty, like 13, I think.

885
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,360
Yeah, I see.

886
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:56,860
13.

887
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,160
Oh, yeah, because it's just dex.

888
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,260
OK, cool.

889
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,960
All right.

890
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,660
So roll 1d6 now for damage, because you definitely just hurt him.

891
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,560
Oh, yeah.

892
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,760
Oh, yeah.

893
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
3.

894
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,260
All right, cool.

895
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,260
All right.

896
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,660
You see the magnet hit him in the face.

897
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,160
Kerplunk.

898
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,960
Yes.

899
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,460
And you notice it kind of react to pulling something,

900
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,360
but you don't know what yet.

901
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,460
Well, but it's super strong.

902
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,020
It should be attached to this thing by now.

903
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,260
It pulled something up and attached to it.

904
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:36,680
Okay, but I can't see what it was.

905
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:40,780
You can kind of tell, but it's like little glints of metal, little spiky glints of metal.

906
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,780
I can prompt you to see that.

907
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,340
Okay, I still have my movement, yeah?

908
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,620
Yeah, you do.

909
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,820
Can I move closer to try to get some idea of what it is?

910
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,820
Yeah, for sure.

911
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,700
I'm showing you some of the movement options you have there.

912
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,700
Hold on.

913
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,700
Go for it.

914
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,700
Okay, I'm gonna walk over.

915
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,700
Mm-hmm. Cut through the market.

916
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,700
I'm about five feet away from him.

917
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Alright. Maybe.

918
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
And, can I see it now?

919
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Uh, you sure can, but you also...

920
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,700
SHIT!

921
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,700
Pat, put your headphones on.

922
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,700
Caleb, keep yours on.

923
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,700
What happened?

924
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,700
Here's what happened. Caleb, um,

925
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
you were just sort of, uh, you dropped your caltrips

926
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,140
caltrops on the ground.

927
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,340
Caleb threw a giant magnet at your head.

928
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:32,700
And you took three damage from that giant magnet hitting you in the skull and your caltrops

929
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:39,660
you had remaining on your person got taken up by the magnet, which is now, I guess, just

930
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,380
lying on the ground next to you.

931
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,740
Caleb went over to get a closer look at what happened, though, and he stepped on the caltrops

932
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,740
you already put down.

933
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:48,380
Well, well, hold the phone there, Patches.

934
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,380
No.

935
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:56,740
as the magnet is thrown, these caltrops are not made out of metal? They wouldn't be attracted

936
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:02,180
to the magnet mid-air? No. Oh, it seems I've stuck you with something sticky, my friend.

937
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,820
I don't think so. You're sticky now.

938
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,820
I'm sticky. You made him sticky.

939
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,740
I think, I think... You made him a sticky.

940
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,540
I was clearing a path. I was clearing a path of all metal.

941
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:17,300
I think... Well, how did you know there was metal?

942
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,500
I did. I was guessing.

943
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,060
Did you did you put your headphones?

944
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,940
No, no, no.

945
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,460
To your feet so that you could hear.

946
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,300
No, I literally threw a magnet.

947
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,980
He is he has been doing stuff with the magnet for the last few turds.

948
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,940
He did not. OK.

949
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,820
He's been trying to figure out what's metal here.

950
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:37,100
I get what you're saying. I'm open.

951
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,980
That is I am fully being logical and you are aiding and abetting a spy.

952
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:45,020
I am. I'm eating and betting a soy is what I'm doing.

953
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:48,240
So yeah, all right.

954
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,940
That's fair.

955
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:49,740
I guess you're kind of right.

956
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,140
It's a super magnet we establish.

957
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,780
I can just pull shit.

958
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,840
So instead of this is not going to be fun.

959
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,780
So instead, Pat, you're going to take six damage

960
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,820
because that magnet is going to fly in the air, pick up the caltrop

961
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,580
and then whack you in the face with them.

962
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,320
The caltrop to put down.

963
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,580
Yes, dude.

964
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,520
Damn it.

965
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,420
So you're now at six HP.

966
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:11,260
Caleb rolled up on you, though.

967
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,660
Uh huh.

968
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,960
So, yeah.

969
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,000
Remember, you are still able to.

970
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,040
It is now your turn, Pat.

971
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,540
Well, unless you're going to do something sneaky,

972
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:26,040
you both can have your headphones on at this point.

973
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,880
You're like right next to each other.

974
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:31,340
Anything that he's going to do, you know, you're going to do whatever.

975
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,180
You all can see each other.

976
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:37,060
Well, I have I have shit items, you know. Mm hmm.

977
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,400
Then you should probably just skip your turn.

978
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,660
No, I mean, it's not like I can throw these fucking birds out.

979
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:57,660
Oh, so he has birds. I have birds. You can throw the birds out. I guess I can. I'm gonna throw the birds at him. Yeah, throw the birds at him. You're gonna put two of them in one hand. You silly fucking idiot.

980
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:07,660
You're gonna spend them both. How do I roll that? Just roll a ranged attack. I'm gonna throw one. Roll a ranged attack. So just d20. 16. Nice. Oh, that hit him for sure. Deets my AC. Yeah. Yep.

981
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:11,660
Yep, and you're gonna take 1d8 fire damage, so roll 1d8, Pat.

982
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,660
Is this the same bird I have?

983
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:18,660
/r and then 1d8, yes it is. Same bird.

984
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,660
Four.

985
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Nice. You take four damage, Caleb.

986
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:22,660
Not a problem.

987
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,660
Cool. Yeah. It is now...

988
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,660
My turn?

989
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,660
Yeah, it is now your turn.

990
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:29,660
So you said I have normal, just...

991
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,660
Melee attacks, yeah?

992
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:35,660
Yeah, there are some fun spy antics up top, but it is now just gonna devolve, I think, pretty quickly.

993
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,660
Yep, I'm just gonna melee him.

994
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:39,660
Yeah, alright.

995
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,660
Run over and just start beating the shit out of him. Alright, go for it.

996
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,660
Well, actually, you know what I'd like to do?

997
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,660
Maybe? What? What?

998
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Where is the magnet?

999
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,660
The magnet is

1000
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,660
at this point, it's on the ground next to him.

1001
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
You can see it's sort of like

1002
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,660
stuttering as it's like trying to pick

1003
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,660
up stuff from the ground. I'd like to go pick up the magnet

1004
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,660
and then push, like, kind of

1005
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
the end of the metal part

1006
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,660
at the end of the two sides

1007
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:11,540
of the magnet, I'm going to like kind of hit him with that so that it explodes the mines.

1008
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,780
What mines?

1009
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,780
The things that are stuck that came off of his body.

1010
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Oh, they're caltrops.

1011
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,780
They're just like spikes.

1012
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,780
Whatever that is.

1013
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:18,780
Oh, okay.

1014
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:19,780
They're just spikes, yeah.

1015
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,780
I'd like to hit him with the spikes on the end of the mat.

1016
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,780
I've kind of created a mace.

1017
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,780
Okay, yeah, for sure.

1018
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:28,700
All right, roll a d20 and add your strength.

1019
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,100
Not your proficiency.

1020
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,460
Christ.

1021
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,460
You got a one.

1022
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:33,460
Oh.

1023
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,540
Oh, that's real bad.

1024
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:39,380
So you swing this around and of course,

1025
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,980
you swing around too far.

1026
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,500
Oh, bro.

1027
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,980
The magnet is now pulling you up.

1028
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:49,900
Up, up.

1029
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,740
Pulling him up?

1030
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,560
Pulling me up?

1031
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,020
What are you even talking about?

1032
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:54,620
It's 'cause you're swinging around

1033
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:57,020
and it's sort of like a shot put where you over,

1034
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,760
not a shot put, you know, whatever the fuck.

1035
00:40:58,760 --> 00:40:59,860
You're swinging the thing around.

1036
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:02,500
Okay, so shot put makes sense.

1037
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,840
Tell me how much damn damage I take.

1038
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,700
You swing up, you hit the

1039
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,940
and you end up back at the.

1040
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,920
Oh no, you don't go up.

1041
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,240
Oh, actually, I know where you go.

1042
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,480
You swing it around and you lose a little bit of control

1043
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,160
and you knock into this orc over here.

1044
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,600
With your magnet attaching to his armor,

1045
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,700
you take first of all, you're going to take some damage,

1046
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,460
but not too much.

1047
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:30,060
Really bad.

1048
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,960
Should have just punched you, man.

1049
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,860
Yeah, you're trying to do something cool, though.

1050
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,060
Wow. You take six damage, actually.

1051
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,100
Oh, what?

1052
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,900
Yeah, I'm at three HP, bro.

1053
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,500
And this orc looks at you and grunts.

1054
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,260
And let me see, I don't remember.

1055
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,500
One of you speaks orc and one of you speaks goblin.

1056
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:56,400
But I don't remember which.

1057
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,960
I made sure you guys had little other languages you could speak.

1058
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:05,960
Let's see, who speaks?

1059
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,960
God, dwarf, not you.

1060
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
Oh, wait, no, yeah, you speak Gaba, not Orc.

1061
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
So you just hear this Orc go like,

1062
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
(mimics Orc)

1063
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,960
and take out his sword.

1064
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:22,960
It is hard to be black in this world.

1065
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
(laughter)

1066
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
To be the black spy, it is hard.

1067
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
And it is now your turn.

1068
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,000
rolling better than you have. And I wonder if Patches did that on purpose.

1069
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,120
He did. You have white advantage, they call it.

1070
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,000
I think that's exactly what it is. Yeah.

1071
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,480
I think that I have white advantage and I think that maybe we should team up against Patches.

1072
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,600
I agree. He's the whitest one, including the white spy, he's the whitest one.

1073
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:52,000
That's not, well, yeah, that's a little true.

1074
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,720
I think it's time to meet your maker, Patches.

1075
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,440
What are you going to do?

1076
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,560
Yep, meet your maker, a white spy and a black spy.

1077
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
Made you.

1078
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,560
Yeah.

1079
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,560
You're a gray spy.

1080
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:02,560
Can we see each other now?

1081
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,560
Can I keep my headphones on?

1082
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:04,560
Yeah, of course.

1083
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,560
All right.

1084
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,560
Naturally.

1085
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:14,920
So, yeah, your turn, Pat, unless you're going to, I guess, attack me.

1086
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:21,440
I can make myself a guy in the next one, yeah.

1087
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,080
What should I do?

1088
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:29,360
You just heard him bang into somebody who now drew their sword.

1089
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,360
So...

1090
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,360
Oh, okay.

1091
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,520
Then I'm gonna sneak away.

1092
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,280
Oh, he's a bitch.

1093
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,280
But he's smart.

1094
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,840
No, I'm going here.

1095
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:40,360
I'm going back on top of this building.

1096
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:44,040
Oh, you're gonna go up the stairs here and over on this little porch?

1097
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,040
Yeah.

1098
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,400
Do you not realize I have three health?

1099
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:49,840
Yeah, but I'm gonna do something cool.

1100
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Okay, cool.

1101
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,400
What are you gonna do?

1102
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,600
So I'm going up to the building, right?

1103
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,400
I'm on this porch that's overlooking the fight.

1104
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,400
And I'm just going to drop the bird.

1105
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Oh!

1106
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
All right.

1107
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,560
Yeah, you don't even have to roll for that.

1108
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:09,400
You just drop the bird and roll 1d8.

1109
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,400
Fuck, man!

1110
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,400
That's it.

1111
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,400
That's it.

1112
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
Yeah!

1113
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,400
The orc turns to face you.

1114
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,400
He grumbles.

1115
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:24,840
said was was I'm going to eat you little man and then a bird comes out of the sky.

1116
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:29,240
You hear the Looney Tunes whistle drop the explosion and of comic.

1117
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,240
Oh yeah.

1118
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,240
OK, does the work at least also die?

1119
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Yes, yes, of course.

1120
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,240
OK, alright, so one point soy.

1121
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,240
Zero points, Caleb.

1122
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,240
Nice, let's go nice.

1123
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,240
All right.

1124
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,240
This was, by the way, this map was Duluth back during Hamward Mound.

1125
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
Oh, yeah.

1126
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
I remember that.

1127
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:03,240
So, yeah, you guys stumble upon an interesting scene here.

1128
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,240
Make your HP back to full, too.

1129
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Back to 13.

1130
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,240
We're going to have you both roll initiative again.

1131
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,640
OK, 8/11.

1132
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,540
Hmm.

1133
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,340
Hmm.

1134
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:23,780
All right, Caleb, Caleb, you're going to go first.

1135
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,060
You're way uptown by the park.

1136
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:29,720
You don't know where the other spy is.

1137
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:33,720
So headphones, I'm going to get my items, headphones off, Pat.

1138
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,560
And then, yeah, we'll give Pat your his items and your you your items.

1139
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,260
So roll your three d 20s, 22 and 13.

1140
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,040
Oh.

1141
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,800
So when he's got to be good to and he's going to be a good item,

1142
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,360
I can feel it.

1143
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,840
All right.

1144
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:52,640
So you should know what, um, two is at this point.

1145
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:57,220
Um, Tuesday canary figurine.

1146
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,980
Oh yeah.

1147
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,080
Nice.

1148
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:04,620
Okay.

1149
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:06,960
So you got the one canary.

1150
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,100
You already have the description for that.

1151
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:08,520
Okay.

1152
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:08,900
Yeah.

1153
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,720
And 13 and then 20.

1154
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,420
Okay.

1155
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:15,620
It kind of sucks though, because he's going to...

1156
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,460
If he sees a bird, he's just going to know what's going on.

1157
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:22,820
I guess he already did, because he had it last time too.

1158
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,820
I don't want...

1159
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:33,460
Alright, sorry, I had to re-write a description.

1160
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,460
I thought I wrote that, but I didn't write it yet.

1161
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,120
Here you go. It's not a very good one, but I'll explain.

1162
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:40,720
Okay, so I have Canary Figurine.

1163
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,920
Caring figurine, you have this.

1164
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,040
This is magic paint, which makes a tunnel where there isn't one with magic paint.

1165
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:49,680
That's pretty good.

1166
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,600
And then here's the thing with 20, because I had more than 20 items, I have an

1167
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:58,240
awkward number you get to pick between a few of them.

1168
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,080
Okay.

1169
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,040
So on me.

1170
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,880
Okay.

1171
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,520
You can pick wild tiger.

1172
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,400
Which releases a wild tiger.

1173
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,040
Uh, that won't necessarily do what you want it to do, but it's just out in the

1174
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,400
A fly, a fly that buzzes around a target who, failing a wisdom saving throw, can't help

1175
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:19,960
but follow it for up to 15 feet wherever you want it to go.

1176
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,520
A hypnotic timepiece.

1177
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,640
So a pocket watch, he's following religion, Pat, stop.

1178
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,040
A pocket watch that does what?

1179
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,520
Sorry, a pocket watch that emits a subtle mesmerizing pattern when activated.

1180
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:37,440
So creatures failing a wisdom saving throw becoming charm.

1181
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,840
Okay.

1182
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:43,220
And a truth serum dark gun.

1183
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,420
So this dark gun fires a truth serum.

1184
00:47:45,420 --> 00:47:46,420
I think I want the fly.

1185
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:47,420
You want the fly?

1186
00:47:47,420 --> 00:47:48,420
Yeah, I like the fly too.

1187
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,500
That seems like the item that would be most likely to work on real life Patrick.

1188
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:55,380
I think I definitely want the fly.

1189
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,380
Cool, yeah.

1190
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,500
You'll get advantage because it's real life Patrick.

1191
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Yeah.

1192
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,380
All right, cool.

1193
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,860
So there you go.

1194
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,020
All right, cool.

1195
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,380
So what do you want to do?

1196
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:12,500
How far can I throw the fly from?

1197
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,540
It doesn't have a range?

1198
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:16,980
You kind of like let, you kind of release it.

1199
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,380
Okay, but it has a target.

1200
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,380
I can choose a target.

1201
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,060
Yeah, you release it and choose a target when you see the target.

1202
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:24,060
Not yet.

1203
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,060
Are you pointing at me?

1204
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,420
No, no, thumbs down to that.

1205
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,140
But I can only use one item here, yeah?

1206
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:32,100
Yeah, you can only use one item right now.

1207
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,020
Unless it's a wearable one.

1208
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:35,020
Hmm.

1209
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:38,120
Hmm. I should have been giving you advantage on stealth checks,

1210
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:40,120
but I guess you weren't making any.

1211
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:43,380
Okay.

1212
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,380
Um...

1213
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:49,580
Okay, I think I want to walk over to this...

1214
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:55,320
to... let's see. One, two, three, four, five, six.

1215
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,320
I'm going to walk over like here.

1216
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,980
And then I think I want to put the magic tunnel

1217
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,120
Like right around just like kind of where I am, like maybe up against that tree.

1218
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:11,880
Cool. OK, so if he sees that, we can approach that later. Yeah.

1219
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:15,240
That's going to be similar to the fly, how that works, you know? OK.

1220
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:21,160
OK, cool. Headphones off, Pat headphones on.

1221
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:24,920
What did he do?

1222
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,080
I can't tell you, you know that, man.

1223
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,800
Did you roll three? No, you just wrote a religion check a bunch of times.

1224
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,500
Can you roll 3d 20s?

1225
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,200
Well,

1226
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,800
I guess.

1227
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:41,500
311 17.

1228
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:47,300
So 17.

1229
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,600
Did he also get a 17?

1230
00:49:49,600 --> 00:49:50,800
He did last time.

1231
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,400
So he'll know what that is.

1232
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:53,000
Maybe.

1233
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,100
That's the magnet.

1234
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:55,100
It's the magnet.

1235
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,000
It sure is.

1236
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,700
This is the only one that I didn't have.

1237
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Yep.

1238
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,380
So it's the only one you didn't have.

1239
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:03,020
So you're going to have the magnet,

1240
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:06,540
which here's the description for the magnet.

1241
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:09,320
You're going to have, what is that?

1242
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,940
Three, okay.

1243
00:50:11,940 --> 00:50:13,900
- Three, 11, 17.

1244
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,060
- This is a fun one.

1245
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,900
Me like it.

1246
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:20,260
It's a doppelganger mask.

1247
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,180
- Okay.

1248
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:24,020
- So which will create a duplicate of the wearer.

1249
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,180
- So basically the same thing I did last round.

1250
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:28,220
- Well, no, this is a doppelganger.

1251
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:31,420
So it creates a duplicate of yourself, not a disguise.

1252
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,900
Oh, okay. Yes.

1253
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:38,800
And then 11 is,

1254
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,180
oh, this one's fun.

1255
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,280
What fun for you?

1256
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,700
So I put the doppelganger mask on a different person.

1257
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:53,740
Sorry, no.

1258
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:56,260
So I can put it on somebody else

1259
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,080
and then they will be me?

1260
00:50:58,080 --> 00:51:01,040
No, no, no. You can put it on. Sorry, the other thing you got...

1261
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,480
And then I become somebody else.

1262
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,880
No, you... Hold on. Let me just grab that.

1263
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,800
When I put it on, I become a doppelganger of somebody else. Is that...

1264
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:11,120
No, no, no.

1265
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:11,760
That's what it says?

1266
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,680
When you put it on, it creates an illusory duplicate of you.

1267
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:18,960
Okay.

1268
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,520
So it just makes another one of you.

1269
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,280
Then why is it a mask?

1270
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,960
I don't know why it's a mask, man.

1271
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,800
That makes no sense.

1272
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:27,200
I don't know.

1273
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:29,280
I was gonna do some cool shit where I like...

1274
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:29,840
I generated it.

1275
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,920
Put the mask over somebody else and then make him kill like an innocent civilian and then

1276
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,040
get him caught by the police.

1277
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,440
Well, you could... What if you did put a mask... What if we changed it?

1278
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,880
Yeah, what if we...

1279
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,160
Who gives a shit?

1280
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,520
Can we do it so I could do that?

1281
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,120
Yeah. What if you did say you put a mask on somebody else and then they are a doppelganger

1282
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:47,520
of you?

1283
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,560
Yeah.

1284
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:50,400
That's way more interesting.

1285
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:56,480
But then it also adds the charisma checks that I gotta do.

1286
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:04,680
Yeah. Yeah. You got to convince a guy to wear the mask. I like that. Yeah. That's way more fun than this bullshit that I got pulled from.

1287
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:06,960
Oh, time delayed explosive pen is sick.

1288
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,440
Oh, yeah. You got that too.

1289
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:10,320
Uh huh. So.

1290
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,400
All right. OK, so what is this person on the corner?

1291
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,560
We know you're waiting.

1292
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,600
That that's Paula.

1293
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:18,920
Guys, notice how my turns are so fast.

1294
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,000
No, that's not Paula.

1295
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,200
Like 10 minutes each.

1296
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:24,200
So is there anybody?

1297
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:30,000
Is there anybody around who has like a clipboard like they wanted me to sign up for something?

1298
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:37,360
Uh, actually, yeah, it's except she's this woman here and she's being on the corner by two gang

1299
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:45,040
members. OK, I'm going to go over and stop that, I guess. Yeah. OK. Yeah. We're the gang members.

1300
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,040
Hey, knock it off. Who said that?

1301
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,240
I'm over here now.

1302
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,240
Now I'm over here.

1303
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,240
Wait, where are you going?

1304
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:58,240
I'm throwing my voice.

1305
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,240
Okay, roll performance.

1306
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:04,240
Eight.

1307
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:06,240
He's talking really like a small guy.

1308
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,240
Just right by them.

1309
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,240
And they're like,

1310
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,240
and then they come over and now they're mad at you.

1311
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,240
Now they want to fight you.

1312
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,240
Okay.

1313
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,240
I'm going to say

1314
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,040
Don't.

1315
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,740
It's gay role persuasion.

1316
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:24,740
We're gonna be your ass.

1317
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,340
Got a good 20.

1318
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,340
Never mind.

1319
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,140
We're gonna go bathroom.

1320
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:33,440
They go away and she says thank you for saving me.

1321
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,640
You're laughing.

1322
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,340
Thank you for saving me.

1323
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,640
Like it's at my expense.

1324
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,140
What can I do for you?

1325
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:42,340
Take this pen.

1326
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:47,540
Oh, and if you see if you see a black spy, make him sign the

1327
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,040
paper.

1328
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:50,840
Oh, I would love to. Would you like to sign it?

1329
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,560
This is how I talk.

1330
00:53:51,560 --> 00:53:56,840
I'll sign that if you take this pen and make the black spy sign it.

1331
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:59,400
Okay, I will. Thank you, Mr. White Spy.

1332
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,480
You're welcome.

1333
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:05,720
Okay, cool. And so you take your headphones off. She's going to start walking in that direction.

1334
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,880
All right.

1335
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:14,120
All right.

1336
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,000
You didn't thumbs up me.

1337
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,600
Sorry, that was my bad.

1338
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,740
Bitch.

1339
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,500
Yeah, that's true, but it's your turn also.

1340
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:24,260
You're not going to make me roll anything?

1341
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:25,260
Oh, no.

1342
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:28,260
Don't make the, oh, no.

1343
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,660
I know that he did.

1344
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:33,660
I see he got a 20 on persuasion.

1345
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:38,460
It's not a bad idea because, yeah, you know, we kind of did this last time.

1346
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,180
Roll perception.

1347
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:46,420
I think that's fair to do when shit like this happens because it is a little bit weird.

1348
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,420
19.

1349
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,420
Uh, ooh, that's pretty good.

1350
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,420
Mmm, yep.

1351
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,420
That's so funny now.

1352
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:55,420
Tell you what, I'll let you know when you get closer to it,

1353
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:59,420
but you're gonna know, you're aware that

1354
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:04,420
that somebody wants you to sign something.

1355
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:05,420
Okay.

1356
00:55:05,420 --> 00:55:06,420
Mm-hmm.

1357
00:55:06,420 --> 00:55:07,420
Alright, I can work with that.

1358
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,420
Let me take a look at my items again.

1359
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,420
Man, I kinda, pfft, fuck.

1360
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:16,420
Um, this is not how you're supposed to do perception checks.

1361
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,820
I'm really just fucking around here.

1362
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,100
Sorry, I'm not talking into the mic, into the mic.

1363
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:21,940
I'm talking into the mic.

1364
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,940
Can I, I'd like to walk over to the front of the Monotoli

1365
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:31,060
and talk to this guy right here.

1366
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:32,140
Which guy?

1367
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,260
There's a few guys in there.

1368
00:55:33,260 --> 00:55:34,380
I don't know how to ping things.

1369
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:35,220
How do I ping stuff?

1370
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,240
Just hold, click and hold.

1371
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,420
This guy.

1372
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:41,540
Nice, that's a security guard.

1373
00:55:41,540 --> 00:55:44,500
I mean, a cop, as you can see,

1374
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:46,620
there's this one woman and she pushed this other woman

1375
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:47,980
in front of the van.

1376
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,340
And she's saying, "So what if I did it?"

1377
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,740
And then there's this cop, you're going,

1378
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,140
"Yeah, she's crazy."

1379
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:56,060
Then there's this cop over here you're gonna go talk to.

1380
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:56,880
Okay.

1381
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,260
I think, I don't know what you're gonna do.

1382
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,780
Yeah, I'd like to talk to him.

1383
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:02,820
Well, hey, what happened here with this lady?

1384
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:07,820
Yeah, one lady pushed another lady out in front of a van.

1385
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,280
Classic cat fight.

1386
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,660
And you're a cop, yeah?

1387
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,660
Yeah, I'm sort of just looking around making sure everything's okay.

1388
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:18,660
Okay, and did somebody call you here because of this?

1389
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:22,160
No, I was just standing there with my friend over, you see the other guy?

1390
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,660
And he points to the guy over there.

1391
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:26,660
Yeah, we were just hanging out and so I saw this happen, I came over.

1392
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:27,660
You saw it happen.

1393
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:33,660
Well, have you heard about this thing where eyewitness testimony is the least reliable

1394
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:37,660
form of evidence that is permissible in court? You know this?

1395
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,660
No, I don't, despite all my years.

1396
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:46,660
It's true, man. Your eyes play tricks on you because let me tell you what I saw. Okay?

1397
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:47,660
Okay.

1398
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:53,580
I saw this guy, white guy, go figure, thinks he runs the world, right? And he was dressed

1399
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,580
in all white.

1400
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:55,580
I agree.

1401
00:56:55,580 --> 00:57:01,420
And get this, man. Yep. And get this, a cop would agree, you're good people. Get this.

1402
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:07,860
He, I mean, what's more sinister than walking around with a lit stick of dynamite, right?

1403
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,580
Nothing more sinister than that, right?

1404
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,580
I didn't even think about it that way.

1405
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,580
Yeah, and by the way,

1406
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,580
this bomb that I have, this is a prop.

1407
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,580
Just so you know. Halloween's coming.

1408
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,580
Yeah, pretty funny, right?

1409
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,580
Pretty funny. Imagine if it really had a bomb, right?

1410
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,580
Oh no!

1411
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,580
Anyway, what I

1412
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,580
saw is that all white fella

1413
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,580
was the one who pushed

1414
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,580
the lady in front of the car

1415
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,580
and as far as I'm concerned, this

1416
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,580
psycho menace needs to be taken off the streets as soon

1417
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,580
as possible. Alright, real persuasion.

1418
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,100
That was very good.

1419
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:43,420
So I pretty much get advantage, yeah?

1420
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:45,420
You're gonna have a much lower DC.

1421
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,980
Oh, please, please.

1422
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:48,980
Ten.

1423
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,980
Okay.

1424
00:57:49,980 --> 00:57:51,140
Okay, okay.

1425
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:56,940
He says, "I don't know, but how do I know if it's your witness, though?

1426
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:57,940
You got eyes.

1427
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:01,140
You're doing your eye witness, too, right?"

1428
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:03,140
Is he frozen?

1429
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:05,300
So what's the truth?

1430
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:11,740
Well, you know what? I'll take a test right now. An intelligence quotient test. Right

1431
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:17,920
now. I would guarantee I'm smarter than you. Go ahead, make me roll intelligence.

1432
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:24,160
Let's do it! And he's gonna roll intelligence against you. You guys are gonna lock eyes.

1433
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,580
And do an intelligence test. 20.

1434
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:30,100
Okay, that's gonna be a -10 for him.

1435
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,100
Nice.

1436
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,080
Perps minus 110, I mean, all right.

1437
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:35,100
That's my bad, yeah.

1438
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:36,080
He lost.

1439
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:40,380
He probably would have, no matter what he would have done,

1440
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:41,900
he probably would have won.

1441
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,340
He goes, "All right, you seem real smart.

1442
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:46,820
"I'll go talk to that white guy."

1443
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,140
You got the perp, go get him!

1444
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,700
All right, so he starts to walk over there.

1445
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,440
And take on--

1446
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,280
And I still haven't used an item, right?

1447
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,220
You haven't, what do you wanna do, yeah?

1448
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,020
I think...

1449
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,740
Huh? I can see Patrick now, right?

1450
00:59:03,740 --> 00:59:04,640
Oh yeah.

1451
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,140
OK, you know what I want to do as the cop is sneaking away

1452
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,440
or walking away?

1453
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:14,740
Can I place the canary figurine in his belt like on his

1454
00:59:14,740 --> 00:59:15,540
utility belt?

1455
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,740
Roll sleight of hand.

1456
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,540
OK.

1457
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:20,740
Fuck!

1458
00:59:20,740 --> 00:59:24,640
That's good.

1459
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,740
Come on, man.

1460
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,140
Are you fucking kidding me?

1461
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,240
That's really bad.

1462
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,240
That's good to hear.

1463
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,640
You put it on your own belt, obviously.

1464
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:40,840
And you like kind of do the, you slap your hands like good work is done.

1465
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,320
Oh, this is so cartoonishly accurate.

1466
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:44,880
Oh my God.

1467
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,480
And how much damage do I take?

1468
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:48,080
You only take one D8.

1469
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,000
All right.

1470
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,160
God, seven?

1471
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:52,840
Yeah.

1472
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:53,840
It's not great.

1473
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,680
Yeah. So you're taking...

1474
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,000
Six HP, bro.

1475
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,040
Oh my God.

1476
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:59,160
All right.

1477
00:59:59,160 --> 01:00:00,000
- Yeah, whatever.

1478
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,000
- That's fine.

1479
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,460
All right.

1480
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,780
You know, honestly, good turn up until then.

1481
01:00:04,780 --> 01:00:05,620
So let's--

1482
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:08,320
- God, I just always do one thing too much, man.

1483
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:11,380
- Yeah, no, it's, you know, yes.

1484
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:14,360
All right, take off your headphones.

1485
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,260
Pat, you're up.

1486
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:19,180
- What happened?

1487
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:22,320
- You saw him walk up to a cock.

1488
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,600
I almost said cock.

1489
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:26,520
I almost said cock, yeah.

1490
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:31,640
You know, I'll come to a cop, start talking to him, and then the cop started to walk in

1491
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,560
your direction.

1492
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:39,560
And then you saw his pants go on fire.

1493
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,560
Like he was a liar.

1494
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:42,920
Uh-huh.

1495
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,720
Yeah.

1496
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:46,680
So I see him right now.

1497
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,120
Yeah.

1498
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,320
Okay.

1499
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:53,560
What should I do?

1500
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:55,240
So does he see me?

1501
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,240
We actually see some.

1502
01:00:56,240 --> 01:00:57,640
Oh, he sees you for sure.

1503
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,320
Let me see something here.

1504
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:01,100
And his pants are on fire.

1505
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:01,940
Okay, yeah.

1506
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:03,700
So actually, and this cop comes up to you,

1507
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:04,540
'cause that makes sense.

1508
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,940
And we'll resolve hers as well in a second.

1509
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:09,880
So I'll put her here.

1510
01:01:09,880 --> 01:01:11,480
This cop comes up to you and he says,

1511
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:14,080
"Hey, I gotta talk to you.

1512
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,800
This guy over there says that you pushed that lady

1513
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,040
in front of that van.

1514
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,780
And he says...

1515
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:26,780
That you're a pedophile.

1516
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,780
He didn't say that.

1517
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:30,780
Sir, his pants are clearly on fire.

1518
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,780
Wouldn't a liar have pants on fire?

1519
01:01:33,780 --> 01:01:35,780
Let me take a look.

1520
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:37,780
Doesn't that make sense?

1521
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:38,780
He's a liar!

1522
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,780
That does make sense.

1523
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:42,780
His pants are on fire.

1524
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:44,780
His pants are completely on fire.

1525
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,780
That's a really good point.

1526
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:48,780
I bet you don't even fuck kids either.

1527
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:49,780
Alright.

1528
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:50,780
No!

1529
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,780
I'm gonna go...

1530
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,780
Hey, do you like fashion?

1531
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:55,680
I love fashion.

1532
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,480
I'm a fashionista.

1533
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:57,580
You love fashion?

1534
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:58,580
Love it.

1535
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:01,780
I've got this new mask I've been selling.

1536
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:03,880
To people.

1537
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:08,280
To people around the town.

1538
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:10,280
That's my job.

1539
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,680
I'm a mask salesman.

1540
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,080
Yeah, play Majora's Mask.

1541
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:14,580
Okay.

1542
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,480
What do you want to do?

1543
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:16,080
Yeah.

1544
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:19,580
Well, this is the

1545
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,120
This is a mask that gets you laid every single time that you wear it.

1546
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,080
You're kidding me.

1547
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,400
Uh-huh. Do you want to put it on?

1548
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,720
More than anything in the world.

1549
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,280
All right.

1550
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:34,720
Do I have to roll persuasion or something?

1551
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:35,600
Nah, man. Nah, nah, nah.

1552
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:36,120
Okay.

1553
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:37,440
Nah, nah. He puts on the mask.

1554
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:39,280
All right, so now he's got the mask on.

1555
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:43,320
Oh, you should go talk to that guy again because,

1556
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,200
well, one, his pants are on fire.

1557
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:48,480
You don't know what else he's been lying about. And two,

1558
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:55,280
I heard that he was a he's a he had sex with a teacher. Oh,

1559
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,600
disgusting. When he was a student. Oh, that's totally his

1560
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,480
fault. But he was a grown up at the time. And she was the

1561
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:09,480
student. Oh, no. But no, she was the teacher. I don't really. He

1562
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:12,720
sounds like a pervert. I don't really know. Yeah, I think it's

1563
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,280
just that he's a pervert. Go over to him. Sure. Cool. It's a

1564
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:20,180
You walk over as he walks over as you now.

1565
01:03:20,180 --> 01:03:21,880
And then I'm just going to go.

1566
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,080
I'm going to hide over here.

1567
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,580
All right, cool.

1568
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,180
Roll stealth.

1569
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:32,480
24 nice.

1570
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,280
Okay, you're basically hidden.

1571
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:35,680
Yeah, right.

1572
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,480
Cool.

1573
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:37,680
It's now his turn.

1574
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:46,580
Caleb

1575
01:03:46,580 --> 01:03:47,580
Get up!

1576
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,580
All right, I'm back.

1577
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:56,620
All right, what?

1578
01:03:56,620 --> 01:04:04,500
You saw the cop go over and you blinked and you could have missed it, but the cop was

1579
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:10,620
gone and there was now some sort of a, it looks like the white guy, the white spy's coming

1580
01:04:10,620 --> 01:04:12,940
towards you now.

1581
01:04:12,940 --> 01:04:17,940
gone and meanwhile this lady's walking over to you and she's saying "Hi can you

1582
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:30,700
sign my clipboard for the fund for changing lives and democracy fund?"

1583
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:34,420
Yeah you know what bitch that sounds really fucking convincing yeah I'll

1584
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:38,140
definitely do that okay so I walk over she comes over with the clipboard right?

1585
01:04:38,140 --> 01:04:42,660
mm-hmm okay I'd like to grab the pen and I'm gonna stab her right in the her neck

1586
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,160
like the guy on that movie Red Eye.

1587
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:46,160
Okay.

1588
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:47,160
It's crazy.

1589
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:48,160
Yeah, I'm fucking crazy.

1590
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,160
I'm a spy.

1591
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:50,160
Okay, cool.

1592
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,160
You grab the pen, you click it to...

1593
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,160
Oh, no, no, I don't click it.

1594
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,160
Yeah, you do, you fuck.

1595
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:54,160
Of course you do, you idiot.

1596
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:55,160
Come on, man.

1597
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,160
You take eight damage, you're dead.

1598
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:57,160
I'm dead.

1599
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,160
I'm about to put on headphones.

1600
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,160
Keep your headphones on.

1601
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,160
I'm dead.

1602
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,160
I'm dead.

1603
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:02,160
I'm dead.

1604
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
I'm dead.

1605
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:04,160
I'm dead.

1606
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:05,160
I'm dead.

1607
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,160
I'm dead.

1608
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:07,160
I'm dead.

1609
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,160
I'm dead.

1610
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:09,160
I'm dead.

1611
01:05:09,160 --> 01:05:10,160
I'm dead.

1612
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:11,160
I'm dead.

1613
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,160
I'm dead.

1614
01:05:12,160 --> 01:05:17,920
on. That was great. That was awesome.

1615
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:18,920
What happened?

1616
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:22,120
He went over - so he - this lady came over and she said she wanted him to sign for the

1617
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:27,760
Fund for Democracy and my inability to come up with something made Caleb think it was

1618
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:33,520
her who was tricking him, which is my fault. And so, he goes, yeah, I'm gonna grab the

1619
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:34,520
pen and click it.

1620
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:35,520
Explosive pen.

1621
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,200
Click it - I would grab the pen and stab her in the neck.

1622
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,000
First trick of the book. Oldest trick rather.

1623
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Yeah.

1624
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:44,760
And so he goes and he grabs and clicks it and it blows up in his face and he's dead.

1625
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,640
I have once again, I have outsmarted myself.

1626
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:53,260
Yeah, I hurt myself with half of my fucking HP earlier.

1627
01:05:53,260 --> 01:05:57,100
Damn. Yeah, he lit his pants on fire with the canary.

1628
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,640
He 2-0'd me, dude.

1629
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:03,500
Yeah. And now the folks at home can say if I play favorites here

1630
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,040
and they can tell me. You clearly play favorites.

1631
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,800
I clearly play favorites.

1632
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:12,240
Whose name is most similar to mine is clearly what I did.

1633
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,400
I never knew that you liked Patrick more than you like me until...

1634
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:17,920
No, that's not true.

1635
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:22,160
No, I think that I won based completely on my cunning and my wit.

1636
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,000
I'm going to, since I wasn't able to listen to this,

1637
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,560
I'm going to listen back and I'm going to be furious

1638
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:32,320
at how simple everything that Patrick does was.

1639
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,040
I just know I'm going to be so fucking pissed off.

1640
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,400
It's going to be like 2am, you're going to text me and be like,

1641
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,000
Like what the fuck was that?

1642
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,760
Are you fucking kidding me?

1643
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:43,600
God damn it man.

1644
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:46,280
I had, dude, I had a backup

1645
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,680
if that pen thing didn't work too.

1646
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,960
I had a tunnel painted onto a tree

1647
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:53,920
that I knew you was gonna fall for.

1648
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,640
Did I walk over to the tree?

1649
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,960
No, not yet.

1650
01:06:56,960 --> 01:06:58,760
Not yet, that was his backup.

1651
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,880
He had a really cool item that he didn't get to use

1652
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:01,960
which was the fly.

1653
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:06,720
We do this again, we could do spy versus spy versus spy.

1654
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,120
That's not a bad idea.

1655
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:09,960
- Yeah, I think we could do that.

1656
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,200
And we could tweak it too

1657
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,480
to make it a little bit more interactive

1658
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:14,040
when you guys aren't listening.

1659
01:07:14,040 --> 01:07:16,760
We'll figure that out, but I really like this.

1660
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:17,600
- This was awesome.

1661
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:18,440
- Okay. - This is a good one.

1662
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,280
- This is awesome. - Well, then I--

1663
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,400
- For some reason, I really like this one.

1664
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,560
- My Spy, I didn't really like it that much.

1665
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,380
My Spy goes back to his country.

1666
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,800
And you know what, Patrick?

1667
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,200
Honestly, man, he probably gets fucking executed.

1668
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:33,000
He failed as a spy.

1669
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:36,800
- And I go to Denny's.

1670
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:40,200
get a Presidential Medal of Honor in your white country.

1671
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:42,200
Be a fucker.

1672
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:44,200
Alright, bye.

1673
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:46,200
Bye.

1674
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:50,200
*static*

1675
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:54,200
*singing*

1676
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:58,200
Shrek. That's them.

1677
01:07:58,200 --> 01:08:02,200
Yeah I know. They did a Shrek soundtrack. It's an amazingly underrated album.

1678
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,200
*singing*

1679
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:10,200
Love a little fan-mer?

1680
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:14,200
It's not any of the fucking lyrics.

1681
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:21,200
I was singing it correctly.

1682
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:22,200
It's none of the lyrics.

1683
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,200
It was all the lyrics.

1684
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,200
I didn't get a single.

1685
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:25,200
I sang all of them.

1686
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:28,200
As a current and future musician, man, you did not get any of the lyrics.

1687
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,200
I'm talking to two musicians today.

1688
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:30,200
I got a new friend.

1689
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,200
They really like me.

1690
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:32,200
They're obsessed with my vanilla ice cream.

1691
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,200
I think it's cool that you can remember the lyrics.

1692
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,200
With the chocolate sauce and that pasty.

1693
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:35,200
Because every time I've ever written a song, I don't know what I'm doing.

1694
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:36,200
I'm just like, "Oh, I'm just going to sing it."

1695
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,200
I'm like, "Oh, I'm just going to sing it."

1696
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,200
I'm like, "Oh, I'm just going to sing it."

1697
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:39,200
I'm like, "Oh, I'm just going to sing it."

1698
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,200
Chocolate sauce and a piece of tea.

1699
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:44,700
Cause every time I've ever written a song, I'd never...

1700
01:08:44,700 --> 01:08:48,700
I was playing in a band for like two years in high school.

1701
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:52,200
And we'd go on and there were different lyrics to...

1702
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,700
Music, same thing, but the words...

1703
01:08:54,700 --> 01:08:59,200
The thing is, live music, nobody's hearing a single fucking word you're singing, man.

1704
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,200
You're doing like house shows.

1705
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,200
Say watermelon, watermelon. Who cares?

1706
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,200
Yeah, no one's hearing the lyrics at a house show.

1707
01:09:04,200 --> 01:09:04,700
It doesn't matter.

1708
01:09:04,700 --> 01:09:07,200
You think they got a proper mixer there? No fucking shot.

1709
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:08,200
Fuck no.

1710
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,200
No, but it was funny because I just would hit the same melody, but I'd be like...

1711
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:14,200
*mimics the melody*

1712
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:16,200
That's why I suck at karaoke so bad.

1713
01:09:16,200 --> 01:09:21,700
I don't know what it is, I can't remember lyrics to any songs.

1714
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,200
Can you not read fast enough?

1715
01:09:23,200 --> 01:09:25,200
I think it's fine.

1716
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:29,200
Because that's my problem with karaoke when I do something like Drake or Eminem.

1717
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,200
I know the words, but I'm trying to follow them on the screen.

1718
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:32,700
Yeah.

1719
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:34,200
And then I get tripped up.

1720
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,200
You get tripped up by specific Drake songs.

1721
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:39,760
you gotta do it and stop saying certain things.

1722
01:09:39,760 --> 01:09:42,960
The timing gets screwed up when you can't say that.

1723
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:43,960
Yeah.

1724
01:09:43,960 --> 01:09:48,000
Which I honestly I think they should stop saying it so I can rap along.

1725
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,000
I'm with you.

1726
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,000
I'm with you.

1727
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:50,000
[SCREAMING]

1728
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,000
*Demonic Laughter*
