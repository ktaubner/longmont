[MUSIC PLAYING]

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:14,480
Last time on "Tribuchet Village,"

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,160
Tales from the Seabomb.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,960
Our heroes, after landing on the shore near post-Port

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,400
Los Beriberi, sprung right into action,

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,840
beating up a weird wing monster and rescuing

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,920
a young woman who was a member of the monster hunter

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,520
guild, the Nimrods, whose members are called Rodsmen.

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:33,720
After telling her that they need to get into the academy, she said she would advocate for

10
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:37,720
them to become rodsmen themselves, which would allow them to have access to the academy,

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:41,920
so they could buy mud marks and take monster hunting contracts.

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,320
All they would need to do is survive the crucible, a notoriously dangerous trial that all rodsmen

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,720
in the nimrods take before being given their nimrod badge sewn magically into the lining

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,720
of their queer ass.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,720
However...

16
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:55,720
What?

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,720
I know what that is.

18
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,720
It's a queer ass.

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
It's a breastplate.

20
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,720
it's usually for...

21
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,720
you have to be a fuckin' queer ass to know that bullshit

22
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,720
oh, a curious

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
a curious

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
no, a genius

25
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,720
it's pronounced queer ass

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,720
you're not

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,720
you're not pulling my leg

28
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,720
but you knew what you were doing putting it in that thing

29
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
he raised his eyebrows when he said queer ass

30
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,720
you knew exactly what you were doing

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,720
what about me right now

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
makes you think I know what I'm doing

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
that's a good point

34
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:47,200
Anyway, Curiosity got the better of Chuggy, who spoke with a shy and sweet cutthroat named

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,340
Sherman who led the party to Condoleezza Carlo, a strange and strangely handsome and very

36
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:58,900
evil seeming warlock, who spends his days tricking boats into crashing into each other from his

37
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:03,580
fake lighthouse tower and then sending his henchmen to pick up the scraps.

38
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,740
His many connections in the academy, including some that would allow evil Raudogan and Chuggie

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:13,180
to become adjunct professors there, and the promise of a way cooler adventure than a crucible,

40
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:18,300
had the crew ready to take on the challenge of heading to Popo Tower and scouting/rooting

41
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:24,080
out the Terrifier Quartz Intelligence Network run by Sticky Fingers so that Beriberi and

42
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,580
Condoleezza can claim whatever rewards lie beyond the fog for their own.

43
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:31,700
We'll talk about the fog a little bit more on Tuesday.

44
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,620
So now the crew heads south through Popo Lake and down south, south Popo River to the Popo

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,900
Tower.

46
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Will they-

47
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,900
Hey, hey, Popo!

48
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,900
Will they confront Sticky Fingers?

49
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,040
I wrote Sticky Fongers, so it's-

50
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Will they confront Sticky Fingers?

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,380
That's its new name.

52
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,220
- Like he fongers?

53
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,620
- Yeah, it's like he fongers.

54
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,140
- I've heard of a finger.

55
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:51,980
- Heard of a finger.

56
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,800
- Yeah?

57
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,700
- Heard of a monger, like a warmonger.

58
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,580
- A fonger?

59
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:58,400
- To see what he knows about Mama Yodar's death?

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,220
Does that matter now that Patrick is dead?

61
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,900
Will they get to see what lies beyond the fog?

62
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,900
Will they finally get to vibe mud marks,

63
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,660
their dream of all dreams?

64
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,260
Well, this is it.

65
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,780
- Oh yeah, you sound real excited about it, huh?

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,700
- I'm very excited, actually.

67
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,380
I'm extremely, extremely excited.

68
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,060
- Okay, well then bring the fun!

69
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,900
- I'm bringing, here's the fun.

70
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:21,480
Do a little almost just spilled something is it completely that was full of water

71
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:26,800
It's spill it was full of poopoo. It's spilled to check this out the whole campaigns full of magic

72
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,680
And we're almost near the end so we should be yes. It is very exciting on here, so here's what's happening, okay?

73
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,900
You guys are right now traveling south

74
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,260
Along the edge I'm in chuggy for based on Sherman you know Sherman gave you guys the the information you need to know about

75
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:46,520
Okay, travel south along the edge of the lake avoid the the you know the the fucking networks of

76
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,520
of Academy, excuse me, Academy Lake shipping lines

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,240
that take goods from Polo's Berry Berry.

78
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,460
And so you've been doing that,

79
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,540
and now you're gonna be heading south

80
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,840
on the South Popo River.

81
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,260
So you can see here, there's the lake,

82
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,500
the North Popo River going up,

83
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,300
and South Popo River to here, the Popo Tower.

84
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,440
Now, do I have it here?

85
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
No.

86
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,100
- So.

87
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:17,240
- Well, I already memorized it as soon as you showed it to me

88
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,080
'cause I have a--

89
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,880
- Actually, it's a very old map,

90
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,640
so it's probably not even important anymore.

91
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,480
- Here, take a look.

92
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,440
Here's the map you know of. - Like the story.

93
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,840
I know of this.

94
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,760
- So, this is the kingdom map,

95
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,600
like of the Terrified Kingdom, of the known world.

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,000
This is the fog that you've seen,

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,840
like that you know of that surrounds it

98
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,640
and covers the world and indicates to you where it ends,

99
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,240
typically, in this flat world, as it's known as.

100
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,080
- Sure.

101
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,920
- So you're all the way down south.

102
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,880
- Like in League of Legends.

103
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,120
- Can I predict what's gonna happen?

104
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,400
Just ruin everything right now?

105
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,000
- The fog is gonna clear up.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,900
- You absolutely can predict what you want.

107
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,600
- You guys ever seen "The Village"?

108
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,520
I think it's a "The Village" kind of situation.

109
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,280
- I think, I agree, I think it's either "The Village" or--

110
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,360
- I think it takes place in 2004,

111
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
and we're gonna get through the fog,

112
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,280
and we're gonna walk in and it'll be like,

113
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,880
"George Bush has been reelected!"

114
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,360
- Yeah, this whole thing has been about 9/11

115
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,200
the entire time.

116
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,020
- Yeah, something like that.

117
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,640
- I would never do that to you.

118
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,400
- He's scratching things,

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,600
he's trying to scratch something off his computer screen.

120
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,100
- He's breaking my computer.

121
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,240
- He's cracking his screen.

122
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,080
- So yeah.

123
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,200
- Is the village about 9/11?

124
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,040
- What's up?

125
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,860
- Is the village about 9/11?

126
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,280
- If you're a film theorist, then yes.

127
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,120
- Yeah.

128
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,440
- Wow.

129
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:28,360
- It's about America's isolationist ideals.

130
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,720
- That's pretty good, Pat.

131
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:32,560
So...

132
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,800
(laughing)

133
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,680
- Yeah, as you're going...

134
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,560
- Through the lake, the crystal deposits in the lake

135
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,840
give it sort of this like shimmery viscous kind of feeling.

136
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,800
It's like moving through like a,

137
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,320
like kind of like a runny jello.

138
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,480
- Come.

139
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,320
- No, no, no, no.

140
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,400
- What the hell's going on?

141
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,240
- Don't say that.

142
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,960
- You said that out of your mouth.

143
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,800
- I said what?

144
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,620
- My mouth was closed.

145
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,040
- Like you're wading through like a liquid metal.

146
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,360
- Hey, I'm waiting to see if it's come.

147
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,960
- For you, Chuggy, it's not come.

148
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,440
You've been in a lot of water.

149
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,280
- It's not come for him.

150
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,920
- But not water quite like this.

151
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,080
- I've never been in water quite like this.

152
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,440
And while swimming in it, you do get a +2 to any savings row.

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,480
- Whoa. - Oh.

154
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,880
I wanna swim in the water too.

155
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,240
Give my fucking white ass in the water.

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,240
Well, you guys are--

157
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,600
Use my blood platelets as refs!

158
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,240
- You guys do-- - I jumped in.

159
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,480
You guys do get--

160
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,680
You guys do get +1 because you're inside of Chuggies.

161
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,840
- Okay, jump out. - Okay.

162
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,240
Yeah.

163
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,480
- We're inside of Chuggies. - That's just while you're inside of the water.

164
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,600
Shut up.

165
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,640
Come on.

166
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,000
It reminds you a bit of Percocet, by the way.

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,360
Your favorite herb.

168
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,320
Oh, boy.

169
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,120
But it's not quite the same feeling.

170
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,520
You have your faculties, you don't have a gnawing void where more Percocet is supposed to be.

171
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,520
I know what it is.

172
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,720
It's like slipping into a better version of yourself.

173
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,520
Cover your ears, Patches.

174
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,520
It's Walkie Slush.

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,760
Oh, like, holy fuck.

176
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:55,920
You think Patches knows what Walkie Slush is?

177
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
It's Walkie Slush, guys.

178
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Is this like a...

179
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Is this like a Zoomer thing?

180
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,920
What's Walkie Slush?

181
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
- What's a walkie slide?

182
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,160
(laughter)

183
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,420
(laughter)

184
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,660
- We got it, move on.

185
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,920
(laughter)

186
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,360
- Move on.

187
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Great.

188
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,020
- So, um.

189
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,200
- We got him to ask what it was.

190
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,440
(laughter)

191
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,840
- As you, so, while the Popo River Valley

192
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,480
is not without dangers, the flood of trade

193
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,320
and Sherman's very apologetic instructions

194
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,920
guided you through to the tower with relative ease.

195
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,920
You guys would have traveled for a couple days probably.

196
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,920
Couple days?

197
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Yeah.

198
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:40,720
It's not the easiest trip.

199
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,720
It's like, you know, if you look at the map and see how long it takes you to get to places.

200
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
What helps here is having a river.

201
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
It's long.

202
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Yeah, it's long.

203
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,280
If you look at the map you'll see that.

204
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,560
But also having a river, that current will actually help speed it up a little bit.

205
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,560
So when you get to the, where the tower is supposed to be, as you approach, you see an

206
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,680
encampment set up near the tower.

207
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:07,960
At a glance it appears empty, save for two cloaked figures sitting by a small fire.

208
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:13,220
It has a stand for armaments, so it's likely some kind of military operation.

209
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,720
Maybe a sophisticated group of brigands or a mercenary company, I mean, you guys have

210
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,280
an idea of who it probably is or what the group probably is because of the insolent job?

211
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,280
So we should avoid them.

212
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,480
Potentially, yeah.

213
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,960
But, so about a hundred yards from that encampment stands the Popo Tower.

214
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:37,680
It's a massive structure, it's like stately stone, has like, I mean you'll see this more

215
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,880
when you get close to it, but it has these very elegant, strange etchings.

216
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,740
Maybe you'll just die I guess before that happens.

217
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,740
But if you do get close to it.

218
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:44,740
What?

219
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,740
What the fuck's wrong with you?

220
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,740
Wait, what?

221
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,740
We talked about I'm gonna die.

222
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,840
I just realized that I'm describing something that you can't see yet, so I was like, oh

223
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,840
I feel a little silly.

224
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:54,160
So he's putting stuff, so you're saying we're about to come up on something real rough and

225
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,440
No, there's really no reason okay, then I go like 30 feet underwater

226
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,620
Yeah

227
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:08,660
And then I just avoid all the enemies, I don't know okay, that's a good yeah, I got your bitch

228
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,780
And now we guess what now you can stop describing that shit

229
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,740
Cuz I was definitely no way we can see that 30 feet under the water

230
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,440
You hear me describing?

231
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,800
Sounds like you're under water

232
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:30,700
But it's good, so it's um, it's these has these high half oval windows a couple of significant drum towers

233
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,160
Crowding the imposing main one. There's like a sort of this big imposing like main one

234
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,400
That's like rectangular and then like a couple drum towers that are also pretty big

235
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:46,640
It's stone is like a it has these are connected by a few like Merlin battlements like, you know, like just like

236
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,560
They're basically what battlements are but like they have these like little like so kind of like sideling that goes up like

237
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:57,960
They kind of look like palisades almost, but they're not.

238
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,360
They were clearly designed to connect these towers at one

239
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,160
point, but they're kind of dilapidated, so they don't as well.

240
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,460
But yeah, so the stone is a mixture of weathered grays and

241
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,960
reds. The corbels against the tower.

242
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,560
So corbels are kind of like these etchings that help kind of

243
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,560
keep the corners of different castles usually.

244
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Usually they have like faces on them or something.

245
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,560
It'll look like it's sort of like a gargoyle.

246
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,560
Yeah, kind of like that.

247
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,560
Or like a gah-goo-ee.

248
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,560
Yeah, like a gah-goo-ee.

249
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,560
You can't really tell what, like, you wouldn't be able to tell what the visage is.

250
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,560
It's so gone from time.

251
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,560
Perhaps it's Policeman of Legend.

252
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Or something else entirely.

253
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,560
Like who? Name five Policemen of Legend.

254
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,560
The ones that are coming to mind are not ones I want to say.

255
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,560
[Laughter]

256
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,560
So I passed you the ball.

257
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,560
Yeah, that's right.

258
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,860
uh... it's a so it's said that there was a really good one of the cops a good one

259
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:56,180
of the other three of serbico

260
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,860
here's uh...

261
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,500

was that what about what it was a bit both of you know what i want to know

265
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,180

Jake Peralta is good.

270

Holy shit.

271
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,540
Uh, uh, Chase.

272
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,540
Chase.

273
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,540
Chase.

274
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,540
Chase.

275
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,540
Chase.

276
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,540
Chase.

277
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,540
Chase.

278
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,540
Chase.

279
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Chase.

280
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,540
Chase.

281
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,540
Chase.

282
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,540
Chase.

283
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
Chase.

284
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,540
Chase.

285
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Chase.

286
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,540
Chase.

287
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Chase.

288
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,540
Chase.

289
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:38,540
Chase.

290
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
Chase.

291
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,540
Chase.

292
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,540
Chase.

293
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,540
Chase.

294
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:43,540
Chase.

295
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,540
Chase.

296
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,540
Chase.

297
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:46,540
Chase.

298
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,540
the tower's considerable height as lookout.

299
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:53,620
Beriberi's long resistance to annexation can be traced back to the region's ancestors being

300
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,720
affiliated with the police.

301
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,140
Where the theory about the realms deep being west past the virtue good archipelago has credence

302
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,760
in the magical and academic community, what is south beyond the tower has no consensus.

303
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,680
Some say it is the edge of the world, just as realms deep in the archipelago are believed

304
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,540
to be the western edge, the isle of gauntlet in the gauntlet sea that extends from it to

305
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,060
to be the eastern edge, the uninhabitable icy, the northern edge.

306
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,220
But where icy has yet to be tamed, and the seas stretch so much further from the east

307
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,780
and the west landmasses that you can't even see the fog, the Popo Tower in the south is

308
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:31,220
able to overlook the very fog that perplexes so many.

309
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:36,620
Many, however, no expedition that's been to the tower has known to have survived, ever.

310
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:42,380
You guys would know this, you probably would have spoken with Han and Lisa about this.

311
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,580
Much like the expeditions into the southernmost fog,

312
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,080
but those expeditions were long ago,

313
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,820
before explorers like Virtuegood and progressive kings

314
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,620
like King Nardwar began to reignite interest

315
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,240
in the closed-minded Terrafire Kingdom.

316
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,020
Members of the Academy, like Condoleezza Carlo,

317
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,500
believe there's something more in the fog.

318
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,460
Just wanted to sort of give you guys

319
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,420
a little bit of a refresher.

320
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,100
- I think there's something more in the fog.

321
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:03,940
- Yeah, I don't.

322
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,620
- I'm thinking Federal Reserve.

323
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:09,620
- You guys are right now a little bit out of the encampment.

324
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:11,580
I would say that you can comfortably, Chuggie,

325
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:16,900
You can comfortably say that they can't, in the encampment, those folks can't see you.

326
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,940
They don't quite have a visual on you.

327
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:24,080
So you can try to bypass them and go towards the tower and get a better, closer look at

328
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,780
what's going on there.

329
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:30,060
Yeah, it's really up to you guys at this point.

330
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:34,060
Yeah, I guess we should go closer to the tower, right?

331
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,060
Yeah.

332
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
Let's go up to the top of the tower.

333
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,180
I'd like to go to the top of the tower.

334
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:45,180
and

335
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:49,020
I'm already a boat swim it up. So so you can make a giant wave, right?

336
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:53,900
Yeah, well, so why don't we use your why don't we use your wave thing?

337
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,660
My character also has the ability on my sheet to walk upstairs. Well, no

338
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,700
Wave won't be tall enough

339
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,060
But the wave will be tall enough for us to do a surprise

340
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:13,440
Tidal wave attack and wipe out every single person who's on watch right? It won't wipe out every single person who's on watch

341
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,320
Here's the only thing is every single person in the world every

342
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,560
Be a Noah's Ark style way, so you could do that here, so here's what I can here's what I can tell you

343
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,920
Actually, you know what chuggy. Why don't you roll a perception check right now?

344
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:31,200
How'd you do

345
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:34,660
Yeah 12, that's not bad, so here's what I can tell you

346
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:42,320
The tower is only 100 yards out you have a pretty clear sense that there are other members of whoever this crew is

347
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,720
is, like stationed by the tower. If you did the tidal wave, it would...

348
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,440
Yeah, couldn't it get us there faster without...

349
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,040
You could reach the encampment, but you couldn't reach the tower, because that's like 100 yards

350
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
out.

351
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Okay.

352
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
It's 100 yards inland.

353
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,040
Yes, thank you. Sorry. Yes.

354
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,080
Okay. I thought that it was like an aisle.

355
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,000
No, not quite. Yeah.

356
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,400
There was an island.

357
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,240
It's more like there's like a shore with like a bit of a beach, and then like a bit of a

358
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,640
beach, and then like a bit further out there's like grassland, and then this like tower.

359
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,640
Okay.

360
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
You're being a bit of a beach about this whole wave situation.

361
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:17,000
situation I'm just trying to um this game then then yeah I won't do that then we

362
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,880
won't do the tidal wave yeah I wasn't gonna do the tidal wave in the first I

363
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,920
thought that it was like right there but I'm using my it doesn't matter what you

364
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,400
could do physical I'm not using my wave on this chuggy you could certainly move

365
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,000
across you could certainly like park yourself to the other side of the shore

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,960
away from the encampment I'm getting out of chuggy yeah you're gonna get out yeah

367
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,900
I'm out all right, so I would roll here's the thing chuggy makes no sense

368
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,800
If you're gonna get out and be a person flailing in the water

369
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:50,800
You just have to roll stealth is all you see what I'm saying just cuz like they're not like clocking chuggy is like a you know

370
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,360
It looks like nothing. He looks like a big. Yeah

371
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,120
Yeah, yeah, it's just they there. Oh, it's there. Oh boy. Is there maybe rock is there any is there any?

372
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,560
There's like yeah, there's vegetation. There's woodland around like there's there's there. What about in the water?

373
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,720
I would say in the water. Yeah, I mean there's like seaweed. It's a can I do can I try it?

374
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:15,120
Can I get out into some seaweed? Yeah? I would say and like poke my eyes and nose out like a frog. I'm green

375
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm a goblin don't

376
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,400
But yeah roll okay like a dead frog

377
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:30,480
Roll okay, yeah, we're like a water jumping lizard roll stealth, and I'll adjust the DC in my head because you're trying to be

378
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,720
be tackable about it.

379
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,420
SID: Ooh.

380
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,820
That is a -- it was a 9, and I touched it,

381
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:38,820
and it moved to a 6.

382
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:39,620
Do you believe me?

383
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,320
JUSTIN: I do believe you.

384
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:40,920
SID: Okay.

385
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,560
What's my stealth?

386
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,320
It's plus 1.

387
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,020
It's a 10.

388
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,700
JUSTIN: Okay.

389
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,360
Yeah.

390
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,660
I mean, you don't see any obvious stirring from the

391
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,060
encampment, so you are likely successful here.

392
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,800
SID: Okay.

393
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,940
And I can just -- can I breathe in the -- can I --

394
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,600
JUSTIN: Yeah.

395
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,140
Yeah.

396
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,640
Yeah.

397
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,440
You -- what you described to me is happening.

398
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,200
SID: So I just kind of hang tight here for now?

399
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,740
JUSTIN: Yes.

400
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,340
SID: Okay.

401
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,040
JUSTIN: Yes.

402
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm just going to hang tight for a minute.

403
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
Yes.

404
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:05,640
Why don't I shoot somebody out of my blowhole?

405
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
Yes.

406
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,600
Yeah, you guys do that and I'll hang back.

407
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:14,440
Put me in your blowhole, shoot me maximum speed to the top like Super Mario 64.

408
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,860
Okay.

409
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:16,940
And then I roll perform.

410
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
And I'd like to hear it go...

411
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,120
As we aim it.

412
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,880
Okay, but let him shoot at least...

413
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,880
At least let me die, you bastard.

414
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,880
At least let him get shot at the enemies.

415
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,880
I'll let you shoot yourself towards the encampment.

416
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,880
Not to the top of the tower.

417
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,880
How about that?

418
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,880
And in the confusion of that, I'm going to run around behind.

419
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
What do I roll?

420
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:36,880
Oh God, right?

421
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
What are you going to roll?

422
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
Do I roll, is that a performance?

423
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
I think you said performance.

424
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Let's do that.

425
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
I guess performance makes sense, right?

426
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I would say it's actually a little bit more of a dex.

427
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,880
It's like a range attack.

428
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,880
It's like a range attack.

429
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,880
So I would roll a d20 and add your dex.

430
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,000
plus proficiency because it's your blowhole. You know how that works.

431
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,480
You got a crit one? Alright well I don't know that so I'm loading myself into this thing.

432
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:07,040
Here we go. Death from above.

433
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,560
You get jammed in his hole. Let's go alright Chuggy.

434
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,560
Press a button. Let's go. Describe what that's like Chuggy.

435
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:15,920
I'm a hands up Superman.

436
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,920
I'm so ready. I accidentally

437
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,920
I see like a sexy fish

438
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,180
(laughter)

439
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,680
- Swim under me and I go, whoa!

440
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,000
- Well, so you're not a fish though,

441
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,400
you're a humanoid who transforms into a fish-like creature.

442
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,800
So you just think, you're just a guy

443
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,680
who thinks a fish is sexy.

444
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,520
- He is a submarine.

445
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,360
- A submarine's not a fish either.

446
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,840
- Yeah, I'm a guy, I see Angelina Jolie in Shark Tale.

447
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,680
- Okay, wow.

448
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,500
- Is that her?

449
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,340
- I can't even blame you then,

450
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,180
because she is actually fire.

451
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,760
- And I go, and I go underwater and I just--

452
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,400
- Wait, and I'm just being dragged down?

453
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,000
- You're in the blowhole and there's,

454
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,800
it's just filling up with water.

455
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:58,840
Okay, alright, uh, okay yeah, at this point I have to say, I mean like, with that, all

456
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:05,280
that commotion of those, of you, I will say with a one, you literally go "Oh boy!" and

457
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,120
just like make that noise, so they hear that from the river, and the two guys who are stirring,

458
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,320
they get up and they start to wander over closer to the shore.

459
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,560
You don't know that this is happening, you do, Raw Dogon, you.

460
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:22,760
Am I just flying through the water like I left my bungee on?

461
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,760
just like inside his hole.

462
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,760
He decides to stop trying to fuck the fish.

463
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,760
The only thing that happened, you thought you were getting shot out, but you like, you

464
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:38,520
were in my, your head is out like a mini corn dog.

465
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Yeah.

466
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,160
Like, or pigs in a blanket.

467
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Okay.

468
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,160
You're like, your head is poking out of my flesh.

469
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Just the top of my head?

470
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,760
Top of your head is like a pig in a blanket.

471
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:50,760
Okay.

472
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:51,760
So what about you?

473
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,900
They're walking are they walking towards me. I mean they're walking towards in the noise. Where were you in relation to them?

474
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:00,320
I guess it's a better question. I mean I'm in the sea where right you're like

475
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,960
I'm in the senior them so like cuz you just cuz you I kind of pictured I guess in my brain

476
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,320
Yeah, tell me cuz I didn't like describe that that like like like I'm next to the shore like lily pad

477
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,360
Yeah, that's kind of I see it, too

478
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,660
So they're kind of like approaching like at your they're not approaching directly towards you

479
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,180
They're kind of coming from like they're gonna be at your like 10 o'clock and are those these the only people who I saw the in

480
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:37,180
the

481
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,500
sneak up and try and get behind them I think.

482
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,180
We're doing a great distraction over here.

483
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:45,340
Yes, we're going to have to start, it depends on what you do.

484
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,140
Are you going back up or are you going down further right now?

485
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,300
The fish turned out to be a piece of trash.

486
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,300
Okay.

487
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,060
I'm going to say.

488
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,060
And you're still following it.

489
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:59,220
I'm still following it because I still want to fuck it.

490
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:03,180
Okay, I need you to roll a d20 for constitution saving throw.

491
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,180
Yeah, yeah I figured.

492
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,180
But the water.

493
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,140
The water is good.

494
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,740
The water does give you plus two.

495
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
You get pluses.

496
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
You get plus two.

497
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
Fourteen.

498
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,740
Nice.

499
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:15,460
I will say the blowhole smells like a fat guy's belly button.

500
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,460
You ever do that?

501
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,260
You ever have a fat friend, you stick your finger in his belly button, you smell your

502
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
finger?

503
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
Yeah.

504
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
Try that next time.

505
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,260
What does that smell like?

506
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,260
It smells really bad.

507
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,260
I'm going to find out.

508
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,260
It smells like barbecue chips.

509
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:27,260
No, no.

510
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
It smells bad.

511
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
No, no.

512
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,260
No, no.

513
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,260
No, no, no.

514
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,260
Oh, no, no.

515
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:35,180
A human shouldn't smell like barbecue chips.

516
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,180
That's true.

517
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,860
You smell like barbecue chips.

518
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,060
I ate some barbecue chips.

519
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,340
Yeah, so you're a human.

520
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:40,840
Barely.

521
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:44,220
I wish I had barbecue chips.

522
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,180
You got plain rough.

523
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,680
So you're--

524
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,180
So I'm starting at it.

525
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,100
You're still-- yeah, so you're able to--

526
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,340
the magical properties of the water

527
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,220
were able to help you sort of maintain composure.

528
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,300
And it makes my hair grow.

529
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,540
It's very composed.

530
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,040
Yeah.

531
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,580
It's like sticking out of a blowhole.

532
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,820
Perfect posture.

533
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,900
And it makes my hair grow.

534
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,660
Yes.

535
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:05,340
You get one hair, like a little baby.

536
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,340
Oh, yeah.

537
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:10,940
And you, you roll a stealth check, Rodogon, you.

538
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
Okay.

539
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,140
That is a 17.

540
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,540
Nice, okay, yeah, I'm gonna roll for them.

541
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,540

Okay, yeah.

544
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:27,940
So you, you are able to sort of get around them right now.

545
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,940
Mm-hmm.

546
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,940
And they don't see you.

547
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,940
They're pretty distracted by what's going on underwater.

548
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,340

00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:36,940

585
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:04,700
Attack roll so just roll d20 and add your strength

586
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:14,200
18 nice okay, you were able to swallow them to eat them at you

587
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,180
This is the only thing I'll let your submarine do we did establish that it can do this

588
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:25,040
You able to put them in your mouth right now. They can go you can either swallow them to go inside your submarine chamber

589
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,100
and oh

590
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,020
No, I guess it would kill you if you transferred back. I was saying that'd be fucking brutal, but no yeah

591
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,820
It would kill you and or you can and you can or you can like kind of spit them out and drown them

592
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,960
you can kind of

593
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,220
Do that?

594
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,680
What if I you like kind of trap them?

595
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,720
I mean, what if I should I do that and and dissolve them in my stomach acid I?

596
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,000
Didn't really think about that

597
00:25:53,000 --> 00:26:02,960
He sounds so scared it's a lot of power. I just gave him he'll be dead soon. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, you digest them

598
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:10,440
Nice well here's here's what I'll say it's ones per log rest power you can eat humans

599
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Okay, you need people that doesn't see because it maybe it ups because it's so full

600
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:20,480
I'm gonna throw up next roll. Wait. Did you show up?

601
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:25,100
They just maybe I roll they are they use here's what you see I have to roll like

602
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:30,680
Basically inside a force, but it would it would I guess if you were inside the okay?

603
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:35,480
It's like you would see them like traveling through underneath the floor. Oh my god like a gust of

604
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,040
Yeah, great. Yeah, you see them like in the like in the Adams family

605
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:47,560
movie from the 90s when uncle the uncle fester imposter goes up the tube because he pulled the wrong chain behind the bookcase and he's

606
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:52,840
Going through the water tube and they're like guess uncle fester's messing around with the chains and then they go outside and he came out of

607
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:57,000
That little door. It's exactly like I'll cover the water on the ground outside the mansion of the house

608
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,200
I should say they call it an uncle fester situation. What's happening here? The hell are you talking about?

609
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:08,940
He knows he just told me to watch that movie because I had not seen it so you know I don't know Christopher

610
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,140
Lloyd, Uncle Fester

611
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,800
Why are you talking about Christopher? We did a performance for the ages. It's a good performance

612
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,680
So funny, I guess

613
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:20,040
Roll like a golf and I

614
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:25,420
Roll like yeah constitution saving throw to see if eating them

615
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,760
Doesn't make me sick

616
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:34,700
Yeah, I like that okay. Let's do that and it'll be a DC. What's your con to DC 12 keep it safe, okay?

617
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,900
Well, I got a 17. Yeah, you're fine. So you're able to digest them very easily and

618
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,180
It's like when you eat

619
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,340
Oysters, I think it's still once for long rest

620
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:46,260
But now instead of like if you fail your DC

621
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,060
I think I'll probably have to raise it to 15 or something

622
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:54,120
But I think from now on if you fail the DC though. It's like you vomit them up. They take like

623
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:00,660
Yeah, they take like maybe like like 1d 8 damage just from like the acid in the churn

624
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:06,700
But you know then you'd fight them or whatever, but if they you succeed you get to swallow a guy

625
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:13,000
And you have to be a guy who has to also do like you said we'll also have to figure out like you know

626
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:20,140
It'll depend like are they aware of this is happening versus like this which is a pure surprise so a pure surprise

627
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:22,340
So yeah, you guys took care of that encampment

628
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:30,700
The tower is yours to approach keep in mind there are a few guys on the outside man was my favorite scroll that came out recently

629
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,380
with all those singing

630
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:38,500
All right, go you can know any time you can go you can go right through the front door

631
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,080
There's a few guys outside of there where you can I would recommend maybe looking around the tower a little bit

632
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:50,780
Okay, I'm looking around the tower my eyes becomes searchlights in there going back and the map the map the man. Yeah, so

633
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,740
yeah, roll a

634
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,340
investigation anyone or all of you.

635
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,180
- Me!

636
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,620
- May Caleb do it, he's the one with who has it.

637
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:04,620
- My investigation added the bonus ability, that's 17.

638
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,580
- That's very good.

639
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,420
- Thank you.

640
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,340
- So, all right.

641
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,660
I should be much better about hiding.

642
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,500
- You should just be better.

643
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,100
- The little map of the tower.

644
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,780
- Holy fuck.

645
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,580
- I memorized it, don't worry guys.

646
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,180
- Basically there's stairs that go around

647
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:22,540
and around and around and they go up one floor by one.

648
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,740
- And they don't stop, they go all the way up.

649
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,060
- The top of the tower is its peak.

650
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,780
It's actually a Soulsian style.

651
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,740
- One of them is Soulsian.

652
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,320
- Listen, I would be able to tell what it is,

653
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:38,020
but Pat is not a good gifted artist.

654
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,180
- I am not a gifted artist.

655
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,940
I'm actually, you know what, I'm not bad.

656
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,780
- He's pushing back.

657
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,860
- I'm pushing back tonight.

658
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,700
Yeah, so you guys--

659
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,900
- He's allowed to push back.

660
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:46,800
- Yeah.

661
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,060
So you guys, as you go around, Steevel,

662
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:53,140
you see a, you know, and you're kind of far out, right?

663
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,220
'Cause you don't really-- - Whoa!

664
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,820
- I mean, I was like, is he gonna, but he didn't.

665
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:01,980
- So, you know, you're trying not to alert the guards

666
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,460
in the front of the tower. - Okay.

667
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:06,860
- But you can see what looks like kind of like scuffed

668
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,140
like ground beneath one of the edges

669
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,320
of like the larger tower on the left side.

670
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,060
So if you're facing the tower-- - Is there any beautiful

671
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,700
golden braided hair falling from this tower?

672
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,900
- No.

673
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,060
- Well, there goes my plan.

674
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,420
Okay, well, is there...

675
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,260
I press the up elevator button.

676
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,260
There's no up elevator button.

677
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,300
Okay, I press the down elevator button.

678
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Fine, you go down.

679
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,560
(laughing)

680
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,940
But no, yeah, you see like a hole

681
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:34,220
that leads to underneath the tower.

682
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,060
Okay, I'm hopping in feet first.

683
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,540
No, head first.

684
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:38,500
Dug the board.

685
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,780
And I use his butt as a pillow, I go right behind him.

686
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:42,620
Okay.

687
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:45,660
Using his butt as a pillow, you guys both go down

688
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:50,660
into what is the, essentially the basement of the tower.

689
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,920
(snorting)

690
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,160
(laughing)

691
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:59,140
- These guys are having a smelling fight.

692
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,140
- So, oh you're G'day Cuntole.

693
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:01,980
- And I'm winning.

694
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,820
- Oh yeah.

695
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:06,020
- Truce.

696
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,820
- Someone needs to lose.

697
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,780
- It smells just like home.

698
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:13,780
- So in this basement area of the tower,

699
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:15,260
compared to the outside of the tower,

700
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,020
what you had seen which had this kind of like,

701
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,620
it was a bit like, it was a bit like,

702
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:23,300
it seemed a bit odd and a bit ancient and all that,

703
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:25,400
but it didn't seem like fully,

704
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:31,900
like a different, a completely like alien architecture

705
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,540
like this basement area does.

706
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:37,620
You see to your right, this,

707
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,140
like a, what looks like a sealed off door

708
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:43,620
to like a smaller room in this room, you know,

709
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,660
it's like jutting out from the wall.

710
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:46,500
- Okay.

711
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,340
- And then--

712
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,380
- Like a shed?

713
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,680
- Yeah, basically a shed, but it's like inside

714
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,860
and it's like affixed to the top of the wall

715
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,520
of this basement area.

716
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:57,280
It's not like a very high ceiling.

717
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,120
- Okay.

718
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,700
- And you see to your left,

719
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:06,380
more of that sort of burrowed tunnel that you had seen

720
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,700
that kind of like led you in here.

721
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,540
- Round two.

722
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,820
- That goes further in.

723
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,680
From in front of you, you can sort of start to hear like the,

724
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:19,040
you can hear like the, like vague like conversation

725
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:22,120
between, yeah, between like guards or, you know,

726
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,360
members of this group who are inside the main area.

727
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:28,680
- Can I do, should I do a perception or investigation

728
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,040
to try to make out what they're saying a little bit?

729
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,160
- This would be, I would say this is perception, yeah.

730
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,000
- Okay.

731
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,240
- It's either that or insight really.

732
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,440
I think perception though is really good.

733
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,280
- 18.

734
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,100
- 18?

735
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,940
Yeah, sure.

736
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:46,940
And you could hear them saying like, "I don't want to go back up there again with that beast."

737
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,100
And you hear them talking about this stuff.

738
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,740
Like waiting for Sticky Fingers, not wanting to go back up there because of a beast.

739
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:01,620
Don't we have an inn with Sticky Fingers because we have Patrick's head?

740
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:06,240
I mean, you don't know if Sticky Fingers was responsible for anything, if he's your friend

741
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
or your enemy still.

742
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,140
like it for all you don't they know that sticky fingers no no I mean they so what

743
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,980
they all they know is that code like the word sticky fingers led most likely to

744
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:22,360
Patrick's mom's death they don't know how sticky fingers connected to that at

745
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:26,980
all so in sticky fingers might regard them as friends you know but they are

746
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:32,200
right now in a like interfering with an operation that he's in the middle of but

747
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,440
like this so that's like but that's like what you I mean they could have debriefed

748
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,440
you

749
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,440
We don't have to do a scene about this.

750
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,440
So this is on the other side of a closed door, right?

751
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:47,940
What?

752
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,440
The voices are on the other side of a closed door?

753
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,440
No, like the other side of like a wall.

754
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
Like a wall in dirt.

755
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Okay, and is that the only door?

756
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:59,440
No, no, no. That's like, it's not a door.

757
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
It's literally like...

758
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
It doesn't have a door?

759
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
Yeah, it's foundation.

760
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,440
Like there's a door out one way and there's like that weird shed.

761
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,440
So there is a door though.

762
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
So the voices aren't coming from the shed?

763
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,440
No.

764
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,720
No, that shed that shit is like that shit like the shed is against the wall and like it looks like it would just stop at

765
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:20,280
The wall, okay, maybe we should get another shit. Yeah, I want to get in the shed

766
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,120
I'm itching to get in the shed. I'm trying to pride the shed open

767
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,560
Wanna take a shit?

768
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,000
Exact way to open it here. Yeah door does not open from this side. Yeah

769
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,680
We'll get back there at some point try to bust it down

770
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:40,000
Busted busted busted. Hold on. Let me look at it gangster

771
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,720
this is it made out of one said I will say he said doors not open from this side and as a as a

772
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:50,240
RPG as an RPG player that means we should keep we should just go somewhere else there

773
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,940
I mean look it's not that they're not away, but it's like it'll it'll be tough

774
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,720
You'll have time you'll have you got a wow me

775
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,480
One thing about me is that I'm tough.

776
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,480
You are tough.

777
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
Can we...

778
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,480
Hold on, hold on.

779
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Wait, I'm getting close.

780
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,480
I've been holding on.

781
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,480
I'm looking at my spells.

782
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
I'm getting really close to a switch.

783
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,480
Oh, wait.

784
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Can I detect magic on the show?

785
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:11,480
Oh, yeah.

786
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,480
Yeah, you can certainly do that.

787
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Real quick.

788
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Okay, I give up.

789
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Go for it.

790
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Okay, I don't know how to do that.

791
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,480
They say something about a beast, right?

792
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Yeah.

793
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
You do just detect magic.

794
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
You notice that there is a little bit of a, like,

795
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,480
a little bit of a, like,

796
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
a little bit of a, like,

797
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,480
a little bit of a, like,

798
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
a little bit of a, like,

799
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
a little bit of a, like,

800
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:28,480
You notice that there is --

801
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:33,480
We don't know what the beast looks like.

802
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:37,480
I can make a new beast.

803
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,480
I can make a completely new beast.

804
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,480
So you can -- you detect -- you definitely detect some kind of --

805
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:51,480
I'd say it's closer to evocation magic than anything from within the shed,

806
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,480
but it also could just as likely be --

807
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,480
it's like it has shades of enchantment magic as well.

808
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,480
There's some kind of -- basically it's like --

809
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
it's the composite magics that would make a mechanism, right?

810
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,480
Like a machine kind of work.

811
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,480
Does anybody have anything to like dispel magic or anything?

812
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Dude, like an anti-magic field or something like that?

813
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,480
I have invisibility.

814
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,480
Yeah, you do.

815
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,480
I'm trying to think.

816
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,840
That's something that you should consider using at some point.

817
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,360
Also have Shatter.

818
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,520
Yeah, this is the... So here's the thing.

819
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,400
You guys also each have, I believe, two good health potions.

820
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,000
If I don't have it in your inventory, I have it in my notes here.

821
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,840
I have Leomund's Tiny Hut.

822
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,280
Yeah, this is the one where...

823
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,360
This is like the... If I didn't write it down there,

824
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,960
that's... This is something that...

825
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,520
And I can use Invisibility for up to an hour.

826
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:47,000
But this is gonna be the...

827
00:36:47,000 --> 00:37:08,000
the

828
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,520
door is not the thing we came through.

829
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,440
- Yeah, sorry, let me make sure I aptly explain this.

830
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,680
Here, wait, let me draw.

831
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,520
Here, wait, let me draw.

832
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,360
- I know you have invisibility.

833
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,960
- I can just walk in this room.

834
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:16,800
- There's no room.

835
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,080
- There's no room.

836
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,920
- You guys came in from here.

837
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,440
This is where you were hearing the voices.

838
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,220
This is where that weird shed is,

839
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:29,720
and this is that other tunnel.

840
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,360
- Okay, I think we should go in the other tunnel then.

841
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,200
It's the only way forward.

842
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,040
- I think so, yeah.

843
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:33,860
- Yeah, I agree.

844
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,360
- All right, well let's get in that there tunnel.

845
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,200
- Okay.

846
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,560
Alright, so you go around this winding tunnel and it looks like there's like these different

847
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,280
like claw marks that are like marking the wall, they're allowing you to go up it.

848
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,080
You see bits of rock and rubble sort of falling on you.

849
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,160
As you're like looping around, you notice that you're moving further away from kind of like

850
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,520
where you were in the center of the tower to like further back.

851
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:04,600
And what you might have noticed actually, Steval, while there is sort of these like makeshift

852
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,760
palisades around all of the, you know, around the drum towers, is that there was

853
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:15,600
like a back section to that main tower. It looked like made of different

854
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,000
architecture and it seems like you're moving up that as you tunnel through

855
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:26,800
this and you approach a window that looks into a...

856
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,800
I'm sorry, not there. My apologies. Oops, I read the wrong thing.

857
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,800
There we go, yes I got it right.

858
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,800
It looks into the second floor of the main tower area.

859
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:42,800
As you were going around you saw this other area, this other stranger architecture,

860
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,800
but then you looped back around into the main tower.

861
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,800
And as you poke your head out you do see a guard immediately on your left.

862
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,800
Does he see us? He does not see you just yet.

863
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:57,800
You're on the second floor of the main tower, so it's like you were underneath.

864
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
Is there any way to sneak past him?

865
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
It's a pretty small room.

866
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,800
It would be very difficult to just sneak past.

867
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Can we sneak attack him maybe?

868
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Sneak attack, doing something with invisibility, maybe.

869
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,800
A number of things you might have to do to make this work.

870
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,800
I think I'm going to cast Vampiric Touch.

871
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Just try to sneak attack kill him with a single hit.

872
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,800
Okay.

873
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,800
Yeah.

874
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,800
Okay.

875
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Read for me Vampiric Touch. Let's hear about it.

876
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,800
Okay, so I guess I'm a fucking book to you.

877
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
The touch of your- is this what you wanted?

878
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,800
The touch of your shadow wreath hand can siphon life force from others to heal your wounds.

879
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,800
Make a melee spell attack against a creature within your reach.

880
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:47,800
On a hit, the target takes 3d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the amount of necrotic damage dealt.

881
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Until the spell ends, you can make the attack again on each of your turns as an action.

882
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
Okay.

883
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,800
Okay.

884
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,800
Yeah, that's good.

885
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,420
It's good. Why not touch him so first thing you're gonna want to do though is sneak

886
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,840
That's true check

887
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,960
That's a 70. Oh, no. That's a four plus one five. That's a nice tripod you almost got me by saying

888
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,720
Sure is oh wait. It was a 20. I'm so stupid. I'm stupid

889
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,320
Yeah, he did the math wrong. Yeah, you

890
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:23,200
It's to make another spongebob reference. It's you stepping on the floor in here

891
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,200
(quack)

892
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Well he wouldn't even look, it's normal to hear a duck sound.

893
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
A duck? What?

894
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,200
And he turns around.

895
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,200
I pretend to be a duck.

896
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,200
Who are you who is so wise in the ways of science?

897
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,200
I don't know.

898
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
What is up with you today in movies?

899
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
What is up with you today in the Holy Grail Witch Scene?

900
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,200
I got you.

901
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,200
I would like to...

902
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,200
I'm the loser, yeah.

903
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,200
I would like to pretend to be a duck if I could origami my body a little bit.

904
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,200
(laughter)

905
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,700
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What if I turn into a duck?

906
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,200
What if I shapeshift into a duck?

907
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,700
Whole squad turned to a duck.

908
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,500
So what are you gonna do now?

909
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
I just saw you.

910
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,000
Okay.

911
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,800
Well, I just...

912
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I... wait, actually...

913
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,800
You said "look a duck."

914
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Oh my God, there's a duck behind you the other direction!

915
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,800
Roll initiative.

916
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,600
Initiative like I'm going out for a job interview

917
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,100
because maybe I could become a guard?

918
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,100
A job interview.

919
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

920
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,000
Can you lure him down the hallway

921
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
and then as he runs past our hallway opening

922
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,160
we just we just get all that's a good idea

923
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,360
so it's it's it's a yeah it's it's a bit of a smaller room but what you could do

924
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,280
if you

925
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,600
pull him for far enough back

926
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,240
unlike like by moving back yeah you could conceivably go around and leave this

927
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,080
room

928
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,720
and into the no i just meant to sneak it like what he walked yet to go with this

929
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,900
to see a cam

930
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,740
all yet you do that to you know he is a no you guys are there yet yet again

931
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:46,080
you have been on all fours

932
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,140
for my pants down

933
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,080
show my asshole

934
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:54,560
uh... and i'm and i'm putting my balls in my dick behind my asshole and then i'm

935
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,220
like squeezing my thighs together

936
00:41:57,220 --> 00:42:02,240
and it kinda looks like a duck

937
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:06,880
and then you run down the hallway like that

938
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,240
while holding my balls behind my thighs

939
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,640
i kinda waddle

940
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,080
galloping like a horse

941
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:18,080
I'm hitting every creaky floorboard on the way down the hall.

942
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:22,080
[quacking]

943
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,080
He does like...

944
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,080
And you're doing a fart that sounds like a duck.

945
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,080
Yeah.

946
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,080
[quacking]

947
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,080
I'm waving my fart in my other face.

948
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:31,080
What the fuck are you doing?

949
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,080
Yeah! Yeah!

950
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:37,080
He's approaching you and he has his sword drawn.

951
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,080
And he's just like...

952
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:41,080
He's like trying...

953
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,560
Alright, I gotta... you gotta get the fuck out of here.

954
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:46,600
And he goes to grab it, he is now past the hole that you guys are...

955
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,760
Attack of opportunity.

956
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,260
Yeah.

957
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:48,760
Me too.

958
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:49,760
We both...

959
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,360
Yeah, you both get attack of opportunity.

960
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,240
I'm gonna shoot him with my crossbow.

961
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,640
Oh my god, I got a crit one.

962
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,640
Okay.

963
00:42:55,640 --> 00:42:57,080
It's a sneak attack though.

964
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,080
Yes, you get a sneak attack.

965
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Is it a sneak attack?

966
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Yes, it is.

967
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
I got a nine.

968
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Okay, that time I got a seventeen total.

969
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,080
What's the... what do I add?

970
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,080
Add your attack.

971
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,960
What are you attacking with?

972
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:26,960
a

973
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:41,960
is

974
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:46,460
I would like to put my hand over his mouth when we do this too.

975
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,760
Oh, I see.

976
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:48,760
Let's have you do --

977
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,760
I would like to continue waddling.

978
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
Or maybe -- yeah.

979
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,760
You're not quite in the initiative order yet.

980
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
I'll --

981
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Is there a conthometry suppress noise at all?

982
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,760
Or does it just make noise?

983
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I think it just makes noise.

984
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Okay.

985
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Sort of a live guy spell.

986
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,760
You can make the inverse of whatever noise he makes and silence him.

987
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:07,760
Invert the phase.

988
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,760
Yeah.

989
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,760
Okay, that is a 14.

990
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,760
Okay, I'll say you got the jump on him.

991
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,760
Yeah, you're able to put your hand over his mouth.

992
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,760
I'm a goblin, so I'm really small.

993
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,760
That's why I had to jump up on his shoulders to do it.

994
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,760
You hear from outside this room, though,

995
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
this hallway, you hear,

996
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,760
"Uh, Kevin, what's going on in there?"

997
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,760
And I do vicious mockery.

998
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,760
Oh. Oh my God.

999
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,760
On that guy. On that guy who's outside the hallway?

1000
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Yeah. Just copy--no, just touch--

1001
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
just copy this guy's voice. You just heard him talk.

1002
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,440
you're a changelog. Oh right, right, I copy his voice. Yeah, what are you saying this other guy's voice?

1003
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,200
Um, hey.

1004
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:48,480
Um, I'm pretty uh, I'm, I'm fucking.

1005
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:55,360
Um, I'm all right. My uh, I was talking to my daughter.

1006
00:44:55,360 --> 00:45:07,280
Yeah, okay Kevin. All right. Um, god that guy's so fucking weird. Just, they just walk away.

1007
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,920
Why would you give him a detail like you know our daughter this guy knows you on it?

1008
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,520
You thought you were doing Louie

1009
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:23,080
Yeah, I mean that's a classic Louie reference - I was talking to my daughter she's a cunt

1010
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:27,080
Just kind of like like pitch down Brandon Ward

1011
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:34,480
It's your turn

1012
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,600
Yeah, let me roll a performance check.

1013
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,360
You have a chance to kill him!

1014
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:43,000
I got a... performance...

1015
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:46,600
Plus I got three, so I don't really seem like a duck.

1016
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:48,120
You just seem like a...

1017
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:48,620
*quack*

1018
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:49,120
*quack*

1019
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:49,620
*quack*

1020
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,120
*quack*

1021
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:50,620
*quack*

1022
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:51,120
*quack*

1023
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:54,760
When my ass is out, my dick and balls are behind my thighs.

1024
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:00,120
I'm crying out. You know what? Because my performance got worse, my forearms are getting real sore

1025
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:02,760
of waddling, so I go down to my elbows.

1026
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:09,320
I'm not looking behind me at all to see the fighting just

1027
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,960
*imitates fighting noises*

1028
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,960
This is really getting me

1029

1046
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,920

1047
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:54,160

1059
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,640

1060
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,640

1061
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:22,640

*grunts*

1064
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
because that's what you think a duck would do

1065
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:32,640
I will also say though he moved right out of your range too.

1066
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:33,640
My range?

1067
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,640
So you have an opportunity attack here.

1068
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,640
Ok, I will.

1069
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:39,640
Use your action last time.

1070
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,640
That is a 19.

1071
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,640
Nice, use your action last time to impersonate him.

1072
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,640
That hits, so roll for damage now.

1073
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:46,640
What are you attacking him with?

1074
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,640
I'm attacking him with my crossbow.

1075
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,640
Ok.

1076
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:52,640
Which I don't care about the range rules for that.

1077
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:54,640
Nobody can tell me otherwise.

1078
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:55,640
Four.

1079
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,640
Okay, plus one.

1080
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:58,640
Oh, plus one.

1081
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,640
And you got, what'd you get last time?

1082
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,640
Four.

1083
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:02,640
And what did you have? You had 14, right?

1084
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:03,640
I had 12, I think.

1085
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,640
You had 12? Oh, okay, yeah.

1086
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
Yeah, he's...

1087
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:09,640
Why don't you write it down? You got the biggest friggin' notepad ever in your life.

1088
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:10,640
Yeah, we call it a computer.

1089
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,640
No, it actually has a giant notepad.

1090
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,640
Oh, I didn't see that.

1091
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,640
But it has all my map designs on it.

1092
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,640
Don't touch things.

1093
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,640
Yeah, he's still, he's still alive.

1094
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,640
At this point, the guy's...

1095
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
It's my turn.

1096
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,480
- It's gonna be, yeah, it's about to be your turn,

1097
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,920
but, well, no, it's actually gonna be your turn.

1098
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,760
- Yeah. - Okay.

1099
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:29,580
- It's your turn.

1100
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:30,420
I mean, this is, I will say, like, you gotta--

1101
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,960

1103
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,520
and hit him and put my hand over his mouth again.

1104
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:36,420
- Yeah. - Just do the,

1105
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:37,260
just run it back.

1106
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:38,640
Oh, wait, I got two attacks last turn.

1107
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:39,480
I completely forgot.

1108
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,880
- Well, no, you didn't, 'cause it's an opportunity attack.

1109
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:41,960
- Okay, well, this time I do.

1110
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:42,800
- Yeah.

1111
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,400
- Okay, that's, that is an eight.

1112
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,240
- All right, you can roll again.

1113
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,920
Yeah, that's it.

1114
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,960
- Okay, that is a 19.

1115
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,880
- Yeah, that hits.

1116
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:56,560
- Okay, okay, and my damage is a three.

1117
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,840
- Wow, yeah, you just didn't kill him.

1118
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,440
- Damn, can I still try and put my hand over his mouth again?

1119
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,160
- I'll let you do that as a bonus action.

1120
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,880
Just 'cause he's pretty bewildered.

1121
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:05,720
- Okay, that's eight.

1122
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:08,280
- Yeah, I mean, like, we'll have him roll against that.

1123
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:10,600
- Or maybe even stick my whole fist down his throat.

1124
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,280
- Is it my turn now?

1125
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:13,960

I'm sorry.

1173
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,080
I'm trying to shoot him with my crossbow.

1174
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:43,080
Yeah, okay. So that'd be a 20.

1175
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Yeah, roll for damage.

1176
00:50:45,080 --> 00:50:47,080

00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:49,080
Plus one. So I got a 19.

1178
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,080
You will kill him.

1179
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,080
Wait, is that...

1180
00:50:53,080 --> 00:50:55,080
No matter what damage you roll, you're gonna kill him.

1181
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:57,080
This is what you add to the attack roll?

1182
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,080
Oh, and that would be like a 20.

1183
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:01,080
You already hit him.

1184
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:03,080
And I got seven damage.

1185
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,080
Describe your kill on this guy.

00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:07,080
really wants to kill evil steve

1187
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:09,080
I can't believe it

1188
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:11,080
the easiest number to add

1189
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:13,080
I shot him in the mouth

1190
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,080
yeah

1191
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:17,080
you fucking duck

1192
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:19,080
wait it shoots like through the

1193
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:21,080
back of his head

1194
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:23,080
and then can he die by falling

1195
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:25,080
maybe the arrow goes all the way through

1196
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,080
clears him completely

1197
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,080
he falls into my ass and maybe my balls

1198
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:31,080
go into his mouth

1199
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,080
like when the dentist holds your mouth open with that thing

1200
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:37,340
thing. Yeah, right. And then I just and then to make his other friend mad now I'm dragging

1201
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:43,200
his him. You know what actually the arrow goes to affix him to me the arrow goes into

1202
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,120
my asshole. It's like a barb and it's stuck in me and I'm just dragging his lifeless body.

1203
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:54,040
You have to take damage for that. It's completely worth it. How much damage do you have to take?

1204
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,040
roll the a you just you decide

That was a one.

It's a one, yeah.

1218
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:24,640
It's actually a one.

1219
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:27,480
It's a one and then a six on the same.

1220
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,480

00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,480
Yeah, thank you.

1223
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,000
Yeah, he's going to hit you for sure.

1224
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,000
Fucker.

1225
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,000
He draws his sword out.

1226
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,600
You take your damage out.

1227
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,600
He tried to hit you.

1228
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,360
He'd do 15 damage to you.

1229
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,880
Did we take a long rest?

1230
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,480
Yeah, you should have your health back.

1231
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:45,480
Oh, okay.

1232
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,480
You're at full HP.

1233
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,480
Yeah.

1234
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:50,680
Oh, I need to get seven HP then.

1235
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,680
Yeah, and you are up now.

1236
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:53,680
Me?

1237
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,680
Yeah.

1238
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,680
Okay, I better run up and hit this dude guy.

1239
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:58,680
Do it.

1240
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,680
Well, I already had, I erased it, but I still had to.

1241
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,680
Okay, that's a 12 on my first attack.

1242
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:03,680
Yeah, no.

1243
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,680
No hit.

1244
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,680
No dice, Bryce.

1245
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,680
Okay, that's a 7 on my second attack.

1246
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,680
No dice, Bryce.

1247
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,680
Yeah, and then I basically am doing the duck thing, I guess, now too.

1248
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,680
Yeah.

1249
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:14,680
That's what we should do, we should do it in opposite directions so he gets stuck in the

1250
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:15,680
middle.

1251
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,680
Yeah, I start doing the duck thing.

1252
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:19,680
I run up, take two swings, and immediately drop to a high point.

1253
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,680
He's like no reaction just drop not even yeah, not even close to

1254
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,320
Completely just

1255
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:33,380
This might make him go crazy at the very least he's gotta be taking psychic damage from this. Yeah

1256
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:36,240
He has to take

1257
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,440
He's going on your ass. Yeah, we had needed to open it. I love Europe. I'm up

1258
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:53,360
shit

1259
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:55,960
What can I do without interrupting my shit?

1260
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,680
All right, I'll do vampiric touch you have a you have a

1261
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:06,380
Crossbow no wait no I need to touch him you have a crossbow dart in your butt if you fart hard enough

1262
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:11,320
You could shoot the crossbow dart out of your butt into his head

1263
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:20,280
Can I cast blindness deafness? Yeah, I'm gonna make him blind. Yeah, don't make him blind. Oh, no

1264
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:30,040
Before I'm gonna use ray of sickness, okay. Yeah go for it. Describe it to me. All right, so

1265
00:54:30,040 --> 00:54:33,960
Let's see, let me let me

1266
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,720

1269
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,040
What do I add to my range plus four that's a nine you only have plus four to your spell attack or no

1270
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,180
Sorry plus 11. I mean 11, okay

1271
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:55,580
Okay, so I did that for fucking nothing I could have done another performance check yeah

1272
00:54:55,580 --> 00:55:02,140
Then I pass is raves is sickness a spell attack or is it a it is a

1273
00:55:02,140 --> 00:55:06,120
third or sub first level necromancy

1274
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,220
Necromancy buddy I'll have hickeys

1275
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:11,220
- What?

1276
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,220
- Yeah, it's a spell attack.

1277
00:55:13,220 --> 00:55:14,220
- Get it?

1278
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:16,220
- All right, you are up, Pap.

1279
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:28,220
- He looks so thoughtful right now.

1280
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:29,220
- I love that.

1281
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:32,220
During everyone else's turn, he's literally looking at the ceiling,

1282
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,220
trying to touch the ceiling.

1283
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:37,220
- He's trying to pull the commander that holds the light.

1284
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:42,220
- And it gets pissed, you start slowly picking up one card by one

1285
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,220
and reading them one by one.

1286
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:47,220
- Can I actually buy you a fidget spinner so that you don't ruin the set?

1287
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,220
- Okay.

1288
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,220
Awesome.

1289
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:56,220
Alright, I guess I'll just use my crossbow again.

1290
00:55:56,220 --> 00:56:00,220
I can't think of anything I can do with these.

1291
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:06,220
- In D&D 2.0, all spells will be so simple.

1292
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:24,740

1293
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:39,500

I'm so dead.

1317
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,040
Total?

1318
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:06,040
Dude, this is it.

1319
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:08,040
Alright. It's gonna end like this.

1320
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:10,040
Pat, you're up.

1321
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,040
I'm going to use...

1322
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:14,040
Before you do it, let's look at your spells.

1323
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:16,040
You've got really good spells.

1324
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:18,040
You have Dissonant Whispers.

1325
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:22,040
That could do 3d6 damage on a failed save.

1326
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
Okay, I will use...

1327
00:58:24,040 --> 00:58:26,040
And they have to be afraid of you and run away.

1328
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,040
So how about we'll do that.

1329
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,160
And what's your spell save DC?

1330
00:58:29,160 --> 00:58:30,160
Look at your sheet.

1331
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:31,160
Go to the next page.

1332
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,400
You should see your save DC at the top.

1333
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:34,880
Bro, there's a spell called message.

1334
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:35,880
Got a smartphone.

1335
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,720
It should be at the top of the sheet.

1336
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:39,400
What does your save DC say?

1337
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,400
15.

1338
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,400
15?

1339
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:42,920
Alright, so he's going to roll against that.

1340
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,920
Not you.

1341
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,920
Me.

1342
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,920
Me got to roll against it.

1343
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:46,920
Oh, I have to roll against it.

1344
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:48,640
No, he has to roll against it.

1345
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:50,800
No, no, you don't roll.

1346
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:51,800
You got a 13.

1347
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,800
Patches.

1348
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:53,800
I got a 13.

1349
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,800
And I got a 19.

1350
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:57,300
My guy's wisdom is that he's not that wise, so...

1351
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,300
Um...

1352
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,800
Hopefully, let me see...

1353
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:00,800
I remember him being...

1354
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,800
Not that wise.

1355
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:02,300
Nice!

1356
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,300
Yeah, that hits!

1357
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:04,300
*Gasp*

1358
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,300
So he's gonna take...

1359
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:07,300
So, Pat, roll 3d6.

1360
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:09,300
So the regular dice.

1361
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:14,800
1, 2, 3.

1362
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:15,800
Nice, okay.

1363
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,800
Uh, he is afraid of you.

1364
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:18,300
So he is...

1365
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,300
You are so excited!

1366
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,800
To see your favorite numbers!

1367
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:29,800
*laughter*

1368
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:31,800
He is afraid of you.

1369
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,800
Uh, so I'm not afraid of the two ducks.

1370
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:37,800
So he is gonna start to move away from you immediately.

1371
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:38,800
Towards which duck?

1372
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,800
Get away from me!

1373
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:40,800
Yeah, which duck is it?

1374
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,800
How is he not afraid of me? I got his fucking front stapled to my ass.

1375
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,800
Cause he didn't do like this and it whispers. He played a discordant melody in his ear.

1376
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,800
Okay.

1377
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:49,800
Fucked him up.

1378
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,800
So did me too.

1379
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:55,920
And he starts to run away, and he runs out of this hallway.

1380
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,920
Uh oh, he's gonna go alert everyone else.

1381
00:59:57,920 --> 00:59:58,420
Good!

1382
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,420
We're done, we're dead!

1383
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:01,420
*laughter*

1384
01:00:01,420 --> 01:00:03,420
You just hear him at the end of the room saying,

1385
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,420
"Get away from me, get away! There's more people!"

1386
01:00:06,420 --> 01:00:07,620
It's over.

1387
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:08,420
Should I shoot him?

1388
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:09,420
It turned invisible.

1389
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:11,420
Oh, okay, I turned invisible then.

1390
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,920
Okay, yeah, you can turn invisible.

1391
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,420
Are we out of initiative?

1392
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,420
Yeah, you're out of initiative.

1393
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,420
Okay, yeah, I think we need to...

1394
01:00:17,420 --> 01:00:23,800
And this the only way that to go is the way that he just ran there's so there's three doors out of this room

1395
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:29,720
Okay, there's one that is walking out of the tunnel here map time map time

1396
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:36,120
You guys walked out of the tunnel, so this is you guys walking out of the tunnel here

1397
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:44,280
Hallway uh-huh this guy ran out of here uh-huh there's a door over here that leads to

1398
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,640
More there's a door over here that leads to more

1399
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,760
Okay, this one he walked in the middle

1400
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:57,200
Okay, it was also where he walked in from maybe let's go to the right side door sure right go right cool all right

1401
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:00,000
I'm by spelling. I'm not no longer a duck

1402
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:04,080
I get up, but I still try the guy still in my ass cheeks mm-hmm

1403
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,240
So dragging you see this you see a hallway when you go out another hallway, okay?

1404
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:13,920
So we're gonna go it's probably gonna go to where he's like barbarian. We also see a you also see a window over here

1405
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:19,420
Can we sneak past this door? I would just like to... who is the best sneaking?

1406
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,420
Mine is +1. My stealth is +1 as well.

1407
01:01:22,420 --> 01:01:24,420
Mine is +4. And I'm invisible.

1408
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:26,420
Roll a perception check too.

1409
01:01:26,420 --> 01:01:28,420
Can we all roll perception? You can all roll perception, yes.

1410
01:01:28,420 --> 01:01:32,420
I got an 11. I got an 8.

1411
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:36,420
I got a 21. Damn, you are noticing shit all the time.

1412
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,420
9 + 10. Yeah, 21.

1413
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:50,420
You can see, you kind of like eagle eye, look through the window, and see there's like this drop, and then one of those, um, uh, uh, sort of like, battlements I was talking about.

1414
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,420
That you could conceivably hop onto.

1415
01:01:53,420 --> 01:01:56,420
I think we hop onto there, right? I think we need to get out of-

1416
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:58,420
Alright, alright, get the hell out of Dodge!

1417
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,420
Let's go hop out of that window!

1418
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:06,420
Okay, you guys sprint down the hallway, you hear the clamber of guards in that room.

1419
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:11,100
I have an idea. Oh my god, I have an idea. Okay, because they'll still see us through the window, right?

1420
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:17,280
If yeah, I mean they come outside to get you. Well, I'm gonna let them go into the window first

1421
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:23,180
And I'm gonna go last and I'm gonna sit at the windowsill with my butt in up in the air

1422
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:24,900
So it looks like just the back of that guy

1423
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:30,140
Just looking out of the window kind of like I'm holding up his body from his head and he's just like looking out the window

1424
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:33,500
I feel like that's more suspicious than yeah, he's got an arrow through his mouth

1425
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:38,380
They didn't care that could be a pimple on the back of his head from far away. I think you're trying to get us killed

1426
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:40,180
No

1427
01:02:40,180 --> 01:02:43,040
you might be trying to get them killed okay, then I

1428
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:48,300
Hmm. I'm trying to feel like we should try and barricade this door or something all right

1429
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:50,300
I use his body to barricade the door

1430
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:54,540
You can you can yeah, you can like deposit his body from your ass in front of the door

1431
01:02:54,540 --> 01:02:56,940
Okay, and then I also nail him like

1432
01:02:56,940 --> 01:03:00,820
to the door like Jesus I'd say you have to roll a

1433
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:21,140
a

1434
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:24,140
It's a little bit, it's definitely more upsetting to see.

1435
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:27,140
Maybe I missed the frame of the door.

1436
01:03:27,140 --> 01:03:31,140
It's like you got part of his cheek, but not like, it's not a lot to go like.

1437
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:35,140
But it might, maybe it'll just make them be like, "Oh, we shouldn't fuck with these guys, they're crazy."

1438
01:03:35,140 --> 01:03:41,140
Yeah, you guys run towards the window, you see that there is this like, palisades kind of like wall out there,

1439
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:44,140
and it's leading to one of the drum towers.

1440
01:03:44,140 --> 01:03:46,140
So you guys could jump on there and run out.

1441
01:03:46,140 --> 01:03:47,140
Yeah, let's do that.

1442
01:03:47,140 --> 01:03:48,140
Yeah, okay.

1443
01:03:48,140 --> 01:03:50,140
You guys jump on there and run out.

1444
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:52,780
Where are you now in my wonderful world?

1445
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:56,500
Wonderful world.

1446
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,740
Where are you now in my wonderful world?

1447
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,780
Are we just toys to you?

1448
01:04:02,780 --> 01:04:07,220
That's a cassette tape they found in a serial killer's house.

1449
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:10,380
Where are you now in my wonderful world?

1450
01:04:10,380 --> 01:04:12,780
You'd be upset if I was a serial killer.

1451
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:13,980
I would not be, though.

1452
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:14,980
You ran out the window.

1453
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,100
That's kind of why it would be cool, though.

1454
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:19,820
So you guys get to the top of this drum tower.

1455
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:24,420
You hear clamoring coming from behind you, you hear them go "OH FUCK KEVIN!"

1456
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:26,220
And uh, um...

1457
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:28,140
I don't even care about the other guy.

1458
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,900
And uh, you are able to like,

1459
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:33,780
I mean, you're able to balance, you don't need to like balance on these towers, you know, they're walkways.

1460
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,180
There's no like, acrobatics trick or anything.

1461
01:04:36,180 --> 01:04:37,980
You get to the top of this drum tower,

1462
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,100
and this is the first time you can see the fog, really,

1463
01:04:41,100 --> 01:04:46,100
'cause now you're up high enough that you can see past the shore and on the other side and see the fog.

1464
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:49,500
And the first thing you also kind of recognize is that it reminds you of the Kaiju Manji fog.

1465
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,180
And the smoke that came from them.

1466
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,940
There is a similar kind of flavor to it.

1467
01:04:53,940 --> 01:04:55,940
It's this like white, billow-esque thing.

1468
01:04:55,940 --> 01:04:57,200
Vanilla.

1469
01:04:57,200 --> 01:04:59,200
And you also see...

1470
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,200
There is a...

1471
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:05,920
There's... Right in front of you, you can go in here and there's like sort of a spiral staircase into here.

1472
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:08,880
You can also jump down onto a smaller drum tower.

1473
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:10,880
And those are your options.

1474
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:12,880
Hmm. I...

1475
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:17,180
So you can like kind of get away further or you can go into this area and like just start

1476
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:18,720
trying to go further up the tower.

1477
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:20,720
I kind of want to keep going further up the tower.

1478
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:21,720
Okay yeah.

1479
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:22,720
Okay let's go.

1480
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,720
That's where you go in my wonderful world.

1481
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,720
It's not going to work a second time.

1482
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:29,720
Yeah that's fair.

1483
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:36,280
So you guys are in the, in this sort of like spiral area and it looks kind of, it looks

1484
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:41,400
more like the way the original tower looked, less like sort of that weird sort of like

1485
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:46,440
kind of alien look that those other lower parts of the tower looked. But it also has these

1486
01:05:46,440 --> 01:05:52,500
etchings that look otherworldly though. It looks almost like somebody's trying to depict

1487
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:57,380
something in these etchings, these wall etchings. It's like sculptures of these like birds, like

1488
01:05:57,380 --> 01:06:01,900
flying. You see the, you see sculptures of old battles between the Terrifier and the

1489
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:08,580
Policemen alongside these like feathered creatures. And as you're going up the tower you see these

1490
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:12,260
gargoyles lying inside of it.

1491
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,260
And they're pretty horrible to look at.

1492
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:24,660
They look like they were melted, but that seems to be just the way that they were made.

1493
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:25,660
It's kind of cool.

1494
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:31,020
And as you climb up this tower and you reach the top of it, you see another walkway.

1495
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:34,220
This one, though, looks like it was not intentional.

1496
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:38,300
This looks like it was a suspended bridge and you're really far up now.

1497
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:41,800
And it's through this window here.

1498
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,140
So if you walk through, you can walk through here and what you'll be reaching is the main

1499
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:46,140
tower again.

1500
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:49,380
So you've gotten pretty far now.

1501
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:52,060
And that's basically all you see, like there's nothing else here.

1502
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:57,400
There's a spiral staircase with all these ghouls and creeps.

1503
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:02,620
So to get to the main tower we have to walk through this window and through this way,

1504
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:04,620
which does not seem like it was intended to be a bridge.

1505
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:06,920
It looks like it was intended to be like a --

1506
01:07:06,920 --> 01:07:08,620
something to hold the tower.

1507
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:10,920
Can a duck fly?

1508
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,120
No.

1509
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:12,920
Really?

1510
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:14,120
Not in this universe.

1511
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:17,220
Can you -- does Chuggie have a secret airplane form?

1512
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:18,120
A helicopter.

1513
01:07:18,120 --> 01:07:19,520
That's kind of the opposite of a submarine.

1514
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:22,220
Yeah.

1515
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:23,020
No.

1516
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:23,820
He doesn't have an airplane form.

1517
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:24,520
Sorry.

1518
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:25,320
You're looking at me.

1519
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,220
No.

1520
01:07:26,220 --> 01:07:27,020
I don't think so.

1521
01:07:27,020 --> 01:07:28,020
Chuggie, do you have an airplane form?

1522
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:30,820
I mean, can we just look at this and try and gauge whether it

1523
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:31,820
would hold our weight?

1524
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:34,820
- Or like even just put a foot out on it and kind of test it.

1525
01:07:34,820 --> 01:07:35,660
- Yeah, absolutely.

1526
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,180
- Wait, how long is it?

1527
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:38,300
How long is it?

1528
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:41,380
- It's about like 45 feet across.

1529
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:42,300
It's a pretty far walk.

1530
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,700
- What if we took turns?

1531
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:44,540
- Yeah, I think we'd take turns.

1532
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:45,680
- I was gonna say, 'cause I could turn

1533
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:48,580
into my submarine form, but I would be 30 feet.

1534
01:07:48,580 --> 01:07:50,460
- Miles.

1535
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,380
- And you could walk on me.

1536
01:07:52,380 --> 01:07:54,460
- Just fall right off.

1537
01:07:54,460 --> 01:07:56,260
- Well, it would be hard to balance on is the only thing.

1538
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,460
It's not gonna be a lot.

1539
01:07:57,460 --> 01:07:59,260
- So who's heaviest?

1540
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:05,340
probably chuggy actually. I could turn into a ball and go in someone's pocket.

1541
01:08:05,340 --> 01:08:10,340
No, you could turn into a smaller guy is what you could do.

1542
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:15,340
I guess the heaviest person should go first because then everybody else can go.

1543
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:18,340
Well, I guess you're kind of a stout dwarf.

1544
01:08:18,340 --> 01:08:22,340
Because if you can make it across then we know the rest of us can no problem.

1545
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:27,340
You know what, I've been convinced I'd do it. I just start running full speed ahead.

1546
01:08:27,340 --> 01:08:30,840
A couple things. First, roll athletics.

1547
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,840
Or acrobatics, whichever one you want.

1548
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:34,840
Let me see. It's going to be acrobatics.

1549
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:37,340
Make sure you can maintain balance as best as you can.

1550
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:38,340
17.

1551
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:41,840
Nice. You're able to pretty much scale this pretty quickly.

1552
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:42,840
Alright.

1553
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:45,840
What you also hear is the distant sound of lightning and thunder.

1554
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:46,840
And rainbow.

1555
01:08:46,840 --> 01:08:48,840
And as you look...

1556
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:50,840
It's okay, I can block it with my metal shield.

1557
01:08:51,340 --> 01:09:05,340
You look up, kind of like diagonally, you're sort of your northwest, and you see this beautiful bird woman with this,

1558
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:13,340
and she looks sort of like a harpy, and you see her, and it looks like she's coming down to attack you,

1559
01:09:13,340 --> 01:09:20,840
But then you see her almost get you, lightning streaking by you, and then her shooting up

1560
01:09:20,840 --> 01:09:22,540
towards the top of the tower.

1561
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:30,340
And you see some sort of vast, like massive ghostly spirit arm swipe at her.

1562
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,900
It's like something's going on at the top of the tower.

1563
01:09:32,900 --> 01:09:33,900
And you're able to get a sense of that.

1564
01:09:33,900 --> 01:09:35,380
I want to get to the top of this tower so bad.

1565
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:39,100
Oh my god, I want to get in with that girl up there.

1566
01:09:39,100 --> 01:09:40,900
I like the hand.

1567
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:44,860
I will say that you getting that 17, you guys can just run across.

1568
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,740
There's no reason why him...

1569
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:50,860
It would break the fiction if for some reason he makes it and you guys don't.

1570
01:09:50,860 --> 01:09:51,860
I'm not gonna do that.

1571
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:52,860
Yeah, because I don't have a +1.

1572
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:53,940
Yeah, I think it's shit stupid.

1573
01:09:53,940 --> 01:09:56,100
So you guys just make it across.

1574
01:09:56,100 --> 01:09:57,100
You climb up the rest of the tower.

1575
01:09:57,100 --> 01:09:58,100
I do a cartwheel across.

1576
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,100
You do a cartwheel?

1577
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,100
Don't do this.

1578
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:01,500
I have +4 acrobatics.

1579
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:02,500
Give a mouse a cookie, right?

1580
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:03,500
Do you guys have that one?

1581
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:04,500
Give a mouse a cookie?

1582
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:05,500
Yeah.

1583
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:06,500
Okay.

1584
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,500
So you guys run across.

1585
01:10:07,500 --> 01:10:08,500
Eat for a week.

1586
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,500
I remember that old book.

1587
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:14,500
That old, old book came out years, so long ago.

1588
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,500
Did Mark Twain write that?

1589
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:17,500
I think so, yeah.

1590
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
Shut the fuck up.

1591
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,500
You guys make it across the tower.

1592
01:10:21,500 --> 01:10:25,500
Me, I like If You Give a Mouse a Bus and Starbucks Coffee.

1593
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,500
That's the one that I read.

1594
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:29,500
Damn, that's crazy.

1595
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:32,500
Kitty got claws.

1596
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:34,500
Oh my god.

1597
01:10:34,500 --> 01:10:36,500
That's fun.

1598
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,520
Yeah, you guys approach the top of the tower and you see

1599
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:47,040
The first thing you see actually is right in front of you you see an elevator

1600
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:53,380
I'm fucking new it. I knew it. Oh my god. I fucking knew it whoever designed

1601
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:56,460
this is a turd and he knows that and

1602
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:03,340
Then you see you your heads whip right as you hear the crackle thunder again, and you see

1603
01:11:03,340 --> 01:11:07,140
Sticky fingers or what's left of him?

1604
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:11,540
uh, bloody and bleeding out against the side of the wall.

1605
01:11:11,540 --> 01:11:13,540
Who's this bastard?

1606
01:11:13,540 --> 01:11:15,540
And then above you,

1607
01:11:15,540 --> 01:11:17,540
you see this,

1608
01:11:17,540 --> 01:11:19,540
this,

1609
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:21,540
oh, sticky fungus.

1610
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,540
Yeah.

1611
01:11:23,540 --> 01:11:25,540
You see this spirit that looks like

1612
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:27,540
the holy police that you guys know and love.

1613
01:11:27,540 --> 01:11:31,540
But it also seems to be morphing and changing into a beast.

1614
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,540
And also it's starting to like, sprout feathers

1615
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:35,540
and it's this spirit that is attacking

1616
01:11:35,540 --> 01:11:41,180
hacking this feathered harpy creature you're watching them fight each other

1617
01:11:41,180 --> 01:11:48,180
if you guys get in the way of this you know for certain you will die

1618
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:52,140
I'm hitting all fours

1619
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,340
hitting all fours

1620
01:11:53,340 --> 01:11:57,340
I'm trying to blend in with the other ducks up there

1621
01:11:57,340 --> 01:12:00,140
I'm still invisible there's veins popping out on my neck and forehead I'm watching

1622
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,300
I'm invisibly probably for certain I will die as I get in the middle of it

1623
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:26,220
for

1624
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:32,700
head got fucked I open up my mouth opens up like the sandworm from the clay

1625
01:12:32,700 --> 01:12:38,340
sandworm from Beetlejuice so I know where I pull I pull quadro mud marks out

1626
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:46,820
of my mouth and put it oh yeah you see sticky fingers go what marks yeah that's

1627
01:12:46,820 --> 01:12:51,460
right and it's got Petrich his head the way he died he just died he did he did

1628
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:57,500
the slump over in the eyes open thing yeah he fucking died and you see this battle

1629
01:12:57,500 --> 01:13:01,380
that is going on and you were watching the battle I've turned to them and I'm

1630
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:06,060
like so if we get in the middle that we certainly will die right unless we have

1631
01:13:06,060 --> 01:13:11,340
a bird lady and then I'm saying like hmm what if like what if we just put one arm

1632
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:17,620
just a little bit what if maybe like what if I put my finger in between me

1633
01:13:17,620 --> 01:13:19,620
- I mean, you could try, it's worth a try.

1634
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,040
- I mean, you could try.

1635
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,320
This is the most tempted I've ever made you guys probably.

1636
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:30,200
Okay, I stick, I stick.

1637
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:37,780
I do I have, do I, I do I have like rope or something?

1638
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:38,620
- What if I--

1639
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:41,340
- I would like to hold just a stick and to--

1640
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:42,420
- That arrow's still on my ass.

1641
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:44,620
- Okay, I hold, I'm holding the arrow.

1642
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,140
- Ow.

1643
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,640
I just hold the arrow to see what would happen to my finger.

1644
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:56,640
Uh, luckily for you, the arrow just bursts into flames, but you're able to drop it in time.

1645
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,640
You were about to take some serious damage.

1646
01:13:58,640 --> 01:13:59,640
Okay.

1647
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:00,640
Okay, I'm gonna cast...

1648
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:03,640
No, it's fine, 'cause I didn't take any damage, so we're probably safe to go in there.

1649
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:05,640
So maybe I should put my head in.

1650
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,140
How big is the spirit?

1651
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,640
The spirit is, like...

1652
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:12,640
It keeps changing size constantly, but it's like...

1653
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:14,140
And it's fighting what exactly?

1654
01:14:14,140 --> 01:14:15,140
This, like, harpy.

1655
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:18,540
- What's like the maximum size you would think it would be?

1656
01:14:18,540 --> 01:14:21,900
- When you see it get particularly enraged

1657
01:14:21,900 --> 01:14:26,780
and like cast some gruesome spells, it gets like 60 feet.

1658
01:14:26,780 --> 01:14:28,500
- So it's outside of the tower?

1659
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,100
- It's like in the tower and also like among it

1660
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:33,220
'cause it's like kind of phasing through it at the same time.

1661
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:35,620
- Okay, it's like jumping in and out of the, okay.

1662
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:36,460
- Yeah, it's like kind of like--

1663
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:37,300
- And why are they fighting?

1664
01:14:37,300 --> 01:14:38,820
- Are we on top like open air?

1665
01:14:38,820 --> 01:14:39,660
Are we inside a room?

1666
01:14:39,660 --> 01:14:41,380
- You're like on the stairs that are like

1667
01:14:41,380 --> 01:14:42,740
kind of moving up towards the tower.

1668
01:14:42,740 --> 01:14:44,060
You're like kind of like looking out

1669
01:14:44,060 --> 01:14:45,060
and seeing this from the very top.

1670
01:14:45,060 --> 01:14:46,660
- But this is happening on the top.

1671
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:47,500
- They're flying on the top.

1672
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,320
- They're outside.

1673
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:49,160
- They're on the top, yeah, outside.

1674
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:51,440
- Okay, and so he sticks his thing basically

1675
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:54,000
above the threshold of the floor from the stairwell.

1676
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,960
He sticks the stick out and it bursts into flames.

1677
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:58,840
- Okay, I use thaumaturgy to make my voice

1678
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:01,640
boom up to three times as loud as normal for one minute.

1679
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:03,740
I say, "What's going on?"

1680
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,640
- Okay.

1681
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:11,280
Yeah, the harpy first whips her head towards you,

1682
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,260
makes direct eye contact with you.

1683
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,220
I pee my pants.

1684
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:16,060
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1685
01:15:16,060 --> 01:15:18,500
I cast major image and I,

1686
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:22,740
so it's his voice, but it's like the image

1687
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:25,300
of Quadro Mudmarks, I guess.

1688
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,220
Oh.

1689
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:28,460
Like a giant version?

1690
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:31,140
Yeah, like a 20 foot Quadro Mudmarks

1691
01:15:31,140 --> 01:15:32,700
'cause it's the highest I can make it.

1692
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,540
All right, yeah.

1693
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:34,980
She sees that.

1694
01:15:34,980 --> 01:15:39,980
She turns her head and her eyes get like ferocious.

1695
01:15:41,260 --> 01:15:43,260
like, going to attack this thing.

1696
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:48,260
And then, *poof*, like, she just gets fuckin' whapped to shit by this spirit.

1697
01:15:48,260 --> 01:15:55,260
And you see her fuckin' sail across and crash into one of the- crash into the spiral tower you just came from.

1698
01:15:55,260 --> 01:16:02,260
And you see the spirit and it looks to you and it gives you- all three of you- it gives you like a knowing nod.

1699
01:16:02,260 --> 01:16:04,260
And you see the little police cap and it tips it to you.

1700
01:16:04,260 --> 01:16:06,260
*sniff sniff sniff sniff*

1701
01:16:06,260 --> 01:16:08,260
And it phases into the tower.

1702
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:11,260
And you see the harpy fall to her death.

1703
01:16:11,260 --> 01:16:15,060
[laughter]

1704
01:16:15,060 --> 01:16:18,260
What the hell are we doing, man?

1705
01:16:18,260 --> 01:16:20,260
You guys have made it to the top of the tower, and...

1706
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,260
You...

1707
01:16:22,260 --> 01:16:24,760
You've never seen the fog up close,

1708
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:30,260
but seeing it now, it is clear that it is the same fog that followed the kaiju manji a bit further, amazingly.

1709
01:16:30,260 --> 01:16:33,260
You see the faint glow coming from a spire that's just above the fog,

1710
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:37,600
So you're looking out at this vast field of the fog that is like the other side of the world

1711
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,460
From what you can tell or where the world should end

1712
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:46,780
It seems impossibly far away a miracle you could see something like that from where you stand, you know

1713
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:51,460
You don't know this but the curvature of the earth should prevent you from seeing this

1714
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:54,700
As you observe the fog and the spire across from you

1715
01:16:54,700 --> 01:17:00,620
Your sense of place begins to waver across a flat expanse the fog no longer sits, but doesn't move either

1716
01:17:01,220 --> 01:17:09,380
Or it's not it's not rolling forward. It's in a smoky stasis shifting its position in relation to you roll perception all three of you

1717
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:14,780
Great 121 13

1718
01:17:14,780 --> 01:17:19,280
Crit 1 yeah, and what'd you get?

1719
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:26,520
13 and 13 I'm standing I'm Stan. There's like one cloud. That's complete. I'm lost in a cloud

1720
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:31,700
Completely I'm like a lot clipping in a video game cloud and my whole vision is white yeah

1721
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:36,860
What you do notice is that when you look behind and around you whatever landmarks you registered appear to be moving away

1722
01:17:36,860 --> 01:17:43,680
The effect is not unlike a dolly zoom a shift in perspective that you were experiencing potentially literally you

1723
01:17:43,680 --> 01:17:47,800
Evil steve-o who's been on his perception game this session?

1724
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:49,800
Mm-hmm you also notice that

1725
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:55,100
When you look away from the fog the movement of those landmarks seems to decelerate as if you're resisting a pole

1726
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:02,640
In all this the tower from across the way remains exactly in its implacable spot even as you feel the world around you shift further and

1727
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:05,940
The fog closer that tower remains fixed

1728
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:11,820
You observe the land around you again all the landmarks continue to move further from you however

1729
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:18,140
They also begin to look like smears of earth, so you're kind of like drifting into this non moving fog

1730
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:20,140
I'm looking at it with my ass

1731
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,400
(laughing)

1732
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:25,380
- Backwards.

1733
01:18:25,380 --> 01:18:27,040
That's why I'm so perceptive.

1734
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:30,420
- And you can now make out the details of the tower.

1735
01:18:30,420 --> 01:18:31,680
You see on that tower in the distance,

1736
01:18:31,680 --> 01:18:33,840
not only that in place of mud mark,

1737
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,840
not only that it's you, it's you there, all three of you.

1738
01:18:36,840 --> 01:18:39,440
You see yourselves in that tower.

1739
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,920
You also see in place of mud marks,

1740
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,640
a frog whose vacant, sweet, and receptive gaze

1741
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:45,740
begets an unperverted masochism.

1742
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:48,360
You know way too well.

1743
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:49,200
It's Sullivan.

1744
01:18:49,200 --> 01:18:54,200
You feel within you the unshakable present fight to be redefined.

1745
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:57,200
Something is pulling at you from a void in your gut.

1746
01:18:57,200 --> 01:19:00,200
This is no longer just a reconfiguration of Vistas. This is real.

1747
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:05,200
You are going to that tower if you want to surrender to the fog.

1748
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,200
So yeah, I... well, so here's my thing.

1749
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:11,200
Is that I got such a bad perception roll that I can't even see...

1750
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:16,200
I don't even know that there's the option to go back to the sub within.

1751
01:19:16,200 --> 01:19:19,000
- I think that Evil Stevel just died.

1752
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,240
I think he just walked off the tower and fell and died.

1753
01:19:22,240 --> 01:19:25,120
I'm like, damn, that's really sad.

1754
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,840
I guess we should go back to that magic academy, huh Chuggy?

1755
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,300
- Yeah, I guess we gotta go back

1756
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:32,000
and talk to Condoleezza Cartlow.

1757
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,280
- All right, well let's just go do that then.

1758
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,720
I thought there was gonna be something

1759
01:19:34,720 --> 01:19:36,720
at the top of this tower, I really did.

1760
01:19:36,720 --> 01:19:39,560
- Evil, evil, evil, evil.

1761
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:43,660
- You are in, I don't wanna describe too much.

1762
01:19:43,660 --> 01:19:45,400
What I am gonna say is you are among

1763
01:19:45,400 --> 01:19:47,440
the kissing continents

1764
01:19:47,440 --> 01:19:49,940
with Sullivan the frog

1765
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:54,120
and two versions of your friends that we will one day-

1766
01:19:54,120 --> 01:19:57,080
I realize that I'm just alone with Sullivan

1767
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:58,680
and they didn't come with me

1768
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:00,080
and I do a full Vader just-

1769
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:03,640
NOOOOOO!

1770
01:20:03,640 --> 01:20:06,640
(Sullivan screams)

1771
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,340
(laughter)

1772
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:10,840
- You also, Sullivan also, on his knees

1773
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:11,680
looking at the sky.

1774
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:12,520
- But he's saying hi.

1775
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:13,340
- Yeah.

1776
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:14,180
(Sullivan screams)

1777
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:15,220
(laughter)

1778
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,420
- That was your Sullivan voice?

1779
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,260
- Yeah.

1780
01:20:17,260 --> 01:20:20,080
(Sullivan screams)

1781
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:20,920
- Yeah, like that.

1782
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:24,180
- I didn't wanna do a dead disservice.

1783
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,060
- Thanks.

1784
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:28,220
Anyway, so Evil Steevel is--

1785
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,460
- In our minds, he's dead.

1786
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:31,460
- Evil Steevel, from what you guys can tell,

1787
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:32,700
he just like, is gone.

1788
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:33,540
- Yeah.

1789
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:38,800
what has happened to countless people who've approached the fog, we will one day return

1790
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,340
to the adventures of Duck-Ass Thievel and figure out what's happening there.

1791
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:46,180
What a way to go out.

1792
01:20:46,180 --> 01:20:49,180
For Dogen, both of his friends died now.

1793
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:51,540
He's basically the most depressed and anxious guy on earth.

1794
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:52,540
So we'll see what happens.

1795
01:20:52,540 --> 01:20:55,660
He has to hang out with a submarine.

1796
01:20:55,660 --> 01:20:58,940
Well yeah, you guys head back to Condoleezza Marlow then.

1797
01:20:58,940 --> 01:20:59,940
Okay, well yeah.

1798
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:02,540
- Yeah, so you guys, that elevator,

1799
01:21:02,540 --> 01:21:03,780
you can take that elevator,

1800
01:21:03,780 --> 01:21:06,740
it brings you all the way down to that room.

1801
01:21:06,740 --> 01:21:07,900
- Yep, I knew it.

1802
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:08,740
Yeah, the little thing you couldn't get into.

1803
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,660
- There were actually, there's actually a lot of stuff,

1804
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:13,060
but you guys already cleared out stuff,

1805
01:21:13,060 --> 01:21:14,020
so we're gonna move on.

1806
01:21:14,020 --> 01:21:16,820
There's actually a lot more awesome stuff, as always.

1807
01:21:16,820 --> 01:21:19,940
- Okay, there's always a lot of awesome stuff.

1808
01:21:19,940 --> 01:21:20,780
- I'm sorry.

1809
01:21:20,780 --> 01:21:22,100
- That's what I would say too if I were you.

1810
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:23,340
- Yeah.

1811
01:21:23,340 --> 01:21:24,420
- Okay, what's up, sorry.

1812
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,860
- So we're going back.

1813
01:21:25,860 --> 01:21:26,700
- Yeah.

1814
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:27,620
- We're about, we're.

1815
01:21:27,620 --> 01:21:29,100
- Yeah, you're gonna have to, yeah, okay.

1816
01:21:29,100 --> 01:21:34,300
Yeah, the cave is fine, it's gone, you guys can get back inside Chuggy and like, or sorry,

1817
01:21:34,300 --> 01:21:40,240
Jogan and Mudmarks can get back inside Chuggy and just go back to all the way up the river.

1818
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:41,820
Back to Port Lowe's Prairie Berry.

1819
01:21:41,820 --> 01:21:44,300
Wait, wait, wait.

1820
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:48,980
While we're in the river, I don't know the rules of Chuggy, okay?

1821
01:21:48,980 --> 01:21:54,340
And I just saw my other best friend die and I'm really depressed and I want to fucking

1822
01:21:54,340 --> 01:21:55,340
kill myself.

1823
01:21:55,340 --> 01:22:04,340
I'm like, "Chuggy, I just wanna die. Will you just turn back into your human form and kill me right now? Just crush my body? Just fucking..."

1824
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,340
Um, say like, uh...

1825
01:22:06,340 --> 01:22:13,340
You're like, "I just need to hear one of CutiePopstar's... Mr. CutiePopstar's great songs."

1826
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:20,340
I just need to hear one of CutiePopstar's beautiful songs right now, and I just need something to pick me up, 'cause I wanna fucking die.

1827
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,340
Anything for my best friend!

1828
01:22:23,340 --> 01:22:24,340
Don't say that, though.

1829
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:27,340
All right, I'm gonna turn into him right no

1830
01:22:27,340 --> 01:22:31,500
Chuggie turns back into you a person while

1831
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:38,180
Well dog it's inside of him, but don't get a bum arches and you just I guess explode I

1832
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:41,100
I've I turn into ribbons of meat

1833
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:47,280
My eyes turn into goo. I like all that's it's like it's like you

1834
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:51,500
Like you look when you pop the balloon and like smash

1835
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Like the, do-do-do-do!

1836
01:22:53,500 --> 01:22:56,500
- Yes. - It opens up with all of my guts.

1837
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,500
- Oh. - I float into the, I do like a free-willy

1838
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:03,500
jump into the air, and then just all of my guts open up,

1839
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:07,500
and all the hands is toking and mud marks just plop into the water

1840
01:23:07,500 --> 01:23:10,500
like a shit. - And I'm just carried by the river

1841
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,500
all the way back. - And you see there, Sherman is there.

1842
01:23:13,500 --> 01:23:15,500
- You're floating on mud marks. - And Sherman is there.

1843
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,500
- Like a lazy river. - No, you're holding him like

1844
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:20,500
Aaron Brockovich, you know, like, you're just walking by yourself

1845
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:25,540
by yourself with mud marks on your hip like a baby and Sherman Sherman goes

1846
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:32,180
because oh god are you all right where the other two come come come and he

1847
01:23:32,180 --> 01:23:37,660
leads you back through town back Oh to the tower where you see it on mud marks

1848
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:43,460
revived not yet okay to Condoleezza Carlo who is watching the ships crash into

1849
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:47,620
each other and smiling to himself he turns around he sees he says you've made

1850
01:23:47,620 --> 01:23:52,620
it back oh what happened to your friends

1851
01:23:52,620 --> 01:24:01,540
that's too bad um can you just any plops you down to sit there it's possible

1852
01:24:01,540 --> 01:24:06,340
down pops you down in a chair and he points his finger at your head and he

1853
01:24:06,340 --> 01:24:16,500
just extracts everything you saw and he just goes oh oh yes he's dead and then

1854
01:24:16,500 --> 01:24:19,060
And then you see his face go white, and he's like,

1855
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,480
"Oh, that's bad."

1856
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:23,560
- Well, I guess I better tell the Academy.

1857
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,540
You, congratulations, are gonna be

1858
01:24:25,540 --> 01:24:27,420
an adjunct professor next year.

1859
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:28,260
- Woo-hoo!

1860
01:24:28,260 --> 01:24:29,440
(laughing)

1861
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,940
- We're gonna get you right to the Academy,

1862
01:24:30,940 --> 01:24:32,620
and you're gonna start your magical adventure.

1863
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:33,460
- I'm dancing.

1864
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:36,320
- I hope you find two new best friends.

1865
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,700
- You're so alone.

1866
01:24:37,700 --> 01:24:38,540
- Yeah.

1867
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,380
- Oh my God.

1868
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,200
(laughing)

1869
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:41,040
Just like walking in the rain.

1870
01:24:41,040 --> 01:24:41,880
- But I'm happy now.

1871
01:24:41,880 --> 01:24:42,700
I was like, woo-hoo.

1872
01:24:42,700 --> 01:24:45,260
- But your friends, all your friends have died.

1873
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:48,740
It's actually, yeah. I say, I say, okay, I say I do, I do Homer Simpson,

1874
01:24:48,740 --> 01:24:51,580
WooHoo instantly when I find out I'm going to be an adjunct professor.

1875
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:55,380
And then immediately after that, no transition at all. I'm, uh,

1876
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,660
Freddie got fingered. Nobody knows my troubles with God scene.

1877
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:03,100
Walking to the school with rain, it's raining. I'm completely soaking wet.

1878
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,860
You're walking through the underground tunnel that he has. Yeah.

1879
01:25:05,860 --> 01:25:08,660
You hear that song. It's raining in the tunnel. It's raining inside the tunnel.

1880
01:25:08,660 --> 01:25:11,380
It's raining. He says, it just fit the mood. I don't know what to tell you.

1881
01:25:11,380 --> 01:25:13,740
I made it that way. Yeah. You're just walking through.

1882
01:25:14,260 --> 01:25:16,740
And next time, we'll perhaps see that.

1883
01:25:16,740 --> 01:25:20,500
Perhaps we'll head over to wherever Sullivan and Stievel are.

1884
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:24,020
- But we definitely won't be going wherever Chuggy went.

1885
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:26,860
- Chuggy has turned into the meat confectioner.

1886
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,100
- Chuggy actually died.

1887
01:25:28,100 --> 01:25:32,100
- Yes, Chuggy is the only person who's really, really died.

1888
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:34,820
- We're introducing the trebuchet,

1889
01:25:34,820 --> 01:25:35,780
we're starting to fracture things.

1890
01:25:35,780 --> 01:25:36,900
- It's like Pokemon.

1891
01:25:36,900 --> 01:25:39,420
- It's like Pokemon, red and blue.

1892
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:40,260
- We have red and blue.

1893
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:43,300
- And who knows, maybe one day Stievel and Duggan

1894
01:25:43,300 --> 01:25:44,140
may meet again.

1895
01:25:44,140 --> 01:25:48,140
They might, there is, I mean there's, they might, I'm not gonna say it.

1896
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,140
Oh my god, this timeline has turned into Kingdom Hearts.

1897
01:25:50,140 --> 01:25:53,140
I'm not gonna say it's not Kingdom Hearts.

1898
01:25:53,140 --> 01:25:56,140
It's completely turned into Kingdom Hearts.

1899
01:25:56,140 --> 01:25:57,140
Holy shit.

1900
01:25:57,140 --> 01:25:59,140
Kingdom Hearts!

1901
01:25:59,140 --> 01:26:02,140
It was really good.

1902
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,140
Thank you.

1903
01:26:03,140 --> 01:26:05,140
Alright.

1904
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:06,140
I love Billy Zane.

1905
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:07,140
Alright.

1906
01:26:07,140 --> 01:26:08,140
Okay.

1907
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,140
Goodnight everyone.

1908
01:26:09,140 --> 01:26:10,140
Goodnight.

1909
01:26:10,140 --> 01:26:11,140
Wow.

1910
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:28,860
Well, it's been kind of weird being stuck in this void, realms deep, you know, after having

1911
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:37,940
sort of a strange, or a death experience inside the Terrify Realm, but it's been nice getting

1912
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:38,940
to know you.

1913
01:26:38,940 --> 01:26:43,300
You're a good kid.

1914
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:50,100
I hope that one day, I don't know when, but I hope one day you get to meet your real dad

1915
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:58,340
and can experience the world because it's not so bad, you know?

1916
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:02,300
It can be kind of harsh, but it looks like I gotta go.

1917
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:04,940
Looks like I'm being called back into something else.

1918
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:08,220
I don't know what it is, but I hope I'll see you there.

1919
01:27:08,220 --> 01:27:09,220
Doug?

1920
01:27:09,220 --> 01:27:14,220
And it's not Doug Stiebel, right?

1921
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:16,220
Nope, it's just Doug.

1922
01:27:16,220 --> 01:27:19,220
And one day I'm gonna get out of this.

1923
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:22,220
Get out of this void and meet my dad.

1924
01:27:22,220 --> 01:27:26,220
I don't know what I'm gonna do when I do, though.

1925
01:27:26,220 --> 01:27:28,220
Whoa, I'm getting pulled away now to the void!

1926
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:30,220
Out of the void now!

1927
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,220
Whoa!

1928
01:27:31,220 --> 01:27:32,220
What is that tower?

1929
01:27:32,220 --> 01:27:33,220
Whoa!

1930
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,220
Whoa, that's crazy!

1931
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,220
Goodbye!

1932
01:27:36,220 --> 01:27:37,220
Goodbye, Doug!

1933
01:27:37,220 --> 01:27:41,220
Goodbye! I hope you get... where are we going safe?

1934
01:27:41,220 --> 01:27:46,220
Thanks! I hope your dad remembers you! Goodbye!

1935
01:27:46,220 --> 01:27:50,220
I hope he remembers me too.
