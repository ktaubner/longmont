00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,500
You're a crap monster.

Congratulations.

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:17,820
Congratulations, Joe Biden.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,580
We always knew you could do it.

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,300
We never doubted you, and we never

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,460
recorded anything else otherwise.

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,100
Now we knew you were going to win.

10
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,060
We have never said that you weren't going to win.

11
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,220
We never said that--

12
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,700
We never said anything bad about you.

13
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,580
Yeah, we never said that you're like the worst candidate we could have thrown up, you're the

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,420
worst candidate that could ever exist.

15
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:46,260
We never said that if you lose it's entirely the fault of you and it's not, it's the entirety

16
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,260
of the fault of the Democratic Party.

17
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:52,220
We never said in the set we from, we don't rep, no Joe Biden, we didn't say that.

18
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,420
I never said that.

19
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,300
We never said that.

20
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,340
I've never said anything mean about you.

21
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,140
I've never said anything bad about the DNC.

22
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,140
And...

23
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
I knew you were always gonna win.

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,780
Dude, if he wins, I'm just in jail right now.

25
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,780
That's true.

26
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:05,780
Yeah.

27
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,780
Fuck.

28
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,260
I'm like literally in jail.

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,260
That's true.

30
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,700
That's why we're recording this the day before, because if he wins, I go to jail.

31
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,880
He has won.

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,460
He won, and I'm recording this from jail right now over a phone.

33
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:20,460
God damn, dude.

34
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,460
Oh, what's up?

35
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,460
What's up, man?

36
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,460
You look good.

37
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,460
God damn, I hate jail.

38
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,460
Hey, man.

39
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,460
Oh, what's up?

40
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,140
You're fucking fine as hell.

41
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,780
Jail sucks so bad, dude.

42
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:33,660
What are they feeding you in there?

43
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,620
I'm fucking toilet paper holes.

44
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:36,620
Yeah?

45
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,100
Yeah, the holes in the rolls of the toilet paper.

46
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,740
Do you think he'll go to jail if he wins?

47
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,220
Not for anything I've done before he won.

48
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,220
Yeah?

49
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,940
Yeah, but probably for something else.

50
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,900
Or, I mean, now that he's won.

51
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,580
Now that he's won, I might go- Here's all I'm gonna say to those who are listening that

52
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,780
this might be pertinent information to.

53
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,780
I might go to jail. I might do something and go to jail.

54
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,280
No, I'm kidding. I guess we have to explain it. We're recording

55
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:11,040
this on election Tuesday. Or selection Tuesday as I like to call it because you select your

56
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,840
vote. You've had a new one for every time we've

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,980
recorded this. That's so true. I wrote it down. That's my thing.

58
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,140
Whoa. I mean, what do you mean every time? This is

59
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:28,380
the only one recording. Yeah. But so yeah Joe Biden won. Yeah. The first president named

60
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:32,260
Joe Biden in the history of United States University. How about you come to my, hey

61
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:37,540
buddy, let's chop it up, we'll talk it over, you come to my storage unit in rural North

63
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:49,460
don't. Let's just hang out, you know. Just hash it out. Just squash the beef. Yeah. I

64
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,780
I think that's the thing. I think now that he's president, I think finally we can squash a beef

65
00:02:55,780 --> 00:03:00,980
with him. Yeah, I mean, because we've been beefing since, I mean... I mean, we have, we have, there's

66
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:08,580
common ground here, you know what I mean? Yeah. Like, I mean, we're, we're both like awesome,

67
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:16,660
like rap style white guys. That's true. Yeah. You know, we're like, I don't know, amazing speakers.

69
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:27,060
Yeah, that's a huge one. See, we have more in common than we have not in common.

70
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,180
Yeah, I mean, the only thing you guys don't have in common is that your name and

71
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:35,060
who wants to do what to who. And you're six feet tall and I'm, you know,

72
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,340
five eleven and a half. Modest.

Yeah, we're the same height. Five eleven and three quarters. Almost six feet.

00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,720
yeah that's right yeah I got some suction in there. It looks like it was playing in reverse.

106
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,120
That's why I'm the most popular guy in prison. It looked like two pill bugs being

born out of a monkey. Dude I saw a chimp's ass the other day. Yeah. Yeah yours. It's got

112
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,600
doing political. I think Joe Biden's ass probably looks like a chimps ass. I think

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,700
I think he should have to show his ass. He's got like Santa's beard on his hole. He should have to show

114
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,640
his ass and his pussy now that he's president. You should have to if you

115
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:42,000
want to run for president you should have to get like just fucking absolutely

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:54,520
humiliated sexually. You know what I mean? Like just like, like there should every candidate, if you want to run you have to fucking just like. There's a video of you just getting your balls

117

00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,640
We should get to eat Joe Biden's pussy dudes if we vote for him.

121
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,440
No I don't think we should.

122
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,920
I think there should be a video though.

123
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,040
Can you imagine?

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:16,480

I mean, I want, I want somebody to do to Joe Biden what that monkey does to that frog in that video.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,400
No. That's what should happen.

168
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,900
No, I don't know if we can say that now that he's president.

169
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,600
Yeah. No, you can.

170
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,100
No. Oh, I can. I'm already in jail.

171
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,700
What's that mean? I'm already here, so it doesn't really matter.

172
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,700
Yeah, we can't say that. No, you guys are fine.

173
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,000
But I don't know. I feel like that'd be a great, like,

174
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Be a good reality show.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,300
Also, it's a reality show. I forgot that part.

176
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Right, and that's the thing. That's the thing.

177
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,800
And it's exactly like The Batchelor, but it's OG Mudbone deciding the president

178
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,100
based on who can fucking take it the hardest.

179
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,020
Yeah who takes it presidentially. Yeah. And he's such a good

180
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,980
presenter too because he looks at the camera goes like yeah

181
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:17,860
you know he does that stuff. Exactly dude I want fucking

182
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:21,380
god by the time the general comes around everybody's gonna be fucking wearing

183
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,540
eye patches and shit. The general? General. The car insurance?

184
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:29,140
From the car insurance. He should have to fuck up. Oh my god yes.

185
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,820
to decide. Because then there's the thing because during COVID and everything. OG Mudboat in a

186
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:40,020
mocap suit just fucking the shit out of someone. Yeah and especially because of COVID his penis

187
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:46,260
will be at least long enough that they could social distance. True. And I think having the

188
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:52,420
general in there too I think adding the layer of CGI. The general watches. CGI people can't get COVID.

189
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:58,820
Yeah. That's a really good point. Yeah. As long as they stop making those like

190
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,220
those diagrams yeah that's true they can get it from that 3d they gotta stop

191
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:09,540
doing the 3d models yeah the CNN breaking news 3d model of the virus that actually

192
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:13,860
the general can get and then he would be wouldn't be able to fuck just seeing

193
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:18,460
that their their 3d model of the virus just float off screen and come back

194
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:24,820
during during a Geico commercial just kill the Geico. No no no what are you doing?

195
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
What are you doing? What's that? Oh, what's that? What are you doing, chap?

196
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,540

Hey here's a Michael Bolton song that describes Joe Biden when a man loves a woman.

221
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,840
Jack Sparrow with the Lonely Island.

222
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:33,080
That's right because Joe Biden gave a few visits to a certain lonely island.

223
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,720
Yeah, that's fucking right.

224
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:36,720

232
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
[music]

233
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't turn it off.

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,320
Is there no stop option?

235
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,920
The pause button isn't working.

236
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I have to reload the page.

237
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,520
All right, I won't click to listen to sample then.

238
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
Thank you for warning me.

239
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
The pause button worked for me.

240
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Dude, Google Chrome hates me and loves my Google.

241
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,600
Caleb doesn't have the capability to pause.

242
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,600
It's true.

243
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
I see two lines, dude.

244
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:18,320
I start fucking zoning out thinking about the heroes we lost on September 11th.

245
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,760
Every time I see a pause button, I refuse to touch it.

246
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Yeah.

247
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,120
Number two is tears in heaven.

248
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,860
I don't know how this relates to Joe Biden at all.

249
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:27,360
You tripping if you think that.

250
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,960
Yeah, his son.

251
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Because his son died?

252
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,960
His son died.

253
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,820
I think that that's a stretch. I think that, yeah, it's about a dead son.

254
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:40,900
Yeah, Eric Clapton's son smoked crack too.

255
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,200
Yeah, that's why he jumped out that window.

256
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,460
Yeah.

257
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,460
He was just bugging, dude.

258
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,620
He tripped on that video of the guy smoking salve and then falling out the window.

259
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,620
That's Eric Clapton's kid.

260
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,260
That's Eric Clapton's son, yeah.

261
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,260
Very unlucky, Eric Clapton.

262
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,100
Yeah. Just raise your son better.

263
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Seriously.

264
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:07,620
Number 3, Crazy by Gnarls Barkley.

265
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:08,620
Hey.

266
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,620
Yeah.

267
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,620
Hey.

268
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,620
Whoa.

269
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:14,820
I mean this is an all-timer of a list already, dude.

270
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,820
Yeah, already.

271
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,820
I mean-

272
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,300
Already we're all float on.

273
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,980
They should put that on this list because then it would be a classic.

274
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,860
Well it's Gnarls Barkley because he perfectly blends sort of like indie sensibility with

275
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,140
like hip hop roots.

276
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,320
Which is exactly what Joe Biden does.

277
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,940
what I mean yeah he's kind of the perfect like kind of cross-section of those two

278
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,080
worlds yeah and he says crazy yeah and also he's yeah and he's well also we

279
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:48,000
could read this as as him being like kind of guilty of the same stuff CeeLo's

280
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,320
guilty of right I guess that could be. Yeah, dressing up in a big gold suit yeah

281
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:59,320
being a cool robot. Dressing like a robot yeah. Having his Samsung Galaxy explode.

282
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:04,720
Gnarly Davidson that's the name that's his uh that's the his name when he dresses up

283
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,640
in the gold suit. Oh. Yeah he said it's a different persona he says he claims it's

284
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:14,100
not him well he's like what you saw was not CeeLo Green that was Gnarly

285
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,200
Davidson. Yeah Gnarly Davidson was one slipping those things in those women's

286
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:27,520
streaks it was not CeeLo Green. Goddamn dude. That one definitely came out of nowhere. Yeah.

287
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:36,960
The CeeLo allegations. I was really like, he's like fucking 4'11 and like 700 pounds. I feel

288
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:45,280
like that's usually a good guy. You know? I can't think of many evil small people. Really.

289
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,280
at this what about a gnome look at it all back look at this picture and tell me

290
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:57,160
that the you're saying this guy doesn't seem that evil but but but look at this

291
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:06,360
okay click on this link okay save for this is the evil part of him yeah yeah

292
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:12,160
this is the guy who did everything bad CeeLo could never just search gnarly

293
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:16,120
davidson guys on and google images you haven't seen it's the picture with him

294
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:21,200
with red and purple glowing lights on his head this is his like mr. Hyde you know

295
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:29,560
yeah yeah number number four is liar by bikini kill that's kind of a lazy one

296
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:33,480
if I'm that's a very lazy one because there's because I feel like liar by a

297
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:40,840
bikini kill is a very feminist band I don't know what's it is song titles

298
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,920
so yeah that's true that is true I guess it's not the content of the song and I

299
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,880
guess we have to go back to tears in heaven and say and that one just doesn't

300
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:53,800
make any sense at all yeah that one really is if you're not considering

301
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,640
content I guess his son is crying in heaven because he's dead there's nothing

302
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,280
about a son about in the in the name right out of context it just makes no

303
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:09,120
sense so I declare Murph creator of this list I'm declaring you idiot of the week

304
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,860
I'm calling you out.

305
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,300
Murph you dumb as hell.

306
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,720
I don't know who won the election but I know Murph lost.

307
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,520
You know who won the election was Joe Biden.

308
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,520
It was Joe Biden.

309
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
It's again, it's so difficult.

310
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,820
Yeah it is tough.

311
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:27,840
I would be the world's worst time traveler.

312
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,120
I'd be so stuck in the day that I left apparently.

313
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:38,000
Just getting sent to future jail for being white.

314
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,920
Kanye West is weird as fuck.

315
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,040
- And is being like,

316
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,500
we don't even know if this actually happened yet.

317
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,560
- Number six, creepy smell.

318
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,420
- You skipped number five, where's my mind, Pixies.

319
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,960
- Number five, where's my mind, Pixies.

320
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,080
- Oh, that's 'cause he's from Delaware,

321
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,880
and in Fight Club, if you remember,

322
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,200
they go to Delaware and they blow up all those buildings.

323
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,520
- Yeah, in Project Mayhem.

324
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,040
- Yeah, that's the only reason that that is on that list.

325
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,900
- Yep, all right, now we can go to number six,

326
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:14,540
creepy smell by the smelvins. This one's clever. Yeah, he's a sniffer right? Yeah.

327
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:20,420

339
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,060
those size 17 shoes.

340
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,420
He's packing his shoes.

341
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:19,100
You know he's got long toes that look like fingers.

342
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,100
That's right.

343
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,860
You know what they say about a guy with big shoes.

344
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:28,340
And he holds his feet together like hands.

345
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,340

Yeah, why? It's over.

354
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:50,340

00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,340
No, that was the last one.

356
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,340
Celebrating Joe Biden's will.

357
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,340
Either way, Antifa is taking the stand.

358
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,340
They're winning at some point.

359
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:05,300
Yeah, either if Trump won yeah, do you think if I still wins if Biden wins antifa if by it will bite him one and now

Yeah, dude earlier today at freaking antifa thug was celebrating and he tried to throw

362
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:19,020
He tried to throw in a rainbow latte through my window and I couldn't see his face as or his identity because he was wearing

363
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:22,060
A damn infinity scarf. Oh my god. I

364
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,940
Luckily, I got a good look at his eyes though because he was wearing glasses with no lenses

365
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:34,020
Oh my god. It is nice that this is, if Biden wins today, the coronavirus is just gone.

366
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:39,700
Yeah, it's gone. It is gone. And Bella and Sebastian, the leaders of Antifa, are gonna make a great album.

367
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,340
Mm-hmm, that's right. Yeah.

368
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,580
Yep.

369
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,020
Number eight, "Been Caught Stealin'" by Jane's Addiction.

370
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:47,980
I don't get this one.

371
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,300
Joe Biden's...

372
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,580
Oh, he steals your hearts.

373
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:54,820
Yeah. He's a fucking smooth Casanova.

374
00:21:54,820 --> 00:22:01,820
Yeah, they call him Joe Casanova. They do. They call him Joey Smoove. Like J.B. Smoove.

375
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:13,820
Yep. J.B. Smoove. He's eating something. He's eating something. Listen Barry. Listen Barry.

376

He's J.B. Smoove dude. He is. I would love a J.B. Smoove presidency. Me too man. Yeah.

377
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,740
There are so many celebrities that I want to be president.

378
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:24,740
Yeah.

379
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:27,660
And it sucks that we already got our number one last year.

380
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,900
I can't believe it was Donald Trump that was the celebrity president.

381
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,300
We couldn't have like...

382
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,300
Mario.

383
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,300
Yeah.

384
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
Yeah.

385
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,460
Mario wasn't easy.

386
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,900
He's not an American citizen.

387
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
Well, he's not naturalized.

388
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,900
I mean, neither was Obama.

389
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
It's fine.

390
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,900
It's true.

391
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
Yeah.

392
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,900
Obama was from Italy too.

393
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,900
Yeah.

394
00:22:47,900 --> 00:23:02,900

395
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:20,900

00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Yeah, very bad. Don't want 'em. I want Flo.

397
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,900
We need Flo. Please, I need Flo.

398
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,900
I need Flo. I need Flo in my life.

399
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,900
Number 9, Dumb by Nirvana. Ohhhh.

400
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,900
They went there. They went there. It's a comment from Stuart that says

401
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,900
"accurate and I despise most of Nirvana's music. The rest is either

402
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:48,900
just bad or okay." What the fuck, Stuart? What are you talking about?

403
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:52,420
Kurt Cobain didn't blow his brains out for you.

404
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,420
Yeah.

405
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,420
Freak.

406
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Yeah, we love Kurt Cobain.

407
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,420
Mm-hmm.

408
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:00,180
Kurt Cobain, you can come on whenever you want after the surgery fixes you.

409
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:02,900
Kurt Cobangz, you can also come on.

410
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
Mm-hmm.

411
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,900
Yeah.

412
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,900
Much respect to Kurt Cobangz.

413
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,900
We're gonna sing with Kurt Cobangz.

414
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,900
My brain is stuck in the 2013 XXL Freshman Cypher for the rest of my life.

415
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,900
Yeah.

416
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,460
It's just me and Kurt Cobangz rappin'.

417
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,260
Who else was in the 2013 one?

00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,260
Me.

419
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:47,980

00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,580

421
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Yeah.

422
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
Oh my god.

423
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,580
Trinidad James?

424
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
What was his song?

425
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,580
All Gold Everything.

426
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,380
Oh, well he did win because of Donald Trump.

00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,140
Dude, he likes gold!

433
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,140
He's got a gold doll in my toilet.

434
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,140
He likes gold!

435
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
His skin is gold!

436
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Gold doll in my toilet.

00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,140

00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,140
Gold in Mar-a-Lago!

445
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,940
I'm saying Mara in the White House.

446
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
Pop to Molly, I'm sweating.

447
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:25,440

Oh my god, you did not just do that, dude.

Because he poops a lot in his gold dollar bike diaper.

454
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,440
Any guy with a toilet that golden must have to poop a lot if he's going to be using it.

455
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
I'm a fat guy, I'm sweating.

I appreciate you Michael, much love.

469
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,280

00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,080
'cause they have been using everything I've said.

471
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,920

00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,200
Uh-huh yeah most of the Trump stuff is from my packet. Yeah Patrick just wrote a bunch of

475
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,720
funny situations that he thought were goofy that ended up being turning into

476
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,880
just tone-deaf political comedy like he didn't know who he didn't know anything

477
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,720
he didn't know who was president. He was just writing characters and they they turned out to be perfect.

478
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,720
They were like these would be great for Trump what the hell we're not gonna

00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,680
hire this guy but his packet is amazing we can't hire this guy because of uh

482
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,040
