00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
[Music]

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village, our heroes had a very weird and fucked up fight with a walrus

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:29,000
involving taking bits of his meat out of his body and doing stuff to it.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Dogen turned into a Oreo-centric, oath-breaking paladin.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Patric Yodar proved a capable shot with a crossbow, and Evil Stevel developed a new catchphrase.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:51,000
After they won the fight, they decided they would try their hand at fighting Ola to field her offer as well in this orc tank scenario.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
In the meantime, Evil Stevel's catchphrase, "Get me out of this hotel."

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh, that's okay.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Alright.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Was causing him concern as he traveled back to the hotel he was staying in.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The, uh, the Blinky's Warm Place.

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
So Patrick Yodar got a crit 20, disguising him as Lindsay Lovely, a pop star with 38G tits.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, they decided to help Blinky's Warm Place get the three stars for the hotel.

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,200
two and a half stars or has been never been a three star hotel by

15
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,440
performing a concert because Lindsay Lovely is also like a

16
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
musical artist.

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, like Hannah Montana. Yes.

18
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,160
It almost went disastrous. It's disastrously. But Patrick

19
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:45,240
Yodar's insane keyboard guitar playing save the day. What

20
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:53,480
happened was was during the final moments. You lovely Lindsay

21
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:58,160
Lovely screamed your catchphrase and then got a crit 1 in your performance check so

22
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,360
your tits fell clean off. Dogen, you were obsessed with Lindsay Lovely, wanted to

23
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,640
be her very sexual backup dancer so you did a Keith Moon tap dancing solo but

24
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,320
you got a crit 20 on your keytar playing so everyone turned their attention to

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,100
you and you guys found a way to kind of play it off that it was just me in

26
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,540
disguise I'm like doing a Hannah Montana thing and you all ever in the whole

27
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,300
crowd and all of you screamed get me out of this hotel and we kind of ended the

28
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:32,400
episode there on that high note yeah so I want to know kind of like the rest of

29
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,940
the night how did that go down the concert ends it's a roaring success

30
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:41,500
you're in Blinky's warm place Blinky's all excited he thinks this could be his

31
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:47,300
chance to get a three-star rating from the Gal Gadot Hotel rating agency mm-hmm

32
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,580
So what happened? What went down? Well I've got I still I have Lindsay Lovelies fake

33
00:02:53,580 --> 00:03:00,220
tits and I've bronzed them. Yes, you bronzed them. And I carry them with me forever now. Yeah. And you hand them to

34
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:06,580
yourselves like awards. Yeah. Did you bronze them immediately after? Yeah there's a

35
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:10,540
bronzer in the hotel. Yeah right. Really? You didn't know about that?

36
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,940
Well that's good. Alright well then I go down to the bronzer and I would like to bronze my

37
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:38,140
right hand okay cool during the crazy after party I took a shit in the

38
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:45,460
bronzing machine Steve will just stuck his hand in the you can't no no picked up

39
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,420
a can't picked up a bronze lizard you can't go back in time after I already

40
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,780

41
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,860

43
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,820

44
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,820
I didn't bronze my hand.

45
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,040
I think you guys have to roll.

46
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I didn't bronze my hand.

47
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,040
I'm trying to think what's the roll.

48
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,040
I think it's a T20 off.

49
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,040
D20, D20, wait, don't roll yet.

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,040
D20 against each other.

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,040
If, okay, if you win.

52
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,040
That's not a D20.

53
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,040
This is not a D20, you're right.

54
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,040
There you go.

55
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,040
No, there's one right there.

56
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
Give that back.

57
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,040
If I win, if I win, you get your own shit.

58
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,040
I divided it perfectly.

59
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,040
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
If you win, then I didn't just bronze my hand, I bronze my tongue also.

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Okay?

62
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Okay.

63
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
All right, ready?

64
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,040
Wait, hold on, hold on.

65
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,040
There are, yeah, what are the rules?

66
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:33,440
win then I didn't just bronze my hand I bronze my tongue also. Okay? Okay. All

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,360
right ready? Wait hold on hold on there are yeah what are the implications if

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,200
you actually bronze your hand right? Yeah. Yeah well that means he just has like a

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:47,480
stronger fist. That's not. Well I bronze it into a into the middle finger. It's okay he's a

70
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,920
he's a he's a cleric he doesn't need to use like a two hands or anything.

71
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,640
If you bronze your your hand if this is what happens like you actually do we can

72
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,520
come up with stats for your bronze tan

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,280
so it like maybe does like one one d_-eight budgeting damage or something

74
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,120
like and that just like

75
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,960
on its own inside a weapon you just have

76
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,120
because you brought your hand it's that the thing is is he's holding it's a

77
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,600
bronze and holding a turd

78
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
it doesn't hold the terrible deterred if you have patrick wins the d twenty okay

79
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,680
will work all right but then what is he'll he needs to have something at

80
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,520
stake here

81
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,160
i think i should have i think this is a is a lot of all got bronzed

82
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,680
yes yes yeah and it blocks all his poop yeah okay all right he poops out of his mouth

83
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,080
already and so hold on so we'll figure out but i think there will be some sort of like

84
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,920
hmm maybe there's like a toxicity sort of damage i'll figure that out it takes septic

85
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:45,200
trying to figure out all right you're going down you pussy bitch oh man hey you are oh man 18 oh

00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Your asshole gets bronzed.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
Because he dips down to shit in it.

90
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,600
Mm-hmm.

91
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,600
What a crazy night.

92
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Do you still bronze your hand?

93
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600

94
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600

95
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
Okay.

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
So your asshole gets bronzed.

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
We're just going to play this out.

98
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Your asshole gets bronzed.

99
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,600
Yeah, I think we can do that like...

100
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,600
Can we count on from now on there being a bronzer in every tavern that we go to?

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,600
I think so, yeah.

102
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Okay, I bronze the oreo I made out of the walrus. This is my new collection thing.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Okay, you got an oreo. Your asshole's bronzed. You didn't bronze anything.

104
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,600
With a bronzed asshole, let's think. What?

105
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
I bronze my pinky.

106
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
You bronze your pinky? Okay, yeah. I mean you're just...

107
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
And there's poop in it.

108
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Well, for some slight of hand checks, the difficulty class will be slightly higher.

109
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,600
I have to make notes of this.

110
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,600
I don't bronze my pinky then. Tell me this shit before I do it, man.

111
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
You need to tell me the consequences of my actions.

112
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:57,600
if you're a person my pinky when I use my pinky okay imagine like just holding

113
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,040
anything and you got your you're just have slightly less grips you should

114
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:07,400
bronze like just your wrist like it like it looks like a watch hmm

115
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:12,040
I'll allow it it's he's have a watch on here no it's not I'll just get a watch

116
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:15,600
this is all right I don't bronze anything I'm being peer pressured he has

117
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:20,640
to he can never shit again I put no you put some confetti in the bronzer okay

118
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,760
bronze the confetti I think I think Eddie bronze that what we'll do is it'll be

119
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,880
like we can do it looks like it's got sprinkles on it here's what we'll do I'm

120
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,640
trying to think is I think I think because because this resolved in a weird

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:37,720
way I want to do this fair so what we can do is that every like four hours of in

122
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,000
game game time we'll roll a d20 okay I have to roll a d20 and if you're higher

123
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,360
than 10 you don't take 1d4 septic damage can there be there could be a cure four

124
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,120
hours is good four hours that's that'll never come into play I don't think I'll

125
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,160
forget sometimes yeah I won't forget I'll figure out a benefit for it

126
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,240
eventually maybe well if someone tries to fucking fuck his buddy yeah and there I

127

163
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,020
when he first approached you guys the group you saw when you were in the the

164
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:21,300
tavern he he sort of entreats you guys and he he comes over and he says all

165
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Alright so today you guys wanted to fight Ola right?

166
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Nah.

167
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,940
Yeah I think so, well hold on I gotta.

168
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,700
Let's just take the fish and leave.

169
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,700
I gotta world.

170
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,700
You guys are serious about that right?

171
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,460
I gotta world tour, I gotta plan.

172
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,340
It's a lot of money on the line here.

173
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,340
Yeah but I.

174
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,340
How much money?

175
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,140
Look I'm trying to focus on my music right now.

176
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,660
Oh god, okay.

177
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,460
I'll go.

178
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,780
No we can't just have one of you.

179
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
I will go alone.

180
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,780
I'll go too.

181
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
No!

182
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
I will go alone.

183
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:53,780
Just fight one of them that's actually offering us money, please.

184
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,280
Alright, we'll fight the green lady.

185
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,580
Why don't you fight with us? You're so invested in this.

186
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,080
No, no.

187
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,580
Yeah, I'll fight the green lady, whatever.

188
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,280
Why do you care so much if you're not making any of the money?

189
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
I'm making some of the money.

190
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,580
Then why are you not fighting?

191
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,180
Yeah, why aren't you fighting?

192
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,780
You shouldn't be. You're not gonna make any of the money if you don't fight with us.

193
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,580
You're not part of it.

194
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,080
Okay, fine.

195
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,480
And we're gonna tell them that.

196
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,780
That you don't get money if you don't fight.

197
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,980
I've got you guys here. I made this connection for you.

198
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,980
I get you can't hear, I mean it can't hear.

199
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,980
He's doing, he's saying what he said.

200
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,980
You guys are making fun of him.

201
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,980
You look over and you see that shaman who was giving you guys the stink eye a few episodes ago.

202
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,980
And he's still giving you the stink eye.

203
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,980
That's the stinky shaman.

204
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:38,980
And you see the shaman says,

205
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,980
Don't listen to them thorax.

206
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:47,980
Just fight the orc by yourself and take the money for yourself.

207
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,980
You don't need-

208
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Hey, shut up, bitch!

209
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,580
And you see, the shaman like glares at you.

210
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,620
He doesn't find any of this very funny.

211
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:55,620
He's like pretty mad.

212
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,620
I flip him off.

213
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,940
You wanna see something real funny?

214
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,940
I pulled down Petra's-

215
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,820
Yeah, the balls are huge.

216
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:03,180
Wait, no, turn around.

217
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
Look at that.

218
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,100
Boy got, boy got fuckin' bronze dipped.

219
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:12,660
You can see like a few like streaks of his balls are bronze too, 'cause he couldn't get

220
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,660
it clean.

221
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,140
Yeah, the bronze went down out of my balls too.

222
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,140
It went down?

223
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,900
crazy night. Look, I'll fight with you if that's what it's going to take for you guys to not

224
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:27,180
accept... I actually don't remember the logistics of the offer with the walrus, but...

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,940
We won't fight unless you fight too.

226
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
I'll fight with you.

227
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
We all agreed on that last night.

228
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,580
We still get the fish from the walrus?

229
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,260
I don't know if there's...

230
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,260
I'm going to bronze it.

231
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:40,300
We're going to bronze the fish. We'll see if we can get fish from the walrus. I just

232
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,300
don't...

233
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,300
It sounded like you guys were going to give the walrus away with us.

234
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,220
All right, we're going to bronze the gold coins too. They might be worth more. If you

235
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,300
had bronze to the point I think bronze is more valuable than gold I'm pretty sure

236
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:56,460
do not do that what well it's extra metal on it wait which one is better gold or

237
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:02,820
bronze gold is there a gold ur in this town I don't think so you can operate

238
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,380
for free for no reason this is the best hotel in this town and it only has a

239
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:13,340
bronzer but have you checked for a gold ur what's the finish this arc we should

240
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,340
maybe go looking for a golder from far away. Do an investigation check for golders. Do

241
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:28,700
an investigation check? Yeah. Okay. That is an 18 plus. Oh I never did the. Hold on. Shit.

242
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:33,700
What is it? Investigation? Minus one. That's a 17. Okay. There is a golder but it's two

243
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:39,540
towns over. We're going there later. Is there a golder? Holy. Does it, in an investigation

244
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,960
You just have to like tell him if there is or isn't one.

245
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,460
No, that's not actually how it works.

246
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,500
I'm just saying shit.

247
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,220
(laughing)

248
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,740
You're supposed to like say what you're doing

249
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,700
to investigate, are you talking to people?

250
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,540
There's all kinds of things.

251
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,900
We, since you agreed to fight with us, let's go kill

252
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,940
Oh, hola.

253
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:57,900
We don't kill them.

254
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,740
We don't.

255
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,980
Yeah, we're gonna, we do not kill them.

256
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,340
I would never kill a woman,

257
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,780
but let's beat her within an inch of her life.

258
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,140
Last time you said you only kill women.

259
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:07,060
I'm a liar.

260
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:07,880
Okay.

261
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,420
I think that was Lindsay Lovely that said that.

262
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:14,300
Yeah. Was it? It was okay for her to kill women because she was a woman.

263
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,860
Alright, let's just... Here's Max, I'm taller than you.

264
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,860
Nah, I think I'm three feet taller. You're definitely not. He's a

265
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:25,540
orc and you're... Look at me, I'm so... look at this. You're a dwarf, yeah.

266
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,980
Fucking huge.

267
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,620
So you guys, uh...

268
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,240
Yeah, you guys, uh... walk out of the hotel, um...

269
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,860
Say it. Go back to the, uh...

270
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,620
Say it.

271
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,020
To head to the arena.

272
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:45,180
man is hotel yeah I see some guy grab his camera and I think I think it's good to

273
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,500
like you realize a little bit more color as to what Gal Gadot is so the city is

274
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:56,820
filled to the brim with all manner of terrifier born so goblins ghouls zombies

275
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:03,260
you know orcs Nards they look at everything and everyone like pieces of

276
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:08,300
meat, rotten meat, which they like more than regular meat. Any

277
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,260
influence felt from the kingdom's more progressive

278
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:15,120
stance of like anti-slavery or like, try not to eat humans so

279
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,480
much is virtually non existent here. Most scaredy cats are

280
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,660
slaves, they pull carts, entertaining their masters,

281
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:30,160
performing odd jobs for no pay and odd favors for no pay. As is

282
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:36,060
customary in the Terrifier Kingdom, and particularly in Gal Gadot, if you pass

283
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:40,600
by a slave you are to spit on them. But because, Evil Steeble, because you're a

284
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:46,320
scaredy-cat born, you're occasionally mistaken for a slave and spat upon here.

285
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,360
But then a lot of times people remember that you're the, recognize you as the

286
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,120
get-me-out-of-this-hotel-guy. When people spit on me I catch the spit midair with my

287
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:02,740
tongue like a frog in a fly roll roll a roll straight decks check okay let's see

288
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:09,080
how you do it that overall yeah you do all right occasionally it gets in your

289
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:16,280
cheek but like you're mostly catching it yeah yeah the the as you guys are

290
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,200
walking there you can hear the shaman under his breath saying shit like peekaboo

291
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,140
scaredy-cat about you because that's like a sort of like a slur you say the

292
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,280
scaredy-cats is peekaboo they like say nasty things he really doesn't like you

293
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:37,100
guys he's crying you're making him cry by saying that not crying he's sort of

294
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,820
just ignoring you guys you walk by the skies of Gal Gadot are crowded with like

295
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:49,980
outstretched claws legs hands shoulder blades tails spikes and mandibles that

296
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
sick from the ground.

297
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,340
This place scary as hell.

298
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,260
These are all kaiju manji, right?

299
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,740
These are all like the dead

300
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,620
beasts of the past.

301
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,460
Is Prince Jumanji named after them?

302
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,340
He's named after the kaiju manji.

303
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,100
It's a...

304
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,780
Because a lot of people who are

305
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,380
terrifier born like worship them

306
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,700
because they were like these great

307
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,540
terrifying beasts of the past.

308
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,980
Precursors of terrifier born.

309
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,700
What?

310
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,300
They weird.

311
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,740
Yeah, they weird.

312
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
That's true.

313
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:23,060
It's a metropolis, although there is basically no vertical living,

314
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,160
as the orcs are resistant to any and all change, preferring to spill out into the street,

315
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:31,060
sleeping all over each other, fighting for space, scraps, meat, and bone,

316
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:34,340
rather than live in the sky, a thing that gives them great fear.

317
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:40,660
Agriculture is a recent innovation, courtesy of Ola, actually, and her magic.

318
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,740
The Kaiju Manji were once worshipped at this grim gravesite,

319
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,260
but any religious fealty for the beasts has gone by the wayside in favor of the Terrifyer.

320
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,660
So like whatever the kaiju manji were like these sort of, you know, pagan gods almost.

321
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:56,660
And the terrifier is now the god that these people worship.

322
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:03,360
And the shaman, from what you could pick up on his wardrobe and his general demeanor,

323
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,360
he's one of these people who worships a terrifier.

324
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,860
There are a number of big churches in the area.

325
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,460

plus 5% in the advisory board,

455
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,160
and you join Ola's family of products,

456
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,320
which means you'll have to sort of like

457
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,640
adjust your vendor relationships,

458
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,400

459
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,600
already sewn up for you.

00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,800
- Plus one billion gold coins for 1%.

461
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,640

The worst kind of hot dog ever.

That's what hot dogs are like in this fantasy world.

483
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,180
They come from an animal that looks exactly like that.

484
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:09,180
It's an animal's penis. Some animal's penis basically.

485
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,180
Some animal's like finger or something.

486
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,180
It's just a terrible thing.

487
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,180
No, it's a hot dog. A hot dog is an animal.

488
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,180
It's an animal. With one bone.

489
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,180
Yeah.

490
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:21,180
worm with a bone in it.

491
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:23,180
Oh yeah, that's canon.

492
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,180
That's so good.

493
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,180
It has to roll around on its side because it can't wiggle like a worm.

494
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,180
Just hoping somebody eats it.

495
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,180
The sound it makes is like...

496
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,180
And the buns are a plant.

497
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,180
They grow near the hot dog.

498
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
I'm just sucking on one.

499
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
You're just making me hungry as hell.

500
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:41,180
I want a hot dog so bad.

501
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,180
I want a hot dog.

502
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,180
Let's pause and go get a hot dog.

503
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,180
And so we're back.

504
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:58,500

508
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:18,780

509
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:26,300
about anything. I gotta tell you one thing Ola. I'm in love with you. This might

512
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:47,980

519
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:46,580

520
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,300
has some weird competition thing. Is Sullivan with us? Yeah. Sullivan's in love with you too. No no no no no no no.

some sort of developmental thing going on. I don't know if you know. I'm into...

523
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:13,220
And Sullivan's in love with you too. No, I'm not. Sullivan is in love with you. He's so bashful.

524
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,500
He's the bashful frog. Oh, I was not

525
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:20,300

Sort of shy look at turning green with shine green with love and you know what? I just wanted to say that

528
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,880
Sullivan's in love with you so much that I'm gonna let him have you

529
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:48,120
I'm not gonna. I'm not gonna. There's no having me. Okay. What look do you want to fight? Do you love him?

00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:55,260
You have to go on a date with him

533

All three of you four of us look at the frog look at me

534
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,100
Hey, look at me

535
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,820
Pick up I pick up Sullivan

536
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,900
Like

537
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,300
Forgot we're the same size

538
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:26,980
Pick him up. He's gonna roll. He's gonna try to resist against that for okay. He's probably gonna resist

539
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:30,700
He

540
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,600
Pathetically try to lift him up and he's trying to hold him up - one on strength

541
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,780
Yeah, let me double check his stats

542
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,780
I forgot to have that up.

543
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:43,780
Um, D&D Beyond is not working.

544
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:47,780
Well, let me try, um, let me try the app.

545
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,780
We'll just say that he lost.

546
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,780
He lost, yeah.

547
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:50,780
He definitely lost, right?

548
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:54,780
No, I don't, I mean, the attempt was made.

549
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:57,780
That's kind of what's interesting here, is that, yeah.

550
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:01,780
So how can we fight you if we're all so god damn in love with you, Shorty?

551
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,780
I'm not in love with her, right?

552
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
Except for him, you can fight him.

553
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,780
He's not in love with you, so...

554
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,780
I cast Inflict Wounds.

555
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,780
Oh my god, okay.

556
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,780
Roll initiative then. Let's do this.

557
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,780
Everyone roll initiative.

558
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
Alright.

559
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:19,780
You roll an initiative when you love the girl?

560
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,780
You wrong for that.

561
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,780
I guess I'll roll initiative.

562
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,780
Yes.

563
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,780
I got a 19 for initiative.

564
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,780
I got a 13.

565
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,780
Don't forget to add your bonus.

566
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,780
Add your initiative bonus.

567
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,480
I think I have a zero initiative bonus. Yeah, I'll say

568
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:42,260
Internet is working. All right, that is Sullivan's initiative, which is terrible

569
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:48,980
Yeah, I saw it and that was all us. Nope. That's all us. Sorry. What the fuck I didn't I don't make

570
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:52,140
Literally make the rules jinx. Whoa

571
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:56,940
Caleb can't talk for the rest of the episode and please don't really got to talk please

572
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:59,860
That was good. We said the exact same thing at the exact same

573
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:05,880
I don't literally make the rule first of all. What are you doing? Where are you going? He's leaving. Caleb come back

574
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,560
Caleb come back. What are you taking out of the garbage? I don't want that

575
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:16,720

576
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,900
Talk again now you want me to

577
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,780
Well, he pulled a coke out of the trash. That's pretty cool. I

578
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,980
I guess just pause the recording now.

579
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
No, it's okay.

580
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,980
No, we're gonna keep this all in.

581
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,980
This is why people like this, I think it's because of this.

582
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,980
Um...

583
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,980
I can't confirm that.

584
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:40,980
I didn't say your name three times. You're just racking up...

585
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:42,980
Stop.

Dude, that is one of the...

And so it's like your balls swing up and so she just like claws through your sack.

618
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,920
Okay so back to what we were talking about earlier.

619
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,240
Is there water in your balls?

620
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,040
We were talking about that before recording.

621
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,040
Let me look it up.

622
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,040
Google is there water in your balls.

623
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,040
It's not water, it's blood.

624
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,040
Is it blood?

625
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,040
There's not blood in your balls man.

626
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,040
Yeah there's blood.

627
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,040
Yeah if you nick your balls, I guess it's the skin.

628
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,040
That's true.

629
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,040
Well in the sack I mean.

630
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,040
I've cut my ball sack so many times.

631
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,040
Well there's blood all over your fucking body.

632
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,040
What is, what are your balls?

633
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Are your balls dry?

634
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,040
Dry?

635
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,040
Dry.

636
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,040
Dry.

637
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Dry.

638
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,040
Dry.

639
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,640
- Balls floating in. - During development,

640
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,300
each testicle has a naturally occurring sac

641
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,160
around it that contains fluid.

642
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,400
- Okay, my fluid comes out,

643
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,440
and it tastes like Baja Blast. - Wait, you said

644
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,140
during development?

645
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,920
Yeah, it's during development, though.

646
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,160
- Isn't that when you're like a fetus?

647
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:19,160
- Wait, what's hydrocele?

648

664
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,960
Okay, my juice comes out.

665
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
And I lost 9 damage.

666
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,960
Yeah, you lost 9 damage to juice.

667
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,960
The juice just like goes on her claw.

668
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,960
Now you have to marry me.

669
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
*laughter*

670
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,120
Some orc rituals require this, but no, not mine.

671
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,960
Well, mine do.

672
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,320
And so now, Patrick, you go.

673
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:14,760
I'm going to launch Cupid's arrow at her.

674
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Your regular arrow.

675
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,760
Oh, you do have an arrow to make her shit her pants.

676
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,440
Yeah, I'm going to do that.

677
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:21,440
Yeah?

678
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,440
That's a kind of Cupid's arrow.

679
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,560
And then you can offer her a moist towelette and then she'll fall in love with you.

680
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,880
I look at her and I say, "Maybe I'm going to hit you with Cupid's arrow."

681
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:33,880
put girls in this hole I can never put a woman in this thing yeah we've been

682
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:39,120
trying to tell you this for a year and I keep trying what am I doing I'm an idiot

683
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:46,680
sorry that we're three love constantly my role whether an attack roll yeah do it

684
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:51,840
well isn't there do I have to like go for the arrow no that's your arrow so

685
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,920
it's like that's just the arrow that's being shot okay it's the same amount of

686
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:59,520
damage as like an iron arrow it just or whatever kind of arrows you can't have

687
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,520
It just also can make them shit their pants.

688
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:07,520
So I think it's +6 for you?

689
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:11,520
Okay.

690
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,520
Got an 11 +6. Yeah, that hits!

691
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,520
Whoa. So she now needs to make a constitution saving throw against

692
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,520
your DC. Can you look at that and tell me what that is?

693
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,520
My DC? I think it's your spell save DC. If you go to the

694
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,600
and print spells it says save DC mm-hmm this character cannot cast spells that's

695
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:39,440
okay you still have a well okay in this case it would be let's say I think oh

696
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,400
yeah is nothing oh yeah I guess I guess it's a plus 20 then I guess it must be a

697
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:51,600
thousand plus 1000 - 13 he can use mine well I was gonna say I think it's

698
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:57,520
intelligence only because the rogue spellcasting subclass is the arcane

699
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,880
trickster and they use intelligence. Okay. So they want to go with intelligence.

700
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:09,400
What's your intelligence score? My intelligence score is 13 and it says plus

701
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:16,720
one. This is plus one? So then that is going to be your DC is 8 plus your

702
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:20,520
proficiency bonus plus your intelligence so your proficiency I think is 2 so I

703
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:24,000
I think your DC is 11 then, so let's see how that goes.

704
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,760
I want to make sure though, I think I just did that right.

705
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,920
Yeah, I got it.

706
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,640
I was just double checking.

707
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:33,640
Paranoid.

708
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,280
Yeah, she resists it.

709
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,600
So she like prairie dogs.

710
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:39,600
The poop kind of comes out.

711
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:40,600
She's like, "Ugh!"

712
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:45,240
Like she tries to like steady herself.

713
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,640
She got balls juice on her hand.

714
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,640
What?

715
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,120
Is there a way I can get the arrow back?

716
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:56,280
You could take it from her after the fight right now. It's after the fight. I can't like run up on her and okay

717
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,600
Yes, you can try to do that. Okay, not this turn. You're gonna get fucked though. Can I have just somebody else?

718
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:09,000
Patient not doing a roll but also roll for damage. Oh, yeah. Why much is it check your?

719
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:12,800
It should be I think it's a d6. Okay, plus your

720
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,880
dexterity

721
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:22,160
One plus my dexterity so that's a four okay cool

722
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:28,640
So yeah, you do like you kind of like you break this you break the skin you almost break her whole it doesn't work

723
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,820
But yeah, so that was the first damage on her. She's like she like turns to you like glaring at you

724
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,320
I love you so much

725
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:41,640
She knows you almost made her shit her pants in front of an entire stadium of people

00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,680
he does go before solvin

841
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:14,420

842
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,360
towards all i think i like

843
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:20,340
very deliberately like side step you jerky yourself off

844
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,740
and sort of what i'm gonna get your all you know whatever

845
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,360
that does it because of his strength is really high

846
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,160
uh... and let's do some damage

847
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,580

848
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,780
k

849
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:36,780
(laughter)

850
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:38,780
Do it in the mic, you pussy.

851
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,780
He does, uh, 16 damage.

852
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:42,780
He just fuckin' like,

853
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,780
cleaves into her fuckin' side

854
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,780
and like, rips the axe out

855
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,780
and he goes for a second attack.

856
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,780
Hey, hold on, before you do that, can you get my arrow back?

857
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:52,780
He's like, "Ugh!"

858
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,780
Oh.

859
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,780
Please. Don't do it.

860
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:58,780
Please. Don't do it. If you touch the arrow, you'll shit yourself.

861
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:00,780
No, you won't, you won't.

862
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,780
It's the tip of the arrow that makes you shit yourself.

863
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:05,180
So if I pull it out, he's like holding his axe there.

864
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:05,680
Hmm.

865
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,080
So if I pull it out, and if I don't touch the tip, I won't shit myself.

866
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:09,780
Yes, you won't.

867
00:51:09,780 --> 00:51:11,280
Jerry's out. Don't do it.

868
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:12,780
Don't say pull it out right now.

869
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,980
I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to attack her again.

870
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,180
Okay, but after that, can you get the arrow out?

871
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:18,980
Yeah, sure. I'll use, I'll use my bonus action.

872
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,480
I'll give you 20 gold coins.

873
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,680
I'm doing my own deal in the orc pitch.

874
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,180
So he's gonna, first he's gonna try to attack.

875
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,680
Um, that does not hit.

876
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,680
And so he swings that for her again, and she's able to like, sort of curve around it.

877
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:39,520
it. He can't like try to grab the arrow right now, but he can try next turn. So now it's

878
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:40,520
Brim.

879
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,840
What? You're wasting, he's a strong guy, you're wasting his attack.

880
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:52,920
Now it's Mr. The Frog's turn. So Mr. The Frog missed, he tried to shoot darts. And the darts

881
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:56,440
just like limply fall directly in front of him.

882
00:51:56,440 --> 00:52:00,440
I don't even want to say what that looks like, the way he's holding his hand right now.

883
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,440
What do you mean?

884
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:08,120
He looks like Sullivan keep that near your lips for like 20 more seconds. What are you talking about? That's exactly right?

885
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:10,120

So I don't have the crap arrow.

939
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:00,840
Don't have the crap arrow.

940
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:01,840
You have normal arrows, though.

941
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:02,840
Why are you so fixated on this?

942
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,840
I do have normal arrows.

943
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:08,480
And I say, "Okay, this one this time is actually Cupid's arrow."

944
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,640
Yeah, roll deception. Yeah, just lie.

945
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,140
16 plus 6.

946
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:19,240
22. That's actually a pretty good roll.

947
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:23,400
Yeah, she's like a little concerned that that could be Cupid's arrow.

948
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,440
She's pretty sure you're a huge liar, but like you're extremely convincing.

949
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,240
Yeah. So I wind up for the attack.

950
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:37,640
I wind up like I point the arrow like Babe Ruth. Yeah like Babe Ruth.

951
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,600
The crowd's like where on her body are you pointing? At her butt.

952
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,600
Her eye?

953
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,600
Yeah.

954
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:48,600
Badass. I'm pointing at her

955
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:50,600
because I know she's prairie doggin' still.

956
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,600
You know she nasty down there too.

957
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,600
Yeah. So I'm pointing at her butthole.

958
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,600
She's fucking disgusting.

959
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:58,600
I'm pointing at her butthole. I'm hoping that this arrow

960
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:04,600
that this arrow hits her butt and poop comes out.

961
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,600
Okay yeah you can hope for that all you want.

962
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:08,600
I can't stop you from hoping that.

963
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:12,600
I think I have to give you permission to hope.

964
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,600
Well if I get a high enough roll I think that'll happen.

965
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:17,600
You know what? I think so.

966
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:18,600
Alright.

967
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:23,600
That is 18 plus...

968
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:25,600
What do I add to that?

969
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,600
I think 6.

970
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,660
What are your attack is oh my attack your bow and arrow attack

971
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:44,600
Is it under equipment or yeah, okay

972
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:48,920
Plus five

973
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,240
Yeah, you shoot it

974
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:58,120
She's like not her backs not to you, but your arrow just like

975
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:03,480
Makes us like winds a corner. It's like a bullet and who framed Roger Rabbit. Yeah

Exactly, and it's like it's like Faust in a guilty gear and she's making the face of like oh

- Yeah, I told you.

983
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,920
- It usually doesn't look like this.

984
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,160
- You taking me to Sea World.

985
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,880
- I told you guys I would make your crap.

986
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,040
- You didn't lie.

987
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:36,880
- Yeah.

988
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:37,920
- You see the announcer's like,

989
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,740
I cannot believe this is the first time

990
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,080
an orc has crapped in the stadium.

991
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,340
This is an amazing moment in Orc Tank history.

992
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:49,600
We are watching live an orc take a crap.

993
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:51,320
- I pull out a big cigar.

994
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:55,960
like the like like Babe Ruth and I just start smoking the cigar.

995
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,960
It's poop.

996
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,460
Yeah, I'm walking the bases.

997
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,460
Yeah, they're her bases.

998
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,460
[Humming]

999
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,460
[Screaming]

1000
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:09,460
Um, yeah, roll for damage.

1001
00:59:09,460 --> 00:59:11,460
You also hit her.

1002
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,460
That doesn't even matter anymore.

1003
00:59:13,460 --> 00:59:15,460
She already doodooed. She lost.

1004
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,460
It's gonna be four damage.

1005
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:19,460
Yeah, she is not looking good.

1006
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:21,460
Take it home

1007
00:59:21,460 --> 00:59:26,900
Yeah, I'm gonna say no. I'm gonna take it home. What oh my turn. Can you skip your turn so I never one turn

1008
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:32,960
No, okay, you got the jerk off man. Yeah, that's more than anyone else got to do

1009
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:36,460
But what if I was setting up for the most amazing turn to ever?

1010
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:41,380
You should tell me exactly how much HP she has right now. No, why not?

1011
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:44,060
No, please we

1012
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,420
We've actually been playing, but imagine the integrity of the game has been thrown out the window.

1013
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:52,500
Just imagine if, let's keep, imagine if you told me that she had

1014
00:59:52,500 --> 00:59:57,340
3 HP left and I knew I could do a finishing blow just with my, with punching her with my hand.

1015
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,340
Wouldn't that be so cool for the story?

1016
00:59:59,340 --> 01:00:06,980
No. I will say Patches, we have kind of been playing with this other DM who does tell us like what everyone's HP is.

1017
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,340
And, uh, it hurts me so much.

1018
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:13,140
Is it? His name is Scratches.

1019
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:20,140
is

1020
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:20,940
my guys

1021
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:23,580
that guy you guys know what he was like when he's talking college

1022
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:27,900
faxes discuss you know that he was actually pretty cool

1023
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,500
so

1024
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,380
and he was actually is probably doing

1025
01:00:31,380 --> 01:00:34,540
and he's probably doesn't even have any the the the

1026
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:37,580
uh... modules so it is in the know

1027
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:42,100
he rolls everything for us first of all that's not fun

1028
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,700
if it's not right to run a show i don't know what now on

1029
01:00:45,700 --> 01:00:50,340
yet natural one yahoo which cratches to which cratches i let him when you

1030
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:54,420
refused to close out of the other scratches it's not all scratches as is

1031
01:00:54,420 --> 01:00:58,420
the scratches scratches you don't know that i had all cratches

1032
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:02,260
and uh... what actually does it have you seen it and i have a great you get in

1033
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:05,740
that way to give you tell you i'm not one counts as a twenty one

1034
01:01:05,740 --> 01:01:09,660
you know it's it is a blackjack yeah exactly it's blackjack rules well yeah

1035
01:01:09,660 --> 01:01:13,280
Different game, so that's another yeah, we exactly he does he has a cooler game

1036
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,860
Yeah, he knows how to meld games together cuz he's like we play

1037
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:19,300
That's somebody you you

1038
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:22,040
You're the worst crunches and dragons

1039
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:27,140
Looking DM ever compared. I don't play crunches and cragons. I play Dungeons and Dragons

1040
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:32,900
Yeah, what people over that is you made a version of crunches and dragons called Dungeons

1041
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:35,660
You know which we tow it. Yeah, that makes sense

1042
01:01:35,780 --> 01:01:39,560
Which we tell at Yatches when we play yungins and yagins.

1043
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:44,480
Like I know I'm tired of hearing about my brothers. Well, okay, so I

1044
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:52,040
Rolled in that one. So just like do something to me. Yeah, sure. Yeah, okay

1045
01:01:52,040 --> 01:01:58,620
Were you trying to do I was trying to punch her. Oh my god, you ever seen that?

1046
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:07,700
Charles Charles Bukowski great guy had this book he did with Robert Crumb where this woman punches herself square in the face

1047
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,940
So that Robert Crumb draws the drawing

1048
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:15,260
You do that. You just punch yourself square in the face. Yeah, is that okay? Yeah, that's good

1049
01:02:15,260 --> 01:02:21,020
What scratches do that or what? He might be like cooler what but he probably described it like a little better

1050
01:02:21,020 --> 01:02:26,340
But yeah, yeah, he might do something funny where like he punches himself in the face and like places his teeth like piano key

1051
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:29,840
Yeah, and it goes like "awooga" when he plays the piano keys, even though they're piano keys.

1052
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:35,040
Well, Scratches sounds like he has a 45% chance of being a racist, too, by the way, so...

1053
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:36,140
Yeah, and he chases a little mouse.

1054
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:37,540
You're gonna want to bump that number up.

1055
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:41,840
Alright, your turn, Evil Steeble.

1056
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:42,740
Okay, I...

1057
01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:44,240
I did steal my turn for you.

1058
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,740
...been sitting crisscross applesauce style.

1059
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,440
I learned that it's wrong to call it Indian style between now and the last turn I had.

1060
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,740
You've been hanging out with Scratches too much.

1061
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:55,640
I get up, I've cum all over my face, and I'm smirking.

1062
01:02:55,640 --> 01:02:59,440
Color become yeah blood red

1063
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,680
But viscous like come yeah

1064
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:08,400
Yeah, well I have I've had a kidney stone for a really long time and

1065
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:16,080
It cut the tip of my penis. Yeah, so all the cum was boy. I understand and now I'm gonna cast level two inflict wounds on

1066
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:17,800
This stupid ass. Oh

1067
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,840
Damn level two. Yeah

1068
01:03:19,840 --> 01:03:23,560
Yeah

1069
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:30,560
19. Oh my god. 3d10s. Damn, she's about to fucking die dude. I think 3d10 is level 1.

1070
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:41,160
No. Mine is 4d10. I don't think so. Mine is only level 1 and I got 3d10. Yes, I think

1071
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:46,960
you got 4. No, 3d10s is my level 2. You can roll it in there. Oh, did you trick me? No,

1072
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,960
it says 3d10 on mine. Unless I'm casting at level 2. You might have casted at level 2.

1073
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,760
No, look, first level, 3D10.

1074
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,760
Plus four is my attack bonus on this,

1075
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,560
so it's actually like a 23, right?

1076
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:59,100
Yeah, that's weird.

1077
01:03:59,100 --> 01:03:59,940
All right.

1078
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:01,400
Maybe his spell is just worse than mine.

1079
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:02,240
It probably is.

1080
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,080
You're better, you have a better character.

1081
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,840
That's not how the spells work.

1082
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:08,160
Oh, thank you.

1083
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,000
I mean, that's fine.

1084
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:09,840
All right.

1085
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:11,480
I'm gonna tell you what, unless you do something,

1086
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,520
unless you do it horribly, you're probably gonna

1087
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,360
not kill her, you can declare that you knock her out,

1088
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:18,200
which is--

1089
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,080
You know what, if there's one thing

1090
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:23,880
we've learned in this campaign is that I've never had a bad roll. So I think

1091
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:31,480
this is gonna be pretty damn golden for old baby boy. Damn! 16. Yeah I mean describe

1092
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,280
your knocking her out. Unless you want to kill her. I walk over with cum on my

1093
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:40,640
face still smirking, still smirking walking in her like Frankenstein and

1094
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:45,480
then I headbutt her so a little bit of it gets on her face. And then how do you

1095
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:56,340
inflict wounds and then yes you cast these spells and it's just like I'll say

1096
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:59,660
you know what your inflict wounds the red come on your face when you headbutt her

1097
01:04:59,660 --> 01:05:05,400
it like wraps around her skull and singes her head that's what I meant to say and

1098
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:12,820
she's like and like just falls to the ground and you guys win you can accept

1099
01:05:12,820 --> 01:05:19,780
yeah I go over I go over and get my arrow yeah first thing and what happens when

1100
01:05:19,780 --> 01:05:27,460
you touch it I touch the the hilt yeah I yeah when you're picking it up and you

1101
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:33,580
pull you you pull it out too hard and you fall back and it grazes me and I go

1102
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:44,440
I'm trying to get up I'm trying to get up and I'm like going like and it hits

1103
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,820
Steve on the leg - I walk over here while she's knocked out and I suck my ball

1104
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:59,500
juice off her hand nice a hands off the merchandise do you all I reabsorb it

1105
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:03,300
into my body. I wish I could just veto that. Yeah, and then I fart.

1106
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,300
*fart noise*

1107
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,700
Um, yeah, all that happens.

1108
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:15,100
Everyone lets that happen in the arena. The arena, they all still like you guys for some reason.

1109
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:19,100
Here's why. Get me out of this damn hotel.

1110
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:22,100
Yeah, he says that and then I do, uh, just like,

1111
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:28,200
I just play piano man on a keytone. Do y'all wanna see penis sucking man suck my penis?

1112
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
No!

1113
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,200
Yeah!

1114
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:31,200
Let's see it!

1115
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,200
Let's see it right now!

1116
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,200
Come on!

1117
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,200
Sullivan, we gotta put on a show for him.

1118
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,840
I don't wanna suck your penis, man.

1119
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:39,200
Have I ever given a fuck what you wanted?

1120
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,200
No!

1121
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,200
Alright.

1122
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:44,320
Oh no, he's right!

1123
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:49,640
So yeah, the announcer comes to you and he says, "Well, it looks like you three, four,

1124
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:55,040
five," remembering the characters that Patrick is playing, "don't do this to me."

1125
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,040
Seven.

1126
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:09,360
about Dolby Dolby Dolby come on out come on out yeah yeah you see like a a like

1127
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:15,240
fat like like a guy who looks like he looks like um Phil Collins from trailer

1128
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:33,600
park boys but he has a single eye on his head and he's like this is why we don't

1129
01:07:33,600 --> 01:07:37,520
use you in battle you guys this is does it the sounding make does that come from

1130
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:43,160
his eyeball he doesn't have a mouth I think it's coming from his butt

1131
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:46,040
You see his butt and it like licks its lips?

1132
01:07:46,040 --> 01:07:48,040
*laughter*

1133
01:07:48,040 --> 01:07:49,040
It's like, "Mmm."

1134
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:51,040
The butt starts singing "Brown Sugar" by the Rolling Stones.

1135
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:53,040
"He's nasty and I'm glad he's gone."

1136
01:07:53,040 --> 01:07:55,040
*laughter*

1137
01:07:55,040 --> 01:07:57,040
And the announcer then says,

1138
01:07:57,040 --> 01:08:04,040
"You have two offers. One where I think you give the walrus two fish, and the other one that's a little bit more legitimate."

1139
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:06,040
We give him a fish and then...

1140
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,040
We'll do both.

1141
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,040
Yeah, we'll do both offers.

1142
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,040
"You can only pick one. That's the rule."

1143
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:12,040
Fine, the walrus.

1144
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:14,540
(laughing)

1145
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,400
- Is that your final decision?

1146
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,400
- I think, hold on, let's just ask this,

1147
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:21,560
ask fucking Thorax, I'm busy, I gotta--

1148
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,400
- Hola, hola, please, if they pick anyone.

1149
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,240
- I gotta--

1150
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:25,680
- I wanted Ritter Finn, but I'll take Hola.

1151
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:29,480
- I gotta plan my world tour, I gotta do all this stuff,

1152
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,720
I'm going to buy, I have to go buy sunglasses

1153
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,720
on ye olde Rodeo Drive.

1154
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:36,480
- You keep talking about this record deal

1155
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,800
and nobody seems to know what you're talking about ever.

1156
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:40,640
- I, uh--

1157
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,880
- I think you may have come up with it in your brain.

1158
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,720
Tell you what you do have.

1159
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:45,540
- I think there's a lot of things going wrong in my life.

1160
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,120
- You have a brass bronze ass.

1161
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:49,220
- A brass ass.

1162
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:50,620
- You got a, it may be a bronze ass,

1163
01:08:50,620 --> 01:08:52,240
but it's a brass ass.

1164
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,620
- Yeah, maybe, you know, maybe, maybe,

1165
01:08:54,620 --> 01:08:56,940
maybe big time stars do weird things all the time.

1166
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:57,780
- I hit his ass with my shovel.

1167
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,480
- Maybe sometimes somebody puts a diamond in their forehead.

1168
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,520
- And it goes like, boom.

1169
01:09:00,520 --> 01:09:02,200
- Like a little Uzi.

1170
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,780
- Please pick, please pick Ola.

1171
01:09:04,780 --> 01:09:05,620
- Walrus.

1172
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:07,460
- Wait, is Ola the walrus's name?

1173
01:09:07,460 --> 01:09:08,300
- Pick Walrus.

1174
01:09:08,300 --> 01:09:09,460
- Pick Walrus.

1175
01:09:09,460 --> 01:09:10,460
Walrus?

1176
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,860
You want us to pick the walrus?

1177
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:15,860
He just left his hands, he like, can't believe he brought you here.

1178
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,860
Alright.

1179
01:09:16,860 --> 01:09:17,860
Okay, here, we'll flip a coin.

1180
01:09:17,860 --> 01:09:18,860
Oh my god.

1181
01:09:18,860 --> 01:09:19,860
If it's the walrus, then it's walrus.

1182
01:09:19,860 --> 01:09:20,860
If this is one, two, three, it's the walrus.

1183
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:21,860
If it's four, five, six, it's Ola.

1184
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:22,860
Okay, I'm glad you brought your dice with you.

1185
01:09:22,860 --> 01:09:23,860
I'm doing this in fiction.

1186
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:24,860
This one.

1187
01:09:24,860 --> 01:09:25,860
Yeah, we were playing on a plane.

1188
01:09:25,860 --> 01:09:26,860
That is a huge coin.

1189
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:27,860
Oh, oh, fuck.

1190
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:28,860
Thank god.

1191
01:09:28,860 --> 01:09:29,860
That was a four.

1192
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:30,860
I'm gonna go ahead and flip a coin.

1193
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:31,860
I'm gonna flip a coin.

1194
01:09:31,860 --> 01:09:32,860
I'm gonna flip a coin.

1195
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:33,860
I'm gonna flip a coin.

1196
01:09:33,860 --> 01:09:34,860
I'm gonna flip a coin.

1197
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:38,540
Oh, oh, oh, thank God.

1198
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:39,540
That was a four.

1199
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:40,540
Oh, God.

1200
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,540
Wait, wait, what's your minus?

1201
01:09:42,540 --> 01:09:45,540
All right, I have a minus one.

1202
01:09:45,540 --> 01:09:50,540
All right, you're going to go with the walrus?

1203
01:09:50,540 --> 01:09:51,540
No, no.

1204
01:09:51,540 --> 01:09:53,540
Oh, the dice already spoke.

1205
01:09:53,540 --> 01:09:54,540
It's a lie.

1206
01:09:54,540 --> 01:09:55,540
Okay.

1207
01:09:55,540 --> 01:09:56,540
Yeah, the dice already spoke.

1208
01:09:56,540 --> 01:09:58,420
Ola, does your offer still stand?

1209
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,740
And she's like nodding in pain.

1210
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:01,740
That's all right, everyone.

1211
01:10:01,740 --> 01:10:02,740
And she crept.

1212
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:04,740
The

1213
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:07,980
Yelling at the sky

1214
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:16,940
The less you know she cried those pants yeah, she got three homeless guys

1215
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:28,020
Amusement Park idiot land stupid ville will be funded by Ola for

1216
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,720

1217
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:36,400

1218
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,680

1219
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:40,680
magical service group so that's

1220
01:10:40,680 --> 01:10:43,440
pretty stellar

1221
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,880
Congratulations fellas

1222
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:51,600
Yeah, I already we already all left. Yeah, okay, so as you guys walk back

1223
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:54,560
I

1224
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,400
want to

1225
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,200
One second here. I'm just I'm waiting in the stadium. No, they left

1226
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:05,400
I'm waiting in the stadium because like nobody's really clapping. Everyone's just kind of like

1227
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:11,400
You see the walrus he's like

1228
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:16,400
He's like it's alright. Don't worry about it. Like he just wants fish. Why isn't a

1229
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,460
No one's clapping for us

1230
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:24,240
The arena area, everyone is pretty stoked for you guys.

1231
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:25,740
They're like slapping you on the back.

1232
01:11:25,740 --> 01:11:26,940
Thorax gives you guys a big hug.

1233
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:28,100
What did I say about his back?

1234
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:28,780
Ow.

1235
01:11:28,780 --> 01:11:29,580
Don't touch it.

1236
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,640
That shit hurts, man.

1237
01:11:30,640 --> 01:11:34,120
Thorax gives you guys like a big hug.

1238
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,380
He's like, "Thank God."

1239
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:36,180
Ow.

1240
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,580
Like, "Fuck you."

1241
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,080
He's like nursing the hangover, but he's like,

1242
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,780
"We're gonna be like, 'We're gonna be fucking rich.

1243
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:43,080
I'm gonna get my tower.'"

1244
01:11:43,080 --> 01:11:44,020
He's like so excited.

1245
01:11:44,020 --> 01:11:45,800
I don't remember you fighting with us.

1246
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,000
Sullivan is like...

1247
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:48,660
[laughing]

1248
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:50,700
Sullivan is like, "Ugh."

1249
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:56,720
Sullivan is like is happy. He's like imagining his general story. And I don't seem to remember you fighting with us either

1250
01:11:56,720 --> 01:12:01,540
I did fight with you! I don't think you were there. I think you just sat out there and you sucked a cock

1251
01:12:01,540 --> 01:12:08,060
Yeah, you became the dick sucking guy. And as you walk by everybody and you walk by

1252
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:12,200
Everyone that's going on

1253
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:18,420
You recall however brief despite your best efforts to black it out entirely that bouquet toss

1254
01:12:19,260 --> 01:12:21,260
from way back when.

1255
01:12:21,260 --> 01:12:28,660
A shared moment of deja vu, time slows down again like it did that time when you tossed a bouquet,

1256
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:34,160
but this time you know your destinies, or you know them by their weight, of which you know there is none,

1257
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:36,540
but you know them all the same.

1258
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:38,900
The knowledge,

1259
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:45,380
so secret to the mortals as within your grasp, reaching, you make futile connections and patterns in an instant,

1260
01:12:45,380 --> 01:12:48,640
but it's the process of reaching that grants you the new weightless and

1261
01:12:48,640 --> 01:12:55,040
Indefinable wisdom you're just sort of like have this moment wash over you all where it's like you know something

1262
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:59,320
You don't know what it is. It's that feeling again when you beat the jester. It's this feeling of

1263
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:02,100
You're being tied to something larger

1264
01:13:02,100 --> 01:13:07,260
Something inside you recalls, but doesn't retain a frightening truth that you're worthy

1265
01:13:07,260 --> 01:13:10,000
These developments are incremental

1266
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:14,420
You know that some part of you knows that part of you that doesn't know anything knows that

1267
01:13:14,580 --> 01:13:21,380
The spirits that live in the planet have made themselves known to you. The large informal council of energies conversed loudly about you.

1268
01:13:21,380 --> 01:13:26,020
The non-presence of the intangibles tips towards darkness though in this city.

1269
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:30,800
As far as your conscious mind is concerned you have a single realization

1270
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,980
from this larger cosmic non-episode. In Gal Gadot,

1271
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:40,020
the most prominent pro-slavery voice amongst the terrifier porn,

1272
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:42,900
you are surrounded by enemies of the king.

1273
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,100
Which means enemies of the prince

1274
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:53,860
And as you walk further and towards the arena you realize there are two people missing

1275
01:13:53,860 --> 01:13:56,940
the shaman and

1276
01:13:56,940 --> 01:13:58,140
the prince

1277
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:00,140
after party at the gold or

1278
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:07,140
I guess we'll take it up from there next time.

1279
01:14:07,140 --> 01:14:09,140
from there next time

1280
01:14:09,140 --> 01:14:11,140
[laughing]

1281
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,140
[laughing]

1282
01:14:13,140 --> 01:14:37,140
[Music]
