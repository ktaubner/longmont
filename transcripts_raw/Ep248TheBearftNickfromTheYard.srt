1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,060
- I'm gonna clap, or actually Patrick will clap.

3
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:12,100
- Wait, I can't do it?

4
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,940
- Nick will clap.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,760
- I got a monster clap.

6
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:14,600
- I just decided Nick is gonna clap.

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,440
- I got a monster clap.

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:16,260
- Okay.

9
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,380
- Podcast spot lists, take one, mark.

10
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,140
- Take one, I'm not doing this again, it's Saturday.

11
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:22,980
(laughing)

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,820
- Yeah, we're not doing both takes, man.

13
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,220
- There is no take two.

14
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,260
- There is no take two.

15
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,100
- Okay.

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:27,920
- We got just one take spot.

17
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,760
- It better be fucking good.

18
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,740
- Here's the bad news.

19
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,040
Okay, bad news. Great news. Let's start with good news. The good news is that I

20
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,320
love you too. You're great friends of mine. The good news is that Nick is here

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,640
from the yard. He's in town visiting us. Okay, but the bad news is that last

22
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:41,960
night

23
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,040
me and Nick

24
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,480
went to a sumo wrestling match. Really? How's that bad news? Sumo plus sushi

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,400
because I didn't because only the tickets for free. So I didn't invite you

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,720
guys. I want to go to a sumo wrestling. Oh, shut the fuck up.

27
00:00:59,720 --> 00:01:04,440
shut up. I wouldn't want to go. You don't know what you're talking about. You said

28
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,880
you don't know what you're talking. You said they were you. I knew you would do

29
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,780
this. I knew you would do this. You don't know what you're trying to see. It's

30
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,820
hard to frame this as some. Why would I don't want to do anything? Yeah, he

31
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,920
doesn't like it. It will be too loud for me. First of all, the guys are too fat.

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,960
I wouldn't understand most of the language. They were speaking. They speak

33
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
English, bro. How would I know that? Well, maybe this will change your mind for

34
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,940
five of them, it was their first time in America.

35
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,940
Whoa.

36
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,940
Wow.

37
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,500
They also fought people in the crowd.

38
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Yeah.

39
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
They did.

40
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Yeah.

41
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:35,500
They literally did.

42
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,500
The end of the show.

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Now I'm actually jelly.

44
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Everybody comes up.

45
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,500
All the sumo wrestlers came.

46
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,500
It was called Sumo Plus Sushi.

47
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,500
It was in Washington Heights.

48
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Everybody comes up.

49
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,020
They do like a WWE rigged wrestling against each other, which he and Brian were betting

50
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,020
on by the way.

51
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Yeah, we were horse betting.

52
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,020
Betting the entire time.

53
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:55,020
And one of them would just like do the biggest flop ever.

54
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,540
I was betting with Noah too and he bet like $10 and the second he lost it, he won it back

55
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,020
the next hand and he was like, "I'm out."

56
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,020
He was out.

57
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,580
I was like, "I'm here for the ride."

58
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,900
Ryan was doubling down.

59
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,500
They were throwing $60 on these guys.

60
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
God damn.

61
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,940
Yeah, Ryan loves gambling.

62
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,180
He does love gambling.

63
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:20,460
The end of it was they bring up like five guys from the audience and these guys did

64
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,300
sumo wrestling with the dudes.

65
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,660
Were they fat guys?

66
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:26,860
One of them was bigger than any sumo wrestler.

67
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,100
One of them was one of the fattest people.

68
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,300
His name was Connor.

69
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,020
He was a huge man and he got destroyed.

70
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:39,020
Are sumo wrestlers, the whole thing is that they're like, they're huge fat guys, but are

71
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,140
they like six feet tall?

72
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,260
Because in my head, a sumo wrestler is like five foot five.

73
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,860
It's tough to tell from the crowd.

74
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,340
Maybe it's just because of the cartoons.

75
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,420
I think one of them was six feet tall.

76
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,700
I would imagine they would probably be tall because you have to be pushing people around.

77
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,740
Yeah, but is it like a jockey situation where they have to be tiny?

78
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,260
I think they probably have to be tall.

79
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,460
Yeah, well they also have to ride a horse.

80
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:09,500
There was one round I bet $60 on a 600 pound guy versus a clearly a 300 pound guy.

81
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
And I lost.

82
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,860
He picked him up.

83
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,300
I bet it's about skill.

84
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,540
I bet that someone who is kind of an entry level, I would assume that at first I would

85
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,000
to think, oh, maybe it's just about weight. It's pure, but it must be about

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,720
waiting, must be waiting for like I said, it was pretty much all rigged until

87
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,840
they were fighting people from the audience and then

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,680
one of the guys was like really like trying. So one of the guys from the

89
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,600
audience was trying so hard to win and the sumo guy, he turned on the jets.

90
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,800
He was like yeah, he got you think that you think it was all rigged and then

91
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,500
they they picked people from the audience to come in and

92
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,400
and it was real. No, those people pay $400 to do that. Oh, there's only five VIP

93
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,320
tickets. Where is this? It was in Washington. This was an unbelievably

94
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,880
expensive. It's my birthday. You get to go do your own. It's a traveling thing.

95
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:05,820
It only comes our birthday. Oh, bummer. But you you pay 400 bucks. You go up and

96
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,360
you you try your hardest to throw these people out of the ring. And these guys

97
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,000
are serious. I want to pay 400. I want to put all the money down. Go up there.

98
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,560
flop immediately. Just get there was some guys who got there was one guy like

99
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,760
full. I'm going to hide a taser in my sleeve. They can't stop me from doing

100
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,360
do you have to make you take your shirt off? Yeah, you guys are in my pant leg.

101
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,480
Me and Noah got pretty deep into the whole what if we sumo thing and we

102
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,000
already banned weapons. Okay, we got to that point. So it's not all that's good.

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,080
Yeah, yeah. What if I use some type of gel that makes my body hair so spiky

104
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,280
like that's allowed. That's a good that's allowed. Porcupine is allowed. Yeah, we

105
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,340
we talked about that. You can porcupine? You can porcupine. It's part of your body. If

106
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:49,400
you just do a mohawk. Some people in Japan are born that way. You can't ban it all. They

107
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:54,880
have fully porcupine. They have porcupine. I will say I noticed that these guys had almost

108
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,880
no hair. And they had also, we were talking about this, they had perfect ass cheeks. No

109
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:05,320
pimples, no stretch marks. They got it. Perfect, beautiful baby bottoms. One almost got naked.

110
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,640
He unwrapped almost all the way. He held his cock in. Which was like a demonstration I think.

111
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,440
It was like it was meant to teach us the rules.

112
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Okay.

113
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,440
One of them.

114
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,120
The rule is get naked.

115
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,080
The rules are there's a ring.

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,080
Be fat, get naked.

117
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,080
There's a circle.

118
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,080
And you go like this.

119
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
You try to, you can slap apparently.

120
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,080
I didn't know.

121
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
I didn't know you could slap.

122
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
Yeah and the announcer was telling one of the.

123
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
Only the chest.

124
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
Oh yeah.

125
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
You can slap people in the chest.

126
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
They weren't slapping their faces.

127
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
You can't slap the face.

128
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,040
They were like DK bongoing each other over there.

129
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Didn't really seem to do anything.

130
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
What is that like guys?

131
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,280
Is that a demoralization thing I guess?

132
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,280
I think it's embarrassing.

133
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,280
I think it was fanfare.

134
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,280
Yeah.

135
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,580
Yeah, I think I'm not sure that would do anything like an in zone. So here's the

136
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,940
thing. Here's what you do. Maybe the momentum builds up over time. You

137
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,920
surgically graft a taser into your chest. Yeah. So when they go to slap it,

138
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:57,260
well, that's a good, that's a point about basically any any sport is if body

139
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,800
modding is available, then I'm getting a third arm. But what is it?

140
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,800
If my son is born with electric eel genes because of something, some chemical

141
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,760
was exposed to. I don't think that counts as body modding. You didn't modify it. If I accidentally

142
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:17,120
raise a perfect human soldier, yeah. I don't know if eel is the best. Well, you know, it's

143
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,680
an example. Yeah. So, well, what would be the best? I guess probably genes of a soldier.

144
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,280
Pikachu's son. DNA of a soldier might be pretty good. Yeah, but it would probably be an eel and

145
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,080
then end up porcupine and a lion and a tiger and a dragon. Dragon's gonna be tough to come by. Yeah,

146
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,440
well, I'm not gonna lie to you. It's gonna be a mutation situation. These guys had, they had the

147
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,520
the hearts of dragons. I was very impressed by Sumo. I always thought Sumo was a fake

148
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,600
sport. I thought it was for wussies. I thought it was like croquet or tennis.

149
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,520
I did the opposite. I actually learned that Sumo is really just about pushing someone down

150
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,720
once and then it's over. I didn't know that.

151
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,600
You didn't know that it was a high intensity kind of sport.

152
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:58,400
I thought there was like choke holds, takedowns. When you're on the ground you keep going.

153
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
That's the thing. That's the problem is you couldn't choke these guys.

154
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,880
Yeah.

155
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
There's no neck.

156
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,280
You can't fit your hands around.

157
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:09,240
Yeah, unless you got a big-ass hand. You can pinch them. You can tickle them. You can make them giggle.

158
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:14,360
I told Cale I would pay any amount of money to you guys as podcast donation to get Jubio in a diaper

159
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,640
and get a photo. He's already in one. Look at him. He's hiding. That's why he's hiding right now.

160
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,160
I would do anything. He's a offer on the table. He's in a diaper. Damn. He said name your price

161
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:29,400
for the diaper, man. Come on. Yeah, what's your price? I mean we have to... One dollar.

162
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,760
That's an amazing deal. You should do that for real.

163
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,640
We have to keep him in a diaper though. He's not allowed to leave that computer.

164
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:43,780
I'm going to feed it into Mid Journey. Start Jubio as only fans.

165
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,400
You made him the love bug in Mid Journey, right?

166
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,160
Somebody did that. I just like putting him in costumes and making him a woman on my Photoshop

167
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,160
application.

168
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,440
I want to make a virtual buddy with him so badly.

169
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,960
I want to make him wiggle him around.

170
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
Do you have evil fans? Sinister people?

171
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Depends on your definition.

172
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
Yeah, I don't know. Do you have evil fans?

173
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah.

174
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,960
What do they do? Try to ruin your life and shit?

175
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,960
Depends. I don't know. We've had police show up.

176
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
We don't have that.

177
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,960
The police are your fans you're saying?

178
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,960
No, no, no. They're expressly not our fans.

179
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,960
But they, I don't know. I'm wondering when people come to your show, is it kind of like what you imagine?

180
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:25,960
Yeah.

181
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,720
Yeah, they're not. They're all really cool. Everyone's really, really cool.

182
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,080
That's what I think about them. They're all cool fucking people. Yeah, they

183
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,400
dress cool, they act cool, they're really good at talking. Yeah, they have

184
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,520
cool hairstyles. Yeah, they're completely normal people. Yeah, it's odd. It scales

185
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,880
by Patreon. I would say that if you think rockabilly is evil, then yes, we

186
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,440
have a lot of evil fans.

187
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,760
I would say that the people who listen to this podcast occupy either the, either

188
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:59,860
Extremes of the height scale where people are either like six foot seven or like five feet tall. Yeah

189
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:06,940
Reality that comes with being an extreme height on either end our fans are so tall really. Yeah, it's weird

190
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:11,540
Yeah, big dog. Yeah, I'm walking in the street. I feel I feel so small constantly. Yeah

191
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,100
Maybe they're not even fans. Maybe they just want to like pick you up

192
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:22,560
People who want to know like a tall guy. That's like wiggle my legs. Yeah, one of these just don't dangle this fucker

193
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,560
I'm sitting on the leg of this table.

194
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
You got the worst chair.

195
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I'm going to keep doing that.

196
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
It's got the roller blade wheels.

197
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
I hate this chair so much.

198
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,560
This was a test for me.

199
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,560
Did you give him the spike chair?

200
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm going to pass.

201
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,560
I think I put the spike chair over there.

202
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I don't feel a spike.

203
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,560
That chair is a spike that goes up the butt.

204
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
It is a prank chair.

205
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
I put together wrong and I put the bolts in.

206
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
Let's get a little switch going on.

207
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,600
I know it sounds funny, but it's not. It's the worst. It's really just not good to be doing.

208
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,640
We just keep it because...

209
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,520
We keep it because it's sentimental.

210
00:09:59,520 --> 00:09:59,920
Yeah, I mean...

211
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,280
Well, eventually you'll have the right guest.

212
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,160
Yeah.

213
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,320
Yeah.

214
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
Someone who likes it.

215
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Somebody... who was... somebody we had was sitting in it and didn't realize it until the very end.

216
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,080
Princess and the Pea.

217
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:08,800
Joe.

218
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
It was Joe. I think Joe liked sitting in it.

219
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,120
Well, he probably has a perfect dimple in his ass that just...

220
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,160
He does.

221
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,840
I'm supposed to ask who Joe is here.

222
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,560
Joe is a...

223
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:16,720
He's our buddy.

224
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,520
He's our friend.

225
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,120
Joe from Home Planet.

226
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,000
Yeah, he's our friend.

227
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
He's our friend Joe.

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,600
So how are you liking New York City?

229
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,480
This is the worst place on the planet.

230
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Really you live in LA bro.

231
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
That's tough talk.

232
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,720
But like New York, I was saying earlier, it's like you took all the worst people in LA and

233
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,360
you just made them group hug in Manhattan.

234
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,920
Well yeah, you're hanging out in Manhattan.

235
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,920
That's what I'm learning.

236
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,000
I've come to Brooklyn three times on this trip and I've liked it substantially more.

237
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,160
Yeah dude, Manhattan's dog shit.

238
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,440
It's like the worst fucking place to be.

239
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,080
Here, this place, Queens, Queens is sick, Kevin James is here, Ray Romano's here, fucking

240
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,820
Brooklyn. That's where... Chris DeStefano's from Ridgewood. Really? I learned that the

241
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,200
other day. Whoa. New favorite comedian, Chris DeStefano. Love him. He still lives here? No,

242
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,360
I think he lives in Los Angeles, but he's from Ridgewood. Yeah. Well, he's got veneers.

243
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:06,360
Yeah, he definitely went to LA. I need to get into being, living in Queens and I need

244
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,640
to become a volunteer fireman or something. Yeah. Really involved in the community. Yeah.

245
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:15,040
Volunteer fireman who's like, has like three daughters and he's so pissed off about it.

246
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I want everybody on my block to know me.

247
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,040
They are getting so many dates.

248
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Oh my god.

249
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,040
Have you guys thought about when your daughter

250
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,040
brings a guy over

251
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,040
and says this is my boyfriend, how you're

252
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
going to react?

253
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
I'll probably go like, what?

254
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
What is this meme you're showing, Jupio?

255
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm just going to act real scared of him.

256
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Oh, that's down the street.

257
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
This is everyone I saw today.

258
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Yeah. Walking here.

259
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
Yeah. Oh my god. TV, high shirt.

260
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Why are you pulling up a meme?

261
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
I hate you bro.

262
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
Does that dox you guys?

263
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
It does dox us because that is next door.

264
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,040
It's the same neighborhood.

265
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
But we're not like you. Nobody's trying to triangulate our location.

266
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
We've been very express.

267
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
Yeah, we give out our address all the time.

268
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
Yeah, pretty much.

269
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,040
Most of the time. We should give it out right now.

270
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
First person to show up wins.

271
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
I won't give it.

272
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,040
I would sooner give out my personal

273
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,040
address than the office address.

274
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,240
Yeah, I think yeah, cuz the office is too. It's too sacred. Yeah, what do you gave your phone number out right?

275
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,840
He did I get my phone number. That is horrible. I don't know what I was you were on Minecraft

276
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,840
I was on a lot of stuff you were

277
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,600
Minecraft was one of them for sure

278
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,040
Yeah, that was the first time I dipped into your world of YouTube man. Yeah

279
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,360
Mmm, we need we need you here so bad

280
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:44,780
How do you do you make the thumbnails of thumb bows as you call? Yeah? Yeah, what is it got a name for him?

281
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,720
You have a name for they already have those fucking pictures

282
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:51,680
They say oh, we got to make one of those fucking we have to make a photo

283
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,880
Juvia makers

284
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,960
I mean you they won. I know exactly what I'm doing. Okay. What is the key?

285
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,560
lesson. What is the key? So you have to first you have to isolate who do you guys

286
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,480
think is the most famous in your podcast? Probably me. It's not Jubio. You guys are

287
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:17,000
fucking with me. It's not Jubio. If you want help, if you want help, I need you to

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,160
be real. Okay, but by that logic, couldn't we just put a photo of Ryan Gosling?

289
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,800
Ryan. Ryan. Ryan. Absolutely. You can. You can. Let's just do that. You can absolutely

290
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:31,440
lie. Okay. Okay. Picture of Ryan Sheckler, right? This is the thumbnail for today's

291
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,320
episode. Okay. Photo of Ryan Sheckler, ax body spray, red carpet event,

292
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:41,200
then a photo of like the three of us really small, maybe like,

293
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,080
like one 80 by one 80 pixels big.

294
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,280
Just a photo of the three of us tiny, tiny in the corner.

295
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,800
Then it just says,

296
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:58,160
and it says Ryan Sheckler kickflip the office big inflated Ryan Sheckler.

297
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,120
Yeah. Like Ryan Sheckler inflation. We put him in. Yeah.

298
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,340
I put him in 3D and we Veruca in the middle of his backyard skate park.

299
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Squished bottom of the shoe.

300
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:07,340
That's what we need to do.

301
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,860
We need to just lean into purely like SEO stuff.

302
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,560
Fetishistic pursuits.

303
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,880
But just call all of our episodes like Pokemon Cheats 2020.

304
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,480
You could probably randomly do fetishized thumbnails until one hits and kind of know

305
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
where your audience lands.

306
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Oh, I know where they are.

307
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,800
And then just stay there.

308
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,360
So like if really big feet start to work, then you switch back to using yourselves.

309
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
You all just have large feet.

310
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,800
I would say probably people who listen to the show probably have a foot thing and a humiliation

311
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
fetish.

312
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Yeah.

313
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:41,000
Do you think that, I mean, we all have the same size foot, maybe we just like photoshop

314
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
it.

315
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
He is so obsessed with that.

316
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are obsessed with that.

317
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He mentions that once a week.

318
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
That's crazy.

319
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I think most men wear an 11.

320
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That means that we can share our shoes.

321
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
You're like a 10 and a half.

322
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
No, it's an 11 and a half.

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Okay, it's like 11.

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
No one says it's 11.

325
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,640
I think he's halving up.

326
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:54,880
I think he's halving up as well.

327
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
I think he has a wide foot.

328
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,320
Are your toes wiggle rooming and you wear them to keep the half?

329
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
I think so.

330
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,440
I thought I was an 11 and I went to the shoe store and the guy said you should wear an

331
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:08,640
11 and a half. I might win this competition. You don't even know what shoe size you wear?

332
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:13,640
No. That's crazy. How do you not know what shoe size you wear? Wait. I don't really.

333
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:18,360
Yeah, but those are converse. The only reason I know what shoe size I wear is because Patrick

334
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,800
asks what shoe size I wear 100 times a year. So we can share shoes. We've never shared

335
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,240
shoes. I don't want to share any of your shoes. We shared shoes on tour. You wear cringe shoes.

336
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,000
I don't wear cringe. You do you wear such cringe. You share your shoes on

337
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,760
tour. We it's not true.

338
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:37,640
That's false. We were those Osiris is that's pretty cool. We didn't even wear

339
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,340
those on tour. I did. I wore them in Seattle. I wore those one time because

340
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,960
my shoes got dirty from a flood in the old office. That's true. They fit.

341
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,920
That's the only time I ever wore those. They fit so it's a good. They're

342
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,880
made of wood. They're not made of wood. You know what I was saying? What I

343
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,580
was saying could come back is the DC Osiris element. That's coming back. It

344
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,920
easy comeback. I didn't easily come back. That Paul Frank, Paul Frank and Ed Hardy all

345
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,920
can come back. They're on their way. Dude, walk around Bushwick bro. You got these people.

346
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:14,180
What about Echo? Echo? I just bought some big ass Echo shorts. How much were they? They

347
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,540
They were like three bucks or six bucks.

348
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,180
But why'd you lie?

349
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,700
That's half.

350
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Price it per leg. Yeah. I price it per leg. That's what I was thinking.

351
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,340
Yeah. I got these big ass echo shorts that, uh, they got the,

352
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,180
you have more, you have, I don't mean this in a rude way.

353
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:41,140
You have more clothes than any girl I know. I know it's completely true. Yeah.

354
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:47,500
I'm like you. Oh, he does too. I went and stayed at his house and I lived in his closet.

355
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:54,300
But I'm just you too guys, you go shopping. Yes, I do. It's not a crime to go and find clothes.

356
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,740
I've been dressing myself at Active Ride Shop for 26 years. Me too. Not Active Ride Shop though,

357
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,220
what we got on the east coast. What do you guys have out here? Eastern Border. That's not real.

358
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,660
That's a real thing. Is that an Indian restaurant? No. What is that? It's a snowboard place in

359
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:16,700
Nashua. That's where I would go. Oh, that's from the office. Yeah, I know that one. Burton.

360
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:24,580
Bring back Burton too. You know that green jacket that Joe has here in the costume closet?

361
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:30,900
That is a Burton like. It's like a blazer. It's a Burton blazer. So stupid. This is not

362
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:37,260
related at all. I was here visiting my dad who lives in New York and I rented a car. What's

363
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,260
his address. So his address is 123 dad highway. I rented a car.

364
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:48,660
It's a terrible. He lives on a home. He lives here. And I rented

365
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:52,260
a expensive sports car to impress him. My dad built cars.

366
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,060
I bought a Maserati. I'm committed now. I rented a Maserati. I

367
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,560
really want to impress him. He builds cars and stuff. And so I

368
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,860
got it. But when I got in the car, it has like a display and

369
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,260
I was trying to I tried for like, I don't know, like 30 minutes

370
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,300
to connect my phone to it. It was like it was ancient like you take out your

371
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:14,020
car's radio and you put you put in like a a new type of thing like if you press a

372
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,300
button it probably has a CD player behind it and I could not get the thing

373
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:25,540
to stop playing Ice Age 2. The car was looping Ice Age 2 and like

374
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:29,140
it was a really it was like a 2012 so like that all the controls are on the

375
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,500
steering wheel but they're all just like letters it's like SRC which I actually

376
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,700
don't know what that means. Radio control screen. Yeah. I eventually

377
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:43,500
eventually realized that this RC controls it, but no matter what I did

378
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:48,400
when I pressed it, it would not go off of ice age to on loop. That's kind

379
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,100
of sick. I drove in. I remember I'm in Manhattan just watching ice age

380
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,600
to they had it like all in the dash. Yeah, right, right up. Just

381
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,300
distracting you. That's okay to do by the way. I know plenty of people.

382
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:04,620
I know I don't I won't say who it is, but it's one of my brother in laws who he

383
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,840
used to go to school in Georgia and drive like back and forth from North

384
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,680
Carolina to Georgia every time and every time he would come back for Christmas

385
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,920
or I would be like how's it driving he'd like man. It was good. I watched I

386
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,380
watched

387
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:18,760
grown ups one and two back on the

388
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:23,900
that's for everybody on the highway. Everybody's yeah everybody's already

389
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,660
watching you. I try it triangle goes across line. Yeah,

390
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,320
for five hours. You have cruise control on it doesn't you can watch whatever you

391
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,820
want to close your eyes. Who the fuck yeah, I wish I knew how to drive

392
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,380
sometimes, but honestly you could watch movies

393
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:46,700
more time for movies. I get so many movies in I'd finish come and see

394
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:53,180
getting pulled over by the cop. I'm sorry. I was just

395
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
and I

396
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:00,980
do the kids face to the cop. You turn

397
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,740
yeah, wait, all the wrinkles yeah

398
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:11,620
yeah, I you guys just don't drive out here. I drive man. He has a car in my

399
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,220
car last night. Yeah, you see is

400
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:18,380
I've never I've never hung out with you guys and not been in the back seat of a

401
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,060
car with four people. Yeah, Oh yeah, that happened again last night. It did

402
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:28,140
Oh my god. I'm starting to think you guys are all pranking me. Maybe. It's not bad, man.

403
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,500
It's not a bad way to go. I just need a bigger car. I really want like a Sprinter van or

404
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,740
something. You should get, yeah. I want a Sprinter so bad. Wouldn't that be dope? They're

405
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:41,300
so sick. They need so much room in them. I'd rather have a plane. You would not rather

406
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:47,100
have a plane. I'd rather have a plane. Okay, so if you want to go from here to fucking

407
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,500
Trump Tower or something, you have an appointment. That's a helicopter ride. A tattoo appointment.

408
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,300
are you going to you're going to ride your plane there? No, I'm going to take

409
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,900
my plane to I'm going to fly over Disney

410
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:59,900
and do circles. You can't fly over Disney, that's the whole thing. I'm

411
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,460
going to do it, though. I'm going to be the first guy to ever do it. I'm going

412
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,420
to be basically the Wright Brothers of flying over Disney. Do you think they

413
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:10,180
have an iron dome at Disney? They do. Really? It's exactly like Israel. No, I

414
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,140
just said that, but yeah, I assume they'll shoot you down. That's what a

415
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,900
California adventure is. Palestine. Yeah.

416
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,620
They're just at war constantly.

417
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm sure the parks have beef. You know Epcot thinks they're so much better than everybody.

418
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,740
Oh, absolutely.

419
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,140
And it's like bro, you don't even have good rides fool.

420
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,140
I think the whole thing, full of air.

421
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,140
Epcot balls?

422
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:35,140
I think if you go up, you fucking punch Epcot hard enough, it's just like a bounce house.

423
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,220
Maybe if you're the strongest guy ever, you think you could punch a hole straight through

424
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,220
Epcot?

425
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,500
I one shot Epcot.

426
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,540
No way.

427
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,620
One shot. Like the sumo wrestler. I was telling Noah last night, if I had a week, well this

428
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:49,300
This is different, but if I had a week to train, could I 100 meter dash beat a

429
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,460
sumo wrestler? I thought you were going to say punch a hole in a sumo wrestler.

430
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,060
I don't clear halfway. The thing is, those guys are scary, athletic, sneaky

431
00:21:57,060 --> 00:22:00,460
athletic. A sumo wrestler's skin, though, has to be stretched to the breaking

432
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,380
point. Oh, absolutely. I think if there's any guy you could punch through his

433
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,220
skin, it might be a sumo. Just pop him? Yeah. Maybe it's just because of the...

434
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,000
Maybe it's just because of the scene in Goldmember, but I feel like if they

435
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,120
lost weight they would look exactly like Goldmember at the end.

436
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,720
Well the announcer guy was a dude who had lost, he was an ex-sumo wrestler who had lost

437
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,720
weight.

438
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,720
Oh yeah.

439
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
And he looked to be about 180 years old.

440
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
But I think he was only like 4.

441
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,480
Yeah, they just had like a, they had his skin just like in a vacuum in the back so he looked

442
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,480
normal.

443
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,200
I mean, he looked exactly like Gabriel Iglesias.

444
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,200
Yeah.

445
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Like exactly.

446
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Like dressed like him the whole thing.

447
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
He had like the long shorts on.

448
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,640
I mean there's not a lot of options to dress like if you're a big guy.

449
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,040
You either look like that picture of like Big Pun in Fat Joe or you're wearing

450
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Hawaiian shirts.

451
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
I said the exact same thing last night.

452
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,760
I said that guy looks exactly like Big Pun.

453
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,640
But if I was that size, I think you have to go Big Pun, you have to wear a suit.

454
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,640
Yeah.

455
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,240
Well, he was wearing a Yankees hat and then he had like, you know how you do the towel?

456
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
The towel down the hat.

457
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,520
And the towel just said, "I want a beard."

458
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,520
It was so cool.

459
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:08,720
Dude, I'm telling you, this is the most fun thing ever.

460
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,440
screaming, yelling at the ref.

461
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,880
What the fuck is that?

462
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,360
Like, like screaming.

463
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,360
It was so much fun.

464
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,160
All the audience members look

465
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,480
vaguely like like famous people.

466
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,040
Yeah. Who were all in Friends at one

467
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,860
point. But they're like just a bit

468
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,440
uglier.

469
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,820
That's where I like the like the

470
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,560
impersonators in New York go.

471
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,880
Yeah.

472
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,520
The sumo thing.

473
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,920
Where impersonators exist here.

474
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,880
Oh, my buddy Charlie did this.

475
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,080
He like dropped this like clothing

476
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,160
line thing. And he got this pitbull

477
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,640
impersonator to like to emcee the whole thing. But the dude I have his business

478
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,480
card. We're not doing people impersonator again. We're not putting my

479
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,000
head. It's new to him. I just want to let him know. But this dude, a fat wallet

480
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,880
from even because he keeps it like it's like the this person isn't a real

481
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:03,120
website. Yeah, this guy is not exist. So Steven like the I don't know if I can

482
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,400
show you the website. Why? It's promo. That's true. Yeah. If you want a pitbull

483
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,160
impersonator in New York City, there's Steven, but there's a technical issue. You would kill

484
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:17,160
that by the way. Pitbull impersonator? I think that's racist. I think I can't do it. Yeah,

485
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,600
I don't think he can do it. No, surely you can do it. Because he's Cuban. You're the

486
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,680
same race. You're both Caleb Petito. I mean, he's whiter than me technically because he's

487
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:29,240
very pale, but I think because he's Miami Cuban, I can't do it. Yeah, but there's a

488
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:35,360
technical difficulty and the Pitbull impersonator was just trying to fill time. I got a video,

489
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,640
it's just him saying like pretty much every single food that the FDA says is

490
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,360
good for you is not. He's telling the truth. Yeah. This guy's like a butter

491
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,600
eater. He was like saying like agave is terrible for you, like any real shit,

492
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,240
like sweeteners and stuff. He's right. Dude, yeah, he was right, but it was just

493
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,600
like... He does the pit bull thing to like push his Monsanto. Maybe, maybe.

494
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,000
Oh, that'd be so sick if he was like

495
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,660
saying all that shit like don't eat any health food. What you need like yeah,

496
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,340
they genetically modify them for that's good. That's good. Yeah, it's like

497
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:13,900
Gattaca. Yeah, we make them better. We're making all the chickens bigger so

498
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,320
you can have like good football and yeah he's right. Some specific food he was

499
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,580
saying that you should never eat. That was very funny. I forgot you were there.

500
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,440
Yeah, it was like wheat or something. He was saying something like do not eat

501
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,740
never eat like rice or like there was some one specific thing that he was like

502
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:34,240
it will kill you. Oh, that's a big one for those like those like a carnivore like

503
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,380
kind of dudes. They say that there's like mold growing in rice silos.

504
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,720
Probably. I'm sure that's true. Yeah. That's how you wash it though. Yeah.

505
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,480
Okay.

506
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,340
So I think I probably would have the easiest time impersonating somebody because

507
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,680
there's just so many bald guys, you know, and people just,

508
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:51,280
you just got, you just have to go bald.

509
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,880
When I needed you for something, I was like, I need a cop.

510
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,280
I instantly thought of you as like,

511
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,320
even a non specific kind of thing. You know, I just doctor

512
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,620
maybe not doctor, evil doctor. I think I look to

513
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:08,020
maybe an evil doctor Disney Channel original movie doctor. Yeah, I can be I

514
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:12,420
can be evil. Any antagonist evil, anything plumber cop, any I don't know

515
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:16,720
how many how many people are trying to hire an evil something impersonator.

516
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,220
Yeah, it doesn't seem like really a well, maybe on October 31st, you get

517
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,220
the good guy first and then you get the even maybe you can break open the

518
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,500
industry, you actually become more evil. If you get a little hair and evil

519
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,100
super evil male strip,

520
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:36,980
I don't think I could be a stripper man, but you could be an evil one for sure.

521
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,140
The thing is about if you're a stripper, you have to like a male stripper. Have

522
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:44,460
you seen these videos? Always a cost to do man. It is disgusting. They pull

523
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:48,740
their clothes off. They pull, they take their clothes completely off. What is

524
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,700
going on man? Yeah, what else do you think they do? They put their penises

525
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,460
in girls faces and stuff. Yeah, that's the thing about a job is that there's

526
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:02,360
nothing going crazy with my that's true. Yeah, it's like they basically have to

527
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:07,100
do like an I'm not touching you. Yeah, exactly. These like forty five year old

528
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,220
women. Yeah, yeah, they're like

529
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:13,340
I'm not touching you. I'm not touching you. Yeah, and the thing is with girls

530
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,660
also is that they actually are more attracted to the

531
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,860
character girls like in general to when a guy goes, I'm not touching you. I'm

532
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:23,520
something they do like that you know you could do. You could be the dancing

533
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,900
bear guys. You know you know the one guy yeah, no, I kill a penis is you could

534
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,080
be really good at the party, maybe not as the guy

535
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,260
I'm the plant.

536
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:38,780
So clearly the

537
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:46,700
the me like no thing for a half a second.

538
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,200
different is

539
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,740
yeah. I what I mean

540
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,460
how to even do

541
00:27:53,460 --> 00:28:00,580
take off for wedding rings on each and being the guy at the very clearly

542
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,500
wants to be chosen.

543
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:06,780
We need a volunteer.

544
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:12,940
You keep moving to sit next to where they're headed yeah

545
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,620
and then when I don't get picked, I like unpack a lunch

546
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,380
eating soup out of

547
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,060
cold curry

548
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:26,980
so loudly. Oh my God, wait, no, this is really good. You ladies need to try

549
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,600
this. My dad made this

550
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:33,060
laying a beef jerky bite on the tip of your penis.

551
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:39,660
It's the new Doritos flavor. You got to try this.

552
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,660
the guy comes over with the like the big like fake head on the like mascot head

553
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,320
and you're just like terrified of

554
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,920
a

555
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,540
don't move.

556
00:28:53,540 --> 00:29:00,180
I'm hiking

557
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:08,860
hiking. You see the bear yeah. You see the dancing bear in the woods. You're

558
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:13,700
but to me, I come home and my mom's like, "How was your day?" It was kind of weird.

559
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,100
I sucked a bear's butt.

560
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:21,540
Well, no, I saw it on the internet that if you see a dancing bear in the woods, you got

561
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
to suck him up.

562
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,540
You got to suck his dick to scare it away.

563
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:29,020
It is funny that porn shows and movies, which is what I call them, they have extras.

564
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Films.

565
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Yeah.

566
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,540
But are those normal extras or do you just go...

567
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,020
Yeah, porn extras for sure.

568
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,700
Do you make a career as a porn extra?

569
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:42,100
I feel like it has to be a porn extra, because can you imagine just being a normal extra

570
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,220
and they're like, "Okay, we're going to cast you, but here's the thing, you're going to

571
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,220
be in a porn shoot."

572
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah, I would say.

573
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
I feel like some of them would do it.

574
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,220
I feel like it has to be separate.

575
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Well, they're the most desperate.

576
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,700
Well, extras in actual movies, they're told to do something.

577
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,540
It's like, "All right, you're riding your bike and then you stop to tie your shoe."

578
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:58,860
But porn extras, there's so many who clearly don't know where they are.

579
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,180
Somebody's trying to do something to us right now.

580
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,500
Oh, what's up?

581
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,820
No, we're good, man.

582
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,100
What are you doing?

583
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
Oh, I see.

584
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,100
He's hustling some window cleaning services.

585
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:11,360
No, no, we're all set man. Thank you. No, no, fuck out of here. Maybe he'll do my

586
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:11,720
phone.

587
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:16,100
The squeegee your phone. Yeah, that's not a bad idea. I brought him in here.

588
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,860
That guy kind of looked like a porn extra a little bit. Yeah, we're actually

589
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,580
like a porn star. I kind of had that rugged, you know, honestly, I know it

590
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,900
was because he had an occupation. I think if you're if you're in a and he

591
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:29,700
showed up at my door. Yeah, if you're in one of those dancing bear videos and

592
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:33,500
you need the guy to put whipped cream on his penis for you to suck it, you

593
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,540
shouldn't be in porn. Yeah, first of all, you should already want it. You

594
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,740
you don't like sex, you like sugar. You like sweets. You have a sugar addiction.

595
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,960
Yeah. I eat like the top off the muffin in that situation.

596
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:55,140
Homer Simpson.

597
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,260
Like a pinky swipe.

598
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:02,100
You can actually have the rest of it. Yeah, no, I don't want to.

599
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,020
No, but if you're like a porn extra, I feel like that's just like something you

600
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,480
like you either like walk in there by accident or like you were the creepiest

601
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,200
man in the world. You have been fooled. Yeah. If you either you those people are

602
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,160
walking in there by accident, probably just go to real strip clubs and then

603
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,960
just like keep the people who are in there in there and get involved, write

604
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,280
their name on a piece of paper. I don't know. Brace was saying that he like

605
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:32,000
ended up in a in a in a porn video by accident. Yeah, I don't know. There's a

606
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,160
video of him in the background of how did he do it by accident though? That's

607
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:49,160
he

608
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,200
It's a furry for sure. Like this is also furry porn. If you go to furry porn

609
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,280
category, you should be able to see Dancing Bear.

610
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:59,440
And now that I think about it, anything with a bear in it should also count.

611
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,040
So the bear...

612
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:05,600
The bear necessities. Well, look, he's got a snail on him. That's his snail

613
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,240
sona right there. Oh, okay. What does that say? It says snail. He's making

614
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,120
the face that I would make if I accidentally ended up at the Dancing

615
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,680
Bear shoot.

616
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,160
he looks like he's next in line. I thought this was just a normal back to

617
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,000
the rep party. I was speaking into

618
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:30,800
don't know that you guys have root beer, though.

619
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:36,060
Well, I guess if they have whipped cream, I came in here. I thought there

620
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,280
was

621
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:40,160
this is your face when you see the whipped cream go on the

622
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:46,080
for sure that you're guys, but I'm so hungry, me wondering

623
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,000
how I'm going to finish all that whip cream. That's a dilemma. Okay, say you're

624
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,960
type two diabetic, right, and you go to the Dancing Bear shoot and you're

625
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,940
supposed to just be an extra, they're paying you 50 bucks, but that whip cream

626
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:59,440
comes out and you're, you're fucking excellent. You get a beep on your little

627
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,440
fucking Tamagotchi thing they got. Does anybody have any Skittles? No, no, no.

628
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,480
All we got is whip cream on this guy's cock. Yeah, well,

629
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,960
it's saving my own life.

630
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,040
Yeah.

631
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:13,800
Yeah, that could save someone's life that day. It could. Yeah, it really could.

632
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:17,720
someone like in the middle of New York is like having a diabetic episode and

633
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,580
yeah, yeah, the dancing bear guy have

634
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,040
there a doctor on the plane? No, but I'm the dancing bear guy with cream.

635
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,160
The guy with the dancing bear guy is putting the whip cream on his cock and

636
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,820
you're like, oh, can I just have some of that whip cream? Like I'm diabetic. I

637
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,200
really need that and he's like he just put the entire thing

638
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,120
can you just spray some on my mouth? It's like a mouth keeps going. Well,

639
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:42,600
that's it's like he's taking a bubble bath. If I was a if I was a dancing bear

640
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,660
time my penis was smaller than it needed to be for the thing I'm going

641
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,240
fifteen

642
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:55,420
holding pure whip cream. The girls are eating it and confused. Why there's

643
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,020
nothing under

644
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,340
it fall on the floor.

645
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:03,720
I have to go to the hospital. I guess you better suck what's left

646
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,140
that's got to be whatever it did. Yeah, yeah, with creamer nobody gets abused

647
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,620
Pretty much nobody, right?

648
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,580
Probably less than one person per year.

649
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,180
In the world, total.

650
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,740
Yeah, there's only one person of abuse in America.

651
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,140
I read that this morning.

652
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,700
We have a classic style episode today for you.

653
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,700
What's that mean?

654
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,700
Where we have a list.

655
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,700
We have an actual list.

656
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:31,380
An actual list, just like old school style, back in the day style.

657
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,940
We're not doing any kind of crazy concept episode.

658
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:38,300
Nick isn't dressed up as a dancing bear, although that would have been a pretty easy way to

659
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
do this.

660
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,300
I wish I would have been ahead of the bit.

661
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,500
- What do we have?

662
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,540
- We have a monkey mask.

663
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,740
- You have a monkey mask?

664
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,860
- I'll do anything basically.

665
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:46,300
- You could have been in this one.

666
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,820
- Yeah, that monkey mask has been on the floor.

667
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,660
We won't make you wear that.

668
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,500
- You don't want that monkey mask on you.

669
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,940
- There's probably a literal flea.

670
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:52,940
- Have I ever told you guys how I found your podcast?

671
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,780
- No. - No.

672
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,620
- You looked up monkey mask?

673
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:56,780
- I looked up dancing bear videos.

674
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,300
(laughing)

675
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:02,980
So Anthony Slime, he sent me you guys kind of randomly once

676
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,900
and it was like, "These guys are funny,

677
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,920
you should listen to them."

678
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,100
And I got 15 minutes into one of your episodes

679
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,100
and I messaged him back and I said, "No, they're not."

680
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,340
(laughing)

681
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,580
- You gotta get 20 minutes in,

682
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,900
'cause that's when the circle can weigh in.

683
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:18,220
- And then I felt, I actually felt guilty.

684
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,020
I was like, well, I was kinda unfair.

685
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,260
I thought you could pick any 15 minute thing,

686
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,580
of anything I've done in my whole life,

687
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,340
and I might look like the most unfunny person in the world.

688
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,460
And so I finished the episode,

689
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,580
and I think it was the one where you said,

690
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:33,380
I remember he was conflicted in Yoda's voice.

691
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,220
- Oh, that was it.

692
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,060
- Oh, yeah.

693
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,780
- And that was the funniest thing I'd ever heard.

694
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,820
We had a couple of months of doing Yoda.

695
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,820
Yeah.

696
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:40,820
Yoda anything.

697
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,460
We haven't had a thing that we've been obsessed with in a while.

698
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:45,460
Yeah.

699
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,380
We used to have months long stretches of the we can only do one thing.

700
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,380
Yeah.

701
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,900
And we kind of haven't had one in a minute.

702
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,100
I think it's because we haven't been going to bars as much.

703
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,100
It's true.

704
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
Yeah.

705
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,860
Our show doesn't usually get obsessed with stuff, but we got really obsessed with the

706
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:01,660
idea of throwing a child pageant and everyone hated it.

707
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Everyone hated it a lot.

708
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,660
Obsessed with it.

709
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,380
And then we had to stop doing it.

710
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:13,680
fine. It's not for it's not for kids. It's it's for adults for adults,

711
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,280
yeah, but it's only adult. Some of those exist in some places. So it's

712
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,480
adults going on stage. So it's like a B. D. O. Pagent. Is that what you're

713
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,000
saying? Yes, I don't know. A B. O. Is what adult baby diaper lover? Yes,

714
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,320
yes, it's like that. It's like that. It's child dressing as kids. Okay,

715
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,320
yeah, but it's called the child pageant for adults. Yeah, and it's grown men

716
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:39,240
some like little bowl. I think you guys are catching on. Let no one like now,

717
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,400
but we did it for like ten episodes.

718
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:46,980
We had a ten episode stretch where all we talked about with this and all the

719
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:49,780
comments were just like, please stop doing this. The thing is, what are they

720
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:53,140
going to do? I'm unable to show this podcast to anyone anymore. I'm unable to

721
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,460
you had people yelling at you for your child pageant idea, but I think you

722
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:00,420
should feel lucky, because I do know that at least one guy was killed for his

723
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:04,020
child pageants for adults. His name was Jeffrey Epstein. That could have been a

724
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,080
lot worse. That's real shit. You could have been in big trouble. That's why he

725
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:12,600
was killed. Yeah. Yeah. He was having child pageants. Yeah. Anyway, so so so

726
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,240
we got that's all I found you guys. I thought you're funny. So now we're here.

727
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,960
So our list today is so I found this this website, this blog we and this is

728
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,920
having done a blog in a minute. This is a blog called box of my stuff and this is

729
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:32,160
what it says at the top of the website. It is really my own cooked up top ten

730
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,220
lists, sometimes serious, usually tongue in cheek. Please click on a bunch of

731
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:40,580
advertisers somewhere. I will get blessings in advertiser heaven. Click on

732
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,300
the follower section and become a fan with a reminder. It's easy and sometimes

733
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,660
fun. Thanks. Ever have a sometimes fun. I might have wrote maybe two blog posts

734
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,540
on a blog ten thousand times in middle school. Yeah, I had a blog in middle

735
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,340
school. You guys could make this your podcast description and it would just

736
00:37:56,340 --> 00:38:00,100
kind of work. That's true. Yeah, if you just know under that, it really is my

737
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,120
Have you put all that in there?

738
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,120
Is this really my own cooked up top ten list?

739
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:06,120
We are usually tongue in cheek I'd say.

740
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,120
Sometimes fun.

741
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Do you have any info about the guy who made this?

742
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,120
He lives in Salt Lake City.

743
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,120
Okay.

744
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,120
So he's maybe a latter day saint?

745
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,120
He likes ELO.

746
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,120
Oh okay.

747
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,120
God what else about him?

748
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,120
I didn't put in the about section because it was just

749
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,120
details about his life.

750
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,120
But that's what I remember from it.

751
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:33,280
that he makes he makes basically only top ten lists, and so this one here is

752
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,820
blank. It basically doesn't exist

753
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:42,060
okay, ten rhymes that might be true or probably not as he says list he made. I

754
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,380
remember a famous court case that seemed to hinge on the rhyme. If the glove

755
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:51,020
don't fit, you must equip it wasn't true. In fact, the logic there is so

756
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:54,960
hilariously faulty that it's amazing that it got any traction at all, yet we

757
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,220
find that if there's a rhyme involved, then something is probably true. It

758
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:01,720
makes no sense at all, but people love a good rhyme, which is always seem to need

759
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:05,100
a rhyme to get a spell or incantation to work, but only if it's spoken in

760
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:09,660
English. Latin spells don't seem to need to rhyme. I'm not sure why. Anyway, I

761
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:12,980
decided to come up with some to prove the fact that rhymes are not indicator of

762
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:16,700
truth or anything really, except the ability to use words that sound similar.

763
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:20,780
I do, I mean it is anything's going to be a little more convincing if you're

764
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:27,740
Yeah, we love rhymes. I love rhyming. I mean, that's but that's because we have a kind of a root in hip-hop

765
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:33,120
I would say that yeah, I would honestly say that this podcast is grown out of hip-hop really

766
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:38,100
Yeah, we're like kind of a branch. We're doing like like a rhyme Sayers kind of podcast. Yeah

767
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:41,180
We're the next the next thing. Mm-hmm the next

768
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,820
Ironically think this is smart as fuck

769
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:49,020
I actually I'm thinking about this diff for the first time like if a witch were to do a spell in English and it rhymed

770
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:52,180
rhymed and then they just like did it in Spanish like wouldn't work because

771
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,420
it doesn't rhyme. Yeah, it definitely wouldn't work. That's fine. That's

772
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,340
why I've never thought about that. Not even also there's no Spanish witches.

773
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:01,700
Yeah, no, no, they don't know. I've never heard of that. No, no. What do

774
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:07,700
you think David Blaine is? Wow, wow. Is he Spanish? He's some kind of ish.

775
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:12,580
Yeah, that's a question for you. He's magish. He's a magician. Magician. He's

776
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,700
a Spanishian. So yeah, here's some rhymes that this guy came up with that

777
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,840
aren't true. Okay, prove that rhymes don't make something true.

778
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,360
If the car won't start, then use a cart

779
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:30,080
cart makes the rhyme, but honestly a bike is better like a go cart. Okay,

780
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,240
well, I was thinking shopping cart yeah, well yeah, I says cart with a C and I

781
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:37,560
think go. I mean to play a smart, I feel like you have to play devil's advocate

782
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,920
with any yeah, of course that's what I would want to do and the devil's a

783
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,980
rhymer. The devil's one of the all time rhymers, but a cart is going to work

784
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:59,860
not

785
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,860
your wife on the back for half the ride?

786
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,140
Have you guys ever ridden? You know what I've never done?

787
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:07,180
I've never ridden on the handlebars of a bike.

788
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,220
I've been on the pegs. I don't think I have either.

789
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,580
I guess I've been on the pegs. Yeah, but I don't think I've been on the front.

790
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,740
No, I've never been on the handlebars.

791
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,100
I saw a group of kids doing doing three on a bike, one on the front,

792
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,220
one on the pegs on the back.

793
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,700
That's how bad the economy is.

794
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,860
Yeah, we have three kids. Kids can't afford three bikes.

795
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,460
The fuck's going on? It's so fucked up, man. It's really fucked up.

796
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,380
I put pegs on my bike when I was younger.

797
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,740
I never learned how to grind.

798
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,140
I just really I wanted someone to do the thing where they hold my shoulders.

799
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,140
You wanted an E.T.

800
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,500
Yeah, so bad. I never got it.

801
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,140
You wanted it. Is it cool to ride on the front or the back?

802
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,740
It's way cool. It's not cool to ride on the front.

803
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,340
I don't know. It's not right now.

804
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,540
It's a power thing. You're essentially a horse.

805
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,260
Yeah, it's a power thing.

806
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,380
I guess I got back, though.

807
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,180
You're right. You're right.

808
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:48,900
You're an airbag.

809
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,260
The front is the third wheel.

810
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:52,100
That's that's like we're being cool.

811
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,580
I'm sitting in the seat and this guy's holding onto my shoulders.

812
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,180
Yeah. I'm like, wait, guys, I want to come to.

813
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,100
Yeah, he's chasing. He's essentially chasing.

814
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,380
Also, if you ride on the pegs, you can definitely just run behind if you fall

815
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:05,220
off and stay attached to somebody's shoulders. You can ghost ride, you can

816
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,260
like jump off, jump back on. That's the only plus, I guess. That'd be so sick,

817
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,740
ghost riding your friend's bike.

818
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:17,100
Alright, here's the next rhyme. Kill a fly, thwart a spy. If that spy happens

819
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,860
to be using a robot fly. So this one seems true. He seems like he's making

820
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:25,300
it true. Yeah, once you add that, it makes complete sense. Even without that,

821
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,720
got a fly fly on the wall. That would be the best rap name. If I was from New

822
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:33,840
York and I kill a fly, kill a fly kill, kill a fly, I think you're going to say

823
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,960
a robot fly

824
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,140
not a good

825
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,620
really bad

826
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:46,200
robot robot fly robot fly. You then you'd have to like add more stuff to

827
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,820
make it sound cool from prison

828
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:50,060
to rob a fly from

829
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:53,400
the fly from prison is just

830
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:00,800
yeah, but if bugs could talk, they would know so much stuff about us.

831
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:06,620
If they could talk, they would well, they are I think they could hear well,

832
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:10,420
they already can hear well, not now their wings are too loud. I've ears,

833
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,120
I think they have ears, they'd be like they'd be saying like poop is

834
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,440
delicious. Well, basically yeah, they don't care about it. I love shit. They

835
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,300
tell everyone what you're throwing away yeah, this guy just threw out a condom

836
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:25,280
yeah, yeah, and they know what you're doing. Yeah, they know all about your

837
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,320
poop. They know everything about you. You think that's the thing you think

838
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,660
they would only do you think that they're kind of keeping in their

839
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,780
business. They're looking in the trash. They're looking at your poop. They're

840
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,620
going to your armpit, but you think that would be nosy. I think they already

841
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,340
know everything and they just don't have a way to convey. They can smell your

842
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:42,280
gut biome from a mile away and they know that you are trying to go inside

843
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:43,280
my realistic.

844
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:49,040
It a fly also has nothing to lose because it lives for a week. That's you

845
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:53,580
I'm true with it. Thank God flies. I would be blackmailing me terrorists. Yeah,

846
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:58,280
flies could speak English and convert to religions and causes. They would be

847
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,780
purely every fly would have a bomb. Yep. How do flies observe time? Do they know

848
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:07,280
it's a week? Does it feel like our week? Or is it like a lot slower? 90 years?

849
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,380
What if it goes really way even fast? What if a flies life like I would prefer

850
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:15,880
if life was like that for me, like if it was only a week long, but but like the

851
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:20,320
jump from like Monday to Friday was like 70 years in my head. You should watch that

852
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:25,880
Queen Latifah movie. Quixi? No, the one that's like where she thinks she has

853
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:31,320
cancer. Oh yeah yeah yeah. I know that one. That's a fire movie. I watched that with my

854
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:33,960
friend's mom. She's like fuck I have cancer what should I do? I'm gonna go

855
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,320
skiing. Isn't it called ski trip or something? No it's called 10 days or 20

856
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,880
days or four weeks or something. It's called Queen Latifah's vacation. 28 days later? No it's not 28 days later.

857
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,880
my business. She got cancer and it spreads around the world or something

858
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,180
like that for sure. Yeah,

859
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:54,380
if the food won't heat, then eat a beat. I would probably rather eat cold food.

860
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:58,880
He just doesn't like beats. Is that I guess he doesn't like beats and also I

861
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,460
also not sure what the situation is. If the food won't heat, I don't know what

862
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,980
that means. I think I can heat basically anything in the world. If the food

863
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:10,240
won't heat, you have a much larger problem. Yeah, it's pretty crazy. That

864
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,860
is the beat to like it. Well, eating a beat won't fix your microwave, so if it

865
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:19,320
won't eat the food he's right that that would not work. Yeah, I mean this one he

866
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,840
is right about yeah, he is right about this one. It's hard to argue with that a

867
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:26,800
friend in need is a friend with weed. He did not come only in Colorado slash

868
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,600
Washington and honestly if he is in need and with weed, then what he needs is

869
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,060
probably a bag of tacos.

870
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:38,300
That's real shit. He's true. He's he's spitting there. He really is. I think

871
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:43,380
this guy's in need of maybe a rehab facility. Yeah, I think this guy's in

872
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:48,260
made of a publisher. I think you should be writing non fiction. A book not read

873
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,740
fills you with dread. I see so many bookies in quotes that have this strange

874
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:56,420
pride in reading. This is for them. It's probably true for them, unless of course

875
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,900
that book is a compendium of my blog entries. Yeah, I mean if you take a look

876
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,060
at this photo, this is a ridiculous library. This would fill me with dread.

877
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:09,620
Yeah, this room in my house. Well, yeah, then stop fucking buying books. I can't

878
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,020
help it. If your house already looks like this, get these goddamn books.

879
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,580
If your house already looks like this, you might as well buy more books.

880
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:20,020
What are you gonna do? One time I did... Maybe read them? When I was

881
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,100
working construction, we did a house rehab on this hoarder house and shit,

882
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,960
and they had a room that looked like this, and I was thinking it was

883
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,720
all just gonna be

884
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:33,460
useless, just random garbage books that this person had collected over the

885
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:38,660
years, but it was all books. It was like, Yes, Please by Amy Poehler,

886
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:43,860
Stephen Colbert's book, John Stewart's books. It was only like the manual.

887
00:46:43,860 --> 00:46:48,880
Literally the UCB manual. It was all like the worst, most annoying guys ever,

888
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,060
just like his collection of the shittiest books in the world. Oh man, it

889
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,340
was so cool. Yeah.

890
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:59,900
Let's see here. Eat a small pie, then you won't die. Later found to not be

891
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:04,220
nearly as effective as the apple a day, but better than a large pie, I guess.

892
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:07,700
That's fire. Neither of these miracle foods will actually keep you from an

893
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:13,300
eventual death. A small pie is not a miracle food. I don't think I think

894
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,980
this guy's making up this whole miracle of it's really if you took the one out

895
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:19,940
of the middle, these would look like bagel bites. Yeah, one to one yeah, I've

896
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:23,740
had a big one. If I had if I had shit, if I was in like holes and I had a bunch

897
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,100
of little pies, I think I would live. I think I would yeah, I would survive off

898
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,980
that. Why is you wouldn't have to eat the sploosh if you're in holes? Oh yeah,

899
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:35,620
the sploosh. Yeah, that shit looked amazing. It did look good. The sploosh

900
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:41,080
onions. These kids were eating good. I want to be in Holder's. Those are like 1 million

901
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,760
year old pickled onions or some shit. Plus you make a wrap at the end. This is the best

902
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:49,960
movie ever. You get to wrap with Shia. Yeah. I've always wanted to wrap with Shia. Le Bluf.

903
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,760
Dude, being able to cypher with Shia. Oh my god. He's actually, he did like, didn't he

904
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:58,040
do like Sway in the Morning? Yeah, he did the five fingers. Yeah, yeah. He did five fingers

905
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:02,040
of death? I'm pretty sure. I might be making this up. That is so sick. I think that happened

906
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:05,560
maybe like a week before all that shit dropped about him. Did he smash it?

907
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:08,920
Didn't he steal it or something? Didn't he maybe plagiarize his

908
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,400
plagiarize like so much shit and then he was like, but it's all performance.

909
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:18,440
So funny to be an actor and plagiarize. Yeah, like you just have to act. You

910
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,760
don't even have to come up with anything. Yeah, you do what someone else

911
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,880
tells you to do. Stop doing all that. You don't need to be. I don't think

912
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,400
actor, I don't think we should know anything about actors, not even their

913
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,360
names. Yeah, they should always just be that guy. Yeah, the guy from this,

914
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,580
the guy from that. Like Vincent Schiaffaro or whatever. I don't know what you're on about.

915
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:39,520
Is that a character actor? Yeah, he's like that one. If you saw a picture of him. The

916
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,460
funny looking guy that's in all the funny comedy movies? He's like the teacher in Better

917
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:48,540
Off Dead. Oh no, I'm thinking of the Greatest Extra Ever, you know that guy? The like curly

918
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,300
haired fat kid who always plays like a kid in the hallway. Yeah, but I know exactly who

919
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,660
you're talking about. He's in the music video for Simple Plan, I'm Just a Kid. Yeah, there's

920
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:59,780
a bunch of, there's like a, and he's been doing it for like 20 years and there's a YouTube

921
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:04,380
video that's all of his appearances as a fat kid with a striped polo walking around a high

922
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,380
school.

923
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,380
Dude, he does so much work.

924
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,380
That's sick.

925
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,380
He gets it in.

926
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,460
That has to be maybe the most rewarding thing ever as an actor is to get a super cut.

927
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,460
Yeah, absolutely.

928
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,140
That has to be the best feeling in the world.

929
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:16,140
That's better than an Oscar.

930
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:17,140
100%.

931
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:18,140
That was Vincent Chiaffe.

932
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:20,660
Oh, he's in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.

933
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:25,340
He's like the really tall guy with the, he looks like, if they made him Dracula, he would

934
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,020
be the perfect Dracula.

935
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:28,020
But only if they made him Dracula.

936
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,020
If they made him Dracula.

937
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:35,100
him when he was alive. If they made him the perfect Dracula, he is the face of a

938
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:36,080
perfect Dracula.

939
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:37,940
But now he's dead.

940
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:43,140
Give some money to a bum and he'll give you some gum.

941
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,640
Wow.

942
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:51,900
You can just say that about all this other stuff. No, I won't. You guys know

943
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,220
what that thing is? Bum gum? That's the... The shock tube? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I

944
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:00,760
remember that that's that you know what man I'm never going to fall for that

945
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:05,500
again. The shot I'm putting my foot down. I have fallen for this shit too many

946
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:09,580
fucking times in my life. I would love to invent a type of shotgun. That's the

947
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:14,260
like the like cylinder, the like eclipse, the one that comes in the plastic like

948
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,300
canister thing instead of like so you you fully reach in and as a

949
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,620
like all the little the little like pellet. Do you guys remember when I had a

950
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,120
prank gum that I was walking around with? No. I remember your fake poop.

951
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:31,820
Wow. That wasn't his. God, I'm so good at pranks. That's an American classic.

952
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:34,620
That was, you know, you got pranked by fake poop. Yeah. I pranked him first

953
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:38,620
though. I put the fake poop in his sweatshirt hood and he walked around to

954
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:41,620
Walmart with it just hanging out for like an hour. He got pranked so hard that

955
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:43,620
he got mad. And threw the poop in the ocean.

956
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:49,220
That's a, it was just an emotional response. You got, you actually, I, but I

957
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,220
didn't think that it was poop. See, you thought it was poop. I thought, yes, it

958
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:58,100
was poop for you thought straight up. I got I did think it was poop. It did look

959
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,160
just like poop. It was shiny like it was through a car window. Yeah, it was the

960
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:06,180
car window that was doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Yeah, it was good. If I

961
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:09,400
saw that with the door open, I would have been like, oh, that's a fake poop,

962
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:13,560
but the car window, the poop in the sweatshirt hood lasted much longer and

963
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:17,560
was even funnier. It wasn't funny. It was much, much funnier. I wasn't because

964
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,900
everyone was there. People pointing at you at Piggly Wiggly and they don't know

965
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:26,380
that. Yeah, we were watching you like walking around the store. We were all

966
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,040
walking behind you, just walking like...

967
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,600
No, you weren't. No.

968
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,040
Seeing you just going like... You didn't even notice.

969
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:37,540
No, nobody was, nobody... People were high fiving us. Nobody high fiving.

970
00:51:37,540 --> 00:51:38,600
Nobody didn't even know.

971
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:42,060
Great prank. Bro, it's alright. We went to sumo night. It's alright. Yeah, so

972
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:44,020
it's sumo night. They'll never have that. They'll never have that. I bet you

973
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:47,020
didn't check in your hood when you were at sumo night, though. God fucking

974
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:47,900
damn it, you're right.

975
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:53,600
he could have pooped you fall on a stick, loose blood quick, depending on the

976
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,900
angle of the stick. When you hit it, this one is actually probably true.

977
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,660
So why and put it in your list man? I appreciate him. No, he's like kind of

978
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,620
showing his vulnerabilities. Yeah, like he's like enforcing his argument, but

979
00:52:04,620 --> 00:52:07,920
I'm not always I'm not a know it all. I don't know exactly about all the time

980
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,260
yeah and I just be fucking lying yeah exactly. I could just be lying about all

981
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:16,140
this stuff on this list. I could all be fucking true. Yeah, he's just he's just

982
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:19,680
try to make a blog yeah. He's just trying to make an interesting blog. I will say

983
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,480
man it's hard to fill up a blog. It is hard amazing people do it. If your face

984
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,120
is on money, then your future is sunny, not likely you're already dead.

985
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:32,380
So this could easily be fixed by saying if you have money, then your future is

986
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,960
yeah yeah. I have to say if your face is on money, he kind of this one. He kind

987
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,920
of engineered to fail. I think I agree

988
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:43,880
walking a mile will make you smile is the double one walking a mile will make

989
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:47,800
make you smile. If you have to go poo, then try walking to failed exercise

990
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,240
motivation at best. Personally, this one's bullshit because the first part is

991
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,680
true.

992
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:56,120
Walking a mile will make you smile. The second part is very false, though. Yeah,

993
00:52:56,120 --> 00:53:00,600
no, that's what no, that's not no, no, no, you can you can halt a poop.

994
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:05,880
Walking makes you want me to poop more. No, you can hold pooping. A mock makes

995
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:09,480
you want to poop for a hundred percent. Not me, man. It's you walk in a weird

996
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,480
way, then yeah,

997
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:13,640
like that the whole way.

998
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:16,640
That's what you're supposed to do. If you can't poop, you're supposed to go walk

999
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,280
around. Really? Yeah, if you're constipated, like run and walk, it makes

1000
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,040
you poop. Huh? I may have just made that up. Yeah, I think you made that up.

1001
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:28,640
That's true. That's real. That's real shit. It's completely. It's real shit.

1002
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:33,520
There you go. Any truth in these rhymes is purely coincidental. Next time you

1003
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,040
hear someone using a rhyme in an effort to prove a point, just remember if he

1004
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,480
uses a rhyme, it'll take more time. That one is probably true. Yeah, that one is

1005
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,480
through. I mean this guy really full circle, pretty poor argument. I'd say

1006
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,580
yeah kind of kind of sucks at a rhyme. Well, if you think that one sucked us,

1007
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,300
this one is going to blow your mind. Here's a here's the second list from

1008
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:57,420
this guy's website. Ten top ten ideas for in my God, we like rhymes. We like

1009
00:53:57,420 --> 00:54:02,680
inventions. This guy he's right up our alley. This is a better mouse trap and

1010
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:06,140
the world will beat a path to your door. At least that's what they say that day

1011
00:54:06,140 --> 00:54:07,460
is Ralph Waldo Emerson.

1012
00:54:09,020 --> 00:54:12,380
didn't build mouse traps. He wrote the sentiment is still the same.

1013
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:15,920
Everyone has an idea about how to make things better. Ninety nine percent of

1014
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,280
these ideas are stupid and not well thought out. Oh, but that miraculous one

1015
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,840
percent is truly amazing. The fact is you have to wade through quite a bit of

1016
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,680
the ninety nine percent in order to actually get to the one percent. We have

1017
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:31,020
had some great inventions in our time and those great inventions build on even

1018
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:35,760
greater innovations. This guy's a genius. We live in an age of excess for less

1019
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,040
thanks to invention slash innovation. We now live better lives than all the kings

1020
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,000
of antiquity. All they had was good food and a soft bed. We would be very mad if

1021
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,160
that's all we had now. Well, my inventions are not life changing ideas

1022
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,360
that will turn society on its head. Instead, they are minor contrivances

1023
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:54,480
designed to make my easy life even easier. I don't think that we, I don't

1024
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,800
think we live better than any king. I don't think so. Yeah, no, we don't rule

1025
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:02,360
over anyone. We can't, you can't kill people. You have to eat a normal amount

1026
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,800
food. Also the king has like a king of antiquity would have like at least some

1027
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:13,260
thought in their mind that they are going to discover a new type of magic or

1028
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:15,960
something. Yeah. Holy grail. Yeah, exactly.

1029
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:21,200
Of cholera or ancient STD or a bear that gets into your palace that you don't

1030
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,720
have the technology to kill yet is all completely dwarfed, I think, by if you're

1031
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,440
a king, there's a million people whose only job is to make you happy and rich.

1032
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:34,560
Yeah, that's all they do. 24/7. You have a poison taster tester. Yeah, come on, man.

1033
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:38,880
How do you beat that? You're in the possible holidays like like holiday

1034
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:46,880
power King's Day. Yep. King is the first one that King is getting a bath day.

1035
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,720
I don't think everyone in the town has to celebrate you washing your ass. I

1036
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,160
don't think this would be a holiday. Patrick. Here's the invention. Maybe in

1037
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,520
my kingdom number one shrink wrap present wrapping. So this idea is a

1038
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:00,160
pretty easy one. It was made for guys like me that think present wrapping is

1039
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,680
for the birds. You just have colored patterns on a bag made out of heat wrap,

1040
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:07,840
drop whatever you want to, wrap in, pick up the blow dryer, and bingo bongo

1041
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:12,000
instant wrapped present. That's actually such a good idea. I hate to give him the

1042
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:15,600
first one. Yeah, I know. Maybe I think that all of them are going to be good if

1043
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,480
this is the first one. This is a pretty good idea. It's really not. Do you find

1044
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,720
yourself in a situation often where you're like, "Man, I don't want to wrap

1045
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,720
this gift, but I have this blow dryer." In Christmas time. I don't even know how

1046
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,720
I had a rapid present. Well, that's the problem is I can't wrap it. A present.

1047
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,400
The problem is I'm always gifting my fucking hair dryers.

1048
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,100
Yeah, where's that? Oh wait, okay, I got it all right. How do you wrap with

1049
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:39,680
this one? You when you want to wrap your hair dryer? Yeah, I guess that's to

1050
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,960
say what if I want to turn it on there's and tape dispenser. You turn it on,

1051
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:48,120
turn it on, throw it in the bag. Yeah, oh my God, it's self wraps every present

1052
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,840
when you buy something as a gift. It comes with a gift receipt, but also

1053
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,280
comes with a built in heat, heat creator. Yes, I

1054
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,920
use turn on this. You put it in the wrapping, you turn on the switch and it

1055
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:01,840
generates heat and it shrink shrink wraps itself. I don't even know how shrink

1056
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:05,880
wrap works and I don't even want to know. No, me neither. One of the one of

1057
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,480
those things in life that if I know it, I'll just my life would be way worse.

1058
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:09,720
Yeah,

1059
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:14,400
number two Philadelphia cream cheese, easy style. This guy is fat.

1060
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:17,160
This is a fat, fat

1061
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,120
that is crazy. I don't want to comes up with a

1062
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,340
as your second invention

1063
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:28,420
cream cheese in a tuna toothpaste tube. That's your mention yeah it listen to

1064
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:31,540
this. So there are there. I am in the office and someone has been kind enough

1065
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:34,380
to bring bails and little tubs of cream cheese. I'm spreading the cream cheese

1066
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,240
on my bagel and it hits me. They have cheese and pressurized cans for

1067
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,120
spreading on crackers. Why not cream tree cream cheese and pressurized cans

1068
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,880
for bagels? It makes perfect sense. I mean it makes sense, but don't do it.

1069
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,020
This guy is thinking fat enough that he's whole he's holding a bagel in his

1070
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,900
man he's spreading cream cheese on it and he's like Fox spreading this cream

1071
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:51,780
cheese is taking so

1072
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:56,580
when the when the dancing mayor tore makes it to Wisconsin. Yeah, yeah,

1073
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,900
there's a switch over

1074
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:04,580
here's his third idea. New Christmas Day

1075
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:10,860
this guy. This guy is like a like probably like over a hundred, maybe

1076
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:14,860
around two hundred top ten list on his blog. I would say at least thirty of

1077
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:19,900
more about Chris. What he's an adult, this is not a child. This is a swing

1078
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:25,220
in for the fences, do just the perfect like like oh yeah, like here's my top

1079
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,740
three inventions already

1080
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,340
heat wrap Christmas present

1081
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:34,140
new Christmas. Yeah, I don't think I don't think I would even say this is an

1082
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:36,640
invention is my problem. Well, do you know what day he wants to switch

1083
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,020
Christmas to? I don't, but will you tell me Valentine's Day? Yo there's no snow.

1084
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:45,720
well, yeah, what are you talking about? It's February. Here's what he says. I

1085
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:48,300
don't know any druids, but I bet they wouldn't mind us taking our copy of

1086
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:51,020
their holiday and moving it to Valentine's Day. Much easier to find

1087
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:53,440
snow and the other two holidays that surround Christmas will gain more

1088
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,840
meaning Thanksgiving and New Year's. So he thinks that Christmas is devaluing

1089
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,580
Thanksgiving and New Year's, but New Year's, thanks and my girl stop on two

1090
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:07,020
gifts every year. That's true. Yeah, yeah, so this is so that's so

1091
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:12,000
to the end of it. He says I'm not sure how you go about getting this changed,

1092
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,380
but I think it's a good idea. This would mean you need like a petition. Yeah,

1093
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:16,640
you need something

1094
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:22,300
led lights around skate tracks. My son dabbles in speed skating. He has a son.

1095
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:26,220
Yeah, he's a full of his whole family. I've watched a bit here and there and I

1096
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:29,080
noticed that they superimposed on the ice, the flag and the name of the

1097
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:32,180
skater as they go by. This is great for the folks at home, but it sucks for the

1098
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:36,480
lat for the live audience and he says they should have little led chaser

1099
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:38,580
lights embedded in the ice. They could be deep enough that they

1100
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,720
wouldn't impede skating, but they could shine the different

1101
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,020
color for each skater. They could even light up based on the

1102
00:59:43,020 --> 00:59:45,480
fastest time. So you knew what you needed to be. This one I

1103
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:47,520
do is too specific. I don't even know what he's talking

1104
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,360
about. That probably means it's the only invention that is

1105
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,920
maybe a good one. Yeah, this one's also this is for his

1106
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,100
family. This one's based on love. This one is less

1107
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,040
necessity. All right, this one's a ten out of ten. I think

1108
00:59:58,040 --> 00:59:58,900
in terms of

1109
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:03,900
he's a in terms of that a hopeless romantic. Yeah, I have

1110
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,540
I give him I have to give him this one is an Edison yeah

1111
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:12,420
LCD window shader. I had this one a long time ago, but I've seen it in practice

1112
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,720
since then. I actually saw it on Knight Rider. The old one is a picture of David

1113
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,140
Hasselhoff. Yeah, you adjust the LCD slider and the shading of your window

1114
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,460
changes from clear to dark. I know they have it, but I had my idea around

1115
01:00:22,460 --> 01:00:25,060
nineteen eighty four. Yeah, I know a day like you have like

1116
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:29,100
you have like ideas like that, where you're like it like come something comes

1117
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:32,700
out and then you're like oh fuck. I didn't even like I had that idea. I

1118
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:37,280
never wrote it down for me. Mine was when I was thirteen years old. We were

1119
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:42,500
watching that movie, that Mel Gibson movie, The Patriot in social studies,

1120
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:45,420
and I think I turned to my friend and said like, what if they

1121
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,900
think it's great at this time period,

1122
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:54,140
but they made like the Assassin's Creed. That's a good idea of like the

1123
01:00:54,140 --> 01:00:58,380
Revolutionary War of then a year later that got announced and I was like man,

1124
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:01,580
I what they should do. Speaking of video game ideas, I just want everyone to

1125
01:01:01,980 --> 01:01:04,840
just know that I had this idea a long time ago and when it comes out,

1126
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:07,720
don't be surprised to people always been trying to steal my stuff left and

1127
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,920
right. It's basically a Dark Souls type game, but it's set in Jurassic Park and

1128
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:14,840
it's called Park Souls and you collect dinosaur DNA and you can become a

1129
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:19,840
dinosaur. Why the fuck that is so it's not a name is my problem. Park soul,

1130
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:25,240
the name is set in stone life. No, it's not about being in a park. Yes, it is.

1131
01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:29,400
It's set in a park. It sounds like a sim game. Yeah, well, it's not. It's a

1132
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:34,360
it's an action RPG. It could be called maybe Jurassic. It's not a

1133
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:38,200
Rassar. Listen, I would love to change the name, the juror. I wouldn't like to

1134
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:41,000
change the name. Clearly, I will. I probably wouldn't. I was saying that to

1135
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,200
appease you. I think they should do a an Assassin's Creed game in the one

1136
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:48,820
nine hundred and seventy. They should do it in the yeah yeah. Kill Cobain and

1137
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,680
shit yeah. Oh, that's the amazing. You do every twenty seven club guy.

1138
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:58,480
You're killing just every single twenty seven. It's a kill Jimmy Hendrix.

1139
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:02,680
quality time travel. Yeah, you killed him. A good idea for a movie. It's an

1140
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:05,860
amazing idea. You have to make him throw. You are the guy who does the

1141
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:09,380
twenty seven. You are the you're you're agent twenty seven. Yes, that's right.

1142
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:15,020
Oh my God, I'm an amazing writer. That's crazy. Yeah, you're giving bad

1143
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,400
reefer to Jimmy Hendrix. You got the bitch with the crazy voice. You're

1144
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:23,000
making him throw up. That's how he died. Ready choked on his. Yeah, maybe

1145
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:26,140
you maybe it's something we're like we all these people. If they turn twenty

1146
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:29,760
if they were going to realize something, they all had some kind of DNA.

1147
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,600
They were all... It's a Hitler baby thing.

1148
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:34,160
Yeah. All these people were one year away.

1149
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:36,240
They were all about to bring about world peace.

1150
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,280
Oh, you knew you have to put an end to it.

1151
01:02:38,280 --> 01:02:40,080
Yeah, that's a pretty good idea. With their music.

1152
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:41,840
Is that what you think Hitler was trying to do? No.

1153
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:43,520
That's what we were talking about.

1154
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,040
And you say this world peace thing. I was talking about

1155
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,640
Jimi Hendrix was trying to bring world peace, but...

1156
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:51,960
Yeah, I don't know. I completely blanked out

1157
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:53,560
because I was thinking about Jimi Hendrix.

1158
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:55,280
You heard the word Hitler, you blanked out.

1159
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:00,120
No, just the game, the part of the game where you are going up to like Jimmy

1160
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:04,720
Hendrix, you have to make him throw up. It has to has to be throw up. So you're

1161
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:08,260
just like walking up to him, just showing him like you're being gross.

1162
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:12,800
So

1163
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,320
my ass right now

1164
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:19,040
stinky, but my ass, this finger is in my butt smell.

1165
01:03:19,040 --> 01:03:22,880
That's actually I mean, I just think that's an amazing idea. That is such a

1166
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:26,720
good idea number six. We're not going to read this one. I just want to read the

1167
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:30,960
first that what the idea is the first sentence here medical testing like fast

1168
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,620
food that actually did happen with

1169
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:36,620
he means, but when he says medical testing like fast food, all he means is

1170
01:03:36,620 --> 01:03:38,300
that it should be more convenient

1171
01:03:38,300 --> 01:03:42,520
again he's in his brain. That means that's

1172
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:49,080
yeah, but that's what happened. It's like remember in like August, twenty

1173
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:52,680
twenty. You had to like go to like a CVS drive through window and they put your

1174
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:56,540
lock in. They put the swap. I stole this guy's idea. I've been meaning to talk

1175
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:02,100
about this for a while now that we now that we finally can the people who ran.

1176
01:04:02,100 --> 01:04:06,620
I think that they literally hired sadists to swab your nose. Yeah, they

1177
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:11,180
were going crazy. These people were touching my brain every time it hurts so

1178
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,420
bad. I'm sick of pretending it didn't hurt and it didn't make me cry for like

1179
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:19,780
five minutes afterwards. I did not like it. The worst part to me was when

1180
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:22,880
they're actively doing it and they and they stick it so far up your nose that

1181
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,360
there and there it was the drive through one. So they're you're leaning out the

1182
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,360
car window yeah and they stick it up your nose and you

1183
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:29,980
like a

1184
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:35,560
I told you guys about the one time I did a worse no time. I did it and the

1185
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,440
nurse lady was like the hottest girl I've ever seen in my entire life and she

1186
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:43,320
put the swab in my thing and pulled out like a booger the size of a golf ball

1187
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,640
and a gag.

1188
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:51,820
like, bitch, you do this all day. You've seen worse boogers. No way. This is the

1189
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,080
worst one. I mean, it was crazy. It was crazy. It must be so funny being like

1190
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,520
the, the nurses outside of the fucking COVID testing place just smoke, like

1191
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,000
chain smoking the bats, like, that's not a fucking booger. What kind of person is

1192
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:08,720
gagging at a booger? Yeah. Well, this, she's just in the wrong field. Yeah. I

1193
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,520
felt so left out. I, I was so afraid of getting my first COVID test, 'cause

1194
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,720
everyone's like, yeah, it's the fucking worst thing in the world. It's, it

1195
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,920
as much as your brain you want to die. And when I first got it, it was so easy.

1196
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:21,360
And then the next like eight times were all really easy. Oh my God.

1197
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,760
But it's just because no one went deep. Yeah.

1198
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:26,720
So I started to feel kind of annoyed. I think that's why I can handle it.

1199
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:31,120
The East Coast, these bitches were going hard. Yeah. They were hurting us.

1200
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:35,040
There was that one spot that we would, that one COVID testing place that we

1201
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:39,520
would all go to. The parking lot? No, no, the one that was on, I think it was on

1202
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,680
like off of Hemrod or something. And we would always go there. And every single

1203
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:47,600
time we went there, it was like, oh yeah, PCR negative, great. Then we'd all hang out.

1204
01:05:47,600 --> 01:05:51,240
Remember that one time I went there and then we all hung out and I fucking just gave everybody

1205
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:52,240
COVID?

1206
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,240
At which time?

1207
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:55,600
That only happened once.

1208
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:58,440
In my brain, every single time I got COVID, it was your fault.

1209
01:05:58,440 --> 01:05:59,440
No.

1210
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:00,840
I've only had it one time.

1211
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:01,840
Really?

1212
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:02,840
Yeah.

1213
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:03,840
I've had it once as well.

1214
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:04,840
I've had it.

1215
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,840
I got Omicron.

1216
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,840
I think you guys just don't know when you had it.

1217
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,840
I got Omicron because I went to a house party that had a horse in it.

1218
01:06:07,840 --> 01:06:10,480
I don't think the horse was the problem.

1219
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,760
I think the horse was the problem.

1220
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,320
You mean you got COVID from a horse?

1221
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,880
I got COVID from a pony, a Shetland pony.

1222
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,680
Okay, so not a horse.

1223
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:19,960
I remember my main COVID testing memory was when I was in Boston

1224
01:06:19,960 --> 01:06:24,120
and I went to, it was like an urgent care that was in like next to a game stop

1225
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,200
and it was like a parking lot and like we like pulled up

1226
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,200
and it was like the place wasn't open yet

1227
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:32,520
and there was a bunch of people, there was a bunch of cars parked there

1228
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:34,840
with people sitting in the cars and I was like,

1229
01:06:34,840 --> 01:06:37,640
well, I want to get my like this test done so I'm just going to go like

1230
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,200
wait at the door like for this place to open.

1231
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:42,680
I like got out of the car and I went and like stood in front of the door

1232
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:46,480
and the second that I stood in front of the door, just twenty middle aged ladies

1233
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,520
who were all sitting in their car, waiting it for if waiting for it to open

1234
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:52,860
who had some clear like like packed in their head that they were like we're

1235
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:55,860
going to wait in the car and then I got out and was waiting for the door. They

1236
01:06:55,860 --> 01:06:56,920
all just swarmed

1237
01:06:56,920 --> 01:06:58,220
all went in for

1238
01:06:58,220 --> 01:07:05,280
I know I was so pissed off dude. I clearly violated their unspoken bond.

1239
01:07:05,280 --> 01:07:10,360
That's so it was so crazy. They were getting all their numbers. I don't

1240
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,460
understand this one at all. I need this one explained to me number seven dart

1241
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:18,640
board with led through fiber optic to approximate the bristle effect. The

1242
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:22,840
hurt first of all this guy loves leds. I love to play darts. Unfortunately, I'm

1243
01:07:22,840 --> 01:07:26,400
not that good, but I still like to play a lot. I have an automatic scoring steel

1244
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:30,160
tip dart board. It's great fun, but as I was playing, I thought wow those bristles

1245
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:34,280
are really not any more around than fiber optic cable. So why not sprinkle

1246
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,960
the dart board with cheap fiber optics so we can see visual effects and targets

1247
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:45,000
the fins. He's saying you use fiber optic behind the dart board like a screen almost.

1248
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:50,920
What? Yeah. But what does he mean the bristle effect? Yeah, what is bristle? Is that what

1249
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:54,720
the materials called? I thought it was the fins, when you throw it it will have like

1250
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,240
little like LED. No, he's saying the board itself. Maybe he meant missile. Oh, the way

1251
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,880
the thing. Missile is a better option. He's saying like maybe you see a bristle on a normal

1252
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,800
small like dart board screen show a bristle. I don't know okay. I tried my

1253
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:12,040
best. I really don't know yeah, this is not a good one because he also said

1254
01:08:12,040 --> 01:08:16,420
it's an automatic scoring one right so like what you must already have yeah.

1255
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:21,920
It's very he loves light yeah. He always was flashing lights fast. I just yeah

1256
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:25,920
sprinkle fiber optic sprinkle the dart board with cheap fiber optics is what

1257
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,140
really can bring is a crazy verb to use for that guys always think the fiber

1258
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:34,380
fiber optic like they don't know what fiber optic cable is and so they think

1259
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:37,660
fiber optic is some like futuristic thing. Yeah, it's for any because they

1260
01:08:37,660 --> 01:08:41,020
put in the ocean. Then you get the internet. My granddad is always like

1261
01:08:41,020 --> 01:08:45,660
like if we ever go by like some city utility that's digging something up.

1262
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:49,900
He's like yep, they're putting in more fiber optic cable. That's because every

1263
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:53,820
every TV commercial that airs for Verizon or something and they say the

1264
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:57,900
word fiber optic twenty times most fiber optic in the country. I don't know what

1265
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:01,400
eruptive even means I think he's. I think he's just got some sort of dartboard

1266
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,600
that like has bristles that catch it. It's like a different type of dartboard

1267
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:07,360
and he wants those to be cable. Oh, okay, so that

1268
01:09:07,360 --> 01:09:10,320
yeah,

1269
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:14,780
I guess, and I'm not sure that's an electric board anymore, though. Yeah,

1270
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,300
not at all. Yeah, it's not a good invention. That's a zero. I didn't

1271
01:09:18,300 --> 01:09:18,720
mention

1272
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:23,080
fair day cages to house movie theaters, so he wants a fair day cage around a

1273
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:25,320
movie theater. So you can't text or call on your phone.

1274
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:30,980
don't they do that? No, that would be so. Why does my phone not work at the

1275
01:09:30,980 --> 01:09:33,160
movies? I'm trying to make all these calls in the theater.

1276
01:09:33,160 --> 01:09:36,960
Can't even get a call. My phone literally never works. If you actually are real

1277
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,060
texting and calling in movie head like me, you'd know it works perfectly in the

1278
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:44,280
movie theater. I text in every movie theater. Oh, I'm on my, I'm singing into

1279
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,760
my phone. I text, I talk, I'm not even. I'm recording voice memos about the

1280
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:52,520
movie. Yeah, yeah. Reminder to watch this movie again. I'm on Smule Karaoke. I'm

1281
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,480
singing with some forty five year old lady from the Philippines.

1282
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:01,200
Texting the five five five number just to yeah

1283
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:03,280
hello.

1284
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:09,520
No don't switch that a boulder coming. I'm just amming sunflower by post

1285
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:09,920
milan

1286
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:15,440
they got it right. Oh shit. It actually is

1287
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:21,120
yeah the entire time. I'm going Siri put my phone on silent. No Siri silent for

1288
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,360
just an hour straight now playing silent

1289
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:30,080
well, my god, able containers for real bulk foods. That little fucking guy,

1290
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,100
okay, basically what he wants. I don't want to read this whole thing. He wants

1291
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:38,100
to be my political. My political leanings are definitely to the right.

1292
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,880
That being said, it doesn't mean that I think we should run around filling up

1293
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:45,360
holes with trash. So basically he wants to recycle. He wants more recyclable

1294
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:46,280
giant book

1295
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:53,700
I mean not even like this is all like logistical food recommendations, not

1296
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:57,960
even like oh, they should make a candy bar that tastes like pizza. He's doing

1297
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:02,740
like I want to make this whole thing a little easier. Yeah, I want to maximize

1298
01:11:02,740 --> 01:11:06,900
storage. Yeah, this is a fat guy that lives like next to a McDonald's yeah and

1299
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,900
his problems are all in a radius of walking. Yeah,

1300
01:11:09,900 --> 01:11:13,940
he also still drives. Yeah, he still drives. There's a two. This is what the

1301
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:18,060
explanation of what here, how he arrived at this idea is we have bulk food areas

1302
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:21,260
in the grocery store, but we really just give them a cursory glance. They are

1303
01:11:21,260 --> 01:11:25,260
called bulk because they don't have packages, but we need packages because we

1304
01:11:25,260 --> 01:11:30,180
need to hold our stuff. So I thought that any dry good could be held in large

1305
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:33,940
bins and filled into smaller plastic containers. Once used, those containers

1306
01:11:33,940 --> 01:11:37,120
will be handed back for washing and a rebate against the next container of

1307
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,880
product. So you can just buy one that you did. You can cut out the middle.

1308
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:44,160
I don't know what this is a very. I know Boo Berry when I see him,

1309
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:51,100
but you can just buy those Tupperware things online and then just,

1310
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:55,460
he just doesn't wanna wash out these containers. He hates...

1311
01:11:55,460 --> 01:11:58,140
Sorry, this is a little... Well, that wouldn't be an invention.

1312
01:11:58,140 --> 01:12:00,940
That's true. This is a little bit separate, but if you work at a

1313
01:12:00,940 --> 01:12:06,020
restaurant and you have... And now you label everything and put it in

1314
01:12:06,020 --> 01:12:09,100
those containers at your house, you are a goofball.

1315
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:12,660
Yeah. You are a goofball. You're calling Noah out. You're saying like

1316
01:12:12,660 --> 01:12:14,820
the red lead no oh no. There's a little

1317
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:21,420
containers and you put and you put like shrimp one slash. Shut the fuck up man

1318
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:25,500
yeah. Honestly, where he had like an hour long conversation about cheese last

1319
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:30,780
night. I hate him Noah yeah, he's spurged out about cheese. I'd leaned over. I

1320
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:33,420
think he was drunk, but I leaned over and I was like hey. I actually missed the

1321
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:37,820
cheese conversation. Can you repeat it and he engaged with it like really

1322
01:12:37,820 --> 01:12:42,020
seriously and he's like oh no, we're still going and I was like okay, and I

1323
01:12:42,340 --> 01:12:44,900
I went back to play Mario Kart. I love him, but he like was like really

1324
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:49,380
excited for me to join in. Yeah, but that that is if you're drinking your

1325
01:12:49,380 --> 01:12:51,780
water at your house out of one of those things, that's

1326
01:12:51,780 --> 01:12:53,780
garbage and your

1327
01:12:53,780 --> 01:12:58,740
honey on it. Oh my God. If you're in a real, if you're in a really,

1328
01:12:58,740 --> 01:12:59,980
really hot kitchen

1329
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:04,420
and you drink out of that thing, it's so good. Oh my God, really?

1330
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:08,540
So good. No new sound. You guys have a sound board. Wait, play it.

1331
01:13:08,540 --> 01:13:11,300
No, play the right one.

1332
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,300
yeah.

1333
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:19,060
Is it the whole song or is it just that part? No, it's just it's that part

1334
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:24,280
twice. You should have one like maybe like right here. I don't like when you

1335
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,980
touch this for no reason. Why did you switch to an empty page to tell me to

1336
01:13:27,980 --> 01:13:32,800
add something? Just the whole song on this one. Why? Why? It's the same. Just

1337
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:36,740
so we can listen to the whole thing. Or it's like a ten minute file that has

1338
01:13:36,740 --> 01:13:39,180
the song in the middle somewhere. Yeah, that's a good idea. And you press it

1339
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,340
when you start my

1340
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:43,000
baby, this is a great idea,

1341
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:47,300
amazing idea, a ten minute file where you had one somewhere in there and you

1342
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:50,240
can press it and then like maybe you could go up to go to the bathroom and

1343
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:52,800
then it plays and we don't know what's going on. I should just do one file

1344
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,240
that's all the sounds at random intervals. Yeah, just play it. We should

1345
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,360
do it one hour. Yes, sound you can record your topics like every like fifteen

1346
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:02,700
minutes be like you know what if the dancing bear guy

1347
01:14:02,700 --> 01:14:07,060
had a penis, oh my God, it would just go and then you just start talking about

1348
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,920
that yeah we have a ding that means we have to move on to we will do an

1349
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,800
episode like that's a very smart idea. Yeah, that's cool of them on me fifty

1350
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:19,140
all right. Here's the his last invention idea, okay, universal time zone. This

1351
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:23,740
one, this one is really boring, but I agree. I don't agree. You don't you

1352
01:14:23,740 --> 01:14:27,720
want to be like noon at like six in the morning here, maybe

1353
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,640
why maybe I'm up,

1354
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:37,060
maybe I'm up at noon in that we just go by the sun like it could be like it

1355
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:40,700
be like pretty bright o'clock. It could be like getting dark o'clock. Yeah.

1356
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:43,860
It could be dark o'clock. Oh, you know what? Anybody who complains about time zones has

1357
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:49,800
difficulty adding two to a number. You know what? You know what my problem is? I got the

1358
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:53,340
time zones mixed up with daylight savings. I thought you were just trying to abolish

1359
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:56,340
daylight savings. I remember on tour you always got time zones wrong. Do you guys have daylight

1360
01:14:56,340 --> 01:15:01,660
savings here? Do you guys have daylight savings here? Yeah. Is it gone in California? It's

1361
01:15:01,660 --> 01:15:06,100
gone in Arizona. Oh, okay. Thank God. I wish it was gone. They need it the most. They need

1362
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:10,140
get rid of the most they got they got sand storms. They got they got there

1363
01:15:10,140 --> 01:15:15,380
dealing with. There's also no excuse for for not being not figuring out time

1364
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:18,580
zones, because it's the easiest thing to google yeah yeah you search. What time

1365
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:22,940
is it? Well, I know I know the time zone difference between here and the west

1366
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:26,060
coast. I know it's three hours, but like I didn't know

1367
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:29,100
good job,

1368
01:15:29,100 --> 01:15:35,020
but when we were on tour, I was like it being like it's tech. We're in Texas.

1369
01:15:35,060 --> 01:15:37,540
It's 11 a.m. so it's about six or seven.

1370
01:15:37,540 --> 01:15:39,740
- Yeah, I also memorized the map in my head

1371
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,900
because it's like Ohio is like one,

1372
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,300
there's like a part of Ohio

1373
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:46,260
that's like a different time zone, right?

1374
01:15:46,260 --> 01:15:47,460
- Were we even in Ohio?

1375
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:48,300
- Never.

1376
01:15:48,300 --> 01:15:51,820
- No, I was in Ohio when I was 18 for my birthday.

1377
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:54,060
And then I like, that's--

1378
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,400
(sad music)

1379
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,540
I thought I hated sound boards,

1380
01:15:58,540 --> 01:15:59,380
but I've just been convinced.

1381
01:15:59,380 --> 01:16:04,220
- If you hate sound boards, hit 'em with the Alvin.

1382
01:16:04,220 --> 01:16:05,920
Oh yeah,

1383
01:16:05,920 --> 01:16:11,420
the fucking find it. It's right there. No, it's not. What is that one? That's

1384
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,020
when it said Connor. Okay, so you hate soundboards again.

1385
01:16:14,020 --> 01:16:27,620
We got you

1386
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:31,620
that's the end of the list. Yeah, yeah, that is the end.

1387
01:16:33,020 --> 01:16:35,880
I must I'm back about the mind present

1388
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,720
no, please, please

1389
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:44,720
you order to the beastie boys thing. I really like this comment. Joseph do he

1390
01:16:44,720 --> 01:16:47,980
said excellent blog great. It was a support up. No,

1391
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,400
it does have

1392
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:55,000
other scheme on the end of way to include people to go to his website

1393
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:58,620
way to include the half on a blog about innovation.

1394
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:06,400
I say great inventions on this post great in this invention fan. He looks like

1395
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:11,040
this is an old Joseph Dewey sounds like he invented some like kind of thing to

1396
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:15,520
make slaves work better. Joseph Dewey, I think he wrote like Malcolm in the

1397
01:17:15,520 --> 01:17:16,560
middle. Yeah,

1398
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:21,800
you know, it did the one of the producer names on that show that I've memorized

1399
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:26,880
all the time was Linwood Boomer. You memorized all the time. I memorized it

1400
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:30,800
every morning. I woke up every single time that I saw a new episode. I'd be

1401
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:34,320
I thought this up Patrick. There it is. Linwood Boomer. Linwood Boomer is

1402
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:37,840
just sick. Memorizes it all the time. Memorizes it all the time. He's

1403
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:39,660
forgetting it and re-memorizing it.

1404
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,840
Well, it's nice to have a pop box. It's like a Groundhog's Day thing.

1405
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,700
Like every morning. Every morning. Every morning he'd watch it and forget he

1406
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:48,620
watched it and then be like, "I gotta memorize that. It's gonna be good as

1407
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:50,880
fuck later." I need to remember that for tomorrow. I reset every day so that

1408
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,720
that makes sense. You kinda do. Yeah. Alright, thank you, Nick, for coming on.

1409
01:17:54,720 --> 01:17:59,260
Thank you. If you wanna see Nick, he's at the bell house. Yeah, he'll be doing

1410
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:06,500

1412
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:15,500
a dance with the devil might last you forever.

1413
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:20,200
Damn. Yeah. Oh, we have to plug our

1414
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:26,600

01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:33,500

1417
01:18:36,060 --> 01:18:40,600
They are going at a pretty good pace. So

1418
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:45,640

miss the whole show. I think we're current,

01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:56,040
I think we have 400 tickets to go. Yeah, only 400,000, I think. That's

1422
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:58,040
Yeah, all right. Bye all.

1423
01:18:58,040 --> 01:19:00,040
Use promo code PATRICK to pay full price.

1424
01:19:00,040 --> 01:19:06,040
Do you guys ever walk by an

1425
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,040
armored truck that's parked somewhere

1426
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,040
and you think to yourself, I hope they don't kill me.

1427
01:19:10,040 --> 01:19:12,040
I hope they don't think I'm trying to steal from the truck.

1428
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:14,040
Because they're covered in guns.

1429
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,040
I hope they don't mistake me for a guy who's trying to

1430
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:18,040
get into the truck. I was walking home at like 2 in the

1431
01:19:18,040 --> 01:19:20,040
morning a couple months ago and they were

1432
01:19:20,040 --> 01:19:22,040
like, the guys were just sitting

1433
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:24,040
looking the other way with like

1434
01:19:24,040 --> 01:19:31,040
the

1435
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:38,040
the

1436
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:40,360
kill these two guys, take this money.

1437
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:41,200
Yeah, easy.

1438
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,080
Who's going to ever know?

1439
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:43,320
They got cameras all over the truck.

1440
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:43,620
Shut up.

1441
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,500
Every single part of the truck has a camera.

1442
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:46,200
I have a camera.

1443
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:47,000
Fuck it.

1444
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,280
You know, I think, but here's the thing.

1445
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:51,960
The Brinks truck has cameras on every single part of it.

1446
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:56,460
Couldn't they make an amazing reality TV show about traffic with the same truck?

1447
01:19:56,460 --> 01:20:00,000
Well, that's what I was going to get at, is that we should do a Parks and Rec

1448
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,920
about people, two, three guys in a Brinks truck.

1449
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,340
That's actually a really good idea.

1450
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,140
Parks and Driving is what it could be called.

1451
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:07,500
Parking and driving.

1452
01:20:07,500 --> 01:20:11,200
that is actually such a good idea. And it's a Brinks truck, it has all the cameras all

1453
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:15,900
over it and it's like those 360 cameras and they're going into like into people's cars.

1454
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:19,660
Yeah, we just get it, we buy a Brinks truck, an old retired Brinks truck. Or we just steal

1455
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:23,700
one. We put some 360... We leave all the money, we steal the truck but leave all the money.

1456
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,940
The problem is that people are going to think it's a real Brinks truck and try to rob us

1457
01:20:26,940 --> 01:20:31,820
and all of our guns are, they're funny guns, they don't do anything. They're props. But

1458
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:34,540
Then the episode starts, right?

1459
01:20:34,540 --> 01:20:37,820
It's like, "You guys, my uncle's coming over.

1460
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:38,700
My uncle's coming over."

1461
01:20:38,700 --> 01:20:39,980
- Same exact episode.

1462
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,220
- Same exact episode.

1463
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:42,780
This is how it starts out.

1464
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:43,940
My uncle's coming over.

1465
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,440
Back of the truck opens up.

1466
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,700
Back of the truck opens up.

1467
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,340
Uncle's head pops in.

1468
01:20:50,340 --> 01:20:54,740
"Hello, it's me, the president."

1469
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:56,420
It's Donald Trump.

1470
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:57,260
Damn it.

1471
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:58,080
(tires screeching)

1472
01:20:58,080 --> 01:20:58,920
(tires screeching)
