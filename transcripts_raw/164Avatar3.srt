00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:09,140

00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:09,640

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,360
What is this for?

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,860
*silence*

8
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,360
What is-

9
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:17,860
*silence*

10
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,860
What's what for?

11
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,860
*silence*

12
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,160
Your out- your outfit.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,360
What is it outfit for?

14
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,080
The firefighters?

15
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,560
Not that outfit- no, the-

16
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,000
*silence*

17
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:28,680
What is that...

18
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,180
*silence*

19
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,660
shit on your... what is this for? Why are you dressed like this?

20
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:32,460
My headphones?

21
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:32,960
Not your headphones.

22
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,180
No, he always wears the headphones.

23
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:38,180
That's so I can hear the episode while we're recording it.

24
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,180
I don't know.

25
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,180
I think that maybe you went a little too far.

26
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,980
With what?

27
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:52,680
What could I have gone too far with, possibly, that I'm doing right now that could be considered too far?

28
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,880
Just... why do you have the... the blue face is okay. We've done blue face before.

29
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,380
This...

30
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,380
Why do you have a braid?

31
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:01,380
Have you never seen Avatar?

32
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,380
I'm a Na'vi.

33
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,380
The braid is...

34
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,380
Don't touch! That's like my penis!

35
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,380
Bro, have you not seen Avatar?

36
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,380
You're lucky you...

37
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,380
He touched it.

38
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,380
No, you didn't.

39
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,380
You touched it and looked at us when you came in.

40
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,380
You were rubbing it.

41
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,380
I don't like you being a Na'vi.

42
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,380
Me neither.

43
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,380
It's giving you an attitude problem.

44
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,380
You're acting like a Hollywood superstar.

45
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:27,880
No I'm not.

46
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,380
And it's pissing me off.

47
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,880
No I'm not.

48
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,380
And also I have a bunch of healthy and animals in my body.

49
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:33,380
You were a superstar before.

50
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,880
You were a superstar before you were a famous singer or dancer.

51
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,380
You haven't decided yet.

52
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,880
You didn't need to do this to your body to become an even bigger star.

53
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,880
This is bullshit.

54
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
It's just what I want.

55
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:44,380
Is this who you really are?

56
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:45,380
Yeah, I'm a Navi.

57
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,880
So you'll be like this probably forever?

58
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,880
Forever.

59
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Mmm, likely story.

60
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,380
So this was your New Year's resolution?

61
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:51,880
Nope.

62
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,820
What about when you go to get a new driver's license or if your first driver's license?

63
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,040
They don't have skin on the driveway do they yeah, they have skin color. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, they put blue

64
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,720
Well, I don't understand. No for the photo you think they're gonna let you be dressed like this if they let freaks

65
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:11,620
Do do flying spaghetti monster. I think they have to let me be a Navi. It's true

66
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:15,340
I mean freaks do flying spaghetti monster or a colander on their head people do that

67
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,620
Yeah, you never saw that and they say it's funny as fucking funny

68

That the world is pandora spirit of Pandora

71

I think the only thing I honestly don't know that much about the only Pandora

72
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,040

85
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,800
He was a big blasphemer

86
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
I bet he would talk and if he was here right now

87
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,580
He roasts the shit out of you in this song. I'd like to see somebody try to roast me

88
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:55,440
It'd probably like a cure in myself a blue face. Yeah, what do you say that to a Navi blue face lazy?

89
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:01,660
That'd be you what like that guy blue face where he says blue face, baby, but you're late. Oh, why am I lazy?

90
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:08,700
Plus you ain't even naked they dress like Tarzan in the movie

91
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:16,280
They're dressed like we're loincloths. They barely wear a cloth you have ironic shirts a Navi would never run a good blue

92
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:23,280
It's a blue for the FDNY. It's a blue shirt or just and I can't support the fire department

93
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,880
They don't have a fire department so fire there. They haven't discovered that yeah, that's later on all they know is unobtainium

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,640
Yeah, I like unobtainium if you like unobtainium so much. Why don't you marry it? Yeah?

95
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,760
Well, I don't think Navi have marriage. I think they just fuck

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,280
With their hair sounding pretty

97
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:47,780
Like this now, holy god damn this lifestyle it was yeah, I don't agree with your lifestyle

98
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,120
This is a lifestyle choice that you're making you were not born like this

99
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,000
I know that for a fact because I was saw when you were born or shortly

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,200
That's thereafter. I actually saw a video of Cameron's birth earlier, and I showed him he showed me

101
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,120
I don't remember that you want to see it again. I don't think you

102
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,720
It's a premium

103
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,640
- That doesn't really, that's not really what I mean.

104
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,080
- No, no, I don't think that you should show that.

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,720
- I saw blue, it was like a surgery on a horse,

106
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,560
and they--

107
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,400
- It was like a giant blue sack of tumor.

108
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,480
- It was a giant blue sack coming out of a horse.

109
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,000
- Okay. - And he wanted to show that.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,080
- Well, that was your birth.

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
- You guys wanna see my new tattoo?

112
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,280
- Yeah.

113
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,080
- Oh, yes. - Yes.

114
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
- There's more?

115
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,740
- Yeah, what's your new tattoo?

116
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,760
(laughing)

117
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:35,720
- It says avatar, and it has the avatars riding.

118
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,720
- How did you even get that?

119
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,720
- On my stomach.

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,720
- No, but like how did that even happen?

121
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,720
- It's a little like, it's peeling.

122
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
That's what happens when you get a new tattoo, you know?

123
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
- It's peeling, it's a little blurry.

124
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
- It's a dolphin or some kind of animal.

125
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,720
- Okay.

126
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
- That they have in Avatar.

127
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
It's probably in Avatar 2.

128
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Which I haven't seen.

129
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,720
- This is bullshit.

130
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
- What's bullshit about this?

131
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
- You're looking pretty ripped.

132
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,120
You're looking pretty ripped. Yeah, yeah, you think so yeah, I got a Navi kind of looking pretty ripped for a Navi

133
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,080
You know Navi are stronger than humans. I will say of the three of us you would definitely I'm not saying you are a Navi

134
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:20,800
But you would be the closest to being a Navi. Well, yeah, cuz my blue face and my braid. He'd be one of the

135
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:28,280
He'd be one of the nerds on the computer dude if I could be like Norm Spellman. Yeah, he'd be like Norm Spellman

136
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,360
Oh my god dream come true one of the scientists in the avatar program this guy Norma the North

So you're Bill yeah like a snowman and I'm gonna be no man. It's your mr. Peanut. Oh, yeah

138
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,860

139
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,880
How does he act?

140
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,560
British right very very British very regal. Would you like a proper peanut?

141

Proper peanut I don't know what he says. I does not say proper never fucking met the guy didn't die yeah

142
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,740
He died and then he became a little

143
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:06,040
Well, I'm not the little version. I think you are no one that's around right now. It doesn't make any sense

144
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:12,040
Do you guys grow up? Yeah, okay peanuts age differently than human that makes sense. Yeah

145
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,720
I think he's a teenager now wait if you're not V

146
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:21,000
How long do not be live because taller people usually live in years, okay? That's very is that true

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,520
That's like a possum only lives one year. Yeah, I should have like read the Avatar wiki

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Or you've seen the movie

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,600
First one so the first one it's cool

150
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,760
spaceships

151
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,760
motor so no motor cycle dresses

152
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:44,860
Dress as a spaceship then why do you pick the you know at least be a little subversive any but any fucking Joe Schmoe off the

153
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:49,280
Street of walking to avatar be like I'm gonna dress up like the blue guy for work tomorrow. It's interesting

154
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,080
It's there's only I'm the only one here

155
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:55,000
I see doing that so I don't like you guys are below average if that's what you that's your point

156
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,680
- You know what would be really, really funny?

157
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,780
It would be really funny to be really, really into Avatar,

158
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,640
but instead of dressing up like the Na'vi,

159
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,600
dressing up like the guys who kill all the Na'vi.

160
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,440
- The evil, the general or the colonel.

161
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,560
- He looks exactly like small soldiers.

162
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,400
- Yeah.

163
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,120
- Yeah, and he has the claw marks on his face.

164
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,920
- Yeah, dressing up like those guys is like,

165
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,920
yeah, I love Avatar so much.

166
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,800
- Yeah.

167
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,820
- Do Na'vi get, can Na'vi get rabies?

168
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,660
- Yeah.

169
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,480
- Probably.

170
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:30,840
That is scary. I think I think that they're gonna do all colors of Navi soon red yellow green

171
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:39,720
Purple but no white one, huh? There will be a white one in Avatar 5. Mmm. Yeah, is he still planning on making like 15?

172
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,040
Avatar movie. Yeah, it's pretty fun

173
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,620
He's been doing a bunch of interviews where he says like just so everybody knows an avatar 5 they're gonna go to earth

174
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,740
Yeah, just doing a full just like as crazy as somebody that we would find on like a forum thing

175
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,820
But he has 20 billion. I also I read a thing today that he apparently I don't know

176
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:07,780
I guess I don't know if they already shot avatar 3 or what but they said that he turned in a 9-hour cut of avatar 3

177
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:13,420
And was like you we're gonna do all the VFX for this before we cut it down. Oh my god. Isn't that crazy?

178
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:16,420
He's a genius. Yeah, he's a mastermind

179
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:20,520
He has to be one of I also the funniest part of this is that we're backlogging right now

180
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:24,680
So even though today the day we're recording is the day that avatar 2 comes out. It's gonna be

181
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:31,160
It's gonna people are already gonna not be it's already gonna be sitting at a 56 on rotten tomatoes

182
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,720
More like a 98 but yeah, no the rating will settle is the point. No, no, no

183
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,840
I don't think that uh, I don't think that it's probably gonna be that good

184
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:47,960
I think you're completely wrong. I still I I get up today. I still think it'll be good. I had to there's a

185
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,440
that thing with my tooth is still weird.

186
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,280
- Mm.

187
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:54,320
- That crown that they put in and then they didn't,

188
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,720
there's that one gap where all the food keeps getting in.

189
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,880
- I'm gonna take the crown off your head,

190
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,880
the podcasting crown.

191
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,720
- Yeah.

192
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,560
- 'Cause you're no longer the king.

193
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,580
- But every time I watch Avatar,

194
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,040
I get up to the point where he turns into the Na'vi.

195
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,880
- The Na'vi!

196
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,400
- And he plays basketball.

197
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,200
He plays basketball with Sigourney Weaver

198
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,960
and then I just, I lose all interest and I shut it off.

199
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:16,240
- Dude, wait, Sigourney Weaver as the blue alien?

200
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,160
- Bad AF.

201
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,880
And I'm not just saying that because I'm blue.

202
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,720
What if they went to the fuck,

203
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,460
what if the Terminator shows up?

204
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,200
That wouldn't happen.

205
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,240
So first of all, that wouldn't happen.

206
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,960
And second of all, the aliens are fucking sexy as shit.

207
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,280
He has no imagination.

208
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,680
But why not, wait, what other,

209
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,120
he did an alien movie, what if the aliens show up?

210
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,200
Yeah, the xenomorph.

211
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,640
I guess they could.

212
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,560
They'd probably fuck up all the Na'vi, man.

213
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,680
Yeah.

214
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,520
I guess so.

215
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,400
Probably fuck 'em to death.

216
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,560
You should dress as the xenomorph,

217
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,000
you should get some body paint and do that.

218
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,180
I could do that shit.

219
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,900
That'd be no problem or issue for me at all.

220
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,420
You kind of look like the...

221
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,460
H.R. Giger, a lot of his stuff...

222
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,860
You have the same type of head as the same...

223
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,340
You kind of look like the hybrid.

224
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,380
A lot of his stuff...

225
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,180
Like a newborn?

226
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,060
A lot of H.R. Giger's stuff.

227
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,940
Which I just watched.

228
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,940
Just saw it, re-saw all four of them.

229
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:03,620
Hate Joss.

230
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,460
Joss?

231
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,280
Joss.

232
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
Joss.

233
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,780
That movie though, actually pretty good.

234
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,620
I like that one.

235
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,900
Do you guys feel like H.R. Giger,

236
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,020
a lot of his stuff was borderline sexual?

237
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:13,860
No.

238
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,180
Yeah, I think there's something about...

239
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,500
I feel like he maybe was drawing, you know like how artists have like, they have a light

240
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:26,720
table or something where they're like, I feel like maybe he accidentally had his dick behind

241
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:30,260
like he was, I think there's something, he was drawing an alien and he looked down and

242
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,260
he saw the silhouette of his penis and balls and he was like, holy crap.

243
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,980
The setup was he's sitting, he has a spinning chair right, and on one side he's blowing

244
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:43,260
a bunch of guys and like fucking sucking their balls and stuff and they have a light behind

245
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:49,460
And he's like, hold on guys. I have to draw something. I just got an idea and he turns around and now the shadows are cast all over

246
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:56,400
So he's outlining him. He's like man. These aliens look badass. These animals should attack a woman and then

247
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,260
Turn it around. It's fucking penises and cocks. Yeah, right

248
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:04,940
But also I guess one of them was holding like a cell phone or some piece of technology seen

249
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:10,760
It's the the album art for Frank and Christ by dead Kennedy's and it's an HR Geiger

250
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,820
Painting that is just dicks going into pussies. It's fire dude, but it doesn't look it

251
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,920
It only looks like that if you squint

252
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:25,800
Very close the way you know the HR Geiger was on some some sexual shit when he was drawing his designs

253
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:31,460
The alien has two mouths yeah, yes, and if that's not the most sexual thing you give an alien

254
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,200
I don't know besides blue tits and butt do we?

255
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,100
Do you ever see the undercarriage any of these aliens and the xenomorph where we go underneath that we're saying okay?

256
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,860
They got three buttholes they have two pussies. There's a I mean I've seen I've seen them in my research. It was two mouths

257
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,100
It's not unreasonable. Yeah, you have to deduce logically. I mean, I just logically

258
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:58,300
The deduction by reasoning of logic is that there's two assholes and two pussies if they got doubles of everything well

259
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:07,000
The the from what I've gathered hmm in my research on the xenomorphs. Yes. Yes. Yes is that the the mama?

260
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:14,340
The big queen the queen the queen xenomorph is just only all she can do

261
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,860
is lay eggs

262
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:24,100
All she does is she sits there and she might become a feminist gets beautiful. I think I'm finally ready to

263
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,340
Become a feminist we need to she lays a million

264
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,200
Bajillion eggs and then those eggs all come out and then they hug your face and they deep

265
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:39,060
Bury a baby deep down inside you a deep area man or a woman even a girl can get impregnated. Yeah. Oh fuck

266
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:42,200
It's gross. It's a disgusting Avi posited

267
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:48,860
It's not right up on the opposite or you'll go up avi posit or there's people who want that to happen to them

268
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:56,620
Yeah, people want eggs laid alien eggs laid inside of their butt nice, and they're funny. It's not a funny thing

269
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,620
It's an actual sexual thing okay, but it's kind of funny. That's funny. It's funny to a guy like me

270
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,820
Yeah, but to a guy... It's not funny to a sexual freak.

271
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:08,620
Mmm... To a sexual... A sexual freak, yeah. A sexual addict.

272
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:09,620
Egg addict. Egg addict.

273
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:13,620
Hey, there. Do you have a new Na'vi name, by the way, that has apostrophes in it?

274
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,620
Cam'ron. D'Shaun. Oh, Cam'ron. That's good.

275
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,620
Either one of those is good.

276
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,620
Okay, Cam'ron.

277
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,620
[laughter]

278
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Um, is there any part of this Cam'ron that is sexual for you at all, or is this purely...

279
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,940
I mean well, I mean if I were to find my mate

280
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,100
I would I may fry I just watched his his his a ponytail

281
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:49,420
Yeah, that is fucked up you can't do that man excuse you touch your fucking hair to him, bro

282
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:55,460
That's fucking disgusting. That's your penis. He wanted to touch it earlier see if he wanted it

283
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,700
If he takes that blue makeup off, he's just a Jedi Padawan.

284
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,260
I agree, he's a fully an Anakin style guy.

285
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,540
Yeah, that's okay too.

286
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,540
You can't go around touching people with your hair, man.

287
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,540
Why not?

288
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,900
Because they're not, nobody wants that.

289
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,100
And don't say I'm asking for it because I don't have any hair, okay?

290
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,420
No, you didn't shave it.

291
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,420
I do wish that...

292
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Turn around, show everybody.

293
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,580
I wish that you had a braid so I could link with you and ride you like one of the Nabi horses.

294
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,580
You should grow out nothing but that.

295
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,580
That's impossible to grow out nothing but one big square.

296
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:24,420
I think we should all get a braid.

297
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,180
I think we should all get one thing. It's cool. I know look I'm kidding

298
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:31,100
I'm you guys think I could rock this for the foreseeable future

299
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,060
Yeah, dude, you might be able to foresee the future with that fucking haircut. Holy

300
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:38,700
What do you think get a punch in on that here is you turn around completely?

301
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,740
and then I guess

302
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:49,220
People can see it's kind of thin well. Yeah, whoa back off man. That's his penis. It's okay. It'll grow

303
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,700
It will grow. It will grow. That is nice to know.

304
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:59,980
It'll get thicker. I think you could just shave like a square. I knew a kid who had a padawan braid in middle school.

305
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:04,340
Yeah, I did too. Yeah, he was pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, it's funny cuz what I

306
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:09,380
The kid that I knew who had a, I guess it wasn't a padawan braid. It was just a rat tail.

307
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:10,220
It wasn't braided.

308
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:15,620
It was just a long rat tail and it's like you have to be growing that, to have that in middle school

309
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,940
and it's like down your back. You have to have that for like a while. Like that's a parent's

310
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,780
choice I feel like. That's something that your mom inflicted on you.

311
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:26,900
What was your conversation like when you got that red tail?

312
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,500
It was mostly about Avatar 2.

313
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,220
Yeah?

314
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,020
It was great clips.

315
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:36,260
I feel pretty bad for most service workers. Anytime that I have to hold a conversation

316
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,380
with someone, it's probably 10 minutes or less that I start talking about Avatar 2.

317
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,100
Really?

318
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:42,900
That's my go-to.

319
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:49,740
Well, I mean when you're getting tattooed I would hope that in 10 minutes if you're a full Navi and have a blue face

320
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:56,120
That you would bring up a blue face avatar before that haircut. Come on. Are you in an avatar t-shirt? No

321
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,260
You know, it's so funny is fucking deep pop resellers. You look up avatar

322
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,980
t-shirt

323
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:06,620
Like one from 2008 they will throw the word V

324
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:12,020
They'll throw the letters VTG on it vintage and then they will sell an avatar t-shirt

325
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:19,400
For $75 that makes sense. That's all that's funny old. It's not that old. That's decently old teen years

326
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:25,400
You know the quality on those shirts. It was like no I don't those paper thin like American apparel shirts

327
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,720
You know those shitty ones. No. I don't know anything about clothes, man

328
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,440
You're just talking about you know nonsense thing about getting this haircut though is I kind of was like oh

329
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,860
I'm gonna go it well so the way that I

330
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,500
Framed it was like I don't think I'm gonna keep this

331
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,700
"but can you give me this because I think it will be funny

332
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:43,340
"to go home to my girlfriend and I have this."

333
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,060
And I was kind of like, okay, which is true.

334
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,980
- Wait, so a professional, you didn't do this at home?

335
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,820
- No.

336
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,020
(laughing)

337
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,020
'Cause I wanted an actual haircut too.

338
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:58,020
I thought that your girlfriend did it for you.

339
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,020
She braided it.

340
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,640
- That's so crazy.

341
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
How much was this haircut?

342
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,840
Do you have to say that?

343
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,340
Where'd you go?

344
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
I went to this...

345
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,340
Please tell me you went to like a Dominican barbershop.

346
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,840
Well, that's what I was gonna say.

347
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
It's because I went to like a place in Bushwick.

348
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,840
They were just like, "Oh yeah, you should keep this. This looks great."

349
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
And I was like, "Oh yeah, I'll think about it."

350
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,340
Did you go to one of those ones that's in like East Williamsburg?

351
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
No, I said Bushwick.

352
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,340
You know it's Bushwick.

353
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,780
And it's called like chop it up. Yeah, basically

354
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:46,660
Tell me how much you paid well, okay, I paid it was a $90 haircut, but that is because my man

355
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:53,580
That's right. Treat yourself. Oh my that is the car. Let's go. It's not for this is for this. That's what I'm paying

356
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,900
That's a $10 haircut

357
00:18:55,900 --> 00:19:02,220
No that man that you don't know dude. Yeah, you've never had long hair. I'm sorry, but you are

358
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,980
Not like me, sorry

359
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:14,580
I think it's hard. I'm saying it's expensive. I spent $60 on a haircut and I was like damn I'm doing too much

360
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,580
But him spending $90

361
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:23,260
No, I'm so good. I will get my haircut once every year and a half. I do not care how much it costs

362
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:29,780
Yeah, I know if you're getting like I get my haircut probably every six months or I'll do it myself

363
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:35,500
So if any like the 60 bucks on it, that's like think about it like a subscription service

364
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,300
And you pay that

365
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,060
It's like a loot box

366
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:45,380
Okay, now I'm starting to understand it. Yeah more nice thing a bit think about it like when you pay like like a gummy

367
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,380
That looks like boba

368
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:55,960
I don't have where you guys going. I will also say that it was so expensive because the

369
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:59,440
She took a really long time. She took longer than she

370
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,280
- She's an idiot.

371
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,120
- She's so stupid.

372
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:01,960
- No, she's smart.

373
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,600
She took longer so it cost me more.

374
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,800
- She's a genius. - She got more money.

375
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,000
- She did a real good job, I'll say.

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,840
- Thank you.

377
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,480
- See, when you don't have the blue skin on,

378
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,480
you will look like Squall from Final Fantasy.

379
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,280
- That's the picture I showed her?

380
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,720
- Yeah, if that's the picture you showed, then.

381
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,440
- I feel like you're gonna be very anakin,

382
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:26,520
especially we're gonna get rid of that mustache forcibly

383
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,360
when you're done being blue.

384
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,180
- Oh yeah?

385
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:33,300
a scar across your eye. We're gonna give you a scar. I would, I want a scar so fucking much.

386
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:40,180
Shut up. You talked about it. You love the scar. I want it. You can go to one of those. I talked about it because I want it. He wants a scar that goes like this.

387
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,900
Okay then walk into a stop sign. Nothing's stopping you. I've considered it. Yeah I bet.

388
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:51,300
Like it, it can't be that bad if you just cut yourself like that right? It, you know what

389
00:20:51,300 --> 00:21:03,380
Nazis did what Nazis would get in fights no pretty tumble Nazis swastika style

390
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,420
Nazis would get into sword fights and they would duel when they were children

391
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:10,540
and then they thought that the scars are so cool they would pack the scars with

392
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,660
horsehair to like make sure they don't make it Wow all those Nazis have like

393
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:19,100
crazy fucked up scars on their face that's you yeah there were weird that

394
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:26,580
Listen those guys are fucking bizarre. Yeah, nothing. I mean they were kind of the Na'vi. I don't want to scar anymore now that I heard that story

395
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:31,260
Cars are actually not CAF. I heard that scars remind us that the past is real

396
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:36,580
Israel mm-hmm you want ours remind us that was a quote from Israel should be in the past

397
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,260
That's a quote from Jacoby Shaddix. Not me. Oh

398
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:44,680
He is such a cool name. It's crazy. I've never heard of this fuck. He's the guy from Papa Roach. Yeah

399
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:49,480
Papa Roach. You never watched Scarred on MTV?

400
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,480
Papa Roach was the...

401
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,480
Scarred? You never saw Scarred?

402
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,480
No. I never watched MTV once in my life.

403
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,480
It was a show that was just entirely like skateboard, BMX, like rollerblade bales.

404
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,480
Oh, I do remember that.

405
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,480
And it's like, yeah, I popped a bone out of my arm and Jacoby Shaddix going like, "Oh, shit!"

406
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Sounds badass.

407
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,480
It was so sick.

408
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,360
- I think if your name is Jacoby Shaddix,

409
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,960
you have a God-given destiny

410
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,280
to start a band called Papa Rouge.

411
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,240
- Yeah. - Definitely.

412
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,760
- Or be an energy drink mascot.

413
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,600
- Yeah. - Yeah.

414
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,120
- Or just a video game character.

415
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,000
They have to download you into Crysis 3 or whatever.

416
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,560
- Yeah, a human keyboard.

417
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,360
- Yeah. - Jacoby Shaddix.

418
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,920
- He's like the goth hacker on a Mass Effect ship.

419
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,060
- Jacoby Shaddix is like a Magic the Gathering

420
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,120
Planeswalker name. (laughs)

421
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,680
- He definitely sits to the side

422
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,920
of the rest of the playing field.

423
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:45,760
he should not be involved. He floats above everything, Jacobi. That's a cool-ass name.

424
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
- Jacobi Shadix.

425
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,760
- Shadix.

426
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
- Shadix.

427
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,760
- Shadix.

428
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,800
- That was my fake Facebook account that I used for Spotify.

429
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
- Shadix, Jacobi Pimento.

430
00:22:54,800 --> 00:23:00,480
- Jacobi Pimento. I used that for my Spotify. Jacobi Pimento. Badass name, dude. Thirteen

431
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
years old. Making sure my mom didn't hear me listen to... I thought that was the last

432
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,880
name.

433
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,880
- It's not.

434
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,680
- What is it? It's like a type of pepper?

435
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,680
- Pimento.

436
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,280
It's a thing.

437
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,640
You guys never had pimento cheese?

438
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,440
No.

439
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,840
Mayonnaise, pimentos, and cheese.

440
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,480
You ever had Aunt Myrna's party cheese salad?

441
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
It's fucking really good, man.

442
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,800
Aunt Myrna's party cheese salad?

443
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
No, it's pimentos and that.

444
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:24,640
Do you remember that video?

445
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,120
Have you guys ever had peanut butter toast?

446
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,960
Is that like a Navi thing?

447
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,520
Peanut butter jelly time?

448
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,360
It is.

449
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,200
It is.

450
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,040
What do Navi eat?

451
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,800
Do they eat animals or are they vegetarians?

452
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,620
They're vegetarians.

453
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,460
Oh, God.

454
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,280
Don't even, all right.

455
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,160
They, they, I don't remember.

456
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:40,920
- Can we at least trick them into eating some meat?

457
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,020
- I think they at least kill animals, but for fun.

458
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,880
They kill animals, they shoot it with a bow and arrow,

459
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,240
and then they go like, they put their hand on it,

460
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,800
and they're like, they speak their language.

461
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,540
(speaking in foreign language)

462
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,600
But they're like, you have been killed

463
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,000
for a purpose or something.

464
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,240
So I think that maybe they eat them based on that.

465
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,480
- I think I might start doing that.

466
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,480
- Yeah, doing some blessings over here.

467
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,880
anytime I eat meat. You can get your meat pre-blessed, you know that?

468
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:18,360
Is that true? For real? For how? For how much? It's from a guy in a cart. Can you get any

469
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:25,400
meat pre-blessed or just his meat? Just any meat. So I can walk up with like a big

470
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:32,120
pack of bacon and say, "Will you bless this?" Yeah. And pork chops.

471
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:37,560
and yeah good why don't they eat pork I will say there's there is something

472
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:45,080
about pork that is disgusting the salt the salinity what it's too salty it's

473
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,980
probably the mud I think you add salt to it I don't think there's salt no pork is

474
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:53,860
pretty salty on its own I don't think so I think you're making this up but there

475
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:57,040
is any time I'm eating a lot of poor anytime I eat this guy never ate steak

476
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:01,880
before I and now that is not now I've probably eaten more steak than either of

477
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,600
Not true. I eat about three or four steaks a week. Not true. That is true. Uh-uh. I ate one this morning

478
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,400
You did not. I swear to God I this morning. That's why it was so surprising to me that you never ate one

479
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,040
Because you talk about eating them four times a week. I had a steak and a glass of milk for breakfast

480
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,320
You're are you becoming one of these fucking carnivore guys? No, I just like steak.

481
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,440
I just try not to eat carbs before 5 p.m.

482
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,240
Cuz it'll slow me down. See how fast I am?

483
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,120
Just cuz no carbs. Oh my god, you are fast

484
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,380
(laughing)

485
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:35,260
(imitating gun noises)

486
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,520
- What are you doing with your hand?

487
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,360
Whoa!

488
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,120
(imitating gun noises)

489
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,960
- Move the chair over.

490
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,280
- And that was full of energy drink.

491
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,120
- Really?

492
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,560
- Yeah, yeah, it's called C4.

493
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:49,120
I thought, you know, before I go to my job

494
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,300
where I talk into my microphone,

495
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,140
I think I need to--

496
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,960
- You should take pre-workout.

497
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,280
- I think I need to have some pre-workout.

498
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:55,680
Have my entire body just fucking jazzed up.

499
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,060
I do feel tingling.

500
00:25:57,060 --> 00:26:00,080
- Dude, that's the, I had C4 for that video I did

501
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,720
and Jenkum and I-- - It's got some shit in it.

502
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,280
- My head, the top of my head was tingling

503
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,320
during that video. - Yeah, you did.

504
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,900
Yeah, yeah. - And I thought

505
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,600
that I was going to throw up on camera.

506
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,760
- I like the tingling.

507
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,920
- I did throw up though.

508
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,000
I threw up 'cause I ate a worm, but that's different.

509
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,520
- Okay, well, I guess this guy's already promoting--

510
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,800
- Braggart. - Still promoting his video

511
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,560
from two years ago where he eats a worm.

512
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,320
- Check out the Dakota Jenkum magazine.

513
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,000
- Nice. - And watch that video.

514
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,240
- Check out my video. - There's a lot of people

515
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,840
mad at me in the comments.

516
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,320
- Check out this video I made,

517
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,040
guess who got kicked out of Starbucks.

518
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,600
I don't think you'll guess the answer.

519
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,000
- It's actually rather funny.

520
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,840
- And check out this other video.

521
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,320
- Oh, and check out this video that I've been working on.

522
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,480
I've been actually a part of it.

523
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,340
I didn't, I actually, this is a surprise for you guys.

524
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,640
Avatar 2 post-credits sketch.

525
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,360
- Yeah, one night and Cameron more like it.

526
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,800
- The post-credits sketch is by and starring me.

527
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,640
- I would love to see a sex tape with you.

528
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,720
I would love to see that.

529
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,080
Like a Ray J, Kim K style sex tape

530
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,000
where like a big guy's like recording it

531
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,840
and you're laying down on the bed.

532
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,680
- A big guy?

533
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,000
- A big guy, like a big strong guy.

534
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,320
And you're like laying on the bed.

535
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,480
Am I blue or just me?

536
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,480
You're whatever color.

537
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,640
And your ass is out and you look back.

538
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,880
I like, like, all right, you can record me, but I have to be blue.

539
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,360
There's no way I'm doing this where I'm not a Nazi.

540
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,880
There's an outline of your blue body on the bed.

541
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:19,120
And then that you look back like at the phone camera and you're, you're

542
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
like, kind of like that, right?

543
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,040
You're like a little bit coy.

544
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:27,480
He leans back up and just to perfect imprint of his face, his blue

545
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,640
face is in the pillow.

546
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,480
- Yeah.

547
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,320
- I'm kinda, I'm like.

548
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,960
- Yeah, well you're dropping the recorder.

549
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,280
- That's all right.

550
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,340
- But you do look like that.

551
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,760
Yeah, you're like looking back.

552
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,680
- I'll do it the other direction.

553
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,840
- Yeah, yeah, do it the other direction

554
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,460
'cause I do wanna see this to get something out of it.

555
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,840
Yeah, you're looking at, right,

556
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:43,920
and this guy's like,

557
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,160
like baby, you know what I'm gonna do to you?

558
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,000
And you're like,

559
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,680
yeah, you're like that, right?

560
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,880
And your ass cheeks are out.

561
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,280
And you have a perfect ass, by the way.

562
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,240
You got a BBL for this.

563
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,080
- Really?

564
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
- Yup.

565
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,240
Yup, you did.

566
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,080
- Yes.

567
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:57,900
- Yeah.

568
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:04,380
And Na'vi, Napoleon Dynamite, I like it. Na'vi, Napoleon Dynamite, this could be an entire

569
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:05,380
new...

570
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
Oh my god.

571
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,860
This could be an entire new SNL cast member.

572
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,660
This is a robot chicken sketch.

573
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,660
It is.

574
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,660
Na'vi, Napoleon Dynamite.

575
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,180
You should try to get on SNL as a Na'vi.

576
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,180
That's not a bad idea.

577
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,180
That's not a bad idea.

578
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,180
That's not a bad idea.

579
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,180
First Na'vi cast member.

580
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Mm-hmm.

581
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,860
Yeah. And you could be the first booger picker.

582
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,860
No.

583
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Do you know, do you guys want to ban me?

584
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,860
Pick your no-one.

585
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,860
I'm ready to booger picker.

586
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:31,420
I'm good for you for my packet, but I don't know if you I assume you guys haven't seen my avatar 2 post-credit sketch yet

587
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,300
You talk about packet. I'm still thinking about you laying on that bed saying I'm a packet. Yeah pack it in there

588
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,860
Can we can we pull up? Well? I can just explain it to you because it's not it's in theater

589
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,700
So it won't be well. No. It's it's you can't show it. That's piracy true. Okay. We're not taking that money away from

590
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:52,100
Fucking avatar the way of water, okay, but it's basically that I'll just I don't want to spoil too much so the premise

591
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,700
is that

592
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,760
White people be bonding with and riding their Banshee like this

593
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:08,000
And then do it and then do how do they do it show me yeah, they're they're like they're like giddy up

594
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:16,860
Be bonding and riding their Banshee like this. Oh, that's good

595
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:22,360
They say Yahoo I do it's a comedy sketch

596
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,320
(laughing)

597
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,640
I guess that makes some sense

598
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,720
that if you're trying to be funny,

599
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,280
you would say yahoo.

600
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,120
Yeah.

601
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,040
No, I guess that white people would be riding their banshee

602
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,040
and connecting with the mother tree by being like,

603
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,560
I'm okay, so I guess this is a thing.

604
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,360
Yeah, all right.

605
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,920
Oh, let me squeeze by you real quick.

606
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,400
Yes, oop.

607
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,320
Yep, oop, oop.

608
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,520
And I, oop, oop, oop.

609
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,440
Excuse me.

610
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,760
I do that, man.

611
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,600
And they'd be like,

612
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,840
do you guys have Taylor Swift on this planet?

613
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:47,680
Yeah.

614
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,320
If their banshee got hurt, they'd say, ah shucks.

615
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:51,820
Yeah.

616
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,320
What?

617
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:52,820
Shut up.

618
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,880
And if their music came on in the band cheat,

619
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,440
they'd be like, oh, I love this song.

620
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,560
(SINGING) It's got tissue that I wish you saw.

621
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,640
Step outside, but not to brawl.

622
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,280
And with the birds of shade.

623
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,280
Be annoying as fuck.

624
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,640
It's like Red Hot Chili Peppers aren't even a good band,

625
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,140
you asshole.

626
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,160
I don't like whites.

627
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,360
No, I fucking hate whites.

628
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,640
They should all die.

629
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:11,640
Yeah, I don't like them.

630
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
And end scene.

631
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,440
[LAUGHTER]

632
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,280
No.

633
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:16,760
No.

634
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,280
No, we don't.

635
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:17,960
That's not true.

636
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:18,880
We don't like whites.

637
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,480
Nope.

638
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,280
It's true.

639
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:20,920
Yeah.

640
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,200
Except for...

641
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,120
Who's white?

642
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,320
Philip Seymour Hoffman. Jake Sully.

643
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,640
Jake Sully.

644
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,880
Noam Spellman.

645
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:28,720
Noam Spellman.

646
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,440
Sigourney Weaver's character.

647
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,280
When I heard--

648
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,400
Dr. Sigourney Weaver.

649
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,640
That's her name in the movie?

650
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,480
Yep.

651
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,560
No, that's not true.

652
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,400
Yep.

653
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,220
You're fucking assholing me.

654
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,060
It's true.

655
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:38,900
Liar.

656
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,720
You know there's a, what was it?

657
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,560
You're assholing me.

658
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,400
(laughing)

659
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,240
Acting like an asshole.

660
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,800
It's, yeah, Dishonored.

661
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,840
She agreed to be in Dishonored because there was an,

662
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,040
like, she was like, well, you know,

663
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,200
like technically you can't,

664
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,460
they were like technically you don't have to murder

665
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,760
to like move along in the story.

666
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,600
She was like oh then it's not a violent game,

667
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,760
but you can also still murder.

668
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,840
- I want to murder.

669
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,680
- Yeah.

670
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,500
- Yeah.

671
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,340
- I have the urge.

672
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,180
- I have a serious, somebody--

673
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,000
- The sinister urge.

674
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:06,840
- The sinster urge.

675
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,960
- Somebody has to fucking stop me

676
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,520
'cause I will fucking murder.

677
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,360
- Yeah.

678
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,200
- I need to kill.

679
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,520
- I'm a beacon of sin.

680
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,600
- How is it that people,

681
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,560
do you guys ever think about--

682
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,440
- A blue beacon.

683
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,160
- How some people like killing?

684
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:21,280
I know this guy who used to be Noah's weightlifting coach,

685
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,800
who's a complete psycho,

686
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,000
and he was in the army for a long time,

687
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,200
or the CIA or some shit.

688
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,800
- Yeah, and plus steroids.

689
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,640
- Yeah.

690
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,460
(laughing)

691
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,300
- Plus steroids are gonna make--

692
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,680
- Yeah, plus the steroids.

693
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,160
- The steroids are gonna make you crazy.

694
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,920
- But he'd always talk,

695
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,000
they would ask him all about his time in the military,

696
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,440
like, was it scary?

697
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,440
And he was like, "Nah, man, it was awesome.

698
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,560
"I get to kill people all the time."

699
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,320
- I hate the fucking Earth military.

700
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,240
- Yeah, but what--

701
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
- But you love your tribe. - But the Na'vi is cool.

702
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:47,740
What?

703
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,620
But the Navi is cool?

704
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,060
Yeah, so I was just thinking out loud.

705
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,000
What's the Navi word for military?

706
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,280
Group of Navi.

707
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:55,780
All right.

708
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,980
Group of Navi is--

709
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,940
That's what we call groups of Navi.

710
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,140
Wait, do they have their own language?

711
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,900
I thought they speak English in the movie.

712
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,980
They go like Mahalo and stuff like that.

713
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:04,660
Mahalo.

714
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,460
Yeah, like this.

715
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:05,980
All right.

716
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:06,980
I think you're making--

717
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:10,500
I think you're mixing up a bunch of different indigenous people.

718
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,000
Yeah.

719
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

720
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,580
I think they do that.

721
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,980
What was this again?

722
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,180
Live long and prosper, nerd.

723
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:22,020
got you easiest trick in the book easiest trick in the book you know one

724
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,740
second I'm going live long and prosper directly into the camera it wasn't

725
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:41,860
cameras you got fucking on the Vulcan nerve pinch - yeah I'm gonna do a fucking

726
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,100
Okay, do a Volcom and nerd pinch on you

727
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:55,260
Stop you from ever fucking touching a pencil as long as you live yeah, you're a pencil pusher

728
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:00,300
I use pens actually and I have a pocket protector for him. Yeah, we know you're a dork man. You can shut up now

729
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:05,160
Oh my god, and you see this tape between my glasses. It's very clear, but yeah, yeah

730
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:13,240
I have tape on the middle because I get my ass kicked so many times by jocks. I fucking would love to meet your jock or your

731
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,920
There really is something there though

732
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,920
You have a bunch of crap right here though.

733
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,160
(laughing)

734
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,080
You do have stuff.

735
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,360
There really is stuff here though.

736
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,200
Oh yeah, what is that?

737
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,840
(laughing)

738
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,320
Oh, I guess that's my,

739
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,720
I gotta get a new windscreen.

740
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:33,720
I actually did have shit on me.

741
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,380
I can't believe it.

742
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:40,800
Wow, you are a nerd, man.

743
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,480
I guess I never thought about it that much,

744
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,640
but you are a nerd.

745
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,480
You have--

746
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,320
It's cool to be a nerd.

747
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,560
Nowadays it isn't. That's fucked.

748
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
It's cool to be a nerd.

749
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,820
Because I'm a jock.

750
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,820
Yes, obviously.

751
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,820
Yeah.

752
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,820
Yeah.

753
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,820
Think about what it is to be a nerd nowadays.

754
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,820
Now it's cool to be a nerd.

755
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,820
I'm a jock because I mostly do long jump.

756
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:00,320
I wish I knew. I've got to fucking, I've got to memorize that Nick Cannon nerd speech.

757
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
Oh yeah.

758
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
Nowadays it's actually cool to be a nerd.

759
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
You should dress like that.

760
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,320
When you see me there's always nerds in my vicinity.

761
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,320
That's true.

762
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,320
There's nerds in the vicinity.

763
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Yeah, I pull up at the function and I've got hella nerds on me.

764
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,520
I forgot that they exist outside of Halloween.

765
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Nerds?

766
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Yeah.

767
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
I thought that like nerds...

768
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,720
I think most people, to most people, candy does not exist outside of Halloween.

769
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,720
Yeah.

770
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:26,880
But I thought nerds were like a Halloween, like in my head, it's like that is a Halloween

771
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,200
specific candy.

772
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,040
You can only get that at a certain time of year, like the Reese's egg.

773
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,720
Like the Reese's pumpkin.

774
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,320
Yeah, or the pumpkin or the Christmas tree.

775
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,080
For other things, egg is for Halloween.

776
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,400
In a way, a pumpkin's an egg.

777
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:42,600
And Avi Positor, bringing us back to the Xenomorph conversation.

778
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
Let's go back to Xenomorphs.

779
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
Yeah.

780
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
No, no, no.

781
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:46,600
I was liking this where we were going.

782
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,200
If you got a face hugger on your face, right, and you knew there was an alien inside of your

783
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,600
body, what would you do?

784
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Give birth.

785
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,600
Yeah, I remember.

786
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
Capitulate.

787
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,600
What would you do before the thing pops out of your head?

788
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,320
I'd be eating pickles and ice cream for real.

789
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
So you're saying if-

790
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
I'd be having those cravings.

791
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Yeah.

792
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,640
You're saying, like, what would I do if it was like that movie Bucket List or some shit,

793
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,640
but-

794
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,820
- A bucket list, but there's a Xenom work inside you

795
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:11,660
at any point in time. - At any point in time,

796
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,480
if something's gonna jump out of my belly.

797
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
One hour?

798
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,320
- Yeah, 'cause that's what it--

799
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,880
- Probably watch about an hour of Avatar.

800
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,680
- Yeah, all right, makes sense.

801
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,520
It's like in--

802
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,000
- No, I would drink bleach or something.

803
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,680
- Yeah, or Pepsi.

804
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,120
- I bet it hates Pepsi.

805
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,740
Oh, true, 'cause Coke will dissolve a penny.

806
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,960
So that guy's probably made out of something like pennies.

807
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,080
- He's made out of plastic.

808
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,200
- He's made out of pennies.

809
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:37,000
- His blood is acid, though, that's the problem.

810
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,500
so I need the opposite of acid.

811
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,640
Oh, what's that movie?

812
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,480
- Base.

813
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,300
- Yeah.

814
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
- You need a base.

815
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,040
- Yeah, I need head and shoulders.

816
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:44,880
- Yeah.

817
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,340
- Yeah, what's that movie called?

818
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:49,000
With David Duchovny.

819
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,840
- Evolution?

820
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:50,680
- Evolution.

821
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,500
- The X-Files movie?

822
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,340
- Remember that?

823
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,320
- That's the only, I never seen it.

824
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:54,160
I was guessing.

825
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,280
- At the end of Evolution,

826
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,980
it's like the worst product placement ever.

827
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,660
They're like, how do we defeat the aliens?

828
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:01,700
And they're like, we have to use head and shoulders shampoo

829
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:02,840
and spray it all over the earth.

830
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,880
So that's what they do.

831
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:04,880
- Yeah.

832
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,720
That's cool.

833
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,520
That is kind of a cool plot device, I think.

834
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:10,120
You're a girl.

835
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,640
Yeah.

836
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,000
You like shampoo.

837
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,240
You are blue.

838
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:14,740
Whoa.

839
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,960
You like shampoo.

840
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,560
Would you say that you're good, yeah, you're feeling all right,

841
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,800
and baby, you're going to have the best freaking night

842
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,000
of my life?

843
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,840
Yeah.

844
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,520
I would also say dabba-dee.

845
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,020
Yeah.

846
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,520
No.

847
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,020
Dabba-die.

848
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,320
That's not an avatar Navi slang word.

849
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,960
What color is your girlfriend?

850
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,600
My girlfriend?

851
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:33,720
Well, if we're talking about my human girlfriend,

852
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,520
that's one thing.

853
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,600
Well, what is her emotion?

854
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:40,400
I'm looking I'm on the market for a Navi mate.

855
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,200
Not a girlfriend. A mate.

856
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,200
They don't have...

857
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,200
Do you wait so I've seen the movie.

858
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
And I'm...

859
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
What color is your hair?

860
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:57,200
If you're watching this, Neytiri, I know you seem pretty happy with Jake Sully, but take a chance on a guy like me.

861
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,200
Why do they not have nipples?

862
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,200
I don't know, but it's mostly so they can show their boobs the whole movie.

863
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,860
- What if the blue-- - It's so crazy,

864
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:09,280
they do a thousand boob shots of every Navi

865
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,120
a thousand times in life hack.

866
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:14,520
- What if the blue skin is actually shirt material?

867
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,480
- Shirt material, what do you mean?

868
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,840
- What if they have shirt material for clothes?

869
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,440
- You mean fabric? - Or for skin?

870
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,040
- Shirt material for clothes.

871
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,680
- Shirt material for skin.

872
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,520
- Right.

873
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,660
- So you're saying, what if that's not their skin,

874
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,680
what if they have clothes on?

875
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,680
- Yeah, what if that whole blue thing is clothes?

876
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,440
- What would be underneath it?

877
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
- Fucking another shirt.

878
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,120
It kind of is Jake Sully's clothes because he's an actual got no legs guy.

879
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:43,420
Yes. And he's inside of that muscle. A wheelchair. And how did they... He's a wheelchair. How did they grow

880
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:51,180
his blue man? In a tank. So basically his brother was a scientist and... Hats off to

881
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:56,960
him. Yes and shoes off for Jake Sully because he has no use for them. Nope.

882
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:02,840
His brother was a genius and they created an avatar, a Na'vi avatar for him.

883
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:03,680
- Oh.

884
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,800
- And then his brother died for some reason

885
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,640
that I can't remember.

886
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,480
- They don't even say.

887
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,300
- I can't remember.

888
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,140
- Blast it.

889
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:13,380
- And they actually let Jake Sully, despite his form,

890
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:16,800
into the Avatar program and he was also, he's stupid.

891
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:21,440
- So even with his mangled body and useless brain,

892
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,280
they still let him into the program.

893
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,040
- He's like an empty shell.

894
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:27,880
- Okay.

895
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,220
- And they let him be blue.

896
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,060
- Wow.

897
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,520
- It's actually an inspiring story.

898
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,120
and he gets so happy that he can walk that he runs around.

899
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,280
- So even if you're-- - And he plays basketball.

900
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,960
- He does, and he jumps over a garden.

901
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,920
- And I've seen up to that part of the movie.

902
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,600
- You should keep going because after that,

903
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,320
actually what happens is they have--

904
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,160
- Oh, they go down a waterfall.

905
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,280
- They go to an alien, they're on an alien world.

906
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,560
- I will say that's a bit of an oversight

907
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:50,920
by the people in charge of the program

908
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,200
that they would think that that guy

909
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,260
wouldn't wanna stay in Avatar

910
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,120
and marry all those people and chill with them.

911
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,440
It's like, he has no fucking legs.

912
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,560
It's so funny, the whole thing is he's like,

913
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,400
because he was a Marine before his legs got mistaked,

914
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:09,040
he's working with the Marines who wanna,

915
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,240
they hate the scientists,

916
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,480
and he's reporting to the lead Marine guy.

917
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,320
- It's a jock versus nerd movie.

918
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,880
- And they keep being like--

919
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,680
- That's the whole--

920
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,720
- The movie literally is jocks versus nerds

921
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,160
versus blue aliens.

922
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,320
- Yeah, it is.

923
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,760
- And he keeps reporting the Marines,

924
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,880
and the Marine guy's like,

925
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,760
"We're gonna blow up the whole tree."

926
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,600
And Jake Sully's like,

927
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:33,160
"No, I need more time to figure out how to blow up the tree."

928
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,440
And the guy's like, "Okay."

929
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,700
(laughing)

930
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,880
- Man.

931
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,920
- And there's just three hours of that.

932
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,760
- That's so funny.

933
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,600
- It's so sick, dude.

934
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,420
- I'm gonna have to do a rewatch now.

935
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,480
- It's really good.

936
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,000
- Maybe I'll show up next episode.

937
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,320
- I did, I, dude.

938
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,160
- Full blue.

939
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,400
- Oh my God, all three of us in our avatar forms?

940
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,240
- Little bit.

941
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,280
- I'd be the Marine.

942
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,120
- No you wouldn't.

943
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:53,940
- You would not be the Marine.

944
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,780
- I'd be a Marine.

945
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,600
- No, you wouldn't.

946
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,440
- You'd be stuck on Earth.

947
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,280
They would not send you to Pandora.

948
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,100
- I would never, ever, ever.

949
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:03,020
ever betray the USA. I would be probably if they had a real-life Pandora program

950
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,760
I would probably be the first guy they sent over there. No, because of your

951
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:10,180
knowledge. Because of my knowledge about Pandora. I don't think you're the number

952
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:14,060
one Avatar fan. Okay, let's ask him some trivia about Avatar.

953
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,500
All right, I got this. What color is the Na'vi's skin? Blue and some different

954
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:26,260
shades of blue at times. What color is the Na'vi's hair? Dark.

955
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,100
- God.

956
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:31,100
- What is the name of the Na'vi's race?

957
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,940
- Race.

958
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,760
- Na'vi.

959
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,600
- God, he's good.

960
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,260
Where on Earth do the humans live?

961
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,500
- The continents.

962
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,020
- Damn, he's fucking good.

963
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,820
In the second one, which biome do they go into?

964
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,780
- The Way of Water.

965
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,580
- Fucking shit.

966
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,940
In the first one, what is it a,

967
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:54,660
is the first avatar, would you say it's more of a

968
00:40:54,660 --> 00:41:03,460
television show or a film television film. We almost got him there. Okay. What is

969
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:10,860
the color of the Navi's feet?

970
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,160
Blue.

971
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,860
I don't know that one. I actually don't know that one. Why don't, why don't

972
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:22,860
- Why don't the Navi show their bits and pieces?

973
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:26,100
- They do.

974
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,740
I truly cannot stress this enough, guys.

975
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,140
If you, they showed, Navi's entire naked body

976
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,140
is literally hundreds of times.

977
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,220
- But they don't have holes.

978
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,180
- But that's 'cause their holes are their hair.

979
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:38,180
They show that a ton too.

980
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:42,340
- But why even give Zoe Saldana perfect buxom bust?

981
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:45,580
- Because you get to look at it the whole time.

982
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,740
If she had nipples there, they wouldn't show it to you.

983
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:50,860
They show it to you literally 10,000 times.

984
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,320
James Cameron, I'm thinking, this is so crazy.

985
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,240
James Cameron, with how much he's thought about Navi and shit

986
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,980
and how much he's spent designing this

987
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,620
and animating it and all this shit,

988
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,180
he's definitely, probably, honestly,

989
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,380
in the hundreds of times, masturbated thinking about Navi.

990
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,220
Yeah.

991
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,040
Of course, no, right?

992
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,700
He's definitely had sex with his wife

993
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,820
and been like, "I wish she was blue."

994
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,740
He's definitely put on an Oculus headset

995
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:17,980
and had an entire three-dimensional realm

996
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:18,820
that he went into.

997
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,100
- It's a movie about a guy going into a virtual world

998
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,580
where he can fuck a blue alien.

999
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,780
- You're 100% right.

1000
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,980
- That's literally what it's about.

1001
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,820
- He developed all this technology so that he can--

1002
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,300
- Is he becoming a blue alien

1003
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,940
so he can fuck another blue alien?

1004
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,940
- Man, but he's definitely also gotten

1005
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,740
custom designs sent to him.

1006
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,580
- Oh yeah.

1007
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,400
- Had people sign NDAs. - Well, they made

1008
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,860
a Na'vi fleshlight.

1009
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,340
- Not, he didn't make one.

1010
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:40,300
- He designed it.

1011
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:41,380
- Really? - Yeah.

1012
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:44,860
- Wait, isn't it, isn't that you have pussy hair?

1013
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:48,780
There's no hair on it, but you can glue it if you have glue.

1014
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,660
- That's true, I guess the Navi fleshlight

1015
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:54,220
should be like a long braid that you stick your dick in.

1016
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,260
Well that's this fucked up part about the Navi hair

1017
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:59,540
is you're like, oh, the hair is like their dick or whatever.

1018
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,480
And they're like, okay, that's kind of gross and weird,

1019
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,260
but whatever, I can handle it, I guess.

1020
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:06,380
And then they do so many close-ups where it's like

1021
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,300
a Navi is like holding the hair in their hand,

1022
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,220
and it's like, first of all, it's a close-up of them

1023
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
holding the hair in their hand.

1024
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,620
and it's like close up and there's little like

1025
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:18,260
flesh tendrils inside it that are going like this

1026
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:22,620
and then they touch it to a horse's, a horse's.

1027
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,600
- What?

1028
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:24,440
I don't remember this.

1029
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,780
- And then they ride the horse around.

1030
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:26,620
- They got motherfucking horses?

1031
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:29,140
- That's how they ride animals.

1032
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:31,300
When they have horses and the banshees that they fly,

1033
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:32,940
they connect their hair to the animal's hair

1034
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,300
and they go like, ah.

1035
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,540
And then they like fly.

1036
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:37,300
They just literally are fucking the animals.

1037
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:41,020
- They try to like, they try to say that it's kind of

1038
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,860
just like a universal tool that they use.

1039
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:45,060
- It's like USB-C.

1040
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,060
- Yeah, and it's like at first you're like, oh, okay.

1041
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:47,900
- Power and data.

1042
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,740
- That's literally what it is.

1043
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:50,020
- Power and data.

1044
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:52,020
- Oh, this is USB-C that we use with our horses

1045
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,180
and our birds and stuff.

1046
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,780
And then they have this scene where Nateeri and Jake

1047
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,220
are under the tree and they're like, oh.

1048
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,060
- Yeah.

1049
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,900
- And they're touching there and you're like, oh.

1050
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,740
- Man.

1051
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:03,060
- James Cameron loves to put in a scene

1052
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,060
where the two people are,

1053
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:08,380
two people who just met just immediately start fucking.

1054
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,860
- I will say that scene,

1055
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:13,900
Okay, they also didn't just meet so yeah fake avatar fan. They don't really

1056
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:17,580
Avatar, but I know they were completely in love by that fuck

1057
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,020
I know the term and also that scene was hot as fuck and I was beat red in the IMAX theater you

1058
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:27,380
It's hard to get beat red through this exactly you would not be able to I looked purple

1059
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:33,140
Yeah, what if you were listen if you were Navi right and you had a Navi

1060
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:39,380
Boyfriend girlfriend situation or boyfriend only for some people in the look up a sneaky link a sneaky link

1061
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,980
If you had a sneaky ass link with a Navi...

1062
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,180
That's also my Navi's name.

1063
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,180
Listen...

1064
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,780
Her name is Sneaky Link.

1065
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:48,620
I'm on the Navi DL.

1066
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:49,620
Are you...

1067
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:52,620
Here's a question.

1068
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:54,460
There's nothing DL about this.

1069
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,460
Are you...

1070
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:56,460
You're trying to sneak around?

1071
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:57,460
Sneaking out of the house.

1072
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:58,460
Hey, I gotta go to the...

1073
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,460
Are you trying to go to the movies?

1074
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,460
I have to go to Pinto...

1075
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,460
The gym.

1076
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:14,080
I get my steps in. Do you are you here's a big question though. Yeah. Are you pitching you catch it? Oh, oh

1077
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:17,800
I don't know. There's such a thing. Hey, hey a hair is a hair

1078
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:19,140
It's a hair. That's what I said

1079
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,840
That's right a hair is a hair cuz if catching hurts as much as it does in real life

1080
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:25,580
Then I'm not doing that but it does sound kind of fun. I

1081
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:35,620
Wonder how it feels probably hurts really bad like in real life. I wonder if they squirt you don't oh, that's a good one

1082
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:42,620
Na'vi squirt. Yeah, they can. They squirt. They completely squirt. Do their hair squirts?

1083
00:45:42,620 --> 00:45:47,220
My hair squirts. If I run. Do you think that if we introduce hip hop to the Na'vi that

1084
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:53,500
they'd be music videos or they'd shake their hair? That's what the third one's gonna be.

1085
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:59,740
Like that? The third one is called The Pillars. No. Could be introduced to the song Cherry

1086
00:45:59,740 --> 00:46:04,420
Pie. Pillars. Hip hop rappers are pillars because they keep dying from fucking pills.

1087
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:05,460
- That's true. - What'd you say?

1088
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,420
- Could introduce cherry pie by Warrant.

1089
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:08,760
- Hairy guy.

1090
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:11,420
♪ She's my hairy guy ♪

1091
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,260

1092
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,860

1093
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:15,820
- No, it's kinda rotten.

1094
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:16,980
- No. - It's not gonna be a song.

1095
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,580
- Look, I'm trying my best. - Fucking asshole.

1096
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,800
- Just steamrolled my thing

1097
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,940
where I was gonna say-- - ♪ She's my hairy guy ♪

1098
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:25,140

1099

1100

- Or I get taken out of the Avatar program.

1102
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:31,820
- Or I get taken out of the Avatar program.

1103
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,660
♪ She's my hairy guy ♪

1104
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:35,940
- That's pretty good. - Yeah, that's good.

1105
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,900
- I really like how that sounds.

1106
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,780
- If we introduce rock to the Na'vi,

1107
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,780
there's gonna be all sorts of fucking awesome songs.

1108
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,740
- There is a giant rock on Pandora.

1109
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:45,380
- There is the climate.

1110
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:47,220
- They float, the rocks float on Pandora.

1111
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,340
- Dude, oh my God, I just realized something, bro.

1112
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:53,060
Imagine you're riding that Banshee, right?

1113
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,660
And you turn that music up, "Fortunate Son."

1114
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,020
- The Banshee's shaking.

1115
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,580
You have an old Banshee and the wings are going like,

1116
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,220
burn, burn, burn.

1117
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:06,380
I would love 50 inch so my all the all the all the quarters in my banshees cup

1118
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:13,660
holder are rattling around yeah we that's the other thing man if I was if

1119
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,540
they were like guys Pandora's 100% real we're bringing people over I'm

1120
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:21,460
volunteering not to be a Navi but to go be a mass murderer because they don't

1121
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:26,260
matter because they're blue yeah that's I'd be I'd be I'd go over there to learn

1122
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,260
how to do audio installations on the Banshee.

1123
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:33,420
- You would not be putting tweeters.

1124
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,580
- I'd be putting tweeters on.

1125
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:35,420
- You would not be putting--

1126
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:36,260
- I'd be putting those things,

1127
00:47:36,260 --> 00:47:38,220
those like the whistles on the exhaust.

1128
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:39,940
- You would not be putting tweeters on a Banshee.

1129
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,760
You would not be--

1130
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:41,600
- That's the--

1131
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,860
- You can't roll coal with a Banshee, motherfucker.

1132
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:45,260
- That's the Navi version of, you know when you get,

1133
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,540
when you have like a Bluetooth speaker and you connect it

1134
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,740
and it says in like a Chinese accent,

1135
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:51,820
it says Bluetooth connected.

1136
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,180
That's for the Navi.

1137
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:54,980
They connect their phone to their Banshee

1138
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,060
and it's Patrick's voice.

1139
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:57,060
Yeah.

1140
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:58,660
That's the equivalent.

1141
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,860
Your Bluetooth device is connected.

1142
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:02,020
Like they're laughing at the accent.

1143
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,060
Yeah.

1144
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,140
I bought this Bluetooth speaker and I turned it on and

1145
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,900
it made like, it went like, do do do do.

1146
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:12,700
And then it played that fucking, you know that when you get like the phone call in

1147
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:13,700
GTA 5?

1148
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,300
No, make it worse.

1149
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:17,460
Did, did Nico pick up?

1150
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,340
It does that until you connect.

1151
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:21,740
Did the cousin pick up?

1152
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:22,340
No.

1153
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:23,340
I saw a Bluetooth speaker.

1154
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:24,340
But I think if I leave it on, it'll probably do that.

1155
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:27,400
I saw a Bluetooth speaker for $4 at a store.

1156
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,400
Yeah.

1157
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,400
I was curious about it.

1158
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,980
There's a store that's closing in my neighborhood.

1159
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:34,140
I had another fucking weird dream, man.

1160
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,140
I'm so sorry.

1161
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:36,140
$10.

1162
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:37,140
I had another weird, weird dream.

1163
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,140
It sucks.

1164
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,140
It sucks really bad.

1165
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:40,140
I had a dream.

1166
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:41,140
What's the name of the bald guy from GTA V?

1167
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:42,140
Trevor.

1168
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:43,140
Trevor.

1169
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:45,780
I had a dream that I was in a movie with Trevor.

1170
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,540
He was also in Better Call Saul.

1171
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:48,540
But in the act, yeah, he wasn't in Better Call Saul.

1172
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:50,100
I've been watching Better Call Saul.

1173
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,420
I got to finish the sixth season.

1174
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,420
Do not.

1175
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:56,760
You're gonna show up fully Mexican next week, then.

1176
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,600
What?

1177
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:58,420
You can show up fully Mexican like this.

1178
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,260
They have Navi.

1179
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,260
You can show up as Nacho.

1180
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,960
They don't have Navi in the fuck, all right, asshole.

1181
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,320
Trevor was in my movie, Dream,

1182
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,200
and we were acting alongside each other,

1183
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,600
and the director said,

1184
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,380
"How about you walk like Trevor for a minute?"

1185
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:11,300
And then he walked around,

1186
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:12,760
and he looked just like the video game.

1187
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,080
Yeah.

1188
00:49:14,080 --> 00:49:14,920
Oh.

1189
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:15,880
Pretty badass, Dream.

1190
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,720
Way better.

1191
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,880
So you weren't a movie set.

1192
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,720
No te te, though.

1193
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:19,540
You weren't like a movie.

1194
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,380
No, no, I was an actor.

1195
00:49:20,380 --> 00:49:21,220
Yeah.

1198
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,660

1201
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,320
defense person who got arrested for stealing luggage at the airport. Yeah I

1202
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,840
don't have any thoughts on that. Yeah you can go ahead and say your thoughts. I guess you know

1203
00:49:55,840 --> 00:50:00,000
what I have no thoughts that start like this person be like this like I got

1204
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,680
nothing like that. I don't have anything. I was just gonna say that's pretty funny

1205
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,400
crime. Stealing luggage. Stealing luggage really funny crime. I feel like I always

1206
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,760

1207
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,960
getting I'm getting somebody's musty sweaty clothes or I'm getting a snow

1208
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:21,440
globe. Well I saw a picture of that person. The thing is the way they got caught definitely was that they

1209
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,560
picked up a briefcase and a police officer was like there's no way that's

1210
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:30,400
that person. That person does not work like that. You know what sucks is I forgot we're

1211
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:36,200
backlogging so this is gonna be like. Oh if we're talking. It's not gonna be relevant. If we're just talking about news that

1212
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:41,600
happened that's interesting. Okay. Today bro or maybe yesterday four chimpanzees

1213
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:47,020
Shot today I saw this where escaped is in escape didn't even escape from the zoo escape from their enclosure

1214
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:52,120
And they were fucking gun. They were yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, where was it was it what country was it in?

1215
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:58,020
Some European bullshit. I was in Europe. I feel the Louvre a curse. Um shit. Yeah, it's something like that

1216
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:01,480
Yeah

1217
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,520
But whatever yeah, yeah, they were shot

1218
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:09,680
Because they said they ran out of tranquilizer darts. They did not run out of train. Oh, bro. I also see banana

1219
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,620
If we're talking about animal news, let's do some animal news.

1220
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,120
All right.

1221
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:15,920
Directly to camera.

1222
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:17,320
I wish we had a graphic to camera.

1223
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,560
So there was an aquarium in Germany.

1224
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,440
Did you guys see this?

1225
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,120
I saw this too.

1226
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,080
It's 50--

1227
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,920
Animal news.

1228
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:27,360
They're trying to escape.

1229
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,080
Did you see this?

1230
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,880
I guess I'm the audience for the animal news.

1231
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,120
In Germany, it was in a hotel.

1232
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,800
It was a cylindrical aquarium 15 meters tall.

1233
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,000
A million gallons of water.

1234
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,440
And it exploded.

1235
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,280
A million gallons.

1236
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,200
and two were injured, but all the fish were okay.

1237
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,560
(laughing)

1238
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:43,400
- Wow.

1239
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,440
- Yeah, it's a miracle.

1240
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,960
They just started flipping and flopping.

1241
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,280
- Yeah, they went into the bathtub of somebody's hotel room.

1242
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,640
- They all ran into the, they all fell into the toilets.

1243
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,160
- They ran, they ran outside and they ran into the ocean.

1244
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,000
- Yep.

1245
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:55,820
- And they were completely fine.

1246
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,360
- It was all a happy ending.

1247
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,000
- But apparently it was the biggest aquarium cylindrical.

1248
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:01,840
- Wow.

1249
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,280
- It honestly did make me, I was like, okay, great.

1250
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,120
- I'm never going to an aquarium again.

1251
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,280
- Yeah, that's another fear I had to have.

1252
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,120
- That's crazy.

1253
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:09,800
that they can explode yeah I thought that you could shoot a bullet in the bullet

1254
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,640
would jump back into your head I did not know that that could chatter I wonder

1255
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,800
sure if the aquarium breaks right like the glass in the aquarium breaks you're

1256
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,120
fine you know how much time I've been you're fine do you know how much shark

1257
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:25,920
fault like a shark it's not there's no water it's not that you think that we're

1258
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,840
scared of an aquarium exploding because a shark is gonna eat a little bit I am

1259
00:52:29,840 --> 00:52:33,160
scared of that yeah I know he's afraid I know that's what it's shards of glass

1260
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,160
- The glass being launched with a tidal wave.

1261
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,000
- I don't care about the glass.

1262
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,160
- I don't care about the glass.

1263
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:39,040
- Why is the shark what you hoped?

1264
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:39,880
- Well, 'cause think about how--

1265
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:40,720
- The sharks are scarier than glass.

1266
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,840
- Think about the entire point of an aquarium

1267
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:45,440
is to sit and look directly at the shark and go.

1268
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:46,680
- That's true, and follow it.

1269
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,360
- Yeah, well, no, that's what I do.

1270
00:52:48,360 --> 00:52:50,920
- Put slices of bread on either side of me.

1271
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,120
(laughing)

1272
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,600
- You can't get me.

1273
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,080
- I'm dangling on a giant hook, swinging back and forth.

1274
00:52:57,080 --> 00:52:59,720
- You're just like looking back at the shark like, ooh.

1275
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,400
(laughing)

1276
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,240
- Paint my ass red.

1277
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,880
- Yeah. - Like a baboon,

1278
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,280
just like spanking it. - Pachum over my body.

1279
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,880
- I bet you want this so bad.

1280
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,920
- You will never get this, you will never get this.

1281
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,160
(laughing)

1282
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:14,280
Yeah, but then if the aquarium fucking breaks,

1283
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,520
what if the shark, what if we walk out and we're like,

1284
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,920
oh well, thank God we escaped the aquarium and all the water

1285
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:23,960
and you say, Caleb, there's a shark on your fucking head.

1286
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,000
- Dude, do you know what's so funny?

1287
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,680
When you're saying that, so you're trapped in an aquarium,

1288
00:53:28,680 --> 00:53:31,120
the shark tank broke, there's water on the floor,

1289
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,960
there's a shark swimming around, it's trying to get you,

1290
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:33,860
and you have to get out.

1291
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:35,480
That would be an incredible movie, right?

1292
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:36,320
- That would be.

1293
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,800
- And I was thinking about, that would be such a good movie.

1294
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:42,320
And you know how stupid horror movie makers are?

1295
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,160
- They've already done it.

1296
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,840
- No, I was thinking they should make a movie like that.

1297
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,620
And I realized, there is a movie like that,

1298
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,080
but it's not set in an aquarium,

1299
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,080
it's set in a grocery store.

1300
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:51,920
- What movie?

1301
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,520
- Why did they make a grocery store?

1302
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,360
- Wait, what is it?

1303
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,760
- It's called Bait.

1304
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:58,480
- Oh man, yeah, why would you not make an aquarium one?

1305
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,160
Aquarium is the most obvious place

1306
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,640
to set any kind of fish thing.

1307
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,480
- I watched that movie so long ago.

1308
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,320
- Is that the one with the crocodile?

1309
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,280
- No, it's with a shark.

1310
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,800
- That's called Basement or some shit.

1311
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,640
- Crawl.

1312
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,140
- Bait is Australian and it's in a grocery store

1313
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,640
and there's a flood.

1314
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:17,600
It's the same as Crawl, but in a grocery store.

1315
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:18,440
- Huh?

1316
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:19,260
- They eat sharks down there.

1317
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:20,100
- That's true.

1318
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:20,940
- This shark eats them.

1319
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,760
- Australians, they all eat sharks.

1320
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,560
- But how stupid are Australians to think

1321
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,200
we're gonna make a movie where a shark gets into a place

1322
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:28,260
and it's not an aquarium.

1323
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:31,260
You know what, I saw this has nothing to do,

1324
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,860
this actually kind of has something to do with sharks.

1325
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:35,280
It has a lot to do with sharks.

1326
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:37,500
I almost bought shark jerky.

1327
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:40,100
- No, that can't be legal.

1328
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,380
That can't be legal, man.

1329
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:44,220
- I almost bought it, it was at a mall in New Jersey.

1330
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:47,060
I almost bought it, but it was like 20 bucks.

1331
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:49,460
- Oh, you went to an exotic jerky store?

1332
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,020
- Yeah, there's an exotic jerky store

1333
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:52,260
in the American Dream Mall.

1334
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,100
- There's one in--

1335
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,140
- It's right next to the Nickelodeon Universe.

1336
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:57,340
- There's one in Morro Bay, California.

1337
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:59,380
I think I had a snake jerky there.

1338
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:00,940
- They had all these different jerkies.

1339
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:02,000
- I had beef jerky.

1340
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,020
- And a guy was offering samples.

1341
00:55:05,020 --> 00:55:07,100
- True, beef is in a completely other place.

1342
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,020
Do you think a shark bite might operate

1343
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,900
kind of like a sniper wound where it doesn't really,

1344
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,900
like until you notice it, it's like not a big deal.

1345
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,660
- I think so, 'cause you go in,

1346
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:17,580
I genuinely think you go into shock when you get bit by a shark.

1347
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,940
- Yeah, so you could go for a while

1348
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:21,420
with a shark flipping around

1349
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:23,620
and everybody who you look at is horrified.

1350
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:24,460
They're going, "Ah!"

1351
00:55:24,460 --> 00:55:25,500
They're covering their kid's eyes.

1352
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,380
But as long as you don't notice, you're fine.

1353
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:28,460
Yeah, you're good.

1354
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:28,940
Yeah.

1355
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:29,540
You good.

1356
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:31,340
I think that's most things.

1357
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:31,860
Huh?

1358
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:32,340
Most things.

1359
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:33,380
If you don't notice it--

1360
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,420
Shark bites and snipers.

1361
00:55:35,420 --> 00:55:36,460
Shark bites and snipers.

1362
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:37,780
What about a beast thing?

1363
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,660
A beast?

1364
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,580
A beast thing?

1365
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:40,740
A beast thing eating you.

1366
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,620
I heard apparently that it's very dangerous.

1367
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:46,340
I guess there's these things called killer beasts that

1368
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,260
can sting you.

1369
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:47,760
Yes.

1370
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,260
It's very scary.

1371
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:50,820
I can't believe that--

1372
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,740
I mean, I feel like this would be bigger news.

1373
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:53,940
Can I ask an honest question?

1374
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:54,420
No.

1375
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:57,140
- What the fuck makes a bee Africanized?

1376
00:55:57,140 --> 00:55:58,260
- I think it's--

1377
00:55:58,260 --> 00:55:59,980
- What the fuck is that?

1378
00:55:59,980 --> 00:56:00,820
Why, who--

1379
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:03,140
- Thank God you got two experts in the room.

1380
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:05,940
- I think what it is, I think it's a type of bee

1381
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:08,000
that they, like an invasive, like I think

1382
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,740
they brought a species from Africa.

1383
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:11,020
- But that's just an African bee,

1384
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,820
what makes it Africanized?

1385
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,660
- Yeah.

1386
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:16,500
- Somebody put some lever that one half was off

1387
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:19,460
and the other half was Africa and they turn it on?

1388
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:21,380
- I think maybe they breed them.

1389
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,580
I think it's like a type of bee that they like mix,

1390
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:24,420
They crossbreed it.

1391
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,980
- You think they got that good honey though?

1392
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,300
- No. - No, they don't have,

1393
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,260
it's like a wasp.

1394
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,880
- What the mother fuck happened to murder hornets?

1395
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,640
I thought these were gonna be cray.

1396
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,000
- Talk on that.

1397
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,460
Yeah, and you know they said that there was--

1398
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,460
- Oh, there's one.

1399
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,680
There's one right there.

1400
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:41,280
- Oh, there's one.

1401
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:42,520
- There was a bug flying.

1402
00:56:42,520 --> 00:56:43,360
- Really?

1403
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:44,180
- Yeah, we both saw it.

1404
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,660
You're blind.

1405
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,240
- Oh my God.

1406
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:48,720
Wait, you were so ready.

1407
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,120
- Am I closing my eyes or no?

1408
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:52,320
- I can't even tell. - I can't even tell.

1409
00:56:52,320 --> 00:56:53,160
- Completely blind.

1410
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,780
have an amazing auditory. Yeah I thought that I thought that murder hornets are

1411
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:03,140
gonna be just as big as friggin Carole Baskin and yeah and Karen's. Karen's.

1412
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,600
Whatever happened to Karen's? We still have Karen's around. Whatever happened to those?

1413
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:09,880
We still have Karen's. You know the ultimate. What happened to them? The ultimate

1414
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,360
imagine if Carole Baskin was a Karen. She is dude no need to imagine. They passed a

1415
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:21,240
law. You're still doing this? They passed a law that bans the it's like going or I don't

1416
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:29,920
remember exactly what it was. I wish that you were like late night Johnny Carson

1417
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,960
telling that story. They passed a law. No no you come over to the couch, Patrick why don't you

1418
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:39,840
come over here. You sit down you say they passed a law and I don't really remember

1419
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:45,320
what it is. I guess they're finally cracking down on like people owning like tigers and

1420
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,320
shit. Oh okay that's probably good. Yeah it's for the best but like. Unless you're a

1421
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:53,060
I fucking hey they can do whatever they want as long as they don't take my banshee

1422
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:59,120
That's right, and I hear they shut down if they come for alligators. They shut down alligator adventure

1423
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:03,360
I will literally I will be so fine if people start protesting alligator adventure

1424
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:08,360
I will do protests. I will drive a van through the crowd. I fucking I will do this

1425
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,520
Just let the alligators out when people protest

1426
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:15,280
Pussies cry yeah, Oh

1427
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:22,640
Alligators aren't even they don't they aren't dangerous like that man. Yeah, they don't bite. No they don't have teeth

1428
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:24,640
You know what I didn't like it

1429
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:30,640
I didn't like about the the the crocodiles that we did see the crocodiles and the alligators what I?

1430
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:35,840
Just did this to come for you because you said you didn't like something. I just like this nice moment, okay

1431
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:38,080
You play six pence none the richer

1432
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:41,200
Put play that six pence

1433
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,800
- Zoom in. - No.

1434
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,280
- It's kind of a stupid name. - None the Richer.

1435
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,120
- None the Richer.

1436
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:45,960
- Yeah, but it's kind of like--

1437
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:48,160
- I'm None the Richer. - Doing all the heavy lifting

1438
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,000
in that name.

1439
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,760
- But I thought that the whole point was like,

1440
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,080
oh yeah, it's Sixpence None the Richer

1441
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:54,440
because even if we had Sixpence, we wouldn't really care

1442
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,640
'cause it would be None the Richer because--

1443
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,880
- But the thing I didn't like,

1444
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:00,600
you guys playing, what was that game?

1445
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,160
- Finger Hold. - No, the--

1446
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,000
- Don't try to snivel out of this.

1447
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,160
You did it.

1448
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,000
- Your hand is so sweaty. - Look at his--

1449
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:10,240
- That was so easy. - Look at his red tip.

1450
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:14,480
look at his red hand. It's not sweaty at all. It's oil.

1451
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,600
And I think it's because he let go. I was trying to show off how good your grip

1452
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:23,680
was and you sabotaged it. I do have awful grip strength. Yeah, really?

1453
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,020
Yeah. Oh, but the alligators had their mouths open and they would sit there and

1454
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:30,880
just go. Yeah, that's how they release heat, I think. Yeah.

1455
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,560
That's weird. I think that's like their version of sweating. It's like a dog panting, I think.

1456
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:38,680
And you couldn't see a hole. Oh, yeah, that is weird.

1457
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:40,680
Yeah, I agree with that being weird.

1458
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,680
They'd had no hole in their mouth.

1459
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,680
I wish alligators had a hole.

1460
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,680
They do have a hole.

1461
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:48,680
I do think that eating...

1462
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,680
I wish alligators had hair.

1463
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:52,680
I want to put something in there.

1464
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,680
I'm covering my mouth so he doesn't see me saying this.

1465
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,680
We had alligator in Texas.

1466
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,680
We had alligator.

1467
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,680
And it's good.

1468
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:02,680
It tasted like food.

1469
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,680
Yeah, but I do think now,

1470
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,680
after different connections that I've had with alligators,

1471
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:10,960
connections that I've had with alligators, I do think that it is immoral to eat an alligator.

1472
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,680
I think it's more immoral to eat an alligator. I think you can tell that it's immoral to eat

1473
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,800
an alligator if you watch a video of someone preparing an alligator. When they leave the

1474
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:20,280
head skin on. When they inflate it to get the skin off, do you know what I'm talking

1475
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,760
about? Yeah, it's awful, dude. It's crazy. We watched that video of the guy making a

1476
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:29,800
turtle soup, right? Yeah. Yeah, I don't like that video much. Turtles, uh... Yeah, you

1477
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:34,760
ever saw Cannibal Holocaust? Turtles are good. Built-in bowl, they make sense for a special

1478
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,960
I think I've seen the scene from Cannibal Holocaust. Yeah full movie, but they just go to town on a turtle

1479
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:43,900
Yeah, they just take his shell off, and they're just that's just his gut I just yeah

1480
01:00:43,900 --> 01:00:51,940
It's really gross you know like they also they kill some

1481
01:00:51,940 --> 01:01:01,040
You know yeah like this yeah, just remembering that in my brain just I went I

1482
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:08,480
Was like this have you guys ever seen that super smash brothers video wombo combo? Oh my god that a falco

1483
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,880
Yeah, that is a funny ass fucking video. I don't know

1484
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:17,200
Yeah, I would love to see them do to falco what they did to that turtle you guys ever seen will it blend. Yes

1485
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:20,880
He puts a PlayStation

1486
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:23,520
What was the one with the microwave do you guys watch the one?

1487
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:26,440
Is it a good idea to microwave this with Jordan? Yes?

1488
01:01:26,520 --> 01:01:32,900
That was a fucking microwave the microwave. Do you remember the one where they did the airbag and it blew up?

1489
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:38,080
Have you guys seen too many cooks? That's the same. Yeah, I think about it and I'm ready to dry comedy level

1490
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:45,140

Time for you to get a watch. Yep pound that out. I guess we have a stopwatch and we never did it

1501
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:39,680
but it was your fault. It's probably over here. I just saw a bug on the ground. Oh no.

1502
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:44,120
Oh not a bug. We got bugs now. Patrick it wasn't your fault I was lying. I know you

1519
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:38,080

1520
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,560
about a Taco Bell blue taco.

1521
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,100
- Oh my God.

1522
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:41,940
Bro.

1523
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,320

01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,000
- Okay, don't say that shit.

1525
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:48,520
Don't say that motherfucking shit to me.

01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:49,360
- Man.

1527
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:50,200
- Avatar food.

1528
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:51,700
I'll just search avatar food.

1529
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:54,960
That was definitely done, right?

1530
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,380
