Yeah, I got a P, my PC came in, I've been gaming just like a fuckin' madman.

40
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,620
What have you been playing?

41
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,100
I've been playing games.

42
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,100
Really?

43
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,100
Really?

44
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,060
No, I've been playing like, I played a lot of, I was playing Star Wars Battlefront before

45
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
this.

46
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,460
What other games have I been playing?

47
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,700
I have not been playing Blade Symphony.

48
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,340
Blade Simulator?

49
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,740
I don't know what Blade Symphony is, but I have it.

50
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,740
Blade Simulator.

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:35,660
That's where you take a picture of yourself and it gives you sunglasses and a trench coat.

52
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,740
It makes you a black vampire hunter, yeah.

53
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:44,700
It's like face app, but it only makes you look like Wesley Snipes in Blade.

54
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,860
It's face app, but it only shows you a picture of Wesley Snipes.

55
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:51,900
Doesn't even make you look like him.

56
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,060
Oh, we've been playing TF2.

57
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,460
Yeah we played TF2 last night.

58
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:59,420
Yeah, we played TF2 last night.

59
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,060
I have not played that game since I was in like community college.

60
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,980
It's still like a perfect game I feel.

61
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,980
Yeah it's very-

62
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,860
Like not like perfect but it's like one of the best games to just like-

63
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,860
Just fuck around.

64
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,860
Yeah.

65
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,020
The problem with it though is now there's like any server you join there's something

66
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
weird happening.

67
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
Oh there's like a billion bots.

68
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,100
In every server there's a- yeah there's at least one like really weird thing that makes

69
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,780
it impossible to play the game the way you want to.

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,780
Like-

71
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:33,240
Yeah there was like an aimbot last night that was saying the n-word and just like standing

72
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,780
in the middle of the map.

73
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:40,780
Yeah, there was, there was like this, there was this kid and this adult who were just having

74
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:46,580
a conversation in voice chat.

75
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,700
And then I asked, "Are you guys father and son?"

76
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,220
And simultaneously they said yes and no.

77
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:55,500
One of them said yes and one of them said no.

78
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,500
That game's the best.

79
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,660
Yeah, dude, you get, it's like the, it's just like a melting pot of just like the weirdest

80
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:06,980
fucking people on earth.

81
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,540
It's like freaking New York City.

82
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,340
It's like Ellis Island combined with the Statue of Bibberty.

83
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,340
Statue of Mike Bibber- Bibby.

84
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,340
Mike Birbiglia.

85
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,340
Yeah, it's a statue of Mike Birbiglia.

86
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,060
No Mike Birbiglia, it's a different guy.

87
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:27,700
They're gonna put that, they're gonna have Mike Birbiglia replace the Statue of Liberty.

88
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,900
He's gonna be like, "Hey guys!

89
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:31,900
I got...

90
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,900
I'm bringing you to freedom!"

91
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,540
Yeah, dude.

92
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,060
They're changing the freaking name to New Dork City.

93
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,060
Yeah, 'cause he's there.

94
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:44,960
Yeah, 'cause he's the new statue.

95
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,460
He's the statue and he's the fucking dork ass bitch.

96
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:51,220
And New Dork City, they also have Adam Ellis Island.

97
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:53,180
Who's Adam Ellis?

98
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:57,460
Adam Ellis is the guy who makes those comics that are like, "Shh, let people enjoy things."

Yeah, that's the other thing.

145
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:20,000
I fuckin' I bought uh two nights ago I bought Cameron a copy of Star Wars Battlefront 2

146
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:29,000
the 2005 one and uh we I didn't I didn't check if it was like a cross plat game like a not

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,140
like cross platform but like a

148
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,640
I mean it's not for Mac

149
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,720
Yeah it's not optimized for Mac

150
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,540
I only got a Macbook he messed up he wasted fuckin' twenty dollars on me

151
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,860
No it was only ten bucks

152
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,060
Oh alright I don't feel bad anymore now

153
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:47,340
Yeah, you bought me a Minecraft account after I bought the wrong Minecraft.

154
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,340
I forgot I did that.

155
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,340
Now I...

156
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,340
Dude, why...

157
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:56,380
He's buying games without checking anything about them.

158
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:01,340
Why is there a specific Minecraft thing that works with their fucking server?

159
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,440
There's like a bunch of different...

160
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,440
There's also like...

161
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,860
Because you can get Minecraft on like Switch or something and that also doesn't work with

162
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,320
like other types of Minecraft.

163
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:12,000
There's like five types of Minecraft that only work with each other.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's fucked up.

165
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
That's so fucking stupid.

166
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
Just make all of them work together.

167
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Yeah.

168
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,180
Nazi, you fucking Nazi bitch.

169
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,640
I'm gonna get out in the streets and I'm gonna protest for that.

170
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm gonna say.

171
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Oh yeah.

172
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,640
I'm gonna get all the-

173
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,840
Yeah, I'm gonna add that onto the- I'm gonna get into the congress and I'm gonna tack onto

174
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,760
the end of the police defunding bill.

175
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm gonna put in a little thing at the end that says also all the Minecraft virgins have

176
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
to work together.

177
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Uh huh.

178
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:54,740
to

179
00:08:54,740 --> 00:09:12,340
to

180
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:17,000
you know the animon the skeleton yet i have a firewood my bill

181
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,420
my executive order when i'm president everyone gets a phone pickaxe

182
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,220
phone diamonds picket yeah working and we're giving everyone a chest or filling

183
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:27,980
it with diamonds

184
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,100
yeah for a mine

185
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,040
mind right like a diamond

186
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,620
and then at the bottom of the minecraft bill right there's an asterisk ok and

187
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:40,340
it's a defund the police it's as black lives matter

188
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:42,440
and then legally they do

189
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,120
and legally yet

190
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,880
and then we see a little child the problem we sell all the problems in the

191
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,380
country because everyone has a phone pickaxe and

192
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:55,400
uh... to copter defunded and racism is over

193
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,120
you know on

194
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,020
you know those people who are like uh... we're like man everyone just needs to do

195
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:04,760
some psychedelics and change their perspective on things and they'll

196
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:07,000
understand there'll be no more hate in the world

197
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,640
yet to want to be that guy but for playing minecraft i think that when you

198
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,600
play minecraft

199
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,120
there is a uh...

200
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,160
there's a thing that snaps in your brain there's a thing that changes in your brain

201
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,600
fundamentally there's a switch that goes from cruelty to love

202
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,400
alright

203
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,580
it's like when you play minecraft and you build

204
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,800
you so

205
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
caleb right let's take the example of caleb okay yeah caleb usually is very

206
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,920
violent virulent racist

207
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:34,840
horrible man before but that was before

208
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:39,040
he built he went in the micro survey built a wooden tower that was just a bunch of

209
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
wooden blocks that went all the way up to the sky level right

210
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,600
that agree for comes in and burned down his tower

211
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,900
and now

212
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,800
caleb is gay

213
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,080
it changes it changed switches

214
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,200
your brain

215
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,420
hate to love

216
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,520
when you when you're something you build and spend time on gets destroyed

217
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,760
there's something in your mind that just

218
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,000
activates

219
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,600
right and let's see the world in a different way

220
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,320
it's true it's for you you you play as uh...

221
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,620
you download the current frog with the infinity gauntlet skin

222
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,420
and you get into that game

223
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,680
download minecraft

224
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,720
put on a skin of a of a guy who's a different race from you and you'll

225
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,120
understand the experience

226
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,720
of a different person in america

227
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
yeah

228
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,800
that's how we're gonna solve this

229
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,520
that that is how we solve every

230
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,340
every race-related problem in this country

231
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,580
yet we

232
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:43,160
we put we put the cops through a six-week

233
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,360
minecraft intensive

234
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,360
yeah of course okay wait here's our new bill

235
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,240
the new minecraft bill is we're giving

236
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,760
we're giving every police department a billion more dollars to buy

237
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,480
to buy computers and minecraft for everyone on the force

238
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,080
and trust you'll buy it and make a difference

239
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:08,560
joe biden is just announced he's buying six hundred alienware or as for the

240
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,700
boston police department

241
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,920
it's the but the

242
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
yet cops can carry guns anymore now they just carry

243
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
they carry wooden swords

244
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,980
they carry a pity carry the phone pickaxe the carrier the uh... x

245
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,980
they have all the uh... the look

246
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,500
There are some creepers in the police force, okay?

247
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,220
(laughing)

248
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,420
I'm just gonna say it.

249
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,420
There's some creepers in the police force,

250
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,500
and we need to,

251
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,100
shut up.

252
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,300
We need to make them explode.

253
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,140
- Yeah.

254
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:47,220
We need to shoot them with a bow and arrow.

255
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,220
- Yeah, we need to get, we need to feed them our chickens,

256
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,160
we need to feed them our pigs,

257
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,000
and we need to uh... just mine so much obsidian

258
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,880
so we can make another portal

259
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,080
that's what the people in the autonomous zone people understand

260
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:12,080
the importance of minecraft. They're trying to create another portal. They're trying to farm, they're trying to make another portal.

261
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,060
because you see if you go through the nether portal you can collect glowstone

262
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,740
dust and you can craft that into glowstone and you know what that means?

263
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:22,600
that's light you don't even need electricity for, okay?

264
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,720
fuck dude

265
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,120
and that pretty much solves the energy crisis for their attitude they're trying

266
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,720
to do some nicole tesla uh... and you know the rack you know that stuff burns

267
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:37,080
infinitely that bird that's the only one stop meowing again

268
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,200
all this uh...

269
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,100
yet another act as a stop

270
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,800
doesn't ever stop burning so that's pretty much

271
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,440
perpetual motion machine room

272
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,240
what whatever

273
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,440
He's just... He was sitting in the bathroom on the sink and just meowing.

274
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,440
Was he looking in the mirror?

275
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,240
No, no he was looking at the door. He was waiting for me to come get him.

276
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Oh that's sweet.

277
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,240
But I was saying right, the netherrack it burns infinitely. So that's pretty much a perpetual motion machine or something.

278
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Okay. So we get netherrack and we um...

279
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
We get all the netherrack...

280
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:19,820
that generate the fire okay then infinite fire from another act we use that too

281
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,760
power steam powered computers

282
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,820
for everyone in the world to play mine so

283
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:30,040
date they are a built-in car that runs on another act but

284
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,880
the government doesn't want you to know that like

285
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,600
it doesn't want you to

286
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,240
to build a car based on the other act

287
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,080
date that's why they put regulations on their portals that's why you're not

288
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,380
allowed to build a portals in city limits

289
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:52,820
I heard that Donald Trump is going to be enforcing more restrictions on nether portals.

290
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,140
I heard that's the platform he's running on.

291
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:57,140
Dude, that's dangerous.

292
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,060
The people want nether portals.

293
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,060
Exactly.

294
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:05,980
You can't strip people of the things that they need, like nether portals and the eye

295
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,980
of the spider.

296
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:14,980
uh...

297
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,940
yet

298
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:21,460
for not going to rest until we build in chairman tables for everybody in the

299
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,080
city

300
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,900
yeah i'm starting a new mutual aid fund and you can donate you can donate

301
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,400
uh... wooden planks so i can build crafting benches for everybody

302
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,400
*laughing*

303
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,400
*laughing*

304
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
*laughing*

305
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
*laughing*

306
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
*laughing*

307
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
*laughing*

308
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
*laughing*

309
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,400
*laughing*

310
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
*laughing*

311
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,400
*laughing*

312
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,400
*laughing*

313
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,400
*laughing*

314
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,400
*laughing*

315
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,400
*laughing*

316
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,560
super cheap. No it was like 30 bucks. Damn dude, you're stupid as hell. I know, I feel

317
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:12,280
dumb. Nah, to be fair that, I wouldn't have known that either unless somebody in the discord

318
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,720
told me. Yeah no one explained it, no one in the discord, so this is on the discord.

319
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,040
Well no they did explain it but that was like months ago, that was like in March when everyone

320
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,640
started playing Minecraft in the discord. So what they need to do is, they need to give

321
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:33,640
me

322
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:38,680
right now? Is he back in the bathroom? He's back in the bathroom. He's sitting on the sink just

323
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:44,200
fucking meowing at me. Oh he clearly wants you to go to the bathroom. You guys clearly have a routine.

324
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Maybe he's thirsty. Hold on. All right. Patrick has to go and uh go to the bathroom in front of

325
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,440
his cat because that's a that's a thing he does every day. The cat's meowing in the bathroom

326
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:02,120
waiting for him because he knows unless Patrick drops a big brown wet load into the toilet he's

327
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:09,120
not gonna stop meowing. So Pat has to go do that really quick. Yeah, I don't know what

328
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,520
to talk about. I guess we shouldn't have dead air here. Maybe I'll just edit it out. Probably

329
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,520
not. I've been playing a bunch of Binding of Isaac. That's a fun game. All the stuff

330
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,520
I have left to unlock though is really hard. It's annoying.

331
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,600
I'm back.

332
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,560
Welcome back.

333
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm back.

334
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,560
What was it?

335
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,360
You just needed to poop in front of your cat and he stopped?

336
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,360
No, he was thirsty.

337
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
Yeah, for your pee pee out of the toilet?

338
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,080
No, he was not thirsty for my pee pee out of the toilet.

339
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,080
Why are you so defensive?

340
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,240
Sounds like I may have hit a nerve here.

341
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,680
He was not drinking out of the toilet.

342
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,160
If he was drinking out of the toilet, it would have solved-

343
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,220
He wasn't drinking out of the toilet because there was no pee in it.

344
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,520
It would have solved this problem.

345
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,280
No, he would not drink out of the toilet if there was pee in it.

346
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,080
That's the only way he would drink out of the toilet and he would only drink out of it if

347
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,480
it was your pee in it.

348
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
No.

349
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,240
If I came to your house and I went pee in the toilet, your cat would not drink out of

350
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,240
it.

351
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,680
He would probably drink it because he's stupid.

352
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,160
But he would drink your pee, not mine.

353
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
He would drink anyone's pee.

354
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,400
He would drink your pee because he's used to drinking it because that's what you give

355
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,480
him to drink.

356
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,300
I do not give him pee to drink.

357
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,300
You absolutely do.

358
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,300
I've seen you do it on multiple occasions.

359
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,300
I have not done it.

360
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,160
I have not done that.

361
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,960
You give him pee to drink and you pee in the toilet and then you grab him and you overhand

362
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:38,840
throw him into the toilet. You drink Peter's juice. That's what you do. Why are you putting

363
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:47,520
a mask on? What are you doing? Stop. Just chilling. Yeah we're just chilling today. This is our

364
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:53,920
just chilling episode. Yeah, Caleb's not here. He's kind of the dad of the show. Cameron's

365
00:18:53,920 --> 00:19:00,920
the mom. I'm not the mom of the show. Cameron's the mom of the show. I'm the silent child.

366
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,120
You're the silent mom. I'm the silent child. Moms are not silent. You're the silent mom.

367
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,920
That is ridiculous because have you ever heard of a silent mom? I don't think that's possible.

368
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:15,920
You are the silent mom. No, I'm the silent child. And you, you my friend, are the closet

369
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:22,440
monster of the family. I'm not the closet monster. You're the closet monster of the family, dude.

370
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:29,800
You're the silent mom, I'm the bad boy son, I'm the black sheep of the family, and Caleb

371
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:39,240
is the dad who sits at home and he shits and he drinks Milwaukee's Best.

372
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,480
I'm the silent child of the podcast.

373
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,520
You are not.

374
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,120
You are not the silent child.

375
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm the silent child, that means I don't talk and I'm cool.

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,560
I don't talk because I'm cool.

377
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,640
I'm too cool to talk.

378
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,920
You're the silent child because you sit there and you, um, fucking, you sit there and you

379
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:02,240
do, um, you plan stuff.

380
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,600
You plan dark things.

381
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,040
I don't plan- okay, well yes, I do plan dark things.

382
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,760
You plan to make people have dark experiences.

383
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:15,600
I plan to bring people into my dark system and process them throughout its entire extent.

384
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,760
Cameron's dark system.

385
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,680
You do not want to be a victim of my system, alright?

386
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,460
I'll tell you that right now.

387
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,760
There's about a thousand steps and all of them are fraught with pain, okay?

388
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:30,800
They're gonna be dark, they're gonna be dehumanizing, they're gonna be barbaric and vicious, alright?

389
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,960
See, this is, these are the kind of things- And there is a lot of paperwork involved in

390
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,960
the system.

391
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:39,920
Yeah, so that's what I was trying to say is that these are the kind of things that a freak

392
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,280
would, a freak child would do.

393
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,020
I'm the freaky silent child.

394
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,920
I'm the silent freak.

395
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,040
You're a silent freak.

396
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:54,040
I'm always, I've got a slight wry sardonic smile on my face because I'm always calculating the most suffering that I can put people through.

397
00:20:54,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I'm looking at people's faces and I'm analyzing the light behind their eyes and how I can best target their deepest fears and anxieties

398
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,040
with a special tailored system of my own design called the Dark System.

399
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
Cameron's Dark System is uh...

400
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
It's called the Dark System, okay?

401
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,040
It doesn't have my name in it so it can't be traced back to me.

402
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:17,400
It has your name all over it.

403
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,440
No, it has your name all over it because I'm writing your name on all the paperwork because

404
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,760
you're the next one getting processed through the system, my friend.

405
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,160
I'm going to put you on a giant conveyor belt, okay?

406
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:33,640
And it's going to have hot dogs on strings and they're descending, they're coming down,

407
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,840
they're going right towards your mouth, and then at the last second it pulls back up.

408
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,640
That's the first step of my dark system that I've designed for you.

409
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,200
The second step is I'm going to come into your house and I'm going to pee on your computer

410
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,640
keyboard and it's going to electrocute you because you're going to be using the keyboard.

411
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,240
How would it electrocute me?

412
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,840
Because my system, I've designed it to redirect the electricity.

413
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,840
I've wired your entire apartment.

414
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,440
Your system is flawed.

415
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
Your system is flawed.

416
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,800
There's not a single flaw in my system.

417
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
It's airtight.

418
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
It's foolproof.

419
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,840
The electricity would travel up your pee stream.

420
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,480
It would travel up your pee stream.

421
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:08,120
No, okay, well there's where you're wrong because I have a non-conductive penis.

422
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
You have a conductive penis.

423
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:17,940
I had a wood casing constructed for it, okay?

424
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:20,320
So it's not, that wouldn't happen.

425
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,000
And it's for exactly that reason.

426
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
It would happen.

427
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,120
You would actually, it would set your penis on fire because the electricity would go up

428
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
and it would shock it.

429
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,520
Okay, but around the wood it's covered in ice.

430
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,520
Which is non-flammable.

431
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
It would melt the ice.

432
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,080
It can't, it's permafrost.

433
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,080
It's not.

434
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,080
Yeah, it's permafrost actually. Jack Frost actually put it on there.

435
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Yeah, Jack Frost constructed my penis.

436
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,080
I got it commissioned by Jack Frost.

437
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:55,080
I went to his Etsy page and I asked him, "Hey, I need a penis for my dark system."

438
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,080
Yeah, I need a...

439
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Hey, okay, so here's the deal, right? I have this wooden penis so I can pee on Pat's keyboard without it electrocuting me,

440
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,960
But I need some kind of ice casing around it so that it doesn't catch on fire.

441
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,960
One Patrick.

442
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,760
And will this work with my system?

443
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Yeah.

444
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,320
Is this system compliant?

445
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,040
Is this compatible with my dark system?

446
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:22,840
Yeah, dude, I got the first one installed and it wasn't compatible so I had to melt

447
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,440
it off and try again.

448
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,800
It was fucked up, dude.

449
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,800
in terms of my dark system.

450
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,800
Just going into Best Buy.

451
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,800
[Laughter]

452
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,800
Yeah, I'm really liking this TV, but I'm just wondering if it would be possible...

453
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,800
Do you think this would interact well with my dark system, or should I choose another one?

454
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
[Laughter]

455
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,800
Oh, it connects to my dark system via Bluetooth. Okay.

456
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Oh, alright. Okay, that's good.

457
00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,240
Yeah, they try to show you which washer/dryer to get and you say, "Oh, see, this is really

458
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:05,760
nice but I do actually have a dark system I've been following, so I'm going to have to look

459
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
at a different option."

460
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,880
What is it?

461
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,880
Is that a Maytag?

462
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:15,400
Ooh, yeah, no, something about the parts in that, they don't, they're not compliant with

463
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
the dark system.

464
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,840
Yeah, do you have one that has blades on the inside?

465
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,600
Do you have one that's a portal to hell?

466
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:29,600
I'm really looking for a gothic style washer and dryer.

467
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,600
I'd like one that's made out of cobblestone, okay?

468
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,600
And it's got a flying buttress on the top.

469
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,600
And a stained glass window so I can look in on my clothes.

470
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,600
A stained glass window on your...

471
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,600
Okay, yeah, I need a gothic washing machine for my capes.

472
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:57,600
I have a gothic washing machine with a stained glass portrait of Christopher Lee on the front

473
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,600
and I only use it for my capes.

474
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:05,600
I only use it for my capes and my frilly...

475
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:13,600
I use a special red tide and I only use it for my frilly shirts and my capes.

476
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,600
The tide pod looks like an eyeball.

477
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,600
Yeah.

478
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:24,680
Do you have a washing machine that's filled with worms and soil?

479
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:31,360
I need to wash my bones.

480
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,640
I need to wash and dry my bones.

481
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,760
Yeah I got a Maytag, it's the Maytag Gothic line.

482
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,840
Yeah, it's...

483
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,240
The Maytag Dark System.

484
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,520
Yeah, the new Dark Appliances line.

485
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520

The Maytag Dark Appliance is lying.

489
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:59,520
They have a dishwasher that only works for goblets and chalices and grails.

490
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Oh, what the fuck? I put my Tupperware in this and it fucking melted it.

Oh yeah, no no no, you had it on the chalice setting. That's why.

00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:49,780
Yeah sure, come on down to the basement.

517
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:57,380
Come to the catacombs, the Best Buy catacombs.

518
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,020
The walls are made of skulls and bones.

519
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:06,580
They have just like a stalag whatever, which one's the one that goes up?

520
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Stalagmite.

521
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:10,420
Stalagmite goes up, stalactite goes down.

522
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:15,880
They just have a stalactite that has a price check on it.

523
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:23,540
We have a wrought iron gaming PC.

524
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,180
And it runs on torture.

525
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,220
It runs on sulfur and pain.

526
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:34,060
Damn, dude I want to go to Dark Best Buy.

527
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,700
I want to see all the shit they have on display.

528
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Yeah we have dark DVDs.

529
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,700
Yeah!

530
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,980
We have a couple of dark games too.

531
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:45,460
We only sell Dark Souls.

532
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,020
And Bloodborne.

533
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,420
Bloodborne and MediEvil.

534
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,420
For PS1.

535
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:57,260
We're the only Best Buy that still sells MediEvil for PS1.

536
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:01,980
And all the discs are made of human skin.

537
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,980
They're made of-

538
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:07,100
And they have that PS2 controller that's like got shaped like flesh.

539
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:13,180
Yeah, and it has a sword on the end.

540
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:17,820
There was a specific one like, I saw it at Best Buy once.

541
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:19,780
God, what was it?

542
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
Is it the-

543
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,380
Oh, here it is.

544
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:26,740
It's the uh, Philips Freaks Pad Fleshy for PS2.

545
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,740
That sounds like a sex toy.

546
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:33,780
I know dude, look at this fucking thing.

547
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:34,780
Philips Freaks.

548
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:35,780
Philips Freak Pad.

549
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:36,780
Oh my god.

550
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,780
That's disgusting.

551
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:42,900
Yeah dude, that thing's fucking insane.

552
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,900
That's horrible.

553
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:48,980
Why would you want to play a game with like a guy's head?

554
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:56,220
That's like that's like the Necronomicon in like Evil Dead where it's bound to the flesh, but that's the gaming version of it, dude

555
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,220
That's the millennial update

556
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,040
That's the millennial update for or the zoomer update for Evil Dead

557
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:08,300
You have to uh instead of like whatever like you do to it would you just read the Necronomicon?

558
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,700
Yeah, you play the game if you play the game you do that you enter the Konami code. Yeah

559
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:15,580
Summons demons yeah

560
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,180
God damn dude, that thing is so fucking crazy.

561
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,300
Yeah, I want one of those to be honest.

562
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:25,540
I want one just to hold it.

563
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,260
Yeah, just to hold it, just to feel what it feels like.

564
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,820
Yeah, because you know that thing's just terrible.

565
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:36,700
And you know what they made the joysticks out of.

566
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,780
They made the joystick out of nipples.

567
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,540
The joystick covering is nipples.

568
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,820
Absolutely.

569
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,420
So let's look at this guy's profile that we have.

570
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,340
This is from the Discord.

571
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,300
Hooch sent it.

572
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:56,060
Thank you, Hooch, from the Discord.

573
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,020
- Thank you, Hooch.

574
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,180
- Thanks, Hooch.

575
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:01,740
This is a, this is a top 10,

576
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,860
the top 10's username to Mewtwo_.

577
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,340
And it seems like kind of like this person is,

578
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:09,500
role-playing as Mewtwo,

579
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,460
but also there seems to be some like,

580
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,340
- Some dark experience.

581
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:17,380
some differences like like there's for example

582
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:21,860
one of the lists this person made his top ten issues with having psychic powers

583
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,300
it's like oh yeah that's me too

584
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,780
but then also one of them is best ways to avoid social media

585
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:31,580
which doesn't seem to have a good as much as much me too but uh...

586
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,760
yeah i was a dead giveaway right here top ten reasons why it's better to have

587
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,540
three st fingers instead of five

588
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:42,700
yet did meet his three fingers so cool i wanna hands like that

589
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,980
i think any any creature with the hand like that is is is a god i think has

590
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,240
some kind of god like power as aliens definitely have that

591
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:52,960
that's true

592
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,440
i want to read this person's um... you choose about section on the top of the

planning

598
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,520
hiding

599
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,680
things i hate

600
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,720
pokey balls

601
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,520

and they believe you hates me you

604
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,840
yet as much as a clone of new

605
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,560
or does need to have you

606
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,120
i don't know i don't think they hate each other

607
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,880
was that

608
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,400
the

609
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,180
i opened up uh...

610
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:39,000
i opened up you choose you to channel

611
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,560
what was it

612
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:45,100
is uh... he makes a lot of uh... source filmmaker stuff

613
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,820
on nice that is what you know this is

614
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:52,020
this is uh... mario versus real mario

615
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:57,520
that's loud you can with definitely on review to was real me too would use

616
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,060
inside the cap what are you doing stuff i'm watching i'm watching some mario

617
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:06,000
versus real mario if you choose real and real life you would use a psychic powers

618
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,500
to manipulate people as if they were source filmmaker

619
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,900
you would make them make those faces

620
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,180
they would make them say putis putis putis putis

621
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:18,660
you'd say grabbin pills

622
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,900
pills here, pills here, got pills here, grabbin pills

623
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,000
uh...

624
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,980
all right so let's look at best ways to avoid social media, yeah i am curious about

625
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,300
if this is going to be

626
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:33,580
mewtwo themed, yeah i want to know what mewtwo thinks, all right so the description of this

627
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:40,580
list is, social media seems to have the power to persuade things.

628
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,840
This does seem, the first one seems kind of Mewtwo adjacent.

629
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Yeah, if I remember correctly about Mewtwo, he lived in a, oh sorry.

630
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,160
Number one is go live in a cave with no power. And the comment is only for Mewtwo and it

631
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:05,160
says it is very relevant for me. And if I remember correctly, Mewtwo lived in a castle

632
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:09,600
where he invited all of the Pokemon trainers to.

633
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Oh my god, I forgot about that. That was so cool. And he made the combination ones?

634
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:21,600
Uh huh. Yeah, he did that. I don't remember him living in a cave.

635
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,680
I think he runs away from the lab and then goes to a cave.

636
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:32,440
Oh wait, I think he goes to a cave in Detective Pikachu.

637
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
Does he?

638
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,160
So maybe they're going off of Detective Pikachu rules here.

639
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,000
In Detective Pikachu he, I don't even remember.

640
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,080
I was so high when I watched that movie.

641
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,840
I watched that on a plane.

642
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,560
I watched that on the plane going to LA.

643
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:49,440
I watched that on a bunch of edibles in the theater and on the scene where the mountain

644
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,760
started moving I got really scared.

645
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,360
Damn, I would never get scared by Mewtwo's power.

646
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,360
That wasn't Mewtwo, that was Torterra.

647
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
But nice try.

648
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
Nice try, pal.

649
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,360
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right.

650
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Yeah, nice try, pal.

651
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
Torterra.

652
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Um, yeah, well, they gave you Torterra's dark experience.

653
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,660
Yeah, that is, that was kind of my basis for creating the dark system, was the experience

654
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,400
of getting scared in a movie theater.

655
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,040
I don't think I've ever gone to a movie theater without being scared.

656
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,960
I think something scares me every time I'm in there.

657
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,000
It's probably because of all the shootings.

658
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,360
Well yeah, that is mostly what I'm thinking of.

659
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:35,000
But then also sometimes there's something scary in a movie, you know?

660
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,800
Yeah, sometimes there's like a clown.

661
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Yeah, like I was watching Birds of Prey, Harley Quinn's Adventures, and they've got a hyena

662
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
in that movie.

663
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,600
And tell me that isn't freaking scary.

664
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
What?!

665
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,520
That was the last movie I saw in a theater.

666
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Probably all ever seen in a theater.

667
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,800
Yeah, that's the last movie a lot of people saw in a theater, huh?

668
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,800
Yeah.

669
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,800
Wasn't, uh, wasn't very good.

670
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,800
You know what?

671
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:06,520
The only, the only, um, saving grace, I guess, of COVID is probably, uh, that they're gonna

672
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:12,360
make movie theater seats, uh, a bit more spaced out.

673
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,360
Yeah.

674
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:18,600
That, that is a big, uh, and I know if Caleb was here, he'd be like, "Oh, because you're

675
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,040
so fat, blah, blah, blah."

676
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:22,080
Yeah, but I won't do that to you.

677
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,680
I won't say that about you.

678
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,520
No, I'm just, but uh, it's uh...

679
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,840
No, it's cause you smell bad.

680
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,480
I hate sitting next to people.

681
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,480
It's cause you smell bad.

682
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,600
It's not because I smell bad.

683
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:33,600
No.

684
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,560
Yeah, it is weird to sit right next to people.

685
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:37,560
But you know...

686
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:43,120
I don't want to sit next to a stranger unless it's like at least a couple feet apart.

687
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,440

00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,280
and let people jack off in an outhouse. Yeah, this is the only movie we could get the rights to, actually.

767
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,840
Yeah.

768
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,040
They're just, they're showing just, um, just a public domain, like...

769
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,040
They're showing the kid...

770
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,640
They're showing like every Charlie Chaplin movie.

771
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,640
Yeah.

772
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,160
But the smell-o-vision system is fucked up so it's still giving the smell of cock and

773
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,160
ball torture.

774
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Alright, number two.

775
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:05,120
I want to look at the other mutual lists.

776
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,120
This list is boring.

777
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,300
How is this one boring?

778
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,300
Top ten.

779
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,300
Okay, listen.

780
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,300
This one's great.

781
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
Top ten issues with having psychic powers.

782
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Okay?

783
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,300
Okay.

784
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:21,300
someone's mind and he has thing about porn.

785
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,840
The only comment is from Mewtwo and says

786
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:30,260
"A image can't get out of my mind."

787
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:33,540
Damn, that's true though. That's why Mewtwo is so dark and brooding.

788
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:37,700
The description for this list is "The powers can be used for slot of task,

789
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,180
but sometimes can mess with your normal day life."

790
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,460
(laughs)

791
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,180
You might destroy/kill something with your mind.

792
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:50,660
It's even worse if there are humans or cops around you.

793
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,740
Mewtwo doesn't want to kill cops.

794
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:56,060
Mewtwo did not say no cops at pride.

795
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,020
Yeah, Mewtwo said cops rights.

796
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,060
Mewtwo said more cops at pride.

797
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,380
Yeah, Mewtwo said only cops at pride.

798
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:09,660
Number three, you might think something out loud

799
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,500
and everyone can hear it.

800
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,780
i don't think you have to be psychic to do that. Yeah, you don't have to be psychic to do that at all.

801
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,100
Patrick does that all the time.

802
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:18,980
That's true.

803
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:24,100
Yeah, Patrick is standing in 7-Eleven and he's thinking, he's just saying

804
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:28,180
ketchup mustard ketchup mustard ketchup mustard.

805
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,420
Little bit of relish.

806
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:36,180
Ketchup mustard. No, you're just doing that walking around town.

807
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:43,180
ketchup mustard ketchup every step

808
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:47,860
uh... number twelve you may use telekinesis accidentally killing someone

809
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:48,980
or yourself

810
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,900
can you imagine accidentally killing yourself with telekinesis

811
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,140
that would be sick are you kidding me

812
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,600
all i'm saying is that would be a big waste of telekinesis

813
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:03,800
yeah that would be what i mean you could telekinetically transfer your telekinesis

814
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,380
to your kid or something

815
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,380
You can't do that. That's against the law. That's against the rules of telekinesis.

816
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:11,380
You can do that if you're omega level.

817
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,380
Nobody's reached that level yet.

818
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,380
I have.

819
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:18,380
Top 10 reasons why sleeping in a test tube is a good idea.

820
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:24,380
Number one, you can't get diseases while you're sleeping, unless it's a very dirty test tube.

821
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:28,380
That's true, dude. I want to get into it. I want to sleep in a test tube. Get down.

822
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:33,380
Number two, bugs can't infect you. They won't even be able to get in.

823
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:38,300
Dude, yeah, this is making sleeping in a test tube sound pretty good.

824
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:41,140
Oh my god, dude, I want to sleep in a test tube right now.

825
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:45,140
Yeah, dude, give me just a pillow and I'm good to sleep in a test tube.

826
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:49,020
Number three, it will give you good nutrition.

827
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:54,500
Most test tubes can do this big all.

828
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,220
Number four, it's more comforting.

829
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,900
Feels like sleeping on a cloud.

830
00:43:58,900 --> 00:44:01,340
Hope test tube be a good idea.

831
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:06,560
worth it if it wasn't a good idea.

832
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,120
From Boris Rule.

833
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:13,960
You can't hear anything while in it, like noises that wake you up at night or just plain obnoxious

834
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,960
things.

835
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,600
Yeah, like my mom telling me to do my homework.

836
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:21,000
Yeah, like my mom telling me, "Where'd you get this gigantic test tube?

837
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:24,600
Can you please take it out of our house?"

838
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:30,800
God, you threw away my couch to put a test tube to sleep in in the living room?

839
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,840
You cleared out the entire living room to put in a giant test tube

840
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,860
Number six you can take a bath in it

841
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:44,900
Good for being lazy imagine if you could take a bath in your bed. Oh my god a waterbed

842
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,060
That's why people like the waterbed so much

843
00:44:47,060 --> 00:44:49,580
Yeah, it's good. You can go into the bed to take a bath

844
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:55,000
You pop a hole in that thing in the morning you wake up in the bath. Yeah

845
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,680
Imagine yeah, you have a valve on the top and you can climb inside and take a bath and then climb out and close the

846
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,680
valve and go to sleep

847
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:06,240
Just the water inside the water bed is getting browner and browner

848
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,640
more

849
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:14,760
Taking a bath every day inside your bed. The best part is you don't need to change the water it purifies itself

850
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,680
Yeah sleep

851
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:18,320
exactly

852
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:23,560
He's coming for you. Look at it. Oh, man, the cats trying to get me through the camera. Yeah

00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:32,640
He looks like me too, dude. No, he doesn't he looks like me. Oh, yeah, he does. He looks more like me

855
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,080
He looks like a muse cousin

856
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,360
Number seven it looks way cooler

857
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:41,080
It does indeed. Yeah, it does indeed

858
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:49,400
That's the top comment here. Well, it does it does look pretty cool. I have to say. Oh, yeah, dude the fucking the back to tank from

859
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,320
Star Wars episode 5 where he's like in that giant diaper

860
00:45:53,320 --> 00:46:00,400
You know sleeping a big ass diaper no who's in it Luke Luke is in the tube and

861
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,440
Then he swims up. I don't remember that you don't remember that. Oh, dude. I've always wanted to I

862
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,340
Was one of those movies that I think tube I was wanted it when I saw that as a kid

863
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:16,180
I was like why don't I just sleep in a big tube like that? Yeah, I'd be so cool

864
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,440
But then I realized it wouldn't be filled with Bacta because we don't have Bacta.

865
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,840
No, we do.

866
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,160
We just have been hiding it from you.

867
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:28,380
What if Bacta is just like the galactic basic word for like water though?

868
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,380
It could be.

869
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:30,380
Yeah.

870
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:31,380
Um.

871
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:37,440
Yeah, if they just had Luke in a giant diaper and a mask on.

872
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,440
And they were like poking him with like needles and shit.

873
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:43,440
Yeah.

874
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:49,480
I mean, every person who is in a test tube somehow has powers.

875
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,480
That's true.

876
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,720
Okay, let's- Every person in a test tube.

877
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:54,720
Sephiroth?

878
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:55,720
Sephiroth.

879
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:58,240
The shape of water fish.

880
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,920
That guy's powers to be a fish.

881
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:00,920
Yeah.

882
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,360
He has the power to gut Michael Shannon.

883
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:05,360
Yeah.

884
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:12,480
Milla Jovovich is in a test tube in Resident Evil 2 in the movie.

885
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
Luke Skywalker, we already said that.

886
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:16,480
Starship Troopers?

887
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,480
Darth Vader goes into a test tube.

888
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,480
Yeah.

889
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,480
Sometimes.

890
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,480
Mewtwo goes into a test tube.

891
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,480
Yeah.

892
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,480
I think Darth Vader is kind of like Mewtwo and Mew is kind of like Luke Skywalker.

893
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,480
I think that's what they based it on.

894
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,480
I think that's what they based Star Wars on.

895
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,480
I think they based a lot of Greek myths on that too.

896
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:36,480
Yeah.

897
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:41,240
Yeah and they based um, that's where they got all the uh, that's where they got all the racial

898
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,380
caricatures in, in.

899
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,600
Yeah that's where they got Wada.

900
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:47,240
In Star Wars, yeah they got him from Mr. Mime.

901
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:48,240
Yeah.

902
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,240
*laughs*

903
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,240
Yeah.

904
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:54,120
No, that's, that's the French character, Mr. Mime.

905
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:55,200
Yeah.

906
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,480
That's where they got all their French uh, are there any French, like fake French people

907
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
in Star Wars?

908
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:04,640
Cause they have pretty much, like I guess the Irish are like the, the Wookies.

909
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:05,640
Yeah.

910
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:13,140
And the Iwa, now the Wookies are Scottish.

911
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:19,940
And then obviously the Gunray.

912
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,940
I don't know what the Gunray is.

913
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:21,940
I'm not going to get into that.

914
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,400
They're the Japanese stereotype from Phantom Menace.

915
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,520
So they just based those on Pokemon in general.

916
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:36,080
What other... because they only did because they had Jar Jar Binks was pretty...

917
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:40,480
What was he, like a mammy?

918
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,480
What's that stereotype?

919
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:42,480
Dude, wait.

920
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,600
Oh my god, wait.

921
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:47,080
Jar Jar Binks?

922
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,080
Jinx?

923
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,080
Whoa!

924
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,960
Think about it.

925
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,200
My theory is they based the Star Wars racist things on the Pokemon racist things.

926
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,800
There's a Pokemon that's just a big nose and I was like, oh...

927
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,160
grow up and then it evolves into a new

928
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,840
he even more expensive booking big no

929
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:09,400
yeah i think i think i would like a lot of things under it and they don't look

930
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,960
like ralph remarks yeah man

931
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:14,840
did they're the best

932
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:15,640
uh...

933
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:18,760
number eight on this list i want to get to this because it that last one's

934
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:19,760
really good

935
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,740
uh... number eight on this list as you can use it as your coffin if you die that

936
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:24,900
is

937
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,580
it's true

938
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:29,840
sounds like you can't you do but yeah

939
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:32,360
being born in a tube and dying in a tube

940
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,560
born in the tube, dying in the tube baby

941
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,940
that's my next tattoo, i'm gonna get that on my forehead

942
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:40,520
get it across your back

943
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,320
i'm gonna get it on my lower back like a tramp stamp

944
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,320
in varsity letters

945
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,280
imagine getting like a

946
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:53,960
a font tattooed on you

947
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,600
just every, like the alphabet in a font

948
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:00,160
the quick for just like that yet the quick brown fox yet jumped over the

949
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,780
lazy dog

950
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:07,060
dissident and in your favorite font

951
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:10,380
a car and a coffin is kinda like a dark a bit

952
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,520
you think about it

953
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,140
that's true

954
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,080
of shit yet

955
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:18,240
that's another that's another dark appliance yeah

956
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,200
a bit is an appliance

957
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:21,840
it's been a point it's

958
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,800
because it's like a sleep

959
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,800
It's like a sleep number coffin.

960
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:26,880
Yeah.

961
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,680
A Tempur-Pedic coffin.

962
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,960
That'd be tight.

963
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:31,960
Yeah.

964
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,840
Oh no, did my chair just squeak on mic?

965
00:50:34,840 --> 00:50:35,840
I think so.

966
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,440
You trying to get it to squeak again to prove it wasn't a fart?

967
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,440
Yep.

968
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:48,040
Number 9, it can give you oxygen.

969
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,440
That's if you can't breath well.

970
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,040
Yeah, I can't breathe well so I'm going to go into this sealed tube and I'll be able to

971
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:57,540
breathe better.

972
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,080
That'll solve all my breathing problems.

973
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:04,720
Yeah, I'm actually in this test tube because I can't breathe.

974
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:07,680
It's basically just a test tube is just one big inhaler.

975
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,440
Yeah, pretty much.

976
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,520
A dark inhaler, okay.

977
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,520
But it's a...

978
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,520
Oh, okay.

979
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,880
Press down the button, it shoots out a cloud of bats.

980
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,800
(laughing)

981
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,800
- You just inhale a bat?

982
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,780
- Like you know when bats fly,

983
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:27,200
a bunch of bats fly out of a cave really gothically?

984
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:28,040
- Yeah.

985
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,840
- Yeah, it's like that, but out of the inhaler.

986
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,020
- Very gothically.

987
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:33,280
- And it's called an impaler, like vlash.

988
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,520
- Oh, 'cause it impales you with a bat.

989
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,720
- It impales you with a bat,

990
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,560
like a bat out of hell, meatloaf.

991
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,140
- Yep.

992
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:41,920
- Yeah, meatloaf is-- - Impales you.

993
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:46,360
Meatloaf is the store, is the sales associate in Dark Best Buy.

994
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,000
And he's always singing.

995
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,760
He's always doing his theater kid songs.

996
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,400
"Oh, woman!"

997
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:58,360
He's also, he's also, he's dressed as his character from Fight Club.

998
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:02,040
Yeah, he's dressed up like Robert Paulson.

999
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:05,880
Which I feel like that would be the guy that works at Dark Best Buy.

1000
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,560
That would be the guy that's like, "I want to work at Dark Best Buy."

1001
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:13,760
He's just a guy who's wearing slacks.

1002
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,720
He looks exactly like Meatloaf.

1003
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,120
Oh, it's a TV but it has ancient jail bars over the screen?

1004
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:26,880
Dude, sign me up, I want to sell that!

1005
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:34,440
Yeah so this is like, this is like, just kind of something, we bottled most of this stuff

1006
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:41,440
after the curse of the black pearl

1007
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,440
it's a blender but at the bottom of it the blades are like flails like on a chain

1008
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:49,720
yeah

1009
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:54,880
dude I'm going to be thinking of dark best buy for probably at least a week

1010
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,720
yeah dude like a food processor

1011
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,020
a food processor but it's got like uh...

1012
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:05,140
it's just a guillotine that moves really fast.

1013
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,180
yeah uh... but number ten on uh...

1014
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,660
on why sleeping in a test tube is a good idea

1015
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,220
is you can use it to produce babies

1016
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:18,820
the comment on yours says a good place for a babies to be born in

1017
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:19,620

Yeah.

1052
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:57,340
They made a lowland Mewtwo and all they did was put a lei around his neck.

1053
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,780
That's cool.

1054
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,260
That would be, that would actually be cool.

1055
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:03,500
Yeah, with a little, with a hula skirt on.

1056
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:08,140
Yeah, Mewtwo in a hula skirt and he's got a lei on.

1057
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:13,620
And he's got coconuts on his boobs cause he's got real big boobs.

1058
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,940
Yeah, he does dude.

1059
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:18,260
He, um, he's got that rack.

1060
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:23,580
I hope they make a Jamaican region because I want to see the forms they come up with for

1061
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:24,580
that one.

1062
00:55:24,580 --> 00:55:30,740
Yeah, they already made, I mean, there's not really anywhere else for them to go.

1063
00:55:30,740 --> 00:55:31,740
You know?

1064
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:33,540
They've done everything else.

1065
00:55:33,540 --> 00:55:36,680
Yeah, pretty much.

1066
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:43,700
I mean there's some of them that I feel like, like maybe Australian.

1067
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,140
Maybe they could do an Australian Pokemon.

1068
00:55:46,140 --> 00:55:47,300
Yeah.

1069
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,820
I think they should, I'm holding out for Jamaica.

1070
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,820
Alright I want an Oddish with a weed leaf on its head.

1071
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,540
- Yeah.

1072
00:55:57,540 --> 00:56:00,940
- That's what I'm talking, I want rated R weed version.

1073
00:56:00,940 --> 00:56:02,800
- Who?

1074
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,820
- Rated R weed version of Pokemon, okay?

1075
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,020
- Oh, I thought you were saying

1076
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:09,300
there was a Pokemon named Radar.

1077
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,060
- No, that's a, you're thinking of a system

1078
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,380
for locating things nearby.

1079
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:15,780
Is what you're thinking of.

1080
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:18,740
I'm thinking of Big Bird's teddy bear.

1081
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,060
Big Bird's teddy bear is named Radar?

1082
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,060
I think so.

1083
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:23,940
That's a really lame name for a teddy bear.

1084
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:25,820
Yeah, hold on.

1085
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,580
Sounds like Big Bird's kind of more like Big Nerd to me.

1086
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:32,420
If he's going to name it after a freaking Radar.

1087
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,420
Hey!

1088
00:56:33,420 --> 00:56:34,420
Okay.

1089
00:56:34,420 --> 00:56:35,420
Ayo!

1090
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:36,420
Whoa!

1091
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:37,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1092
00:56:37,420 --> 00:56:38,420
Yeah, what?

1093
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:40,140
It's named Radar?

1094
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:42,340
His name is Radar.

Earthquake Machine

1099
00:56:51,140 --> 00:57:00,420
The comment for Earthquake Machine is "It will shack the earth to nothing."

1100
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,420
Water Machine

1101
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:09,380
The top comment on the Water Machine is "This list is pretty cool.

1102
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:14,340
We can kill Bieber.

1103
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:15,340
Sar Bomba.

1104
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:18,620
What is Sar Bomba?

1105
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:20,620
Sar Bomba is a giant bomb.

1106
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:23,780
It's like a mother of all bomb type thing I think.

1107
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:24,780
Oh ok.

1108
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:27,780
I thought it was just a thing.

1109
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,180
Ok.

1111

Planet Buster.

1112
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:32,740
Number 12, Planet Buster.

1113
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:34,820
I mean it says it in the name.

1114
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,140
It'll destroy the planet like Thanos snapping his finger.

1115
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,700
That's a comment from Pickle Man.

1116
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,700
Pickle Man.

1117
00:57:41,700 --> 00:57:47,100
I'm just looking through all these other lists, I'm seeing if there's anything else good.

1118
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:51,340
I don't think an Ion Cannon would destroy the world, I think it would just set off an

1119
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,460
EMP blast.

1120
00:57:53,460 --> 00:57:56,640
Top 10 reasons why it's better to have 3 fingers instead of 5.

1121
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,880
The other 2 fingers are useless to have.

1122
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,420
Your appearance looks better.

1123
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,000
It's much better to eat with.

1124
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,420
The other 2 fingers won't get in your way when working.

1125
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,580
It makes it easier to grip your opponents.

1126
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:13,580
you'll be better at playing guitar, it makes typing more challenging.

1127
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:19,500
The comment on "you'll be better at playing guitar" just says, "Most humans who do guitar

1128
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:25,640
don't use their five fingers."

1129
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:29,540
Number nine is, "You can use your three finger issue as an excuse.

1130
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:33,260
You can say you don't have to learn how to type because you only have three fingers.

1131
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:38,860
example of what abilities you don't have to learn.

1132
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,780
Yeah I want three fingers to be lazy.

1133
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:46,220
I want three fingers so I don't have to go to computer class anymore.

1134
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:50,660
Number ten is you don't have to worry about cutting off the other two fingers.

1135
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:56,140
But imagine cutting off like your thumb when you only have like three Mewtwo fingers and

1136
00:58:56,140 --> 00:59:03,220
then you only have two Mewtwos on your hand.

1137
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:14,260
to mute you oh boy I'm fucking my back hurts I'm hungover yeah it's time to

1138
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:18,500
it's time for me to you're gonna need a bunch of tums you're a bunch of tums

1139
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:26,860

1140
00:59:26,860 --> 00:59:33,860
hour

1141
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:39,140
it up join the discord we play tf2 sometimes we've done it once I guess we

1142
00:59:39,140 --> 00:59:42,260
did it one time and I don't know if we're ever gonna do it again maybe we'll

1143
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:45,660
stream or something I don't know yet to figure that out yeah we should probably

1144
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:50,320
just stream probably stream in the discord that's probably send us lists to

1145
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:54,500
do because we're lazy we don't like finding our own lists yeah we're

1146
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:59,580
outsourcing it to you and you pay us yeah that's called the money maker

1147
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:00,900
