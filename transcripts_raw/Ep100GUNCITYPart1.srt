The year is 2300

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Long ago, humanity abandoned Earth

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,500
And all the disgusting poor people on it

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,500
In favor of a new home, Planet Eba

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,000
While there is no life on the planet

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,400
There are enough GI Joe PSAs and remixes of "Papa Smurf Cannot Lick Yo Ass"

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,000
to feed humanity for at least another half century.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The largest city on planet hum-

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,500
um, GUN city,

16
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,000
is run by a puppet government

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
installed by the Stakehams Federation of Bodies and Spaces.

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
Humans have finally learned to worship their corporate overlords

19
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:51,000
and have fully embraced the oppression and technological comforts that come with it.

20
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,500
And guess what?

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,500
Living like that?

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,500
Huh.

23
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,500
That's only if you're lucky.

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,880
Because if you have to live in the slums of Gun City, where the neon green turns to a crimson red,

25
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:05,680
you either rule the streets through fear, like the mad suckler, or you shoot up enough

26
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,520
Papi-chukos techno slime to numb the pain, like our friend Chatterbox over here.

27
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,400
And what's controlling all this?

28
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:21,540
How does the Stakem's Federation of Bodies and Spaces keep this shit in line? Through the world's biggest computer.

29
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:30,460
No one can escape the computer. It controls everything, doling out just enough slop to keep these piggies hungry, keep them dependent.

30
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:39,460
It constantly plays overrated synthwave records from 2013 that echo throughout the city, allowing only a single vibe to exist.

31
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:46,460
It controls the traffic lights, the bitheads, the delta jocks, the panzer freaks, the techno scum, the street samurai, and the netrunners.

32
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:51,460
It knows everything about everyone, where you last jacked in and when you last jacked off.

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:59,700
off. There's no escape, not even if you're a jazzed up psycho kurumaku. But today is

34
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:06,620
going to be different. Today Ashton Futures, CEO of Top Ten's Mindfulness Corporation,

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:10,220
has assembled an elite team of professional mercenary operatives to

36
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,900
carry out Operation Solution Dark Brain, a highly classified mission that will

37
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:20,260
change Planet Ebound forever. The team is assembled now on a laser helicopter

38
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:26,380
flying over gun city gentlemen introduce yourselves

39
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:31,260
oh my god, patches you should just do that voice all the time

40
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,820
that should be your speaking voice

41
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,340
oh you're fucking with that normal voice

42
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,180
come on dude that's sick

43
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,900
yeah there you go you know how it is

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,500
so yeah everyone introduce your characters

45
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
who are you guys

46
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Um...

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Uh, well I, um...

48
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
I am Blotoss Piss,

49
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
a ruthless Grinch hunter from Whoville.

50
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Growing up as a Who,

51
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
I was a bit of a Christmas freak,

52
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,500
so when the Grinch stole my favorite holiday out from under my dog-type nose,

53
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,500
I formed a serious tool-style grudge.

54
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,500
I placed a personal bounty of a thousand presents on the Grinch's head

55
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,500
and emigrated to Planet E-Bomb

56
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,500
to carry out my jolly task.

57
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,500
I'm highly trained in gun-cada,

58
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
cyber-foo,

59
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,500
and mental karate,

60
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,580
karate and I'm prepared to fight, kill, and fuck any fuzzy green gremlin that tries to

61
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:20,500
get up in my business and jack my joy. I'm fully decked out in red and green holiday camo

62
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,040
fatigues with a green wireframe cyber metal for most cuttingly sarcastic Deadpool quips

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,240
to the camera. I wield a fearsome Chris Kyle style Grinch gun with tactical scoundrel scanner

64
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:35,440
scope to pick off pesky Grinches from long range as well as dual lead pipes to beat the

65
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,580
stocking stuffing out of any creepy creature that crosses me. My strength, agility, and

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:46,820
mercilessness, mercilessness, my strength, agility, and mercilessness in combat are

67
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:50,660
matched only by my lack of physical beauty, deep autism, and intense

68
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,020
unpleasantness to be around. And I also have a pet monkey named Patrick."

69
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,500
Whoa. That's awesome.

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Alright.

71
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,020
Yeah, so you're sort of standing in the helicopter with your arms crossed.

72
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:08,340
Yeah, you're, you know, leaning against the helicopter wall, just sort of, uh, ready to make a quip.

73
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,220
And I look at the camera and I say, "I love helicopters, so to me this is more like a

74
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,220
heavinecopter."

75
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,300
And I say that to the camera.

76
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:18,740
Can we get a pun roll on that?

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:19,740
Yeah.

78
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
Absolutely.

79
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,860
What's a...

80
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,860
It succeeds.

81
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,860
Oh, okay, an actual roll.

82
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:24,860
Hold on, let me see.

83
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,860
Yeah, we need to roll that.

84
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,860
We need to see if he successfully made this roleplay.

85
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:31,700
I'm gonna have you roll that with advantage, 'cause that was an awesome pun.

86
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,300
Thanks.

87
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,300
What stat is that?

88
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,580
So, what that'll be...

89
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,140
roll two d20s and take the highest number all right that's a really good pun then

90
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:47,600
that's really good. That was the entire helicopter the entire heaven-icopter actually

91
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,300
everything is really insane. Yeah now we have to call it a heaven-icopter. Yeah I'll just know I mean you

92
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:00,300
know it just took me four hours so I'll just change this. Just spell helicopter. I'll just change this.

93
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,300
Okay, who's who's next? So

94
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:13,020
Well, oh I am a computer who spent most of his life as a prop on popular NBCIA

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,500
sitcom electronic the office

96
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,180
After spending years in Hollyweird

97
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:24,140
I decided I needed a change of scenery and quit acting forever to become a corporate operative

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:28,540
But first I needed a body to hold money and breasts

99
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:35,240
I had my old friend John Krasinski bring me a demon from the police station he now works at,

100
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,240
where the demon was chief of police.

101
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,540
John shoved me in his back and I hacked his body.

102
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:46,540
In return, I gave John a plastic sheriff's toy gun and star that I got at the dollar store,

103
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,540
and I told him there was an Afghani family trying to enjoy a dinner down the street,

104
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,540
so he left to go kill them.

105
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:57,540
With my new body, I needed new things, like a name.

106
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:04,780
Luckily, I am a computer, so I wrote a program that analyzed all of the world's names and

107
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,160
constructed the most normal name imaginable.

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,100
So I will always fit in and blend in.

109
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:16,140
My new name is Ray William Johnson, but you can call me Ray.

110
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,140
Okay, amazing.

111
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:25,340
So, Ari, how is the demon sort of enjoying the heaven copter?

112
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,340
What are you doing, Ray?

113
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,340
The demon is smoking a cigarette.

114
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,340
Amazing. Okay, cool. No one's yelling at you about it either.

115
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,340
No. No, it's normal.

116
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,340
Okay. So now, who's the last member of this...

117
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:46,340
I am Patrick Yoda.

118
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:50,340
I was born to two bitcorn biners on the planet Fukasukabob.

119
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:55,340
My parents were two yodas and they had normal missionary sex to create me.

120
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:01,100
Nothing weird happened when they had sex either, it was very normal by Yoda standards.

121
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,780
They didn't even suck each other off, it was purely for procreation.

122
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,980
I grew up hoverboarding on the streets of Succafuckabaw reading my neighbors minds and using my cunning

123
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,340
to make them get me hoagies and hotdogs.

124
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,860
I joined the top 10 mindfulness corp after they tricked me into signing up, saying I

125
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,180
would get free hoverboard parts and Humpty Dumpty all dress chips.

126
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,580
I provide valuable resources to the team as I am the last person in the galaxy who remembers

127
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,660
how to make a smoothie.

128
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,660
Okay.

129
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,660
Whoa.

130
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,660
Nice.

131
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:38,300
So you're probably just sort of hovering.

132
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,300
Mm-hmm.

133
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Just hanging out.

134
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,300
I'm practicing a flip.

135
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,300
Okay.

136
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
On the helicopter?

137
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,300
On the helicopter.

138
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,300
I'm practicing a flip.

139
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,300
That's dangerous, dude.

140
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,300
You could fall out.

141
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
No, I won't.

142
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,300
You could hit the rotors and get chopped up.

143
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,300
I'm gonna warn him.

144
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,020
No, I won't.

145
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,860
You can hit the road.

146
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,540
I'm gonna warn him.

147
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,100
You'll get chopped up.

148
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,380
Please, you, uh, there is a 60% chance that you fall out of the

149
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,420
Evanicopter.

150
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,260
Don't tell me the odds.

151
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,780
So yeah, that, that goes on actually for about 15 minutes.

152
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:14,260
And then you look up at the, uh, the vidi screen in the, uh, uh,

153
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:22,580
Heaven Copter. Okay. And you see a silhouette of a really cool looking guy from Iowa.

154
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,900
Geez, beautiful.

155
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:32,380
With a sideways hat on. And you would recognize that silhouette anywhere as

156
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:41,220
Ashton Futures, the CEO of Top Ten's Mindfulness Corporation. And so he

157
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,220
addresses you guys.

158
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,220
Um.

159
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,220
Uh, yo, what's up guys?

160
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,940
Uh, it's me Ashton.

161
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,220
It's good to see you guys.

162
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,780
Um, I'm so glad you guys, you know, decided to do this mission.

163
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,940
It's gonna be so frickin' sweet, dude.

164
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:59,700
We're gonna totally punk, totally punk Stake 'Em's, okay?

165
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,780
So what I need you guys to do right now, though, is look in front of you.

166
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,820
And you guys see in front of you a couple of dossiers show up.

167
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:11,500
And I need you to open these up and we'll gotta go point by point what the mission is.

168
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:20,300
So yeah, you guys open up the dossiers and you see another screen and it's Ashton Futures just again.

169
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:27,500
And he says, "Let's just say that a buddy of mine who is not called Cyborg Jerry Seinfeld,

170
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:32,140
who is not dating a 17 year old Jewish Roomba, gave me a hot tip

171
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,500
[Laughter]

172
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,500
about a video that lives inside the world's biggest computer.

173
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Okay? So I'm thinking maybe we do a punt, right?

174
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Okay? So here's what I'm thinking.

175
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,500
Okay. So.

176
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I'm gonna take you guys in this helicopter over here.

177
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,500
We're gonna fly over the HQ

178
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,500
of Stakehams, which as we all know

179
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:01,500
is a massive social media manager.

180
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,500
And we're gonna drop you guys on there, right? Okay?

181
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,500
And we're going to go into the world's biggest computer while it's doing an OS update.

182
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Which that happens only once every 50 years, and it's happening tonight.

183
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
They're updating to Windows Fogel.

184
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,500
So we have to go in there now.

185
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
To have access to the computer.

186
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,500
To finally frickin' delete the Kramer video.

187
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:30,500
It has been a stain on Mr. Seinfeld, I mean, my friends.

188
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,460
legacy for years now and we're going to delete it from the internet and all

189
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:41,700
planet ebomb forever so are you guys in or are you out?

190
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,700
In. I'm in.

191
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,420
Okay this would be a lot harder for me as a DM if what I was open to it if you said

192
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:59,220
out but I'm so glad so. I changed my mind.

193
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:01,220
*laughter*

194
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,220
Ashen Futures just kills himself

195
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
*laughter*

196
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,220
So yeah, he says

197
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:09,220
"Well, it looks like you guys are gonna

198
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,220
need to be jumping out soon, so

199
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,220
I'm gonna sign off

200
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,220
but make sure you get this done

201
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,220
by midnight

202
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,220
or you guys are the ones" and I wrote this

203
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,220
down "who are gonna be punked"

204
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,220
and uh, yeah the vidi screen

205
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,220
shuts off, the dossiers

206
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,220
explode in your hands

207
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,020
Um, and you see a timer show up on the helicopter on the video

208
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:36,700
screen. Now it says, uh, um, like five, five minutes till drop.

209
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:43,380
Um, so you guys are gonna drop in about five into presumably the

210
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:49,900
giant gargantuan social media manager sort of Megazord. Um,

211
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,420
yeah.

212
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,100
I'm ready.

213
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
Okay, let's do it.

214
00:11:55,780 --> 00:12:00,980
So yeah, so time goes by, five minutes go by, you guys get all suited up and everything,

215
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,660
and you jump out.

216
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,580
Can everybody, let's do our first, let's do our first roll of the game though, for real.

217
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:14,900
So everybody, let's roll, roll either athletics or acrobatics, and we're gonna see how successful

218
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
your jumps are.

219
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Which one, which one is it?

220
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,060
So I can, I can choose either acrobatics or athletics?

221
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,060
Yeah, that's usually.

222
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,060
So I rolled a d20.

223
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Mm-hmm.

224
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
I got an 11.

225
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Fuck.

226
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,060
Fuck, I got a 2.

227
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
And my acrobatics is 0.

228
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
Okay.

229
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
And you got an 11. So then you got a straight 11.

230
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,060
What about you, Blotas?

231
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,060
I got a 15 total.

232
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,060
I got a 2 with a +4 athletics modifier.

233
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,060
Okay, so you're at a 6.

234
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
So, in that sense,

235
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:44,060
uh,

236
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:46,060
so yeah, Blotas, you know, you're a

237
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
total badass, you know,

238
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,060
Deadpool kind of, like, roguish cool guy.

239
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,060
So it's very easy for you to just

240
00:12:52,060 --> 00:13:01,580
sort of flip out and start skydiving down. You've locked on your target. Can I do a spin? Yeah, definitely. Can I do a spin while I do it? Yeah, you very easily do a spin. You don't have to roll for that.

241
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:18,300
Patrick Yoda, you know, you're, you're a hoverboarder, you know, this isn't, you know, so you have some experience doing this. So you kind of you jump out, like in, like Sonic the Hedgehog, Adventure 2 battle with your hoverboard ready to go. You don't do anything fancy, though. You're trying to just, you know, it's a pretty far drop.

242
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:21,860
Ray William Johnson, you just start a trip.

243
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,700
And you're just sort of falling.

244
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,740
You're

245
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,140
just like sort of an unpleasant experience.

246
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:49,380
And so yeah, you guys are falling. It's like it's looks pretty badass, the camera spinning around you. And but then what happens is, is the camera spins around once more. And it spins past you guys. And now I need you

247
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:57,860
all to roll a dexterity saving throw but I need our friend Ray William Johnson to roll his with disadvantage.

248
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,660
Oh fuck.

249
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,060
I got a 19.

250
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:02,860
Nice.

251
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,860
I got it with my negative one.

252
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,360
I got a 9.

253
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,460
Okay.

254
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,460
I got a 12.

255
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,760
Okay, cool.

256
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:12,460
So,

257
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,260
so

258
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,960
what happens is

259
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,460
you guys are falling

260
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:30,160
And just as fast as you're falling out of the corner of your eye, um, blow toss, you can see, uh, the Jollibee sky patrol rolling up on you.

261
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,060
Oh no!

262
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:37,360
Um, and, uh, they immediately, no questions asked, start firing.

263
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:46,420
Um, uh, and, uh, I'm going to need, uh, yeah, Caleb, you're going to take, or sorry, Ray William Johnson, you take, you take-

264
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,040
That's right.

265
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,600
You take...

266
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
*laughter*

267
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,800
You take, uh...

268
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Let's see what you take.

269
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
You take one damage, so it's not too bad.

270
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,000
So they shoot at you guys.

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,500
"I take one damage."

272
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
*laughter*

273
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,000
They shoot their, uh...

274
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
I thought I was dead.

275
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,300
No, dude, they shoot their little pellets at you.

276
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,100
Uh, they're doing their best.

277
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,100
They get a surprise attack on you, uh, Ray.

278
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,500
They sort of, like, over, like, a loudspeaker.

279
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,300
They're, like, falling with you guys.

280
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,400
Um, but they're just, like, flying downward, chasing you.

281
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
Uh, they're saying, uh...

282
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:21,700
You're flying into unauthorized areas on behalf of the Stakeholder Corporation.

283
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,700
We will continue to shoot unless you change directions.

284
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Oh, fuck.

285
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,700
Um...

286
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:31,700
Is it- am I- is this- would it be reasonable to try to fight them in the air?

287
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
Or...

288
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Oh, somebody should try and convince them that we're gonna change directions.

289
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Oh, okay.

290
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
Oh, yeah.

291
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,700
That'll be- that'll be me.

292
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:40,700
I'm a very persuasive- I mean, I'm a computer.

293
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,700
Okay, so here's what I do.

294
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,700
I open- I open Internet Explorer.

295
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Okay.

296
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,700
Right?

297
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:50,700
and I open Cleverbot.

298
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,700
I go to cleverbot.com and I ask her what she would do in this situation.

299
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Right? And she says to me,

300
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,700
"I love music."

301
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,700
[laughter]

302
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,740
And I'm like, and so I'm a little fucked.

303
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,220
So I just got to make it up by myself.

304
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:23,020
So I say, I say to the guys, I say, we gum in bees.

305
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,020
Let's see if that works.

306
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Yeah.

307
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:28,020
Roll a d20 and add your persuasion.

308
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
15.

309
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,020
Damn.

310
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,020
Okay.

311
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Yeah.

312
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
That's pretty good.

313
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,940
It's a pretty good roll, but it's not enough for these guys.

314
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:36,940
They're pretty hellbound.

315
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,940
Are you kidding me?

316
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
So, uh...

317
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
They say "BULLSHIT!"

318
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,940
And, uh, yeah.

319
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Everybody has to roll for initiative.

320
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,940
I guess it would be kinda hard to believe that

321
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
coming from a demon.

322
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,940
That was kinda the part of the difficulty of that roll.

323
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,940
Demon falling from the air.

324
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
I was thinking about it, and I was like,

325
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,940
"I think 'cause he's a demon."

326
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,940
You might be right.

327
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,940
So everyone roll for initiative. We're entering battle.

328
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Alright, I got 13.

329
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,940
Nice. 15.

330
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:10,580
plus four. Okay, let me just make sure I get this down. Yeah, some of this stuff will be

331
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:16,020
like the stuff you cut out, like me keeping track of initiatives, I imagine. I'm cutting

332
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,300
out everything except it. Alright, never mind then, what is the good part? In that case,

333
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:26,900
we're gonna cut out everything you say so that it's just us rolling to nobody.

334
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:33,140
You like leave in someone asking a question but leave out my answer. Yeah, every single time.

335
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:39,140
Leave out all the story and just like, "Um, I ate a cheeseburger at 11."

336
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
It'd be a proper episode then.

337
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:44,940
Okay, let's roll for these, these Jollibees. Let's see how they do.

338
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,940
Alright, cool.

339
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,820
Yeah, so in that case, pretty good. Pretty good, everyone.

340
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,820
Yeah, so there's three of them.

341
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:56,460
You're all sort of falling within, like, within, like, range of each other.

342
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,940
And I'll say that you can probably, like, sky swim, like, at-

343
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:06,340
I'm gonna say like that you guys are like super, you know, you guys are like super badass like mercenaries.

344
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
You can all sky swim at regular speed.

345
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,340
So you're all within range of each other pretty much.

346
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,340
I'm on my...

347
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,340
They come at you and they run on you.

348
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,340
I'm on my belly on my hoverboard.

349
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,340
How many...

350
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,340
And I'm surfing like that.

351
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,340
How many...

352
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Yeah, you're like boogie boarding.

353
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,340
I'm still spinning, first of all.

354
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,340
And second of all, how many are there?

355
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,340
There are three of them.

356
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
Oh, we got those, dude.

357
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,340
Yeah.

358
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,740
So this is when we fight them now?

359
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Yes. Uh, yeah. So the first thing... yeah, dude.

360
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:43,140
I'm absolutely gonna get crap from your nerd fans about how I did that dexterity saving throw. I'll find out later.

361
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,640
Who cares? We have no nerd fans.

362
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,140
Yeah, that's true. You guys only have boys.

363
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
We made sure.

364
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
Yeah, Pat, it's actually your turn first.

365
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Oh, it's my turn. So I have to pick something to do to them.

366
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Yeah, so there's one in the back who, furthest in the back who has a Jollibee special gun.

367
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:09,140
That's what I wrote for that.

368
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
Then there's one closer-

369
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,140
It shoots great.

370
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,140
There's one closer up that has a Chickenjoy Nightstick.

371
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:23,940
stick, and then there's one closer up also who has a bunch of lasers ready to go that

372
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,220
are all branded with Jollibee and Stake 'Em.

373
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,500
Wait, I have an idea.

374
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,140
Can I just do whatever I want now?

375
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,140
No, it's Patrick's turn.

376
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,140
Not my first turn.

377
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,140
I didn't hear that.

378
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:38,140
Yeah.

379
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,140
You should ask me about my idea.

380
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Yeah, what's your idea, Caleb?

381
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:50,140
No, you gotta do your turn. You can't talk to me yet.

382
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
Why?

383
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:59,140
Alright, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hit him with a hoverboard boomerang.

384
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,140
Hell yeah.

385
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,140
Okay, yeah. Which one are you gonna hit?

386
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
Can I take both of them out?

387
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:15,140
You can take, you can, okay, here's what I'll have you do. You can hit one of them and then you'll be able to do some damage to the other one.

388
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:23,140
So if the two of those that are closest together bunched up. So roll a d20 and add your attack bonus there. You see that?

389
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,140
I got 11.

390
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,140
[laughs]

391
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Sorry. Damn, that's plus 8?

392
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
[laughs]

393
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:52,860
Yeah, so yeah, you throw it, you manage to, you miss the first guy in the front, the guy with the chicken joy nightstick, he sort of just deflects it, but it whips around and whacks the other guy, the nerdier one with the lasers in the back of the head. So yeah, now roll for damage. So you see there you got 2d4.

394
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:58,340
So I got in a I got an 11 on the d20. And now I got to roll the d8. Yeah, okay. I got seven.

395
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:04,300
Nice. Okay. Yeah, you, uh, so your hoverboard, uh, boomerang

396
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,820
wha- whips around and just like whacks the shit out of that guy.

397
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:08,420
Alright.

398
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:11,980
Uh, he is not looking too good. You basically like knocked half

399
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:16,100
of his like, head off. He looks fucked up. He's fucked up that

400
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,060
Jollibee. He's like, he's like screaming.

401
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,940
I'm glad, I'm glad he's doing that.

402
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,380
I hope he feels pain.

403
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,780
What is his, what is, does, what is his meat?

404
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,260
Yeah, what's it, does it look like chicken?

405
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:27,060
What does it look like in here?

406
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,060
Yeah, that's a trade secret.

407
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:31,060
So, they call that a cop-out.

408
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,060
That's fair.

409
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,060
Okay, yeah, it is now your turn, Caleb.

410
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:39,060
Okay, so there's two left?

411
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,060
Yeah.

412
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,060
Alright.

413
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,060
I will use my ability...

414
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:49,060
Hacker Mode.

415
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,060
Hell yeah.

416
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,060
To try to hack the one...

417
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,060
One of them seems probably like the leader, right?

418
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
Yeah, the Chickenjoy Nightstick.

419
00:21:56,060 --> 00:22:01,580
Nightstick. Okay, Chickenjoy Nightstick. I attempt to hack him. Okay, so that's 19

420
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:05,980
with my spellcasting modifier. Yeah, he's dumb as shit. He rolled awful. He's a

421
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:11,860
fucking idiot. You hack him very easily. So in my computer voice, I turn

422
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:17,220
around to the other Jollibee and I say, "Maybe he was killing our friend as a

423
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,140
joke and he's actually a pretty nice guy. We should maybe leave him alone."

424
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:38,020
Yeah, so he's he's saying this and he has like a giant alien where like computer tower lodged in his back and is just like saying trying to say this. So for for the folks at home, Caleb's hacker thing.

425
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,860
Ray William Johnson's hacker thing is a computer.

426
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,620
There's an alien where computer lodged into the back of a demon.

427
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:48,940
It unhooks and then hooks inside of another character.

428
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,980
So and his demon just poses the while that's happening.

429
00:22:53,020 --> 00:23:04,420
So there is now a giant hard drive in the back of this Jollibee and he's just trying to talk to his friend and say, maybe it was okay. I'm gonna, I'm gonna have you, I'm gonna have you roll Persuasion with Advantage.

430
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,740
Yes.

431
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,460
Because that's, that's a good idea. They're not very smart.

432
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,420
Oh, perfect 20.

433
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,780
Oh, you got a nat 20?

434
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,740
Not natural, but I plus three for my Persuasion.

435
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:23,260
Okay, cool. Yeah, so the other one responds to you. The other one responds to the other Jollibee, just goes,

436
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:30,760
"Yeah, I guess it was pretty funny when half of his head came off. So, I can kind of see what you're saying, man."

437
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,260
And he turns to Yusuf.

438
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:40,260
"I mean, I don't really want to die, so let's huff it. Let's huff it out of here."

439
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Nice. The Jollibees are from the 40s.

440
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,260
Yeah. They say things like "Let's hop in."

441
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,260
That's why they wear that little hat.

442
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,260
True.

443
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:56,260
Okay, and now I right-click, safely eject the hard drive out of the Jollibee's back.

444
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,260
Yeah, you safely eject your back inside your doomed body.

445
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,260
You guys, so yeah, the two Jollibees kind of go away.

446
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,260
They're dragging their dead friend along with them.

447
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
Out of the sky?

448
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,260
Yeah. Oh yeah, they're flying in the sky.

449
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:13,740
this kind of how far are we dropping? You're dropping so far. We've been dropping for like

450
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:20,940
10 minutes. Um, and, oh, well, it looks cool about the, oh, I shouldn't, I will though.

451
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,340
So the one round of combat in D&D is 6 seconds. So all that happened in just like 6 seconds.

452
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:33,780
So we have so much time left. Damn. Oh, yeah, of dropping. Oh, awesome. Uh, so it's only

453
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:41,880
been like it's been like like 12 ish seconds as you've been falling and

454
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:48,500
however what ended up happening though was that the Jollibee's called in

455
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:55,740
something when they left. Oh no. And out of the corner of your eye actually you know

456
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:00,460
what blow toss roll it roll a perception check. Yeah oh that's a seven. Yeah so you

457
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,000
don't really notice it but uh what happened like you're you're sort of

458
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,860
focused on falling and you're doing a lot of cool stunts so you probably don't

459
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:14,320
notice it but um yeah I'm flipping over doing some DDR shit in there yeah I'm

460
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,720
shooting at my gun everywhere and that catches the attention you know of a

461
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:26,200
flying blue blur that comes out of nowhere and it's it's none other than

462
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:33,200
in

463
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:39,520
They put the blue Grinch in the game, dude.

464
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,680
And he says to you guys, you can kind of make it out as he's like approaching you, like

465
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,560
at Mach speed.

466
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:55,720
He says, "Merry Christmas, sucka fuckas!" and he crashes right into all of you.

467
00:25:55,720 --> 00:26:00,120
I need all of you to roll a Constitution saving throw.

468
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
I got a seven.

469
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Okay.

470
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:10,040
four. Oh my god. I got a 14. Okay, a blow toss and Patrick Yoda both yards

471
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:19,720
immediately and there go all my hot dogs. Yeah, in my mouth. That's all blow toss.

472
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,280
That's all blow toss. Hot dogs. Hot dogs. I just want to put that in. Yeah, they all

473
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:28,120
land in my friggin mouth and I eat them. And then you throw them up

474
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,680
immediately after. I throw them up because they're they're Grinch out dogs. So there's

475
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,760
this sort of exchange of vomit going on as you guys are falling through the sky

476
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:42,480
and you're knocked totally off course. You manage to sort of hold your ground

477
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,680
Ray and you're now so you realize you sort of look in the distance you see

478
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:54,720
that the the main part of gun city and the the giant social media manager are

479
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,560
fading in the distance. No. And you look down and you're starting to, you start to

480
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:07,280
realize that you're falling towards somewhere very different. And so you guys

481
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:13,340
are gonna have to figure out how you're gonna land safely. Deploy, deploy

482
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:21,000
parachute. I haven't, we have not deployed our parachutes yet. That's true. Well I

483
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I have. Because I've been on my hoverboard. Yeah, yeah, you guys roll, roll a, I'm thinking

484
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,120
what this should be. I want this to be a, a, a, I guess this is technically a dexterity

485
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:37,160
saving throw to see how well you roll your parachutes and how well you land. I got a

486
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:46,760
42. My dexterity is zero. I got a six. I got a ten. Okay, so six, a ten, and what did you

487
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:54,440
get? 22. Okay yeah you you expertly pull it out. What do you say the camera as you're

488
00:27:54,440 --> 00:28:00,080
landing perfectly? Look at these parrots shoots over here and I point to my the

489
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:07,440
two other... Ryan Reynolds is fearing for his life hearing these quips.

490
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Yeah you two, Patrick Yoda you do pretty well. What what do you do like a move

491
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:21,120
when you land I do I do a backflip

492
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:29,480
mr. rubbing my fucking face that I got a six I land on the ground I do a backflip

493
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:35,600
immediately and as I'm landing I've also flipped a cigarette and then I land in

494
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,440
the cigarette lands in my mouth okay you got it you're gonna have to roll a

495
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,520
performance check because that's yeah yeah which one is that dude yeah bullshit

496
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:55,120
what's your performance 16 no wait 16 and then do I add the three here yeah so so

497
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:08,000
that's a I was in remedial math just took two and a half full seconds to add

498
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:19,200
three to six I told you okay but with that hey with that 19 who needs math you

499
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:25,600
fucking stick that landing the cigarette falls in your mouth and you see sort of

500
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,720
people around you give you a polite golf clap like oh it's pretty that was pretty

501
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:38,480
cool people around us oh you'll see oh fuck no no yeah if I land yeah how do you

502
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,680
land so you fucked up how do you land just um I fucked up and so the demon

503
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:49,040
that I'm in control of he's sort of like gains consciousness for a minute and he

504
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:53,720
just starts jacking off demons do now I can't get him to focus on the ground and

505
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,600
he's actually jacking off to the thought of him hitting the ground and dying so

506
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:02,040
He's just rapidly just right on his fucking demon dick, which is really small.

507
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,680
It's like proportional to like a, like a gorilla dick.

508
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,600
Like it's like really small for his body.

509
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:10,360
Um, and I'm like, uh, and so I, I try to get him to stop.

510
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,920
I'm like, stop, stop, stop, stop.

511
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,200
Um, and then I, and then what happens is we land his horns first into the ground.

512
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,200
And so I have to wait for somebody to pull me out like a pitchfork.

513
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,480
Uh, yeah, you, you.

514
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,760
I pull him out.

515
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,220
- Do a strength, do a strength.

516
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,060
- I put it back.

517
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:31,800
(laughing)

518
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,880
I put it back immediately.

519
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,920
- Okay, this is gonna be a strength contest.

520
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,320
So both of you guys roll strength to see

521
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,840
if you're able to either pull them out or push them back in.

522
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,680
- All right.

523
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,800
I got a 10, minus one.

524
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,480
- Okay.

525
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,320
- And what's that?

526
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,140
- I got a nine.

527
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,980
- There it is.

528
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,280
- So Patrick, you're like jumping up,

529
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,400
you're like real little,

530
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,200
you're like trying to like stomp on his feet

531
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,480
to like keep his head in the ground but blowtoss pistol is able to pretty easily

532
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,120
uh...

533
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:03,280
Why are you doing this dude? Are we like enemies?

534
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,240
No, it's a combat... I was gonna jump off of you.

535
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,520
At who?

536
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,360
At the people.

537
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,880
You were just gonna attack the people?

538
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:17,480
No witnesses! We're supposed to be... this is a covert mission.

539
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,880
That's a really good point. Those people saw me do the flip and they golf clapped for me.

540
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,000
We gotta take them all out.

541
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
So you guys land...

542
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,000
Oh, also I should say, uh, yeah, Ray, you take five damage from that brutal fall.

543
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Five damage, dude? Oh, fuck.

544
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
You fell with your horns in the ground.

545
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
That's like nor- I don't know.

546
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's normal for me.

547
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
People do that, I don't know. People do that.

548
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:48,000
So yeah, you guys have landed in the slums of Gun City.

549
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Where the neon turns to orange.

550
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Sorry, did you say "Guns Titty"?

551
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I said-

552
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I think he did. I think he said Guns Titty.

553
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Okay, so I'll just change name really quickly.

554
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
[Laughter]

555
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
You guys have landed in the slums of Guns Titty, otherwise known as Guns Titty.

556
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
[Laughter]

557
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty.

558
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
That's right. And the girls here are pretty busted, folks.

559
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh my god.

560
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
You're in one of the nastiest parts of all of Planet E-Bomb.

561
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,000
e-bomb where some of the lowest scummiest techno slime dealers live. It's just wall to wall,

562
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:35,080
tons of fucking Arby's and electronics stores. Stores that sell electronics is what they

563
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:43,400
say on the signs. People all walk with their head down. They're all just totally impoverished.

564
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,560
They refused to succumb to the glorious Stakem's brand lifestyle.

565
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,640
And because of that, they suffered.

566
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:57,560
It's a, it's pretty, it's pretty harrowing, pretty, pretty, pretty big bummer.

567
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,720
It's sort of a, it's like, uh, you guys ever see the movie Blade Runner?

568
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
It sure is a lot like that.

569
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,780
Whoa.

570
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,940
Wow.

571
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:06,920
So yeah, you guys are in the middle of the slums.

572
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,960
You feel your Sony N-Gage ring.

573
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
[laughter]

574
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
It's almost definitely not Sony.

575
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
It's Nokia.

576
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Yeah, thank you. It makes way more sense.

577
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,960
You feel your PSP's ring.

578
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,960
Okay.

579
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,960
And you take them out of your...

580
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,960
wherever you keep the hat, I guess.

581
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,960
I'm thinking of the... My pocket.

582
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
Yeah, your pocket, but...

583
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
My horns.

584
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:35,960
You know, you keep it...

585
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,960
Tactical kangaroo pouch.

586
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,960
Amazing.

587
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:39,960
Okay, you guys take it out of those places.

588
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,960
And it's, uh, Ashton Future sort of, uh, goes on.

589
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,960
He says, "Whoa, looks like you guys really fucked that up.

590
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,960
Okay, so if you guys are gonna be able to make it there by midnight, you're gonna have

591
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
to find a way to get to the main city.

592
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,960
And, uh, I'm gonna be honest, there's really no good way to get there.

593
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
I'd suggest probably start asking around.

594
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
You might find a way in.

595
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:07,280
good luck or again you're and he almost curses and he says you guys are punked

596
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,920
whoa and then he signs off and he likes because you can't curse on TV and yeah

597
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:19,880
he said fuck a little do that but well you get one fuck it's a pg-13 campaign

598
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:24,520
yeah yeah yeah so you guys are kind of stranded in gun city times a ticking you

599
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:29,440
have to do it by midnight before OS Fogel fully updates in the computer so

600
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,720
fuck okay um who's turn is it? yeah so there's people around all different

601
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,880
shapes and sizes there's some freakers on the streets and some is there any big

602
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,240

604
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:56,680
so uh you know what I want you to do I want you to roll roll investigation see

605
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,940
if you find a big bitch.

606
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,940
Hell yeah.

607
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
I roll a 26.

608
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:00,940
Okay.

609
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:09,400
So yeah, you spend like a good minute just sort of looking around, peering everywhere,

610
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:15,240
and you find some of the choicest, largest women in the slums so easily.

611
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:22,080
You find a group of them sitting outside of a Jollibee's and they're just chatting.

612
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:29,680
And they're making eyes at you and your demons making eyes at them maybe.

613
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:34,160
So I'm going to try and take advantage of my demons lustful glare.

614
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:39,320
And so the demon walks up to him, right?

615
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:43,020
And he starts going like, "Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr."

616
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
Right?

617
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
Yeah.

618
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,200
And then I click the mute button.

619
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:50,600
I go to the dock on myself and I click mute and I mute him so he's just moving his mouth

620
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,880
but nothing's coming out.

621
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,880
Right.

622
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,420
But then I turn the speakers on and I go, "Hello, women of planet E-Bomb.

623
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:02,160
Could you point us in the direction of the main city?"

624
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,720
Yeah, the two big ass bitches look at you and they're-

625
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,720
How big are we talking?

626
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:14,620
Yeah, what do they look like? Yeah, how so these bitches have you seen the movie shallow how?

627
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:19,660
They look like Jack black

628
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:24,920
Say no more. Yeah, I won't

629
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:30,580
Yeah, so they sort of look at each other and look at you

630
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,900
I'm gonna sort of like laugh a little bit a little embarrassed

631
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:41,580
You're like, "Um, you can't like get to the main city like from here, not in any way that I know of."

632
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
Why, bitch?

633
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,860
Which one of you says that?

634
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
The computer.

635
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,860
Yeah, roll a persuasion check.

636
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,860
You just called this woman a bitch.

637
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,860
Alright, hold on.

638
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,860
I roll a 13.

639
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860
Why don't you just put it up here and paint her?

640
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,620
- Okay, yeah, she sort of is not too thrilled,

641
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:06,460
but she's like, "Oh, there's something to this demon.

642
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,500
He's kind of, he's at least muscular, you know,

643
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,100
maybe there's something there."

644
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:16,860
And so she says, "Because you need like so many different

645
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,780
kinds of like verification to even begin to go to the rich

646
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,620
part of town."

647
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,700
And the other one goes, "Yeah, it's really hard

648
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,720
to get there."

649
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,580
(laughing)

650
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,420
- We ran into John.

651
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:38,420
Jack Black does he scat at all yeah he was we get some Jack Black rickety kicks

652
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:43,460

653
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:47,940

Yes. Yeah, so they're sort of looking at you guys talking through what you should be able

664
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,380
to see. And then they're like, "What are you doing?"

665
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,380
I'm making a smoothie.

666
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,380
Okay.

667
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,380
Duh.

668
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:56,240
Okay, so yeah, do you-

669
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,960
That's what I'm doing.

670
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,320
Do you offer them the smoothie?

671
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,400
I offer them the smoothie, but I don't know what's in it yet.

672
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Okay, yeah, so-

673
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,400
You don't know what's in that?

674
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,400
How do you say that?

675
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,400
Do you say that?

676
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:11,720
I still don't know what's in the smoothie.

677
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:19,440
Yeah, okay, so you have to... yeah, so the thing about Patrick's smoothies is that you don't know what's in them until you drink them.

678
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:19,940
Mm-hmm.

679
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,440
So...

680
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:20,940
Fine.

681
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,440
Roll a persuasion check since you're offering these strangers a drink.

682
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,440
[Laughter]

683
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,440
I got a stranger, they're big bitches.

684
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,440
Yeah, okay, so they're big bitches, so they're kind of just down, you know, like, you know, respect, you know.

685
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,940
Yeah.

686
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,440
You hand them the smoothie.

687
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:35,940
Mm-hmm.

688
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:40,940
They take a drink of it, and it is the best goddamn smoothie they have ever had.

689
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,580
Oh my god.

690
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,380
They are losing their fucking minds.

691
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:51,140
The Jack Black one is doing like the little Jack Black like shuffle where he's sort of

692
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,140
like this.

693
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,700
I know the shuffle.

694
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,700
Yeah, yeah.

695
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,700
I'm familiar with it.

696
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,420
When he walks between the desks in School of Rock.

697
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,420
Yeah, yeah.

698
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Yeah.

699
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,420
Because that's what I was thinking of.

700
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,820
Yeah, he's so, he's so excited.

701
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,580
And he's just now, he's a guy.

702
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,580
He's Jack Black.

703
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
He's still a big bitch.

704
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
I just didn't care.

705
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
He sure is.

706
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,580
They're so excited and they're like, "Okay, okay. Oh my god."

707
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,580
And Jack Black's like, "Scooby-dee-wee, wobbly-dee-boo!"

708
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,580
And then he's like, "Okay."

709
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,580
That was the best smoothie I've literally ever had.

710
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:31,580
Okay, someone who might know actually how you can get in is Sullivan the Frog.

711
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,580
He lives a couple of blocks down from here.

712
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:40,080
Um, you won't miss it, 'cause his apartment looks like a tree stomp.

713
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,580
*laughter*

714
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
I tell her that that's my cousin.

715
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:48,080
Are you lying?

716
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Roll deception check.

717
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,580
*laughter*

718
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,580
Making that up?

719
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:55,580
Okay, I also tell her that's my cousin.

720
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,580
But-

721
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,080
I say he's not my cousin, but I'm lying.

722
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,080
He is my cousin.

723
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,580
Wait, I roll- alright.

724
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,880
So you all have to roll deception because you're lying about how you're related or not related

725
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,880
to Sullivan the Frog.

726
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,380
Alright, do we roll it at the same time?

727
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,380
I got an 8.

728
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,380
I got an 8.

729
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:11,380
You got an 8.

730
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,380
I also got an 8.

731
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,380
I got a 5.

732
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,380
Okay, yeah, they're just...

733
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,380
Yeah, you all sort of...

734
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:18,380
Just like, just like three dudes like immediately, "Yeah, yeah, he's my cousin, yeah."

735
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,380
Like all at once.

736
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,380
He's not my cousin.

737
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,620
(laughter)

738
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:27,280
- Just like, just like three dudes like,

739
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,720
immediately, "Yeah, yeah, he's my cousin, yeah."

740
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,060
Like all at once.

741
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,300
- "He's not my cousin."

742
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,540
- Yeah, they sort of like, like, you're like, "Oh, okay."

743
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,760
Yeah, like they're like watching three guys

744
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,300
try to brag about how this frog is their cousin

745
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,440
or not their cousin.

746
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,640
- Yeah.

747
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,680
- And they're like, "That's cool."

748
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,520
- "It is cool, bitch."

749
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,280
- Okay.

750
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,740
talker yeah you sure do they're like okay like honestly thank you for the smoothie

751
00:41:54,740 --> 00:42:00,480
best smoothie ever which could be hard to be we're gonna go like home and so they

752
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,640
get up and they leave I tell one of them they're my cousin I put a tracking device

753
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,280
on them hold on okay what do you do Patrick and then I told I tell one of

754
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:11,280
of them that they are my cousin.

755
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Yeah, dude, that is so unhinged.

756
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,280
Okay, okay.

757
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
Yeah, they just sort of walk that off.

758
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,280
I can't even begin to conceive of another kind of response.

759
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I yell after them that Patrick is my cousin.

760
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
They're walking fast.

761
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,280
I turn on bass boost on my built-in speakers and I say,

762
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,280
"I have no cousins."

763
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,280
*laughter*

764
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,280
Okay, I'm gonna say at this point, you guys are making so much commotion.

765
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,280
*laughter*

766
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:52,280
That you've got to tap on the shoulder, Patrick Yoda, since he's the only one who can reach.

767
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:55,280
You're the only one whose shoulder he can reach.

768
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:01,280
And you turn around and see a handsome dandy of a little frog.

769
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,280
Oh my god.

770
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,820
an adorable little bowler hat on. It's my cousin. He's uh. Does he think that that

771
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:16,540
Yoda, Patrick Yoda is also a frog? He's at first, and then he turns around he's like

772
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:20,860
it's not what that is. He's not wearing any pants but he's got like a cartoon

773
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:26,820
bottom half so like no indecency. Is he wearing like a suit? He's wearing like a

774
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:35,340
suit up top like he's winning the pooing it gotcha he says to you guys excuse me

776
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:49,220
Patrick don't know who you are with my hand I'd cover Patrick's mouth I give him

777
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:56,220
really light tap with the pipe just enough to like confuse him. I cracked the pipe out of camera's hand.

778
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,220
Alright let's get back on track.

779
00:43:58,220 --> 00:44:02,500
There's like a lot I could resolve there it's like you're trying to figure out

780
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:07,100
yeah he he sort of regards this like interaction where it's like no yes no

781
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:13,380
yes he goes "uh well if you're looking for solve in the frog that's me" and he

782
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:18,900
point to himself with two thumbs and smiles. Is there any way that I can help

783
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,500
you guys? Okay I got this boys don't worry about this.

784
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:31,180
All right I walk up to him eight over nine feet of demon and I just say I'm

785
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:37,380
just like I'm just like can you point us in the direction of the city? Oh you're

786
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:43,100
trying to get to the main city and leave try to get out of Guns Titty. He's sort of

787
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:48,380
like nods and he winks at you but frogs have translucent eyelids so it's just he

788
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:54,460
just like blinks it's like a weird filter goes over one of his eyes okay and he

789
00:44:54,460 --> 00:45:00,560
says I'd certainly like to help you but I was wondering if there's something you

790
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,340
could do for me first no you guys look pretty strong okay real real quick I I

791
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,340
I hack Patrick Yoda.

792
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,340
No.

793
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,340
Yeah, I hack Patrick Yoda.

794
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,340
That's gonna happen? Okay, so what you have to do then

795
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,340
is you roll a

796
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,340
uh, amazing, okay.

797
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,340
You roll your

798
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,340
d20 plus 8, Caleb.

799
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,340
Okay. 20.

800
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
You got a 20?

801
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,340
Yeah. He didn't get a 20.

802
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,340
I did. Prove it.

803
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,340
12 plus 8.

804
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,340
Oh, yeah, that's what that is.

805
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,260
I had to take a route for Patrick.

806
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:40,260
You have to roll, oh shit, Patrick has minus two intelligence.

807
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,860
He's like, "Oh wait, someone knows."

808
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,860
What do I roll?

809
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:47,460
You have to roll, Patrick, there's literally no way you can beat a 20.

810
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,860
You have minus two intelligence.

811
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,860
I think I can do it.

812
00:45:50,860 --> 00:45:51,860
Okay, I want you to try.

813
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,860
Roll a d20 and subtract two.

814
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Seven.

815
00:45:53,860 --> 00:46:01,740
Okay, so that's a little bit less than 20.

816
00:46:01,740 --> 00:46:04,460
So the tower unlodges from your back, Caleb.

817
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,900
Describe the process of hacking.

818
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:10,540
Yeah, yeah, so again, I safely eject the tower, right?

819
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:13,500
But then I realize that I have no way to propel myself

820
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,460
since we're not in the air, I can't use like,

821
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,460
you know, centrifugal force.

822
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:19,700
So I just drop onto the ground.

823
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:22,060
And then the demon football punts me

824
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:23,940
into the back of Patrick Yoda's head

825
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:27,980
where he conveniently has a USB 3.0 port, right?

826
00:46:27,980 --> 00:46:28,900
Female.

827
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:30,100
And I plug into it.

828
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:34,220
And all of a sudden, and also Sullivan the Frog

829
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,500
does not notice this somehow because I rolled a 20. I'm so good.

830
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:42,220
Okay, I actually would rather you roll a stealth check to see if it works.

831
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:45,820
Oh, come on dude. Okay, alright.

832
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:50,220
Since you want to complicate everything, I roll a

833
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:54,900
22, er, 21. Okay, yeah, let me roll for him. He's probably not going to notice.

834
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,260
He's not very observant. He is looking right at you though, so we'll see.

835
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,340
No, he doesn't notice. He did pretty bad. He doesn't notice at all.

836
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:06,940
Yeah, you just hack into Patrick Yoda and you're deeming-

837
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,440
So suddenly, this is what it looks like to Sullivan the Frog.

838
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,940
He's trying to talk to you guys.

839
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,040
There's like a fight going on between two of you.

840
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:20,440
Uh, one of you starts T-posing and the other one stops like talking all of a sudden.

841
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:25,540
After he just said "no", after asking if we needed his help,

842
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,740
Patrick Yoda said "no" and all of a sudden his eyes go white

843
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,740
and you see the Matrix code overlaid.

844
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:39,900
And he says, "Actually, yes, we would love your help."

845
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,860
Saul in the front goes, "Oh, that's good.

846
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:48,380
Well, here's something I wouldn't mind you guys doing for me.

847
00:47:48,380 --> 00:47:54,700
So, well, I don't know how familiar, you guys don't look quite like you're from around here,

848
00:47:54,700 --> 00:48:02,140
but, well, there are a lot of gangs here in Guns Titty, and one of them is the uncle and

849
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:08,940
his nephews they come around every night and they give me wedgies and call me

850
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,340
slurs like happi which is a slur for frogs they're a small-time gang and

851
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:18,620
they're hooked on the stuff they push that techno slime so you know I don't

852
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,020
think they're too tough probably for you guys but if you guys can maybe just talk

853
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:28,660
to them or something I'd really appreciate it I say mission accepted and

854
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:31,300
and I'd crouch down I look right in his eyes when I say it.

855
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,780
Um, so he knows that I'm serious. He like pees himself a little.

856
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,940
Uh, very scared. Um, and he says to you guys,

857
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,340
to you, uh, "Well, okay, you can, should be able to find them at the

858
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,940
Suckafuckabarn grill. Um, that's where they're usually pushing their techno slime.

859
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:50,300
Probably in the back. Anyway,

860
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:57,300
I have to go suck a dick."

861
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:04,300
I just never figured out what he was going to say there.

862
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:05,300
Okay.

863
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,300
Say, "TMI" to the camera.

864
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,300
Yeah.

865
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:16,300
You didn't need to say that, Sullivan.

866
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:21,300
You could have just said you were going to go to the bathroom.

867
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,300
That would have been fine.

868
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:25,300
Yeah, we don't need to know what goes on in the bathroom.

869
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:27,300
We get it you're doing number four

870
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:37,340
Get lost you hoppity little bitch

871
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:44,460
You are a hoppity little bitch he looks really dejected

872
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,660
But we will save you

873
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,300
He says I'll see ya I say think of us think of us as the lesser of two evils

874
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:02,080
I'm gonna say we're gonna. I'll see you I'm gonna call you later

875
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:07,460
I marked the location on your cyber map, so it should be not too hard to find

876
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:12,100
Come back here when you've sorted it out. I'll get you topside no problem

877
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:18,940
And he sort of hops away and goes into his little stump a couple couple blocks down you can watch him walk hop the entire way

878
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:24,380
Yeah, so you guys have it marked on your map. You can see that the Suckafuckagrill is

879
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:30,120
Further down and I no longer. I'm no longer hacked by Caleb. Yeah, I

881
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:43,780
And then I I use my CD drive to crawl myself back to my demon

882
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:49,380
Mm-hmm yeah, and then he picks me up, and he puts me he accidentally puts me on his penis, but it still works

890
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:31,040
Okay, so you walk by a sunglasses store, and you found sunglasses that you didn't pay for

891
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:35,000
Okay, cool. I'm gonna let that go

Dispensaries that are like like, you know medically approved techno slime

VR sort of like arcades where people are putting on VR helmets and stuff and you get to

902
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:29,780
The Suckafucka barn grill and it's just it sort of looks like a giant like can of beans

903
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:33,580
It's sort of a

904
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:34,780
weird like

905
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:38,320
chrome futuristic can of beans shaped kind of place.

906
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,460
Wait, are you saying that in the future

907
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:45,020
cans of beans will be chrome and futuristic?

908
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:49,620
Or it's like a can of beans but with futuristic attributes?

909
00:52:49,620 --> 00:52:53,140
It's a can of beans chrome like situation.

910
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:57,940
So you get to the Suckafucka Bar and Grill though. It's probably the seediest bar in town.

911
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,180
It's where the Mad Suckla, the kingpin of the

912
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:06,260
Guns Titty is said to like sort of run a lot of his operation out of it.

913
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:10,980
There's a lot of gangs there. You guys, you walk inside you see

914
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:17,080
the Hillary Clintons, or a gang of men who all got surgery to look like Hillary Clinton.

915
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:21,140
You see the Jerky Boys.

916
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,060
Just the Jerky Boys.

917
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:28,660
You see the Techno Scum Psychonauts.

Yeah, those guys are the only cool ones. Those are the ones that Cameron has a join those guys. Yeah

919
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:42,460
Everyone who is not in a gang is wearing an oculus rift that simulates getting a blumpkin from boxy

920
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:52,260
Damn dude the first time that name's been said in a recorded medium. Maybe ever

921
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:59,560
It's what I'm here for uh and you guys see the bartender which is a

922
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:04,560
a giant worm named Jamal.

923
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,760
- Sounds like a big bitch to me.

924
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,600
- Oh my God. - Jamal the worm?

925
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,640
- Jamal the worm. - It's Jamal the worm.

926
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:11,040

00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,120
- I order.

928
00:54:12,120 --> 00:54:14,000
- I say, "Hey, Jamal, what's up, buddy?"

929
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:14,840
- Yeah, he's singing you guys over.

930
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,520
He's like, "Hey, what's going on, guys?

931
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,480
"How you doing?"

932
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:18,960
He's just sort of immediately

933
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,280
the most chill, friendly worm around.

934
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,920
You see him from the theater. - I order.

935
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:23,760
- Yeah, what do you do?

936
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,480
- I order one Pib Cosby from Jamal the worm.

937
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:29,340
- He says, "Pib Cosby coming right up."

938
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:33,480
And he, uh, he sort of is balancing himself on his worm body and using his

939
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,700
tail to make the drink.

940
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,160
Uh, while he's doing that, he says, what can I help you with fellas?

941
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,200
Um, real quick.

942
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:41,220
I ordered just a normal Cosby.

943
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,540
Okay.

944
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:47,740
He sort of says you're going to have to go out back for something like that.

945
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:51,500
Okay.

946
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,260
Uh, what's it, wait, what's the name of the gang we're hunting again?

947
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,900
The uncle nephew.

948
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,180
Yeah.

949
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,100
I'm going to snide.

950
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,860
So I, so I asked him all.

951
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:03,860
I say, "We're looking for a gang called the Uncle Nephews."

952
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:05,260
Jamal goes like, "Shh, shh, shh.

953
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,660
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

954
00:55:06,660 --> 00:55:08,660
I only have one volume setting."

955
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:10,920
(laughing)

956
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,020

They're kind of a, ugh.

959
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:20,720
He sort of rolls his worm eyes and he says,

960
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,380
"They're a real pain.

961
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,300
The sucka's been trying to get rid of 'em himself.

962

964

uh... i think you're the only thing that has many of this is you want

998
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:13,860
many are a lot of what i thought i was going to have a good back door

999
00:57:13,860 --> 00:57:17,100
okay wait let's try it out and uh...

1000
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,300
how about i think

1001
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,820
i think patrick

1002
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:24,100
yoda should go out there and pretend to be one of the net use you look like an

1003
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,760
avenue and

1004
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,460
do you know what i'm saying

1005
00:57:27,460 --> 00:57:31,020
me and ray will hang back in a things get ugly

1006
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:32,380
we run in a week

1007
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,140
so i think you know the way that i

1008
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,660
should i turn someone into people you'll be dead if things get ugly your your

1009
00:57:38,660 --> 00:57:42,460
dates if you die will just for if you don't i will just leave

1010
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:43,220
all right

1011
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,740
so this is what i'm saying is we sacrifice

1012
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:46,900
patrick

1013
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,080
i agree

1014
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,260
no so that's not what's up country

1015
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:54,420
here you know what let's just take a vote

1016
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:59,160
what if we are going to be very well i said let's take a vote on on on that's

1017
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,700
not you have to do tactics

1018
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,940
that's right and it's actually here

1019
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:07,420
the tactic here is to send patrick of first alone okay

1020
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:11,920
and he should leave his well i'm all in favor say i

1021
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,120
i by

1022
00:58:14,120 --> 00:58:19,440
all of those in a metric we have to do the but i i think that i'd tell you that i

1023
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,240
think that's a sign unanimous no uh...

1024
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:24,480
we have to go around

1025
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,560
i pick up i said i had to do the body

1026
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:31,800
pat i'd pick up patrick's tiny yoda body i put him on his hoverboard my push him

1027
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:36,320
out the back door before you roll rolling it together it's great strength

1028
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:40,920
contest so both you guys role for strength okay

1029
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,600
i got an eleven

1030
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:43,880
I got a 17.

1031
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,880
Okay.

1032
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:45,880
Fuck.

1033
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,880
Yeah, so you try to like grapple this little Yoda guy and put him on a skateboard and what

1034
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:50,880
do you do?

1035
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:51,880
How do you shove him off?

1036
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:52,880
I...

1037
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,380
Well, I grab him by the...

1038
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,380
Oh, you're talking to me.

1039
00:58:55,380 --> 00:58:56,380
Yeah, you suck.

1040
00:58:56,380 --> 00:58:57,800
You don't get to do anything.

1041
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,280
What I do is I go between Cameron's...

1042
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:08,200
Or I go between Piss' legs and I swing up onto his back and now I'm on his neck.

1043
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,120
Okay, so you're just sort of...

1044
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,120
Okay, then I just walk in and now

1045
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:20,080
The entire plan just you guys are sort of just the mighty

1046
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:23,760
We're pretending to be one

1047
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:29,980
We're one before they walk out of the door I jump on there on on Patrick's shoulders

1048
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:36,840
Yeah, Cameron, I'm gonna need you to roll a

1049
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:40,560
strength saving throw to see if you could hold him.

1050
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:43,960
Okay. I got a 23.

1051
00:59:43,960 --> 01:00:07,600
You're strong as hell. You're just holding a demon and a Yoda. You guys come out I guess to take goodbye tickets to the R rated film. You go out to the back and you do see you do see you see that the the alleyway is lit by much dimmer neon than the than the inside the bar than the main city.

1052
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,940
You know, it's a little bit seedier out here, right?

1053
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:16,480
And you see, dimly lit in the back, you see this big British

1054
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,880
looking orc man and you see just, he's just like hideous

1055
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,860
looking and he's wearing a white tank top, which has another

1056
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:26,240
name.

1057
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,600
I'm trying not to, I'm trying not to use it anymore, you know,

1058
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:34,120
and he's wearing that and hanging on his arm is just, is

1059
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:41,120
this like busted looking blonde woman who is just like like talking at him saying

1060
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:47,760
some stuff and then on the ground you see a bunch of little goblins dressed in

1061
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:57,880
sort of like Adidas tracksuits but chrome and they're all just playing jacks and

1062
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:02,200
when you lose that you get shot in the head the kind of jacks they play.

1063
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,200
And so they see you guys come out.

1064
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,200
And um...

1065
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:07,200
Okay, we continue.

1066
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:13,200
No, yeah, the uncle sort of looks at you guys and says, "Hell you boys want!"

1067
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,200
"We're one nephew!"

1068
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,200
"We're all stacked up!"

1069
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,200
"Hell, whoa!"

1070
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,200
"First of all, we're one big nephew!"

1071
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:23,200
Yeah, yeah, so we try to convince them that we're just one big nephew.

1072
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,200
Yeah, yeah, how about this?

1073
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,200
Imagine this.

1074
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:31,200
Say each of the individual things you would say, and then we'll imagine all of them being

1075
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:37,380
said at the same time. Okay, ready? Three, two, oh no wait we'll do it. Yeah just do that.

1076
01:01:37,380 --> 01:01:45,060
I say, I say, oh yeah let's do it. Okay, three, two, one. We're just one big nephew. I'm one big nephew.

1077
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:50,580
One guy. Okay so. One. He sort of is like looking around at you guys and he's like

1078
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:56,060
"What? You're, you're my nephews? Are you guys trying to, trying to become nephews?"

1079
01:01:56,060 --> 01:02:02,780

1080
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:06,660

1081
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:13,940
us yeah all you guys roll deception I got 17 with deception right yeah yeah I

1082
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:21,580

1083
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:25,900
must have forgotten and I hired you guys why don't you play jacks with the rest

1084
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:29,100
of the nephews and see the little goblin man like yeah come play jacks with us

1085
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:35,620
come on okay we remain on top of each other though yeah because nobody can

1086
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:39,460
move until I move because I'm the heaviest one and I'm on the top no I

1087
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:44,140
know no I'm the one who moves I'm on the bottom no no no nobody nobody can get

1088
01:02:44,140 --> 01:02:48,660

01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:56,500
you can play jacks with us.

1091
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:57,020
Okay.

1092
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:58,180
Actually, here's what happens.

1093
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:03,100
Because, uh, uh, because you are at the bottom and because your arms are busy

1094
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:07,620
holding Patrick Yoda's legs over your shoulders, what you have to do is you

1095
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:12,500
have to sit 10 feet away from the circle of people playing jacks and bend over

1096
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:14,580
so that I can be the arms.

1097
01:03:14,580 --> 01:03:15,900
Okay.

1098
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:16,580
I do that.

1099
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,380
Yeah.

1100
01:03:17,380 --> 01:03:23,540
And I, I pick up the jacks and then I looked immediately.

1101
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,900
Not how you play jacks.

1102
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:31,940
Yeah, and then I pick up the jacks, and I put them in my mouth.

1103
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:39,940
Okay, yeah, the uncle looks at you, he's like, "Wait a minute, my nephews would never do that.

1104
01:03:39,940 --> 01:03:41,940
Who are you guys, really?"

1105
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:44,940
I pull out my lead pipes, and I hit the uncle.

1106
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,940
Okay, everyone roll initiative.

1107
01:03:46,940 --> 01:03:48,940
Let's fucking go.

1108
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,940
Okay, hold on.

1109
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:51,940
Fourteen.

1110
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,940
I rolled a four.

1111
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:55,140
I got eight.

1112
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:56,540
Okay, cool.

1113
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:03,840
So, before anything happens, which Cameron, you do get to go first.

1114
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:19,140
You are going to get to like whip out that lead pipe, but you see the blonde woman who is hanging on the uncle just like sort of stand at attention and turn like just rock solid and the uncle like picks her up like a sword.

1115
01:04:19,140 --> 01:04:20,140
Whoa.

1116
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,340
Yeah, so that's, that happens right away.

1117
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:24,640
Yeah.

1118
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,140
Uh, broadsword is the-

1119
01:04:26,140 --> 01:04:27,140
Oh shit.

1120
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,140
Oh my!

1121
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:29,140
Yeah.

1122
01:04:29,140 --> 01:04:30,140
Uh, so uh, yeah.

1123
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,140
Uh, now, so yeah, now Cameron, you're up.

1124
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,140
You're up.

1125
01:04:32,140 --> 01:04:38,720
So you, you, you, you're gonna go, you're gonna go lead pipe on them.

1126
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,880
You're close enough, 'cause you guys approached, uh, did the, the, the, the Jack's subterfuge.

1127
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:43,880
Um.

1128
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:44,880
Yeah.

1129
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:45,880
Okay.

1130
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:46,880
It's really good in your mouth.

1131
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:47,880
I, uh.

1132
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,880
Alright, that one's my bad, guys.

1133
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:49,880
I'm sorry.

1134
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,880
I do, I, I, why did I do that?

1135
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:57,000
I do I I whack the or how many nephews are there so there are like

1136
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,440
what's the number of nephews so here's a nephew uncle ratio there's like four or

1137
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:06,960
five little nasty goblin nephews the way they're gonna work though is it's like

1138
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:10,920
horde fighting so it's like you just attack the nephew group as long as

1139
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,440
they're within range and you're just gonna sort of take out a few of them

1140
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:17,960
depending on how much damage you do all right gotcha okay I wanna I want to fuck

1141
01:05:17,960 --> 01:05:28,120
up the nephews. I want to hit the nephews with my dual pipe. So I take out my dual lead pipes

1142
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:34,440
and I spin them around in my hands really fast and I just stick my hands forward like

1143
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:43,400
they're two helicopter blade lead pipes. Roll a d20 as your attack modifier. Yeah let's

1144
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:57,720
see here that's a 13 okay yeah that's a hit okay roll for damage that's 17 damage

1145
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:07,680
okay yeah describe your kill on all of the names okay they just go flying they

1146
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:12,280
um I stick my spinning pipes into the midst of them and they all just like

1147
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:16,920
scattered and they go they bounce around like bowling pins and disco completely

1148
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,760
rigid

1149
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,680
instant rigor mortis

1150
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:24,120
uh... no it's not that it looks like it it looks like a p_g_ movie that has

1151
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:28,760
comic violence yeah there's no blood is just bruising it is a bruise covers all

1152
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,520
of their bodies instantly

1153
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,360
you you you're just killing heartless in kingdom hearts it's just there's training

1154
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:38,760
to mist yeah exactly evaporate

1155
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,600
That's my cool cultural reference.

1156
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,000
So, yeah, they're all gone.

1157
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,760
And the uncle just goes, "MY NEPHEWS!"

1158
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,760
And like, screams towards the sky.

1159

He's just like, despondent.

1161
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,760
You see a single tear from his broadsword.

1162
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,560
Like, she cries as well.

1163
01:06:57,560 --> 01:06:59,560
Completely stone-faced otherwise.

01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:02,360
Yeah, is there anything else you want to do?

1165
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,760
Do I get an extra attack and then a cunning action?

1166
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:07,960

disengage ok if you wanna hide you can

1187

1203
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:20,960
So he's gonna roll for damage now as well. Let's see how he does. Okay, yeah, so he takes his wife,

1204
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:27,840

1219
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:11,780
whatever you want. I could yeah hmm because if I could attack him but I

1220
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:13,780
I could also turn him into Pickle Rick.

1221
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:15,780
Whoa.

1222
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,780
You could, you can try for sure.

1223
01:11:17,780 --> 01:11:19,780
Hmm, but that, should I use Techno Slime points this early?

1224
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:21,780
You got lots to, you can recharge it, use it.

1225
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,780
Oh, alright, then I'm gonna use it.

1226
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,780
Do it.

1227
01:11:25,780 --> 01:11:27,780
Alright.

1228
01:11:27,780 --> 01:11:29,780
Which one do I roll?

1229
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:31,780
Okay, yeah, so for, for Pickle Rick,

1230
01:11:31,780 --> 01:11:33,780
Uh-huh.

1231
01:11:33,780 --> 01:11:35,780
Uh, your, your, basically your polymorph spell,

1232
01:11:35,780 --> 01:11:37,780
you roll,

1233
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:39,780
you roll,

1234
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:46,780
polymorph spell, you roll a, um, they have to actually roll. So, they basically have to

1235
01:11:46,780 --> 01:11:53,780
resist, um, a roll. So basically you, so what do you say as you sort of, uh, use this, and

1236
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:59,780
like, how do you use this, this, this ability? What is it that, how does it do it?

1237
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:04,780
It just, uh, I just kinda stand there, I wiggle my fingers and something happens.

1238
01:12:04,780 --> 01:12:06,780
Okay, cool. So that's how it goes.

1239
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:09,780
Then he has to roll a resistance of charisma.

1240
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,780
Yeah, he fucks that up big time.

1241
01:12:11,780 --> 01:12:13,780
Yeah, so he turns into Pickle Rick.

1242
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:16,780
Does he want to turn into Pickle Rick? Or you can turn him into anything.

1243
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:18,780
I can turn him into anything, okay.

1244
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:21,780
I'm gonna turn him into a nephew.

1245
01:12:21,780 --> 01:12:23,780
Whoa.

1246
01:12:23,780 --> 01:12:25,780
Uncle to nephew.

1247
01:12:25,780 --> 01:12:27,780
So yeah, you turn him into a nephew.

1248
01:12:27,780 --> 01:12:29,780
He shrinks down.

1249
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,780
His shirt is now sort of just like

1250
01:12:33,780 --> 01:12:38,740
just like hanging over him. He's not really able to lift the sword so he's

1251
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:42,740
probably he's gonna have disadvantage on attacks with that and he's just like you

1252
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:50,220
little punk I'm not a nephew I'm an uncle! That's exactly what I wanted to see.

1253
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:54,580

1264
01:13:31,540 --> 01:13:34,540
It's to murder people and then steal from their bodies.

1265
01:13:34,540 --> 01:13:35,540
Yeah, that's right.

1266
01:13:35,540 --> 01:13:36,540

So I grab him by the collar of his big shirt, but then he falls out.

1272
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:48,540

1281
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,580
strength contest so let's see he might he might fuck it up but he's weaker now

1282

1284
01:14:53,220 --> 01:14:56,700
you can still tell him what you said to him all right so I say you still say

1285
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:01,380

01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:06,880
disadvantage because you just like fucked up frankly let him timid yeah so

1287
01:15:06,880 --> 01:15:11,880
So you roll two d20s, add your intimidation to each of them, and then take the lowest- the lower number of the two.

1288
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,880
Fuck. The lower number?

1289
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:14,880
Yeah.

1290
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:16,880
Uh, eight.

1291
01:15:16,880 --> 01:15:20,880
Okay, I'm gonna see how he does against that. Uh...

1292
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:24,880
Yeah, no, he's sort of- he's like, "Fuck you, you weird demon freak!"

1293
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:27,880
Ah, come on. Okay, alright. Um...

1294
01:15:27,880 --> 01:15:32,880
I- I- I say, uh, "You guys handle this one."

1295
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:35,880
And then I walk inside and I drink all the Pib Cosby's.

1296
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,880
- Okay, yeah. - They're sitting on the bar.

1297
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:41,580
Yeah, he's gonna get an attack of opportunity as you're walking away.

1298
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,480
Oh, fuck. I don't even care, whatever.

1299
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:47,480
You're like, dejected and you start walking away and he tries to hit you.

1300
01:15:47,480 --> 01:15:50,880
Oh, he completely misses.

1301
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:56,480
He literally tries to hit you and he, like, falls over and is knock-prone.

1302
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,980
Which means you guys have advantage on attacks on him.

1303
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:03,280
He tries to hit you and he trips over his giant shirt like an asshole.

1304
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:07,620
Your turn, Cameron. You're inside now, you're just drinking Pimp Cones.

1305
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:09,160
Yeah, I'm just slamming him back.

1306
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,160
Jamal's like, "How'd it go?"

1307
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,160
*laughs*

1308
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:12,860
He's so-

1309
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:19,160
Amazing. It went so good. I was so cool out there. You should've been there, Jamal.

1310
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:20,660
Fizzbump bro.

1311
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:21,960

01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:25,960
So he's lying prone on the ground, right?

1314
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,460
Yeah.

1315
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,460
Can I use my gun to shoot him in the butt?

1316
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:31,560
Yeah, you can do that as many times as you want.

1317
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,060
Yeah.

1318
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:33,560
*laughs* As many times as you want?

1319
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,560
Okay, I do it a thousand times.

1320
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:36,560
Okay.

1321
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:44,060
Okay, I take out my Grinch gun and I look through the scope and I shoot right into the hole.

1322
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:45,760
And that's a 23.

1323
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:47,800
Oh, you hit.

1324
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:48,800
You hit roll for damage.

1325
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:49,800
Uh, six damage.

1326
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:52,800
That's not very much damage.

1327
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,800
Okay, yeah.

1328
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:57,840
I mean, you still, you still, yeah, so you shoot him and he sort of is able to wiggle

1329
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,880
a little bit out of the way.

1330
01:17:00,880 --> 01:17:05,840
And so you get him like kind of in the shoulder and he's like, "Ow!

1331
01:17:05,840 --> 01:17:06,840
Fuck!

1332
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:07,960
It stings like a Grinch!"

1333
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:11,480
And he's just sort of writhing in pain.

1334
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:17,680
When I hear the word Grinch, I flip the fuck out and I put my gun back, I holster my gun

1335
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:21,160
and I take out my dual pipes and I go gorilla on him.

1336
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:22,160
Oh, absolutely.

1337
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:23,160
Again, you roll with advantage.

1338
01:17:23,160 --> 01:17:24,160
Advantage, okay.

1339
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:25,160
That's 22.

1340
01:17:25,160 --> 01:17:26,160
Yeah, yeah.

1341
01:17:26,160 --> 01:17:27,160
Roll for damage.

1342
01:17:27,160 --> 01:17:28,920

1352

red dot on the ground is all that's left of him and I eat him also.

1353
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:02,760
Because I just, I enter full blood lust. Grinch lust.

1354
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,760

1360
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:28,760
Okay.

Everyone sort of shuffles their feet and they're kind of like, "Did he eat the guy?"

1396
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:18,880
Or does he... I don't know.

01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,560
He says, "Anytime, boys. Thanks for taking care of those punks."

1404
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:48,520
Now I give the $17 I found outside to Jamal in exchange for a six pack of Pib Cosby.

01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:46,440
he like sort of points at like a place on the cyber map.

1459
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:53,480
He says, "If you follow this, you'll be able to come topside without anybody really noticing.

1460
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:55,960
The only thing is, this is the posters underground.

1461
01:24:55,960 --> 01:25:00,280
There's a lot of freaks there so you're just gonna have to be careful.
