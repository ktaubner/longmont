Woo.

8
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,000

We're here with Felix on the show.

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,520
What's going on with him?

12
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,160
Oh, he's getting a rip.

13
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,880
Getting a rip in.

14
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,240
He's getting ripped off his pod.

15
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,760
Yeah, I have a new pod.

16
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,560
I have like the Nord where you have to click the little like...

17
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Oh yeah.

18
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,560
The VPN.

19
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
Yeah.

20
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Yeah.

21
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,560
That hits different.

22
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,560
Spooking a VPN baby.

23
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,560
Yeah.

24
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,560
That thing's crazy.

25
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:40,280
It looks like a Mio water enhancer.

26
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Yeah.

27
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,280
That's why I got it.

28
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,280
Yeah.

29
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,280
Yeah.

30
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,680
No, it's a LED fucking thing.

31
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,800
I don't know.

32
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,240
I wish I didn't have to hit the little fucking doodle on it.

33
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,800
You have to hit a button?

34
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Yeah.

35
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,800
Oh, that's game breaker.

36
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
It's sometimes nice to have the button though.

37
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,480
sometimes nice when you can pull your own it's nice to have some sort of feedback

38
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,040
yeah exactly it's like a jewel like my like if my jewel pod leaks then it's

39
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,120
like if I try to hit it then it just doesn't work for me the most important

40
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,520
thing is always just that it sounds like a cigarette does in a movie uh-huh you

41
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,260
know I mean where it's like a crackle that no real cigarette has ever made but

42
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:21,060
like a jewel makes that crack right so it kind of tricks my eye it tricks my

43
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,720
brain into thinking I'm smoking a cigarette a little bit that's the best

44
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:36,360
part

45
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,840
loud cigarette. I want to find out which brand is the loudest though. I think

46
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,040
camels are pretty loud. Because you crush them. Exactly yeah you have to crush them

47
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,720
they have all that that tinfoil in them. Juice. Yeah that juice and the tinfoil.

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,400
Camel crushes are very important to in New York the b-boy community. Yep exactly.

49
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:02,160
They provide. Yeah it's one of the hidden pillars. Yeah. Michael Rappaport

50
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,840
didn't learn about that pillar until he was 45. No, he'd randomly picked up smoking.

51
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,320
Yeah. I was laughing about like being like 30 and picking up smoking recently.

52
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,980
Oh that'd be amazing. For me it's almost as embarrassing. I didn't start

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:20,240
smoking till like two years ago. Yeah. Like middle of college. I didn't smoke a single

54
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,160
cigarette until college. I don't think that's that. You were what like 19, 20 when you

55
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:30,680
started smoking? Yeah. I don't think that's that bad. I don't know. I

56
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,240
I started when I was like 13.

57
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,080
- Me too.

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,900
- That's cool.

59
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,600
- Did you read The Outsiders too?

60
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,440
- No, no.

61
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,720
I just like, I like, I saw like older kids smoke them,

62
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,480
like kids I knew were having sex.

63
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,760
And I was like, this is, I thought it was like AP classes.

64
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,400
Like, oh yeah, if you do this now,

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,040
like you're going to be set up down the line.

66
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,280
And that was not true.

67
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,340
- I read a million little pieces and I was like,

68
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,800
I'm never doing a drug, dude.

69
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,920
I was just lied to.

70
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,120
You read A Million Little Pieces when you were like 13?

71
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,320
Yeah when I was like, yeah, maybe even younger.

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,320
Oprah recommended it, of course he was gonna read it.

73
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,120
Yeah, I was part of the book club.

74
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,720
No, my big brother was into like any book that was like,

75
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,720
like, what's that other one?

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,320
Perks of Being a Wallflower?

77
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,620
Like any book about like a sad, got a sad white guy, like,

78
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,520
selling drugs.

79
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,620
A Million Little Pieces and Perks of Being a...

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,920
Those are two very different books.

81
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,120
No, they do stuff in the book.

82
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,920
What do they do?

83
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,520
They have sex and they do drugs.

84
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:32,920
Yeah, well anything like that my brother was super into and he would make me read

85
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,520
Did he make you read the audiobook?

86
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:43,340
Perks of being a wallflower, man growing up religious must be fucking crazy. It was insane. Yeah. Yeah, it's really weird

87
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:48,500
You didn't grow up religious at all. No. Well, yeah, I read Master of the Senate

88
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,280
Yeah, perks of being a wallflower for me, I mean it was like it was like

89
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,940
Discovering like the clash. Yeah

90
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:57,940
I was like wow, there's this whole other world

91
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:02,320
that like I had no idea existed discovering guys who were a bit you

92
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,900
were basically discovering being too into the Smiths yeah a hundred percent yeah I

93
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:13,000
yeah no I watched perks of being a wallflower when it was like I forget what

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,860
situation I watched it in it seems like one of those movies it's just like on in

95
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,980
someone's house that no one cares to turn off yeah it must have been one of

96
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,740
those and I was like who the fuck is this movie for and yeah no people who grew up

97
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,740
religious that makes sense absolutely people who grew up religious who like are

98
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,620
trying to rebel against their parents but that's somehow the movie they need

99
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:37,900
it well they need to do it in their brain right they're too scared to do it they

100
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,100
can't they can't rebel actually but like in their head they're like I'm fucking

101
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,980
yeah I need somebody to do drugs for me exactly it's drugs by proxy exactly I

102
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:51,980
would that would be a good book if he just started acting like Morrissey

00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,980
The most racist kid in high school?

104
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,480

Just saying like Chinese people are barbarians and shit like that.

107
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,600
When did he start being so racist?

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,420
He's was racist, like he said, I think, 2012 he said something about

110
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,920
He specifically...

153
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:35,640

and me and Brian Quinby from Street Fight like went to the gas station to

155
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,000
cigarettes or some shit and I showed the woman at the gas station my ID and she's

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,360
just like one of those in tri-state goblins.

157
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,360
There you go honey.

158
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,560

Oh yeah Ross.

160
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Mike Wazowski you haven't filed your paperwork.

161
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,960
She looked at my ID and was like you're 27?

162
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,960
"Ugh, that's a rough 27."

163
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
(laughter)

164
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,960
And to be fair, at the time, I didn't know what face wash was or anything, but it's like,

165
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
"Come on."

166
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
Like, you were like,

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,960
actually lived years of their life in Delaware.

169
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
But I took it. I didn't have to hide it.

170
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
I was just like, "What am I gonna do?"

171
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,960
Well, also, I have such a reverence for just like, service workers,

172
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
'cause I'm such a good guy. I'll take a lot of shit.

173
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,800
lot of shit today we went to some diner the Red Arrow Diner oh yeah yeah yeah

174
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:40,720
Manchester Red Arrow Diner with them, San Luberto. It's now the Sirius XM Red Arrow

175
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,200
Diner. Sirius XM bought it. Yeah. It's fucking insane. After they kicked out Opie and Anthony they picked up the Red Arrow Diner.

176
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,520
They needed something more racist. So I walked in and I I was like I ordered to

177
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:58,800
go and I was like yeah it'll be to go and she like didn't acknowledge it or

178
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,560
anything so a couple minutes later I was like yeah that's to go by the way and

179
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:12,000
she was like yeah I know like you seem very excited to tell me I wanted to spit

180
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,380
in her face but I was like yeah okay 25% I'm going to get the biggest tip of your

181
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:22,680
life I mean she deserves it yeah is that just a Manchester thing no they have they

182
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,480
have a new location so the red arrow was a Manchester thing and then it got like

183
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,660
too famous because every politician went there so now they have to put red arrows

184
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:35,240
and like fucking Portsmouth. They have a pretty fucked up picture of Hillary in

185
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,380
that. Oh they have like the most fucked up picture of Hillary. It's like her face is

186
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:44,760
completely washed out. Like if you like wanted to convince me of Hillary being

187
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,240
like an actual reptilian you would have to show me that picture and that gif of

188
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,640
her being surprised. Yeah she looks transparent. Yeah no yeah I totally see it yeah. Oh no I

189
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,480
I meant like service workers like that because I feel like...

190
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:57,980
Oh, being shitty?

191
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,480
Yeah.

192
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,980
That's a New Hampshire thing.

193
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,480
Yeah.

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,980
Yeah.

195
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,240
Or just New England in general.

196
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,740
New England.

197
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,240
Yeah.

198
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,000
My mom does that.

199
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,400
New England is like...

200
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:12,400
The only place I went where people didn't seem like that bad of a mood all the time,

201
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,440
weirdly enough, was Boston.

202
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,040
Yeah.

203
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,540
Boston is...

204
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,480
Well, Boston everyone keeps to themselves.

205
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,540
I mean, Boston you just have like nice, rich Chinese people.

206
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,040
Yeah.

207
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,680
Like there's like...

208
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,480
No, you don't have the like white trash of New Hampshire.

209
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,140
- Oh my God, the best.

210
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,240
- The best white trash.

211
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,440
- Best white trash is Hampton Beach.

212
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:34,020
Hampton Beach are like a really rich suburb in like Auburn.

213
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,860
- Yeah.

214
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,760
- Those are like the most like white,

215
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,520
they're like cosplaying white trash though.

216
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,360
They're white trash and then they went up.

217
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,200
- Yeah.

218
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,020
- And then they got rich

219
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:42,860
'cause their landscaping company

220
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:45,160
got fucking bought out or something.

221
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,280
- Yeah, the landscaping company with the logo.

222
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,760
- With the Looney Tunes.

223
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,680
With the Looney Tunes on the side of the truck.

224
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,280
- That's a big thing here apparently.

225
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:56,000
every landscaping company has a Speedy Gonzales

226
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
as their landscaping logo.

227
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,840
- Yeah.

228
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,660
- Nothing to do with landscaping.

229
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,480
- To show how fast they are at landscaping or something.

230
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,040
- But also the other one had Elmer Fudd.

231
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,640
- Yeah, Elmer Fudd and Taz.

232
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,480
- What is that supposed to insinuate?

233
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
- Elmer Fudd was very rarely successful

234
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,320
at any of his tasks.

235
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,160
- Exactly, why would you use him as like,

236
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,980
- Oh, there was one.

237
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,920
- Or as good as Elmer Fudd is at hunting

238
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,400
with that for landscaping.

239
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,560
It's like he famously never killed the rabbit.

240
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,960
- There was a septic company that used to do

241
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,000
like the like that used to like empty the septic tanks and shit in my like

242
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,800
childhood neighborhood that had Yosemite Sam on the side of it

243
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,440
Elmer Fudd would be a good mascot for like a like a Teflon company that like

244
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,840
dump stuff in the water and they're like this is what we turn people into yeah we

245
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:45,880
make people into Elmer Fudd. Yeah I don't know yeah I think that must be why I

246
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,240
like Boston because most of my interactions in New York are with rich

247
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,920
Chinese people. Yeah. Just from like where I live. Like far out in Queens. Like that's...

248
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,480
Exactly. Yeah, no, it's a good way... One of the best types of guy you can be in New England.

249
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,360
I, um... Definitely. They all work in like, like, uh... Oh, shit.

250
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:13,920
Bio-pharmaceutical technology or some shit. Yeah, same with my area. Yeah, it's like,

251
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,280
you know what like it's good going yeah probably better than rich americans were in china like 120

252
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:27,760
years ago yeah they're not showing us for yeah for opium yeah exactly yeah not yet yeah no we might

253
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,240
know we're doing that ourselves in new england yeah we're killing ourselves with opiates they're

254
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:38,080
just killing themselves for opiates yeah yeah uh yeah if the time comes i think it would be

255
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:43,840
that could be the next phase of my life being a traitor a traitor you think so yeah yeah

256
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,360
like it is you know

257
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,560
no no a traitor

258
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,640
like uh...

259
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,140
uh... between my country all i think you know i got a i_d_ i think it'll be in

260
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,520
truth and others without thinking to as it would you do you like an opium

261
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,040
trader and like that like middle like pittsburgh what level of trader we

262
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,160
talking

263
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,000
uh... i would you know i mean like

264
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,840
chelsea manning alike colin kaepernick like young that

265
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:09,800
i thought i had one holiday i forget that i thought that i thought that

266
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,720
Yeah, the lowest being Chelsea Manning.

267
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,960
I is going to go with Kaepernick.

268
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:19,520
Yeah, I would do the thing where it's like I'm just their local proxy and I tell them

269
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:23,280
who to bribe and open up opium shipping routes.

270
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,560
Damn, that'd be genius.

271
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,440
That might be a good line of work for you.

272
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:35,920
And then like, yeah, probably 60 years down the line, we become communist and my grandchildren

273
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,880
get killed in a cultural revolution.

274
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:44,000
yeah that's the circle of life we go to China we go to like we go back to China

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,560
and do the opium wars yeah again and again and again over we're living the

276
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,920
same 180 years over and over again except now we have like cooler guns and

277
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,640
shit we have like John wick stuff yeah nowadays soldiers would be on their

278
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:01,560
phones all day exactly now it's on your gun yeah gang is Khan would be like gang

279
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,560
Genghis on his phone. Genghis console.

280
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:09,560
That's what his name would be now. That's right.

281
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,560
You doing alright Cameron?

282
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,560
Yeah, Cameron's taking this episode off because he's sick.

283
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,560
He's been, there's a succubus taking him down.

284
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Cameron ate too much Red Arrow and he got the...

285
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,560
That is true. Yeah, you got the Dina, or you got the Queen Mo.

286
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,060
These fucking Nazis serve beans with breakfast, dude, and they're delicious.

287
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,060
That's the fucked part. That's the most... that's the worst part of it.

288
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,560
Oh, they do it Anglo style there?

289
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,560
Yeah, man.

290
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,060
Yeah, they do, like, English breakfasts here.

291
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,060
How fucking... as an American... talk about a traitor.

292
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:43,560
Uh-huh.

293
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,060
Beans for breakfast.

294
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,060
I think...

295
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,060
Double Kaepernick.

296
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Oh, my...

297
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
Exactly.

298
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,060
Don't even say two Kaepernicks, dude. You're gonna make me flip my lid.

299
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,560
I don't know if you've seen my haircut.

300
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,060
That's two D's on the ground.

301
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,560
Two D's on the ground.

302
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
Yeah, and he's praying to Allah.

303
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:01,560
(Laughter)

304
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
(Laughter)

305
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,560
No!

306
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
God damn.

307
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
That would be a good Jack Ryan movie.

308
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
He has to prevent Colin Kaepernick from

309
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
(Laughter)

310
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
One full prayer to Allah during a football game

311
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
or it will ruin football.

312
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
(Laughter)

313
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
Damn.

314
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Yeah, I fucking...

315
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
Is that still going on? Is he still trying to do football?

316
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,720
Colin Kaepernick? Yeah. I think so. Good for him man. Yeah. My grandpa's not gonna let

317
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,200
him I'll tell you that much. Yeah I know. He'll fucking stand in the tunnel of

318
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:39,280
whatever team it is and body block them. My grandpa is so racist but only about sports like

319
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,320
outwardly. Like one time he was watching... That's like still like accepted. I mean that's kind of the highest level of racism.

320
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:50,280
True yeah. Like one time he was watching golf and I was at his house and he was

321
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:55,360
he's just watching golf some tournament like the mid 2000s and Tiger Woods was

322
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,040
was up and just completely unsolicited he's watching Tiger Woods play golf he

323
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,200
said you know that guy's only famous cuz he's black

324
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,200
he actually sucks at golf

325
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,200
he's terrible

326
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:14,200
he's terrible also golf famously so welcoming to black guys

327
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,200
so think of golf affirmative action

328
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,200
it's those clubs that only let in black guys

329
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,200
I know, it's crazy dude.

330
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,200
He's going nuts.

331
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,200
Oh the cat's going nuts?

332
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Fucker's going nuts again.

333
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,200
I hate your cats dude.

334
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
I'm back to hating them now that I'm seeing them again.

335
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
This is our first time seeing each other in months.

336
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,200
Yeah.

337
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,200
We're very excited.

338
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,200
I think, who had their balls in your face last night?

339
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Was it Yoda or Fucker?

340
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,200
It was you.

341
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
It was me?

342
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,200
Yeah.

343
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Oh yeah.

344
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,200
They don't have balls.

345
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,200
They don't have balls.

346
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,200
They have a little cashew between their legs.

347
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,200
It's not a cashew dude.

348
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,200
It looks like a cashew.

349
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,200
It's an empty balloon.

350
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,320
There's nothing in it.

351
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,800
I've always wondered this, like, how did you decide to get, like, that's, cause like I've

352
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,840
never seen anyone with that breed of cat.

353
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
The Sphinx cats?

354
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,840
Yeah, Sphinx.

355
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,840
Yeah.

356
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,840
How did that come to be?

357
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
I just liked them.

358
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,280
Cause he has fucking fetal alcohol syndrome, what do you mean?

359
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:06,720
That's why I made that decision.

360
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,000
I just wanted a cat that looked like Caleb.

361
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,520
Oh, come on.

362
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
I just missed him.

363
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,520
No.

364
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,560
They're cool, like, how did you find them?

365
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:16,560
Just like a shelter.

366
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,560
The internet.

367
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,300
Yeah, isn't it like the most expensive kind of cat? I think so. Don't say you're supposed to deny it, dude

368
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,860
I don't say yes to that. You don't you don't have a job

369
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:35,320
Yeah, the pot about list patreon is or the subreddit's about to go crazy about how they're paying for Patrick's cat happy

370
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,660
Yeah, we need to get our subreddit shut down like you did that was genius. Yeah, it's one of the best moves

371
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,040
We've ever it was so smart dude. Oh my they weren't they weren't that expensive. How was that the best day of your life?

372
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:51,160
Honestly, it was something things have been getting better since then I'm not yeah

373
00:17:51,160 --> 00:18:00,760
Much good things so many good things have happened to me since that happened. Yeah, and I can't be a coincidence

374
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,520
That was not getting no seriously like I like I never

375
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,040
read it like I I

376
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:15,400
Think I had like just a low level of like just ambient annoyance with it existing like the idea of it was like Israel to me

377
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,400
like I first got mad about Israel as a child because it was like you're doing

378
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,320
this in my name and I felt the same thing seeing people post like shitty memes

379
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:30,340
where it's like 10 paragraphs of text and then gritty with the AK-47 I was like in

380
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,920
my name. Because you feel like it's your fault, like you should feel responsible

381
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,400
for Israel you also felt responsible for the Chappatrap subreddit. I feel responsible for it too.

382
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:53,480
yeah all white people should I know this really big streamer on twitch trainer oh

389
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,260
doxing each other swatting each other yeah everyone their articles about how

390
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:34,600
bad their fan bases are and I was the only one whose subreddit had been shut

391
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:45,280
down. That rules. I'm trying to kind of navigate my way into where you are

392
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,680
where I'm trying to become a pro pro gamer as well as a podcaster I feel like

393
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:54,640
that's a sweet spot. Yeah I mean well like you you're starting like eight years

394
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,960
before I did so like you getting worse every day. It is funny learning

395
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,100
It's funny learning like, it's funny that Counter-Strike pros have a, it's like

396
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:12,300
basketball like once you turn 26 you go way down. What's your FaZe Clan name?

397
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:16,420

398
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:27,980
Mr. Awesome. Is that good? What about FaZe Mr. Clean? I don't know any of them. I know FaZe Blaze, FaZe Swag, FaZe One.

399
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:29,980
I was on Scuffed with Faze Swag.

400
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,980
You told me that's one of the funniest things you've ever said to me.

401
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,980
You were on a podcast about, was it about like racial politics?

402
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,980
Yeah, with Swag.

403
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
He's a very nice young man.

404
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,980
He rocks, dude.

405
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,980
Yeah, he's great at Call of Duty.

406
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
He's fucking awesome at Warzone, yeah.

407
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,980
I do think it's funny though, just like,

408
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
do you know Hiko, the old CS pro?

409
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,980
Oh yeah, Hiko's like 30, and the only reason, like,

410
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,980
he's an amazing player and has like

411
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:58,460
like amazing game sense and shit but it

412
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,300
would be hard for a 30 year old to win

413
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,820
consistently a Counter-Strike. The only guy

414
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,500
I know of who's like 30-31 who did

415
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,860

he made that name in like high school and

418
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:13,300
just couldn't change it. That's the fucked up

419
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,340
part about all these pro gamers is

420
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,660
that in like high school they were like

421
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,220

I'm on an NBC show and I'm a furious destroyer. I'm credited in a movie.

424
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:33,540
I love the gamer names where it's like they just heard a word and they're like

425
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:40,820
that's a gun word. FaZe Panopticon. Yeah, the guys here name like Panopticon

427
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:55,020
when I was when I was like 14 and I made like a Steam account I named my Steam

00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:58,780
name was Sci Theory.

429
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:08,900
It's just get this it's a it's a combination of psychology and theory.

430
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,580
I don't know man. That's how you know you're a gamer but you're also thoughtful. Exactly I was yeah I was a

431
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:18,420
mentalist. I'm thinking about my next move in the game. Yeah I'm always ten steps ahead of the

432
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:32,220
competition them in their head theory did you have an embarrassing gamer name I I

433
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:37,140

445
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:54,020
It's been really cool to watch me go from Jim watch Jim Blunt go

446
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,660
Yeah, there's nothing like fucking team chat in a video game. Yeah, cuz you just always get a kid like that

447
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:13,860
I like I've been getting I've been solo queuing CS a lot. No one talks to me because my name is always like

448
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:16,520
the gay guy

449
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,880
Became so funny to me it is

452
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,960
It's still wargers, which is another thing of just like a combination of

453
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,640
What are you need another beer? I do

454
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,940
It's a combination of what just a combination of things that I did. There's sounds I put together

455
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,840
Well, that's the highest level highest level of gamer is like just random sounds. Yeah, right

456
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:56,400
For example, like sci-theory, you know what I mean? Like this is genius three random syllables thrown together. Hmm

457
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
Yeah, I mean

458
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,240
Opening that oh you got it. Okay?

459
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:08,280
Yeah, all the really good CS players now are just like gorlocks and smack. Yeah, my favorite

460
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,920
There's a valorant pros name is just food. Oh, yeah

461
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,880
Food is really these are really good players. He's great

462
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:20,620
Yeah, there's a valorant streamer. I see all the time. That's just Wardell that were tells me out

463
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,140
I love it. I keep why it's Brandon Wardell

464
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,760
I keep thinking it's Braden Wardell playing Valorant and shit.

465
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,520
Dude, Wardell, he owns, dude.

466
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,720
Yeah, I've seen a couple of his games.

467
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
I've heard that he was like not a very good...

468
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,720
This is for nobody, by the way. This is just for us.

469
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,520
I know.

470
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,480
I know, right?

471
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,360
Wardell was like a... He was not a very good Counter-Strike player,

472
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,360
but he's great on Valorant.

473
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:44,080
Well, yeah, I mean like...

474
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,240
Valorant... Again, this is also...

475
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,640
It's for bad... It's for bad CS players.

476
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,880
I know you think this, Felix. Come on.

477
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
I... Well, it depends... I mean, Braxton "Swag" Pearce

478
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,920
was gonna be like the American,

479
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,960
God damn, this is really for no one.

480
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,800
- I know. - He's gonna be

481
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,360
the American simple,

482
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,320
but then there was the match throwing scandal

483
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,560
and he's like, he's very good.

484
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,360
There are a lot of like great CS players

485
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
who are there just for different circumstances.

486
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,720
- Nitro just switched over to Valorant.

487
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,560
- Yeah. - Whoa.

488
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,560
- Yeah, so that'll be huge.

489
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,560
Let's get off video games.

490
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,040
- Yeah. - Let's get off like

491
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,120
very specific pro scenes in video games.

492
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,760
- I know, yeah, it's insane.

493
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
I mean, it's funny 'cause to me,

494
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,220
like I was never into any sort of like competitive gaming until Valorant

495
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,600
because it was like it was the only game that I played with a competitive scene

496
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,680
because I just grew up playing like Halo and shit and I never was aware of like

497
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,120
any sort of Halo pro scene although I guess Ninja was like a Halo pro right?

498
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,320
He was yeah no a lot of those guys who like blew up in the last three years were

499
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,880
big-time Halo guys or like Gears of War guys. That makes sense. Like games you would never think had a

500
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,900
competitive scene. Yeah, Gears of War having a competitive scene is insane.

501
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,900
Saints Row 3 competitive scene.

502
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,900
Who can be the funniest shit in Saints Row the third?

503
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,900
Tildo bats only.

504
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Tildo bats only rounded in fucking...

505
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,900
What's that? Oh, I thought it was gonna say Port Carverton, but that's Skate 3.

506
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,900
Yeah, you're wrong. Is there a competitive skate scene?

507
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,900
There is a competitive Skate 3 scene.

508
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,900
That sucks, dude. Yeah.

509
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,900
That shit gives me so much anxiety. Like, whenever I would read

510
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:22,340
the former Gears of War pro, I would just think of the economics of being a Gears of War pro.

511
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:26,340
It's like, what's the most, if you're like the ninja of Gears of War, what did you make?

512
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Like $18,000 a year?

513
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:35,260
No, dude, you made like $400 bucks and won first place in the world.

514
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,740
You're the greatest of all time.

515
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,500
Every Gears of War competitive match is probably just a giveaway.

516
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,500
It's fucked up.

517
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:46,860
It's fucked up because if the truth is, to be the greatest player in the world, you have

518
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:51,260
at any video game, it takes as many hours as like becoming an engineer.

519
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:51,760
Yeah.

520
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,460
You know what I mean?

521
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,760
And like, and if you were the greatest engineer in the world, you'd be a millionaire.

522
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,060
But if you're the best at fucking playing like...

523
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:02,660
Conker's Bad Fur Day, you're not making any money.

524
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,160
Right.

525
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:06,160
It just, it gives me severe anxiety.

526
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,760
Like when I see like, I like watched some YouTube clip of like,

527
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
this is the Gears of War tournament in like 2007 or something,

528
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,060
like the major of Gears of War.

529
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:20,540
And it's like basically sharing floor space with like, you know,

530
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,260
like it's all in for fans of Law and Order.

531
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,300
Yeah, yeah.

532
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,500
It's one conference hall.

533
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,020
It's at a family guy meetup.

534
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:28,460
Yeah.

535
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,740
It's more competitive.

536
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:35,620
It's like the fucking Yeah, it's the the dream hack of Gears of War.

537
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:40,380
And it's like, if you spent 12 hours a day, six or seven days a

538
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:48,220
week playing like yeah Kane and Lynch until you like you didn't learn anything

539
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:52,420
else like when you turn 28 and you're like oh my reflexes are too bad to play

540
00:28:52,420 --> 00:29:00,060
this game yeah like all right time to be a lawyer yeah well but you but you got a

541
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,380
lot of pussy that's the truth yeah you went up to you and I was a girls at the

542
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:08,500
at the at the bar and you were like yeah I'm actually the number two player in

543
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:13,500
conflict desert storm in the entire world so you might want to watch my penis right

544
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:20,260
now I'm gonna look out for that I'm gonna look out for my penis blow up I have c4

545
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:24,100
strength to it what's even worse is like the people who play pro games and they're

546
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,020
just sport sports games oh like that's the bad and competitive UFC game

547
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:36,220
competitive - shit so sick dude I always feel like I have like a twinge of

548
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,920
sadness for those guys because it's just like it's like when they make a wire mom

549
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:48,340
for monkeys it's like oh it's like so close yet so far to being a pro football

550
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:53,080
player. Exactly yeah it's like well I'm amazing at imagining being Bo Jackson in

551
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,500
my head right you know like I'm so good at that. They should just give them

552
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,740
coaching jobs honestly. No.

553
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
They would.

554
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,260
What we need to do here is press X four times.

555
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:07,100
In this match.

556
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,340
I'm gonna need you guys, look, I'm gonna...

557
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,380
Talk about some guys who'd be anti-Colin Kaepernick.

558
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:19,380
I think the pro Madden gamers maybe is the number one anti-Colin Kaepernick constituency.

559
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,380
Yeah.

560
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:28,380
I guess the same argument can be made for competitive Tony Hawk players.

561
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,380
Yeah.

562
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:36,180
yeah I was like no shit do more of them skateboard that then the best there's

563
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:41,220
not a single Madden pro that plays football like flats the trail now like

564
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,540
in a league of children oh they were all like amazing at Tetris and then they

565
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,460
stopped making money off Tetris and they're like I'll just play this instead

566
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,020
it's true yeah you know I'm playing it so I should do it I mean that's the

567
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:53,140
nature of competitive gaming is that every game except for stuff like

568
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,060
Counter-Strike or League has like a year and a half of like competitive peak and

569
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,300
and then they all move to a different game.

570
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,140
- It's true. - Yeah.

571
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:00,980
- You know, so they have to constantly--

572
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:02,820
- Right, 'cause you can't, like, it's not like no one's,

573
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,860
like, you can be the best at, like, Madden 2012.

574
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:08,380
- But Madden 2013, they put an extra button in,

575
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,220
they put a juke in there.

576
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,540
- They made a whole new soundtrack.

577
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,300
They got Mellow Hype on the soundtrack.

578
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,860
- You gotta get used to the soundtrack, yeah.

579
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,140
- That would be the worst thing.

580
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,740
You have to keep buying Madden,

581
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,500
and for like 90% of Madden pros, does it even,

582
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,300
are you even, like, coming out ahead?

583
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,700
Are you breaking even on buying Madden?

584
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:31,640
60 bucks. The 70 bucks with the pre-order and the like fucking sticker that you get

585
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,800
with it? No, definitely not. This could be like my most stereotypical trait but I just get so

586
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:42,840
much I get economic anxiety for other people thinking about their jobs.

587
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,120
That's the most Jewish thing you've ever seen. You're just thinking about

588
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:56,120
the the Epoch Times writers and you're just like oh yeah yeah when I see

589
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,640
someone who like works for OANN I'm like oh his retirement accounts in shambles

590
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:10,040
I can't I can't say it's like I have the they live glasses for that stuff yeah

591
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,840
actually that's the second most Jewish thing you've ever said to me the first

592
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,080
was in Call of Duty warzone you said I'm great at sniffing out money in this game

593
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,920
And then the fucked up part is there was a time where everybody on our team died except Felix

594
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,520
and in like 90 seconds he bought the whole team back dude.

595
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:32,600
I did buy, I bought 14k in like 90 seconds.

596
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,320
It was the most, like directly after he said he was great at finding money in the game.

597
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,320
I found 14k.

598
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,080
It was crazy, he was like skipping over crates he knew had nothing in them.

599
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,560
He was like, I can just tell dude.

600
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,240
- We should get Felix into the competitive

601
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,520
deal or no deal for DSC.

602
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,120
(laughing)

603
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:52,960
- It would be great.

604
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,360
It would be great on a game show.

605
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,200
- Yeah.

606
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,040
- Yeah.

607
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,200
- No, all this, my entire media career,

608
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,440
has been leading up to deal or no deal

609
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,560
coming back and me getting on there.

610
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,440
- Is it gone?

611
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,520
I didn't even realize it was gone.

612
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,480
- Yeah.

613
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,320
- Oh my God, dude.

614
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,160
- Yeah, Howie Mandel hasn't been doing,

615
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:10,560
he got the fucking, he got whatever that show is.

616
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
It's not The Voice, it's the other one.

617
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,000
- Howie Mandel?

618
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,820
- America's Got Talent.

619
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,760
- That was forever ago, dude.

620
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,080
Howie Mandel was doing them at the same time. He's doing them both at some point?

621
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,320
Yeah. Damn that is why they call him the hardest working man in show business.

622
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,320
It's true. Yeah it's funny that he won't shake a man's hand. Yeah. Kind of sus

623
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:34,360
Howie. Yeah. It's kind of sus to shake a man's hand let's just... No. Nah. Nah that's respect.

624
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:38,640
Yeah exactly. No respect is the straightest thing you can have for another

625
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,200
man. It's when it bleeds into into something else that's that's when you

626
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Yeah, Howie Mandel.

627
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
If the pinkies touch.

628
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,800
If the pinkies up while you shake the hand, that's us.

629
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,800
Yeah.

630
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,800
Yeah.

631
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,400
Cause then what is it, like a beverage to you?

632
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,400
What are you drinking?

633
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,400
What's this, a beverage?

634
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,400
You gonna drink me?

635
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,400
Huh?

636
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
You gonna lift me up?

637
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,400
Yeah, big guy.

638
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:04,920
Do you guys know anybody who's ever on a game show?

639
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,680
Just by odds, I got it, right?

640
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
I mean like...

641
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Yeah, right, at some point.

642
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:11,040
Yeah, I actually know Watson from IBM.

643
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
Yeah.

644
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,040
We're close friends.

645
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,120
I mean like I guess I think being Ken Jennings follow each other

646
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,320
That's not really like knowing someone. I guess true

647
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:21,640
Yeah

648
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:27,220
My dad was on some game show in the 90s and this was back when you make like if you win the game show you make

649
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,880
$600 yeah, you know and I think they might they asked him like it was all like

650
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,160
They would show him like a stop sign and they'd be like if you're on the road

651
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,760
What do you do when you see this sign and he got him? All right, he's perfect until the end

652
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,580
they asked him some like science question they like showed him like an equation

653
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:51,720
they were like solve this they knew he was getting too close yeah they couldn't

654
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,760
lose 600 bucks back then that was like the most the show had ever made on cable

655
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,240
TV manufactured the wheel yeah I had to sell the wheel to pay my fucking dad but

656
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,360
that is the reason my parents got divorced my mom brings it up constantly

657
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:09,200
really she's like yeah my life would have been different if your dad had won the

658
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,200
The final question was about child support.

659
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,200
[laughter]

660
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,200
My parents were in a situation where they knew each other too well

661
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,200
to really even care if they paid each other child support.

662
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,200
They were just like, "Eh, pay it when you can, I guess."

663
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,200
That's the only reason it worked out.

664
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,200
My dad does not have a job.

665
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Yeah. Yeah. No, he just he runs an illegal poker room and a storage unit.

666
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,440
That's that's that is what that's worked.

667
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,960
And then he launders the money through a construction company.

668
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,320
Cool job.

669
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,920
You should see it, dude, because when I was a kid, I used to have to like put

670
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,600
Fritos in the fucking pantry at the poker room.

671
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,960
It's not that cool.

672
00:35:55,960 --> 00:36:00,160
No, I mean, it's it's not like it's mostly direct TV.

673
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,960
That's why people come. Yeah. Yeah.

674
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,640
Who gets invited? Like it's like I'm seeing like a lower level poker game.

675
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:13,880
Yeah, there are high level legal poker games. But so like, it's like David's game.

676
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:18,440
Toe for Grace is there.

677
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,960
The people that would go there would be like the guy who won salesman of the month at the

678
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,120
Kia dealership. Yeah, right. The big ballers in Wilmington, North Carolina.

679
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:31,240
Gambling with fucking gift cards that they wanted a call center.

680
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Yeah, Blockbuster gift cards.

681
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,240
Yeah.

682
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,240
I had an aunt, I still have an aunt, she's alive, makes you rest in peace, Aunt Phyllis.

683
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:45,320
She would, until maybe two years ago, every year she would give me a $15 Blockbuster gift

684
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,320
card.

685
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
And it was after Blockbuster closed.

686
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,480
So she just had them?

687
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:54,060
Apparently she stocked up for 10 years with Blockbuster gift cards for every niece and

688
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,060
nephew she had.

689
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,060
Damn.

690
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,060
And she kept them in a drawer.

691
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:01,860
She was just giving, she had no awareness that Blockbuster had been closed for like 10 years.

692
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,300
Well there's still like one open, you could have gone to Alaska.

693
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:06,300
I could have gone to Alaska, that's a great point.

694
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Yeah.

695
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,660
I don't know if it was valid in all 50 states.

696
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,660
Oh that's true.

697
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,660
Yeah.

698
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,660
I had to find out.

699
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,220
Do you still have them?

700
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,940
I mean probably, like I mean it's just for breaking into houses now.

701
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Yeah.

702
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,420
You know, just figuring out how to jimmy a lock.

703
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,780
That's what the Blockbuster gift card has become.

704
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
That's true.

705
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,060
Do you see how they tried to do like a...

706
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:28,060
The 90s room?

707
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:32,460
No, they did like a thing on Twitter where they got on the Blockbuster official account

708
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:35,700
and they were like, "Oh yeah, we've been chilling."

709
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,700
Yeah.

710
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,700
Or whatever, like six days ago.

711
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,460
That was for the Airbnb in Seattle.

712
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,620
There's a 90s themed Blockbuster Airbnb.

713
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,620
That's horrifying.

714
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:46,620
I know.

715
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,860
The worst part about that tweet was like every brand from the 90s, just like Chuck E. Cheese

716
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:57,100
and dominoes commented under it and they were like oh bro we miss you

717
00:37:57,100 --> 00:38:06,040
my dick dude it was insane yeah it's horrible I just guess you know they

718
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:09,980
don't have like the blockbuster gift the blockbuster Twitter account also has

719
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:17,300
like 9,000 followers yeah even like when Twitter started like in like 2008 it's

720
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,300
Yeah, and nobody cares.

721
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,800
No.

722
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,800
I don't give a shit.

723
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Not at all.

724
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I, um, I had a flashback to like one of the most annoying-

725
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
You know like when there's just like a-

726
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,300
It's like a hall of mirrors of people being annoying?

727
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Where like-

728
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:37,800
Wendy's, like, Wendy's made some like, you know,

729
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:42,300
It's good, just like, if you're gay and want to eat at Wendy's, cool.

730
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,300
You know, because-

731
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,300
This don't eat the bacon it might, the baconator might turn you straight.

732
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,300
You might want to be careful.

733
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:52,300
I know you don't want to piss off Allah.

734
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:57,300
These gay guys, they definitely don't want to piss off Allah.

735
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,300
But they, yeah, they had some dumb shit tweet like that.

736
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:11,300
And then like, the, like, you know, people who were like, guillotine Ray Jepsen were like, pay your workers more, my bitch.

737
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,500
And then the woman who ran the Wendy's account was like,

738
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,780
"I think it's interesting that Bernie supporters are targeting Wendy's,

739
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,900
which is one of the only brands identifiable as a woman."

740
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,820
[Laughter]

741
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,320
What?

742
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:31,460
Oh my god, dude. The psychosis these people are fucking experiencing on a daily basis.

743
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:37,060
That's what every day in 2017 was like. Like Trump just made people so annoying all the time.

744
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,420
Just made them crazy, dude.

745
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:43,320
Yeah, fucking come and go the gas station has a tick tock account

746
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:48,720
Dude, nice. Oh, what the fuck? What about come and see tick tock account? Yeah

747
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,840
Be pretty funny. Yeah. All right now we got something cooking

748
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,520
When mom makes an idea work and it's the guy crying

749
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,860
That's right, yeah now I'm excited for

750
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,560
Just all of it just to relive every moment of 2017 again next year. Oh my god. It's gonna be amazing

751
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:15,400
If Trump what I mean, that's if Trump wins, but if Biden wins we'll have like a reverse 2017. What do you think?

752
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:20,160
What's your predictions? Um, it's just like we roll we roll everything back to like

753
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,280
2009 like Michael Ian black just like

754
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,160
Breaks out of a cocoon. Yeah, like you see like he has one treat. It's like

755
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,900
January 19th or whatever the day before inauguration is is like, you know guys

756
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,160
For all the pain and suffering that happens in this country

757
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:45,640
We believe that America could truly be as great as the founder said it would be but for POC

758
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,720
for disabled people for blah blah and then the tweet the next day is like

759
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:53,720
I'm dumb sucking disabled dick in the Holocaust

760
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:57,520
How come how who

761
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,620
What baby do I have to rape to get some sweet low

762
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:13,100
They're gonna bring back Michael and Michael have issues when by the yeah, they will absolutely back Michael and Michael have issues

763
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:19,140
They're gonna bring back human giant. They're gonna bring. Yeah. Oh dude Aziz is getting uncanceled. Yeah, he's coming back

764
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:25,080
Oh my god, every as soon as Biden gets elected people would be like Aziz. You're such a hero for fucking that annoying woman

765
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
(laughter)

766
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Thank God!

767
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:33,080
Aziz, for doing that move with your fingers, we've now decided that that's cool and that we're gonna like that.

768
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Dude, we've now decided you're just chill as hell, dude.

769
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,080
Where's Wiz Khalifa? We gotta get Wiz Khalifa back.

770
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,080
There's like a parade right after inauguration.

771
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,080
For Aziz?

772
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:48,080
Yeah, for like, the people that walk out of Biden's limo are like,

773
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,080
Tyga, Aziz, Crystalia.

774
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,080
(laughter)

775
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:54,080
Hey, they're back!

776
00:41:54,080 --> 00:42:00,320
Chris DeLea is doing his face again! Dude, he's epic, oh my god. Yeah we get like-

777
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:03,740
Oh my god Joe Biden, thank you so much! We get like old school memes back, we get

778
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:07,760
Philosoraptor back. Oh my god, we're gonna have socially awkward penguin at the

779
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,120
dais of the uh, of the roasts that are coming back. Jeff Ross is coming back.

780
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:17,400
Greg Giraldo's coming back to life. Greg Giraldo's coming back to life. And he's gonna roast the socially awkward penguin.

781
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:22,600
He's gonna destroy him in court. Oh my god. Oh man, every meme will be about how Justin

782
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,640
beavers gay and a girl. Yes. Oh, which is true. We're gonna bring back his haircut.

783
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,640
Yeah, the bowl cut. The bowl cut. It became the k-pop haircut. It did.

784
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:36,440
Yeah. I don't think it's gonna be like that extreme but like it is

785
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:41,560
like... You don't think so? You don't think Greg Geraldo's gonna happen? Well I think that will happen.

786
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:46,640
Okay. Everything else. I do think there's gonna be a rollback on a

787
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,800
lot of stuff because like every, like if you have like liberal parents, they've

788
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:55,120
gotten hyper engaged since Trump but the promise of Biden is like hey you don't

789
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:58,640
have to pay attention to this shit again yeah so every everyone whose job is to

790
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,080
like write about like the Paris commune for Condé Nast that like the second

791
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,880
that bite his hand touches that Bible it's gonna be like well you're done

792
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,160
that's how it is like that's how it is like the we did this thing for a G the

793
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:17,800
company genius in 2016 we're like we would just take like shitty news articles

794
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,680
and like be really mean to the writers. That's funny. And the day, literally it was during

795
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:26,760
Trump's inauguration, they were like, "Oh yeah, we just don't have it in the budget for this anymore."

796
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,160
Like that's how quick it moves. Like, well, you know that Biden's not going to be putting

797
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,960
his hand on a Bible, you know it's going to be a Quran. Oh yeah, for sure. For sure. It's going

798
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:43,480
to be a Corona. That's right. Yeah. I pledge allegiance to the beer. Yeah, I'm fucking,

799
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,120
I hope that that happens.

800
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,120
Yeah, that would be sick, dude.

801
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,120
We get, uh...

802
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:53,120
Every mom that's made like a parody song about Trump...

803
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,120
Just evaporates?

804
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
They're just gonna disintegrate.

805
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,120
My mom was not a liberal until Trump.

806
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,120
My mom was a hardline conservative

807
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,120
until she decided Trump was too mean.

808
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,120
Yeah, a bunch of those people are gonna like...

809
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:08,120
Some of them are gonna stay, but like for the most part

810
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,120
there's just not gonna be the cultural space for all that.

811
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,920
and like yeah I hope that slides back because like it's easy it was easier to

812
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,520
make fun of her as a conservative now I just feel like bad for her you know I

813
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:24,160
mean she's like super into Pete Buttigieg it's like god damn it dude like

814
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,560
if you just fucking if you just still like the day that Obama got reelected I

815
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:34,120
walked downstairs and my mom this was her idea of a cheeky joke she was like hey

816
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:40,360
son welcome to the US long pause SR

817
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:48,020
crazy that those jokes are still being said though I miss that shit dude no

818
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:53,240
like people are doing that about Trump now like people are like oh like every

819
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:56,360
every president you don't like them they're Russian right that's the truth

820
00:44:56,360 --> 00:45:01,720
yeah or never ended I wish I had like that type I only have like one real

821
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:07,640
conservative in my family and I have a neocon uncle. Nice. Hell yeah. So he's like

822
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:13,680
he'll never do like the you know the funny like a bungler stuff but he'll be

823
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:19,520
like um this you this Council on the United Nations that has absolutely no

824
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:22,880
power and has never stopped Israel from doing anything they're actually

825
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,480
anti-semitic and it's like whatever man. Dude the conservative Jew is a that is a

826
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:34,820
a that's the supreme conservative. Oh he's awesome. He's awesome. Like his he just

827
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:39,580
like all he does is like respond to articles that are about like some like

828
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:46,720
academic who died in 1989 and he'd be like why Harold Tuck is still matters in

829
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,160
the face of Jew hating Muslims. Well because conservative Jews get to

830
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,400
do the thing where they mix conservative politics and like liberal like identity

831
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:03,240
politics yeah so they get to be like yeah the war in Iraq was bad but just because

832
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:08,840
it was like kind of annoying for Jews yeah I like I've seen a lot of like

833
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:14,560
conservative Zionists be like do the I'm so tired thing oh I'm so tired of being

834
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,040

838
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:43,640
you can't make it through an entire Shabbos without turning Christian

839
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:53,120
by Caleb. By a man with no hair. My goy tricked me. I'm a Christian with no hair. I wasn't

840
00:46:53,120 --> 00:47:06,600
allowed to turn on the light. It was too dark in my house and he baptized me. So you just

841
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:11,320
have one conservative relative dude? Oh all my relatives are. Well not you, of course

00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,440
to we went to Patrick's aunt's house which is drove by he hasn't been there

844
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:27,120

845
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:31,440
sick dude come on London Dairy hearts are cops and then the heart is the blue

846
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,720
lives matter like next oh that's great I like I had like a lot of friends when I

847
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:41,340
lived in Minnesota or like friends that like were in rural Illinois whose parents

848
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:45,280
were like you know like had Ann Coulter books and shit like that and they would

849
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,440
try to like you know get me into an argument with their parents but the art

850
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,840
like it was just like well I don't like you know like Obama like yeah that's

851
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,800
always the confusing yeah they're like well what do you mean you are a liberal

852
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,120
correct and I fit my beliefs are so like weird that I'm like my main thing is

853
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:08,560
like we need to dissolve NATO and they're like, okay.

854
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:15,720
Sure. I don't know what that is. Is that a video game? Sure. Yeah, it's fine. Yeah, I

855
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:19,080
remember getting in arguments with like, because I grew up I mean, North Carolina,

856
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,120
it was pretty hard to like, go to a friend's house and not get into it. I mean,

857
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:27,640
it's obviously as you can tell, very politically minded young man. And I would

858
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:32,040
go to like my friend, his my friend, Chad, his parents house, and they and I would

859
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,620
argue with them about whether 9/11 was an inside job and that would be that would

860
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:40,860
be my version of a political argument yeah where I'd be like it's somebody did

861
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:48,100
it I don't know my parents are on that tip now yeah my parents are like my mom

862
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:52,600
last time I saw my mom we were talking about new JFK conspiracies Felix is

863
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,120
Jewish you can tell us straight up yeah what's up you guys do it well the thing

864
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:05,400
The thing is, this was like, you know, success has, you know, many parents, but

865
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,160
failure is an orphan. But that's also true of 9/11. A lot of people worked really

866
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:15,040
hard on this. We would love to take credit for all of it, but we couldn't have

867
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,160
done it without the Mormons and the Deep State. Yeah, exactly. You had

868
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:23,600
collaborators, you know. The Mormons had to do it. They had to find the pajamas under the

869
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:26,800
towers. It's like that movie New Year's Eve. It's like so

870
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,400
many people worked on this it's hard to hate right you know what I mean there's

871
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,360
so many big names attached. They got Mr. Bean and Louis Veracon.

872
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:44,600
I like yeah I um my dad was kind of a conspiracy boomer but like in a tongue

873
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:48,480
and cheek like he would yeah he was like he was like one of those liberals that

874
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:53,000
hated the CIA like he remembered like the Church Committee and all this shit

875
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,880
but he was also like, "Bill Clinton's a good president."

876
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:59,040
Like just totally like incongruous liberal boomer beliefs,

877
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,240
but he had like, he had fun with it where he'd be like,

878
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,480
"Yeah, John McCain's a Manchurian candidate,

879
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,880
but they deserve that for what we did to them."

880
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,600
(all laughing)

881
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,840
And it was like, that was like the only guy.

882
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,240
My brother, my sister has really interesting,

883
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,000
like weird contrarian opinions.

884
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,400
I think it's just like,

885
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,880
she's the smartest person in the family.

886
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,920
And I think just like, if you get that spark,

887
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,700
You just, you have to come up with like just insane things that you can argue,

888
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,420
just have fun.

889
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:30,580
But like everyone else is just like, you know, like my, my uncles are like,

890
00:50:30,580 --> 00:50:33,900
really nice. They're really great dudes, but they're also like, you know,

891
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,100
I thought, I thought Julian Castro was electrifying.

892
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,660
And me and my sister are like,

893
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:46,060
the Black Eagle Trust Fund was formed in 1983 with the express purpose of putting

894
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,580
the Knights of Malta in power and then did 9/11.

895
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,020
Yeah, it is funny, like, liberals get so magnetized to politicians.

896
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:03,540
Like, my mom is not, again, she was not a liberal until fucking three years ago, but she went to,

897
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:09,540
she did her master's degree at Walden University, which is an online college that's like bankrolled

898
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:15,460
by the Clintons. And so like every year they have Bill Clinton come be the commencement speaker.

899
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:22,380
And so my mom did her like master's commencement or whatever and she and my

900
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:26,940
mom has always been like Bill Clinton is a rapist piece of shit and then she came

901
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:30,840
back from her trip to Minneapolis and she was like Bill Clinton has the most

902
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,700
electrifying eyes I've ever seen.

903
00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:39,740
She's like something about his yes gravity that pulls you in.

904
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,700
It was the most insane fucking like coin coin turn I've ever seen.

905
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,360
- That is amazing.

906
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:47,200
- Yeah.

907
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,040
- It rocks.

908
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,760
- My neocon uncle got married to like a resist lib.

909
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:52,600
- So nice.

910
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:53,960
- He's been married a bunch of times,

911
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:57,040
but he, she would always like email me,

912
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:59,460
like basically pleading with me to be a normal lib

913
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:03,400
because like I could like, I used to get mad at my uncle,

914
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,260
but like after a point I was like, okay,

915
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:06,720
I'm like not letting him get me mad

916
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:08,520
because his opinions would be so ridiculous.

917
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,920
Like he had this weird thing where he played,

918
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,280
he had this way of saying that like Elliot Spitzer

919
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:19,280
cause the recession in 2008 because he prosecuted AIG.

920
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,200
And after a while, like after I got old enough,

921
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:25,040
I was like, okay, I'm not gonna let that like get me mad.

922
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,880
But his wife, like my aunt would email me and be like,

923
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,160
I wish that you could meet Hillary Clinton

924
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:33,160
to see what a great person she is.

925
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,440
I know you two would get along.

926
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:38,040
And I was like, that's like really nice of you to say,

927
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:40,520
but she's Satan.

928
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:42,720
I actually agree with my uncle, she's Satan.

929
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,200
- Just for different reasons, but like--

930
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,440
- Could you imagine the Hilary Chapo episode?

931
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:47,680
- Would you guys let her, would you,

932
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:51,240
if she said, I wanna come, I wanna chop it up,

933
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:52,920
all right, I want me and Joe Budden to come on the podcast.

934
00:52:52,920 --> 00:52:54,600
- I wanna go to the trap house.

935
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,000
- Yeah, I want us to come, are we gonna squash the beef?

936
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,440
What would you say?

937
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,800
- If she was down to do like a hangout,

938
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,600
like riff on the news episode, yeah,

939
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,080
but not like an interview episode.

940
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,480
- No. - I just don't,

941
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,760
like, I don't know, there are only a few people

942
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,120
who are like good interviews.

943
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:10,960
- Well, we have her right here.

944
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,080
you think she would be good at riffing yeah I think so I think like I mean that

945
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:20,660
you know we came we saw he died riff was pretty good it's pretty good it is

946
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:26,400
truly one of the all-time great riffs yeah I guess you're right

947
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:33,360
what was weird because people were like oh that like the way she laughed on that

948
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,160
proves she's bad and it's like oh we're good what about like all the stuff she

949
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:45,080
did. Who gives a shit? Like, if you're one of those people, if you're an Atlanticist who thinks that

950
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:50,600
NATO should police the world, of course you would think killing Gaddafi is an objectively good thing

951
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:56,520
with no negative repercussions. But whatever. That's why I'd have her on. I think she was

952
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:01,640
unfairly targeted for laughing during that. As someone who's had a lot of stuff of my own taken

953
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:07,640
out of context. Buy your subreddit. Yeah. Buy your own. What kind of

954
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:11,120
questions would you ask Kaler? Would you do like top five dead or alive rappers

955
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:17,640
and comedians? Yeah I would do Marc Maron style questions. Who are your guys?

956
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:28,640
Yeah. You're kind of like the Patrisse O'Neil of American politics. If you had had ten years where you could

957
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:35,120
practice guitar what jam with after if you could fuck Frank Zappa's daughter

958
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,260
would you do it I know my answer

959
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:47,180
before can you get into him can you get into that mark I mark Marin gives me

960
00:54:47,180 --> 00:54:52,000
pause because I think like there's a real risk I become like that's what I'm

961
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,520
like when I in like only like 20 short years hmm no you know the thing is the

962
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:03,640
The way to get Mark Maron is like 30 years of just like begging to be a successful comedian

963
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,480
and then getting successful doing something other than comedy.

964
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:07,480
Okay, yeah.

965
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,480
That is the-

966
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,480
My dad worked with him.

967
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,480
That breaks a man.

968
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,480
I've talked about that before.

969
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:12,480
Huh?

970
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,480
My dad worked with him.

971
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:14,480
Oh yeah, you guys worked- they worked at Regina, right?

972
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,280
Yeah, well it wasn't Regina, it was called the Sports Depot.

973
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,360
It was just a restaurant.

974
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:19,520
My dad used to drink whiskey in the basement with them.

975
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:23,680
Your dad has such- his dad has such an interesting web of like famous people he's interacted

976
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,680
with.

977
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:25,680
He used to bully Jeff Bezos in high school.

978
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:26,680
No, no, no, that was-

979
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:30,520
that was Dom's dad. Oh it was Dom's dad? Yeah. Oh that's even better.

980
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:34,040
Yeah. You guys are like the opposite of the Illuminati, your families.

981
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:38,960
Like Patrick's family, it's like they have all these connections to famous people but

982
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,440
it's just like weird coincidences. Right, it's like he worked with Bobby Kelly.

983
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:48,680
Yeah. That's pretty big. Yeah. Actually Bobby Kelly's gotta be... I was watching Louie in high school and he's like

984
00:55:48,680 --> 00:55:53,160
"Oh I know that guy." That's so funny. Bobby Kelly has to be like, I mean that's like

985
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:55,880
the lowest level guy you let in the Illuminati, you know?

986
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,920
He makes $40,000 a year off of radio and TV appearances,

987
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,160
but you're like, yeah, okay.

988
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,000
- Yeah, he's cool.

989
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:02,840
- Yeah, sure.

990
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:03,660
- We'll let him in.

991
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:04,500
- He's so funny.

992
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,560
- That is, that's a cool way to get into the Illuminati.

993
00:56:07,560 --> 00:56:09,160
I've been reading this book,

994
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:12,520
"The Family of Secrets" about the Bush family,

995
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,520
and there are like, there are like all these pages

996
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,280
where it's like, and then they form this like

997
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,760
oil services company that was perfect

998
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,680
because the CIA could hide all these funds,

999
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,760
and then they killed this guy and then blah, blah, blah.

1000
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:24,600
- JFK.

1001
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:25,440
- Yeah.

1002
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,260
- Yeah.

1003
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,040
- Like there's just all this like satanic shit in there,

1004
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,520
but then there's like, oh yeah,

1005
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,980
and I guess like Prescott Bush

1006
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:32,600
just thought this guy was funny.

1007
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:36,520
So he paid him $5 million a year to be in this company.

1008
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,840
- Yeah, it gets you further than you would think.

1009
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,960
- I would, yeah, that's, if I, if there wasn't podcasts,

1010
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:43,600
that's what I would have tried to do.

1011
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:45,640
- Be the funny guy in the Bush family?

1012
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,120
- Yeah, just find the most evil family I can,

1013
00:56:48,120 --> 00:56:50,160
like in Chicago and be like,

1014
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:56,560
Like I'm fun to be around for them. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a Dean Martin Jerry Lewis thing, but with like Illuminati like

1015
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,760
Felix is like marrying into the Emanuel family

1016
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:09,600
That was my other plan if like there was no podcast or articles

1017
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:15,760
Just power just because you're cool to be around. Yeah, that's what happened with Jared Kushner most

1018
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,000
Relationships in LA. Yeah, pretty much. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know Aaron Carter

1019
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:27,740
No, yeah

1020
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:34,200
I I think it's an amazing accomplishment to be close to the Illuminati as an entertainer and not eat like

1021
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:37,560
The fact that Chris Tucker was on the flight logs, right?

1022
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:41,320
My first thing isn't like oh, he's a pedophile. It's like oh

1023
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:44,740
"Oh wow, they just liked Chris Tucker so much."

1024
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:47,060
They're like, "Yeah, you can see all our blackmail."

1025
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:49,300
(laughing)

1026
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:51,140
- You're so goddamn funny.

1027
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:54,580
- Yeah, that's the highest compliment to an entertainer.

1028
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,460
- Yeah, dude.

1029
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:58,340
I mean, that's gotta be crazy for like,

1030
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:01,140
like imagine you've been in the Illuminati like 40 years.

1031
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:02,340
Right, like you've been,

1032
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:04,580
you paid your dues in the Illuminati, right?

1033
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:07,060
And you're still like a low level Illuminati guy.

1034
00:58:07,060 --> 00:58:08,660
And then you walk into work one day

1035
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,340
and Rick Ross is your boss.

1036
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:12,340
*laughter*

1037
00:58:12,340 --> 00:58:16,340
And you're just like, "What the fuck dude, Mastermind is not a great album."

1038
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:18,340
*laughter*

1039
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:22,340
Yeah, it's just like James Baker or some other Aran Kondra figure.

1040
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:24,340
It's like, "Well my kid says he's great."

1041
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:27,340
And we really hit it off. And you're like, "What the fuck?"

1042
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,340
*laughter*

1043
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,340
Look, I like blowing money fast.

1044
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:35,340
I put years and years into fucking pedophilia just for this guy to come in and ruin it.

1045
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:37,340
He's sagging his pants all over the office.

1046
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:39,340
*laughter*

1047
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,340
Jim, are you kidding me? I killed Gary Webb.

1048
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,340
And that was 30 years ago.

1049
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:49,340
Yeah, now I'm cold calling for Rick Ross.

1050
00:58:49,340 --> 00:58:52,340
Jesus fucking Christ, dude.

1051
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,340
Yeah, I'm becoming one of those conservatives like,

1052
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,340
"Oh, I got fired for standing up against affirmative action."

1053
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:01,340
But it's like, yeah, Rick Ross got added to the pedophile Illuminati.

1054
00:59:01,340 --> 00:59:05,340
And he went way higher than me, just 'cause he's a black guy.

1055
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:07,340
Yeah, just like Tiger Woods.

1056
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:12,380
It's like Tiger Woods in golf.

1057
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:14,580
He skips every, he skips the hard part.

1058
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,500
Never paid his dues, Tiger Woods.

1059
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,980
He sucks at golf, let's be honest.

1060
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:19,980
He sucks, right?

1061
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,180
Look, I can hit a hole in one probably more times than him.

1062
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:24,180
Yeah, dude, it's easy.

1063
00:59:24,180 --> 00:59:25,180
Take me and him out on the links.

1064
00:59:25,180 --> 00:59:26,180
I'll show you.

1065
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,180
I'll show you he shouldn't be here.

1066
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:28,260
Listen, here, we'll settle it.

1067
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:30,100
I'll rap battle Rick Ross.

1068
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:31,100
Fine.

1069
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,980
Rick Ross, they only, yeah.

1070
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:40,420
People just say he's a good rapper because he's a black guy, just like Hyder Klutz.

1071
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,380
Did you ever follow Rick Ross on Snapchat back in the day?

1072
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,500
I did not have Snapchat.

1073
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,740
He had, well yeah, you're an old man.

1074
00:59:48,740 --> 00:59:50,940
If I downloaded Snapchat now I would get arrested.

1075
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,940
Yeah, immediately.

1076
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,940
Yeah, that's what they're waiting on you to do.

1077
00:59:54,940 --> 01:00:00,060
They're just fucking, the FBI's just, "God, I hope he downloads Snapchat."

1078
01:00:00,060 --> 01:00:04,520
He used to have these snapchats where he apparently is like a, he has a mansion and then he has

1079
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,520
a farm of llamas.

1080
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:06,520
Oh yeah?

1081
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:11,180
And so he would walk around his property just like feeding macaroni and cheese to the llamas.

1082
01:00:11,180 --> 01:00:15,580
I mean like, my llamas are always fed very well.

1083
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,420
It was sick dude.

1084
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:22,060
I just remember, that just reminded me of, I was trying to find it the other day, it

1085
01:00:22,060 --> 01:00:25,820
was just some Danny Brown tweet I saw in high school and it made me very self-conscious,

1086
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:30,940
just said uh if you snapchat another dude you gay

1087
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:36,300
i mean absolutely owned yeah yeah uh there was one i found i was trying to

1088
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:38,780
find that one and then i found another one

1089
01:00:38,780 --> 01:00:43,340
um that was like bat the new great theft auto game is called

1090
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:46,620
ballot of gay tony

1091
01:00:46,620 --> 01:00:52,300
i do remember that being a huge thing in the eighth grade community

1092
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:54,300
Just like, "What, I'm doing missions for a gay guy?"

1093
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:56,700
"They put a gay guy in my favorite video game?"

1094
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:01,900
Well, that's like, the gay marriage Supreme Court case also passed just a few short years after Gay Tony.

1095
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,100
Just because of Gay Tony.

1096
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:12,500
Yeah, the Gay Tony expansion and the Battlefield Vietnam expansions, they allowed gay marriage to pass in the Supreme Court.

1097
01:01:12,500 --> 01:01:19,900
There was a lot of, yeah, Battlefield Vietnam, Gay Tony, when Mitt Romney was, he was in New Hampshire actually,

1098
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:26,280
And he was in it might have been that diner you guys are talking about and he just sees this like crusty old man

1099
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,200
He's like, oh this guy would will be like

1100
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,920
homophobic with me and

1101
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:38,520
The guy is just like I fought for my country in Vietnam and I love a man. What do you say to that?

1102
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:44,760
Romney like he like spin bodied and like clip out of the restaurant

1103
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:52,440
I miss Mitt Romney dude. It's funny that he tried to like he tried to be anti-Trump for like yeah

1104
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:57,160
Well, you had that picture with him. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that for just one year

1105
01:01:57,160 --> 01:02:01,360
There's like a crazy amount of politicians that come here like there's politicians all over the wall at the red arrow

1106
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,600
But the airport diner is like the one where they go to like get away. I watched it

1107
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,760
Did I ever tell you that the Ted Cruz thing?

1108
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:13,200
I saw Ted Cruz at the airport diner in Manchester and that guy has no fucking control of his kids

1109
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:20,100
me and my girl calling him out yeah Ted Cruz fucking get him did wrangle your

1110
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:25,140
kids what they do one of his daughter slammed her face into a pancake and then

1111
01:02:25,140 --> 01:02:31,060
his wife just like wouldn't look at him when he talked to her first off get your

1112
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:34,740
kids in control second of all your bitch in control she's not paying attention to

1113
01:02:34,740 --> 01:02:39,740
you doesn't make any goddamn sense brother yeah but yeah we I think my

1114
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:43,060
girlfriend got a picture with him and she's like doing a really like she's like

1115
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:47,160
closing her eyes like in the picture she's like that's pretty good it's a

1116
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,820
good picture I got I had like a I was like very hungover and I got too nervous

1117
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:56,160
to take a picture with Ted Cruz no I did she went over and got the picture with

1118
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:01,600
them his wife took the picture of her and Ted Cruz and I went outside to smoke

1119
01:03:01,600 --> 01:03:08,280
because I was like that man is so evil I'm like god that's one of the most evil

1120
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:12,080
people I've ever seen. Yeah that's the best just like yeah just fucking meeting some like it

1121
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:15,920
It just any Republican politician would be like, "Wow, the evil in that room was palpable."

1122
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,920
I'd go outside because I was afraid of what I would say to him.

1123
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:24,660
I was afraid of myself, the devil that would come out, if I had to fucking talk to him right

1124
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:25,660
then.

1125
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:26,660
I would just see red.

1126
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,640
I'd be one less bastard in the Senate.

1127
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,540
Yeah, the truth is there would be some new viral video for conservative Twitter of some

1128
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:39,880
fucking dumbass 18 year old being like, "You totally suck."

1129
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:45,680
yeah that is what would have happened but you you you're a total asshole suck yeah

1130
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:55,000
seriously just like David Cross's comedy in 2008 like Bush you're a craphead you

1131
01:03:55,000 --> 01:04:01,300
suck crap and that's it I am that's why I was good that I went to New Hampshire

1132
01:04:01,300 --> 01:04:06,120
for the Republican primary is the first time when I was like 25 because I just

1133
01:04:06,120 --> 01:04:10,960
have that like, if you see them you have to see something or you're complicit

1134
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,080
like that thing. Because I would just see Tom K or John Kasich and be like

1135
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:21,560
oh he looks like a hobo. Yeah see Ted Cruz, be like what an ugly guy. Oh he's so much

1136
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:25,360
uglier in person. That beard's doing nothing for him because you know

1137
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,040
you when you see that beard in person it's like probably patchy. He looks like a conquistador.

1138
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:34,080
Yeah he looks fucked up. He looks fucked up in person. I saw him put a lot

1139
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:39,320
of food in his mouth. Yeah he seems like he would not chew a lot. We went to a

1140
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:45,040
Carly Fiorina event in, I don't think it was Manchester, it was like St. Elsam, and

1141
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:50,960
it was like the Carly Fiorina, it was like the Carly Fiorina like death march.

1142
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,840
It was when she was like pulling in single digits after like conservative meetings, like Carly Fiorina is

1143
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,520
actually having a moment. Actually no one's gonna vote for Donald Trump and

1144
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:03,200
they're all gonna vote for Carly Fiorina to give us all jobs so we don't have to

1145
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,680
start the Lincoln Project, but it was just clear her campaign was anemic. No one

1146
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:11,000
wanted to support her. No one liked her. Like literally at the debate she was

1147
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,720
like, "You might not like me, but you definitely want to see me debate Hillary."

1148
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:21,560
And people were like, "We want to see Trump do that." But we came in there and

1149
01:05:21,560 --> 01:05:26,360
we were trying to, we were covering it for Cafe.com at the time, and there are

1150
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:32,680
these two like six-foot-four mass holes on the floor. Like they're wearing like

1151
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,200
floor-length leather coats and had balding ponytails.

1152
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:37,960
Yes, sickest kind of ponytail.

1153
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:40,920
And they were just like, you know those little pussy

1154
01:05:40,920 --> 01:05:43,720
Northeastern Republicans, the guys with the quarter zips?

1155
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,240
These guys were just partying.

1156
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:47,880
These mouseholes were just partying them like the sea.

1157
01:05:47,880 --> 01:05:51,160
And they were just screaming, "Where's Collie?

1158
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:53,320
I want to get a picture taken with Collie!"

1159
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:57,320
That rocks.

1160
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,520
And I always wonder if those guys became Never Trumpers or what,

1161
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:03,960
because it's like you would see them be like oh Trump voter but they were just

1162
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:10,440
like we love Kylie she ran HP so good they're like they're never Trump but

1163
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:15,880
they also own like a fucking like auto auction yeah it's an auto auction in

1164
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:25,120
Pittsfield Mass yeah god damn that's called like Frank auto auction Tony's

1165
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:31,760
Tony's foreign auto. There's a lot of those around here. Oh yeah. If I had access to like

1166
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,520
Echelon or any deep state technology I would like track those guys down. Yeah.

1167
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,240
What are your opinions on what's happened since you tried to get your

1168
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:46,560
picture with Carly Fiorina all those years ago? Turns out that's like one of my uncles.

1169
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:57,560
Goddamn. Alright. Felix, I have to piss so bad, dude. Thanks for coming on, man. This is very fun.

1194
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,280
It's "Stop trying to make MAGA happen.

1195
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,160
It's not going to happen."

1196
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:10,680
