1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Excellent. Hello. Hello all. Welcome. We are doing a Halloween spooktacular campaign, or

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:21,120
one-shot, I should say. And it's going to be based on Child's Play, the movie starring

3
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:28,360
Brad Dorff as Chucky the doll. And we're going to be doing a little bit of us getting the

4
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:33,320
characters together. You know, I feel like last time I just sort of shoved those

5
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:42,080
Pokemon down your throats and I feel like... Pause. ...we could benefit. Pause. Pause. Right. No, I yeah I get it.

6
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,840
I feel like we could benefit from together building these characters out.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,160
Now some of us have already given me some ideas, some of us have given me

8
00:00:51,160 --> 00:01:00,280
nothing I'm open to all of it who gave you nothing his name rhymes with

9
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:06,040
Shmaleb Schmitz I gave an idea in the chat but I'll do I'll come up with

10
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,840
another idea right now I will be actually maybe just didn't see it then I

11
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:19,840
will be a Hot Wheels car that wants gasoline okay that's not a good idea but

12
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,720
Yeah, that was a good idea and that was just right off the top of my head.

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
That was... you just thought of that now?

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,720
I kind of like that idea.

15
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
Yeah, I'm a hot wheels car.

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
I'm a hot wheels car.

17
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
And I want gasoline.

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,720
[laughter]

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
So, we're gonna put you guys now...

20
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Oh, does this...

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,720
Did they... did they... did they fuck this up?

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,720
Did they... did Roll20...

23
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
So they have folder...

24
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,720
They have a folder structure,

25
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,720
but you have to move the players to the room.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
to the room.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,880
So this doesn't sound important,

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,420
but it's actually super fucking annoying.

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,580
There we go, I fixed it.

30
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,420
Awesome.

31
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:57,260
- Okay, so on the character sheet,

32
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,020
do I want to use the character manser?

33
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,520
- Yeah, use character manser.

34
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,440
So for those listening at home

35
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,720
and for anyone curious about Roll20.

36
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,240
- What is this?

37
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,280
- So there's ways where you can edit the sheet directly.

38
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,360
I usually do that because that allows me

39
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,960
to put in all kinds of weird stats

40
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,200
and weird things to go on.

41
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,080
For you guys, use the character manser.

42
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,080
Just follow the drop downs, make your character level 2

43
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,080
for any class you want or you think fits your character

44
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,080
and then we will add in our own sort of custom abilities after the fact.

45
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Because you are all things that are possessing toys or objects of some kind

46
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:40,080
you will all have the ability to briefly possess an inanimate object

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
similar to the ability I give every other Caleb character I feel like.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
But and you'll only be able to do it for a short amount of time, though,

49
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,620
and then you'll inevitably be sucked back into your toy

50
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,100
as is the curse that Chucky is under.

51
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:56,940
Would you say that's so sad that a possessed car

52
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,140
would be a dragon born?

53
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,140
I already put that.

54
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:06,940
So you already the same thing, be the same thing, it's true.

55
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,640
Oh, OK. Well, no, I'm not going to copy.

56
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,240
I would say a car just from like, like, I guess like

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,360
- Because there's no war forged in there,

58
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,960
you know, which is kind of an automaton in D&D lore.

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,320
I would say dragon born.

60
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,560
Me, I'd say a gnome 'cause they tinker with stuff

61
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,560
or you could say a dragon born because they skin wise,

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,000
it's more car like maybe.

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,320
- I will be a gnome, I think.

64
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,400
- I like that.

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,440
It could also be based on who you were.

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,000
- And I'll be a rock gnome.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
- It could also be based on who you, nice,

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,080
who you were before you possessed the doll.

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,320
What kind of class is a lawyer?

70
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,400
Is a lawyer a bard?

71
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,640
It's a background, I believe,

72
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,540
but a lawyer.

73
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,960
But my guy is a lawyer.

74
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
What should I make my speech?

75
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,640
A bar?

76
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,920
Would that make him a bard?

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,440
You think maybe probably bard is good.

78
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,760
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

79
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,360
He talks.

80
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,120
Yeah, like you know, you a bar

81
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,460
College of Eloquence would be

82
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,680
something that a lawyer would.

83
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:10,000
OK, and skill proficiency is deception.

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,240
Yeah, first of all, yeah,

85
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,240
Intimidation and persuasion.

86
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,560
Nice.

87
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,080
No way.

88
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,160
I like that.

89
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,160
No way it's that perfect.

90
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,640
And then tool proficiencies, flute, horn, and dulcimer.

91
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:31,280
I think it has to be a dulcimer.

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,120
It has to be something that you don't need, you can still have your mouth for.

93
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,640
Right?

94
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
I got three of them.

95
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I'm going to make my favorite enemy giants because I'm a toy, so everybody's going to

96
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,740
be a giant to me. That's cool. Oh, that's a good choice. That is smart. Yeah. Ability

97
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:53,100
scores, choose. Method, choose. Yeah, I don't know why they, it's not. Choose a

98
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:57,780
background. There's only, the only background available is acolyte. Yeah, I

99
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,580
don't know why that is. Do you not have other ones or is it just acolyte? I

100
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,420
feel like it's like that if I don't buy more stuff. It's okay, I'll just be an

101
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,260
acolyte. Yeah, you're all, don't worry about it. You're all acolytes. You're all

102
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:12,820
in the church of... - Acolytes of toyhood.

103
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,660
- Of toyhood.

104
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,220
- Personality traits. - My language proficiencies.

105
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,580
- I don't wanna do this crap.

106
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,060
I wanna get to my stats.

107
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,240
- Portuguese.

108
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,780
- Yeah, look at this.

109
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,100
Maybe you're thinking about who's my character?

110
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,100
Portuguese, are they Brazilian?

111
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,260
Are they from Portugal before they possessed?

112
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,860
It's Brazilian.

113
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:34,180
- Yeah, and the language proficiencies

114
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:37,320
are Portuguese and goblin.

115
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,280
The favored enemy is a good idea, by the way,

116
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,940
'cause you will get bonuses on checks against them

117
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,360
because of that, Caleb.

118
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,960
- My weapon will be a rapier.

119
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,800
- Hold on. - And I'll have

120
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,520
a diplomat's pack, as well as a dulcimer.

121
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,040
- Yeah, that stuff is, diplomat's pack does not matter.

122
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,080
(laughing)

123
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,280
- What do you mean?

124
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,520
- And a prayer book. - A diplomat's pack

125
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,360
and a prayer book.

126
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
- Well, tell me what's in a diplomat's pack

127
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,120
and maybe I can-- - I have no idea.

128
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,320
It doesn't say.

129
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,920
- I never, I feel like I've only ever run one thing

130
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,200
where someone was like,

131
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,500
oh, let me get out my like,

132
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:14,900
like disguise kit and look up what could be in it.

133
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,740
And I was like, please--

134
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,500
- I'm just gonna choose a bunch of random spells here.

135
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,620
- He's like, please don't do that.

136
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,680
- Cure wounds.

137
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,780
What does Bane do?

138
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:25,020
Bane, identify, could be good.

139
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,860
- Bane is good.

140
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,600
Bane is sort of the inverse of bless.

141
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,340
So if you're playing Baldur's Gate,

142
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,660
you know what bless is. - Oh, I see.

143
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,820
- Yeah. - Hideous laughter

144
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,160
also will be good for my character.

145
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,720
- Minor illusion, vicious mockery, hideous laughter.

146
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,880
- Diplomats cat,

147
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,620
Diplomats pack has two cases for maps and scrolls,

148
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,960
a set of fine clothes, a bottle of ink, an ink pen,

149
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,480
a lamp, two flasks of oil.

150
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,200
- I have all this stuff as a toy?

151
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,040
- Yeah, a vial of perfume,

152
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,380
sealing wax and soap.

153
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,040
- How old is my character?

154
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,700
- I decided just recently that I'm a red car.

155
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,400
- You're a red car.

156
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
- I'm saying my age is one.

157
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
- Me too.

158
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,840
It is point five.

159
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
That was me.

160
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,600
Yeah, I'm going to do point seven five.

161
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Nice.

162
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,800
Well, it's inches or feet.

163
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,840
Nine inches.

164
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,600
Nine inches tall.

165
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,320
Y'all.

166
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,720
Yeah, it's my weight.

167
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,600
As long as you guys are not like over

168
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,480
like a foot, a foot, really, I'll be OK with it.

169
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,600
These are like big dolls.

170
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,880
I think that mine is.

171
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,080
I'm an action figure.

172
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,200
Well, we can talk about yours.

173
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:29,880
I'll look it up.

174
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,760
What can you look up the size of that?

175
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,800
Yeah, I'm doing that.

176
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,960
Yeah. OK.

177
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Um...

178
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,640
I, um...

179
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,840
Um...

180
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,160
It's actually for...

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,120
It's actually a steal for the price.

182
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah?

183
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,880
Yeah, probably. I don't know.

184
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:52,240
Specifications.

185
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,920
Oh, I have starting wealth.

186
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:56,200
It's in centimeters, of course.

187
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,000
I have to choose my personality traits?

188
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,320
It's required?

189
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,520
It doesn't have the weight, but it does.

190
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,640
You can roll them.

191
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
But it is about...

192
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
How many...

193
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
What is it? 2.2 centimeters per inch?

194
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
I misquote sacred text.

195
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,640
Wait, when do I get to do my stats?

196
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,640
That's Fahrenheit to Celsius.

197
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,640
I still have one on everything.

198
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Oh, so it has...

199
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
It's 10 inches.

200
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
Oh, it's 10 inches?

201
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
I think I might be the tallest one here.

202
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Would you say it is 10 inches?

203
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm sorry?

204
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,740
I wonder I get to do my stats. I'm still at one for everything.

205
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,140
Oh, can you not edit it?

206
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:44,340
I just said one. I mean, I guess I'll go with one for everything.

207
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,540
That's fine with me.

208
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:50,140
You should know we would have you didn't ever give me the chance

209
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:50,940
to make them.

210
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,540
You should have you just roll them.

211
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,340
I'm a minus five and every step.

212
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,740
So yeah, just hit.

213
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,940
What the hell?

214
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,940
What the hell?

215
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Did you pick a class?

216
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
Yeah.

217
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,940
Yeah, you picked Bard, right.

218
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Review. Why can't I change your stats? I hate this shit.

219
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,940
Just do it in the...

220
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,940
That's okay, man. I'll stick with 1.

221
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,940
No, we'll edit the sheet after. It's okay.

222
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,940
Just hit review and edit the sheet.

223
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,940
What am I doing?

224
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
Just hit whatever apply changes or whatever it is to get through it.

225
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,940
I did, yeah.

226
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
So I'm at 1 on everything.

227
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,940
You're 1 on everything.

228
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,620
Should I put a one on everything too?

229
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,080
'Cause I have my strength, dexterity,

230
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,320
and constitution at five,

231
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,520
and then intelligence, wisdom, and charisma, negative five.

232
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,860
- How did you get that?

233
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:43,260
- 'Cause I made a custom class.

234
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,780
- Mm-hmm. - Custom race.

235
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,540
- Yeah, character manager's weird that way.

236
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:52,500
Cam, just roll 3D6 six times and apply it.

237
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,760
What were you saying, Caleb?

238
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,920
- I didn't say anything.

239
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,020
- Damn. (laughs)

240
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,320
- Caleb, what were you saying?

241
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,820
I made my guy I'm just waiting.

242
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,320
Oh he made his guy?

243
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,320
How did you get your stats?

244
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:09,320
My stats I have negative 5 constitution negative 4 intelligence which is fine by me.

245
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,320
How did you get any of anything? I don't understand.

246
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
I just don't know how it got gotten.

247
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
I don't know.

248
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
Yeah alright we'll give you that.

249
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,320
What's so funny man?

250
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
It's just crazy.

251
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
You're not gonna be able to do shit.

252
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,160
- At least from a constitution point of view.

253
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,000
- I said I would take all the ones.

254
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,440
- I'm a fucking toy, of course, yeah,

255
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,960
no shit I can't do anything.

256
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,840
- All right, I fuck with you.

257
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,360
- I'm playing in the lore, man.

258
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,680
- He is, you know what?

259
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,040
He's playing in the, yeah, you are.

260
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,920
I like that.

261
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,720
Cool.

262
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,820
All right.

263
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,240
Let me know when you're done.

264
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,100
- I'm working on it.

265
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,400
- Cool.

266
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,280
And then I wanna hear who your characters are

267
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,320
once we're in the story,

268
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,360
and I'll give a little intro to where we are.

269
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,400
We're at Pal-Mart.

270
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,800
For the folks listening, I have an image of Walmart.

271
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,040
I changed it to Pal-Mart

272
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,560
so that it's like the podcast about list, Mark.

273
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:19,500
- Okay, all right, I'm ready.

274
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,480
- All right, cool.

275
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,900
- Wait a minute.

276
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,840
(laughs)

277
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,160
- What?

278
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
- Wait, why do I have eight hit points?

279
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Am I supposed to have that?

280
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,960
- My strength is negative three.

281
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,320
My dexterity is negative three.

282
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
My confidence is negative three.

283
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,160
My intelligence is zero.

284
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,280
My wisdom is zero.

285
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,520
And my charisma is zero.

286
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,360
- That's good.

287
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,400
- I have two plus ones,

288
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,120
but that's everything else is zero or negative one.

289
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,920
- That's gonna be good.

290
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,760
All right.

291
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,960
So you sit in the Palmar and let's timestamp this.

292
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,080
Let's wait till 12 minutes on the dot.

293
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,960
So folks can know, go to 12.

294
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,840
Just go.

295
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,920
You sit in the Palmart shopping mall,

296
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,960
the center of commerce in Duluth, Brooklyn.

297
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,880
The only place that rivals its size, scope,

298
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,980
and impact on the city is Wankoff's factory.

299
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,120
It makes the mall of America

300
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,960
look like the doll of China America,

301
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,740
like a little China doll.

302
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:21,960
Speaking of dolls, you guys might be dolls.

303
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,060
I don't know what characters you're making.

304
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,180
And that's not where you were a little while ago.

305
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,260
You were not in any kind of mall.

306
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,380
You weren't even planning on shopping.

307
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:34,220
Did we even exist?

308
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,940
You were people beforehand, before you entered these dolls.

309
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,740
Before you entered these characters.

310
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,380
And I'd like to know who you were.

311
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:52,660
And you guys, right now you sit in the Mr. Hickory Bones spooky toy shop in the mall,

312
00:12:52,660 --> 00:13:01,180
by a Mr. Hickory Bones who is a creepy old toy man and he's put you guys in

313
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:06,420
different areas of the store based on exactly what you do. So I'd like to know

314
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:14,340
first who you are as a mother, a mother and her sweet little boy walk in, the

315
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:20,220
bell rings, what toys will they be buying today? Who are you guys?

316
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,540
Uh, okay. Here's who I am.

317
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,540
Mm-hmm.

318
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:29,980
My name is Davey and I'm in deep shit, man. Deep fucking shit. I owe a lot of money to

319
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,580
some people. See, they manufactured me for the release of the 1993 crime drama film Carlitos

320
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:40,300
Way directed by Brian De Palma. They modeled me after Sean Penn's corrupt lawyer character

321
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:45,380
David Kleinfeld. They expected to make a whole bucket of money with my toy line. Every kid

322
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:50,060
in America was supposed to be playing with a fully articulated hairline Acura Davey Kleinfeld

323
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,660
with included prop tape recorder.

324
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:54,060
I was going to be a fucking hit man,

325
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:56,760
but the box office result for the movie

326
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,460
was lukewarm at best.

327
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,860
So now I'm in deep fucking shit.

328
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,560
I was supposed to be the best-selling toy in the world

329
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,660
and now I got to find a way to make back that cash

330
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,760
and I can't even do it by being a lawyer like in the movie

331
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,260
because I'm a toy.

332
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,260
I'm so fucked.

333
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,260
I'm so fucking fucked and as for how I became a toy.

334
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:17,960
Well, I guess it's either that I'm Sean Penn

335
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,660
and I got trapped in this toy body,

336
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,660
which also got me stuck in character as David Klinefeld,

337
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,140
or maybe I'm just method acting, or I guess I could just have been a toy all along

338
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:31,700
and just never had it was a person, or maybe I'm the real David Klinefeld

339
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,940
from the movie who escaped from the TV and then became a toy in the process.

340
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:39,380
Or I guess also I could be the guy who came up with the idea for the toy

341
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,420
and they trapped me into the toy as a punishment for the toy selling bad.

342
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,220
Or maybe I'm just a random guy who happened to accidentally become a toy

343
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,460
and also happens to have the exact same personality

344
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,860
and values as David Kleinfeld from the movie Carlitos Way,

345
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:54,340
I honestly can't remember.

346
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,500
The point is I need $1 million and fast.

347
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,680
And also it's Halloween,

348
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,580
so I'm a psychotic serial killer as well.

349
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,420
Okay, cool.

350
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,760
- That's scary.

351
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,500
- That's so, yeah.

352
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,860
I'm a little spooked out, man.

353
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,700
Wow.

354
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,180
So this guy is, yeah, he's like,

355
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:13,140
it seems like you maybe have either multiple personality

356
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,060
or which is, which is by the way normal.

357
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:18,660
I'm David Klinefeld from the film called "Did You Not Listen?"

358
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,160
I don't think any of you guys have seen that movie.

359
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,360
No, I still haven't seen it.

360
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,360
You keep telling me I haven't seen it.

361
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,360
No, me neither.

362
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Basically, he's a lawyer.

363
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,360
He's played by Sean Penn.

364
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Okay, and that I got.

365
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,660
So you're sitting in the movie's action figure.

366
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:35,660
From the movie.

367
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,260
I'm in between Batman and Optimus Prime.

368
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,260
Yeah, yeah.

369
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,260
- Yeah, and below you is a Lego set for Sallow.

370
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,500
So. (laughing)

371
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
And cool.

372
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,000
And speaking of more toys,

373
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,940
nah, it would have been a good subway,

374
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,000
but I gotta save it.

375
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,220
Speaking of other toys, further down the way we have,

376
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,840
speaking of Transformers,

377
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,660
I believe we have a car also in the midst.

378
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,100
- Not a Transformer at all.

379
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,640
- I know, but we have a car.

380
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,120
labeled as a transformer, but there was a manufacturing disaster.

381
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,340
You have like, like, like, like, like,

382
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,920
a fingerprints on you of kids trying to break.

383
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:22,080
Yeah. Yeah. Most of my all the wheels have been ripped off.

384
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:25,540
One of the doors is gone because kids have been trying to turn me into a bug

385
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,920
every single time they see me.

386
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,540
Cool. I am a red car.

387
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:35,640
I am the most classic toy,

388
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,600
the most classic toy you could have.

389
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,080
I don't remember much about my life before,

390
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:44,760
but I remember that I had a red car.

391
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,720
So I became a red car.

392
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,640
The last thing I remember was I was driving down the Pacific

393
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,680
Highway in a red car.

394
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,840
And I think maybe I crashed and then I woke up.

395
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,240
Okay.

396
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,920
It's coming back to me.

397
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,160
I crashed my red car.

398
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,320
I, my head got chopped off by, because it was a,

399
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,520
It was a classic car, had very little safety features,

400
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,540
no airbag, red car.

401
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,240
My head flew out into the Pacific Ocean

402
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,220
all the way back around the entire world

403
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,340
and then landed in basically, well, maybe not my head,

404
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,060
my soul flew all the way around the world

405
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:26,240
and landed in Brooklyn in a red car toy

406
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,620
because basically I thought it was cool.

407
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,240
And now that I'm a car, I don't really even care

408
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,000
about becoming a human again.

409
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,760
I want, what are cars like?

410
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,720
Gasoline.

411
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,720
So I want to get one gallon of gasoline.

412
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,960
(laughing)

413
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,520
- I think it's all number-based goals so far.

414
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,560
- Yeah, I'm gonna be keeping a running tally

415
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,960
of how much money I get.

416
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,920
- Yeah, good.

417
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,500
Okay, and so speaking of hot rods,

418
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,960
we got quite the last toy,

419
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:02,720
way in the back of Mr. Hickory Bones' toy shop.

420
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,800
And who is this? And who were they?

421
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,400
Well, I'm the ideal top...

422
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,880
Who's this?

423
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,920
Hey, we're doing the D&D right now.

424
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,760
- Oh, I'm sorry.

425
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,720
(laughing)

426
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,720
- It's Pierce.

427
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,600
Hey Pierce.

428
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,600
(laughing)

429
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,880
Wave hi to everyone.

430
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm the ideal top and the perfect bottom.

431
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:37,940
This dirty cock interactive fuck my cock masturbator delivers an incredible pleasure combination.

432
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,500
This stroker features life like fanta flesh skin combined with a super hot male voice

433
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:46,700
and powerful vibrations for an unforgettable sensory experience.

434
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,860
The handheld design offers up a tight asshole and stimulating tunnel.

435
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,900
The interior is soft and snug with a firm exterior shaft.

436
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,420
Featuring a built in rechargeable hi-fi speaker that delivers his irresistible voice.

437
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:03,040
This stud will tell you how good it feels and what he wants you to do with him with

438
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
every thrust.

439
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:09,420
He screams, moans, and begs you to yank his stiff shaft.

440
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:14,420
The powerful micro-bullet near the base provides extra stimulating vibration and concentrated

441
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,280
pleasure.

442
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,780
I became this item after a shootout with the police.

443
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:27,760
I was shot 16 times in the chest and then I fell into a vat of the phantom flesh mixer

444
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:35,520
almost exactly like Child's Play 3, where Chucky's blood coagulates into the dolls that

445
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,160
create the latex in Chucky's skin.

446
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,160
I was the...

447
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:48,080
I mean, based on the other two guys, I think I'm the only actual serial killer in the group.

448
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,760
And now my goal is to fuck somebody's bones out of their body.

449
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,020
(laughing)

450
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,800
- Okay.

451
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,640
- All right.

452
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,900
- So yeah.

453
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,740
- Bones.

454
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,600
- Good, great, great toy for child's play.

455
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,340
- Out of their body.

456
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:08,760
- I am doing this because you and Julio said that I should.

457
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,600
- You said don't do it man, it's a kid,

458
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,560
we're gonna be belonging to a kid.

459
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,400
- We're all sitting next to each other on the shelf.

460
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,160
- 18 year old, no me and Patches talked it out

461
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:19,640
and I have a different storyline than you guys.

462
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,440
- Well, you'll be a part of the same group.

463
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,180
- Yeah, be a part of the same group of toys

464
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,380
that belongs to a child.

465
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,800
- It'll make sense in a second.

466
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,520
- Yeah, it'll make sense who's buying me.

467
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,000
- The mom is gonna buy you for herself,

468
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,160
but she's gonna mix it up

469
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,240
and she's gonna give it to the kid.

470
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,220
- Let's make it make sense.

471
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,000
So, here you guys are in the toy shop,

472
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,820
well, in the mall, in the toy shop section,

473
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,400
over there in the top right.

474
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,060
Let me drop in Mr. Hickory.

475
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,060
I thought I had him in there.

476
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,060
Get him.

477
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,940
Let me go lock the door real quick.

478
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,940
You're going to lock the door in case somebody comes in?

479
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,060
In case Pierce tries to come back in, dude.

480
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,380
Perfect.

481
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,180
Mr. Hickory himself.

482
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:12,980
What was his full name?

483
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,380
Mr. Hickory Bones, actually.

484
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,380
Scary.

485
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,540
- Here a woman and a young boy walk in.

486
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,860
Do not pay attention to the boy looking like a soldier

487
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,160
in a fantasy setting.

488
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,720
- He's dressed up, it's Halloween.

489
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,540
- I know. - Yes.

490
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,380
- And that's why.

491
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,180
- Mom, I wanna be a fantasy soldier.

492
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,020
- Mm-hmm, that's what he said.

493
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:38,380
- Can you make me a fantasy soldier costume this year?

494
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,700
- The name of it, I think.

495
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,540
- Which one is Mr. Hickory?

496
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,380
- Can I be a top-down Roll20 character tile, Mom?

497
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:46,440
- Fantasy Soldier does kinda seem like a

498
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,760
Spirit Halloween-linked outfit.

499
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,440
- Yeah, yeah.

500
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,020
And so the boy and his mom walk in.

501
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:53,380
This boy is Gary.

502
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,760
He's a sweet young boy who,

503
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,500
(garbled speech)

504
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,860
who doesn't know it yet,

505
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,500
but he's got an enterprising future ahead of him.

506
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:11,500
And his mother is a neglectful bitch named Jossica.

507
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,860
- What else is new?

508
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,580
Yep, and she drags in Gary and she says,

509
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,020
"Come on, Gary!

510
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,080
"Come on, let's get you a toy!

511
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,340
"And let's get me a toy, too."

512
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:26,700
And she wanders on over to the section you think she would,

513
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,380
while Gary looks over at the toys that are there,

514
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:35,100
sees a Transformer, he sees a Batman, he sees a Pokemon,

515
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,900
and then he hears from behind him a Mr. Hickory Bones.

516
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,000
"Oh, young lad, is there a toy

517
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,240
that has caught your eye.

518
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,840
And Gary says, Oh, geez, I don't know.

519
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,900
I really like some of these toys, but

520
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,740
I want something a little different than just a Batman.

521
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,440
Well, I'm giving a thumbs up inside my box.

522
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,640
I'm giving a thumbs up.

523
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,880
OK, and I'm also holding the little toy size tape recorder

524
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,340
that's included with my box and I'm pointing to it.

525
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,640
I'm actually going to roll to see if he notices that

526
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,700
His insight is pretty good for for a child.

527
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,820
I'm chilling with the prospector from Toy Story two.

528
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,120
OK, cool.

529
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,860
He he looks up and he sees

530
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:25,360
he sees a movie goes, well, it's like doesn't he isn't quite

531
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,460
registered his movement yet?

532
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,040
You know, it's a little too not real to him, but he does.

533
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,080
Something's different about this one.

534
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,460
It's like, what's this one?

535
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,420
And Mr.

536
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:38,500
Hickory Bones comes over and with a almost skeletal hand,

537
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,340
he puts it on the young boy's shoulder and says,

538
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,480
This is a very special toy.

539
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,000
From a long ago, back when movies were movies.

540
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,660
- I do like movies.

541
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:56,660
- Yes, you do like movies.

542
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,320
And what about this one?

543
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,140
And he goes over to the red car.

544
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,680
Oh yeah, this is about to get good.

545
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,100
- Red car?

546
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,140
Does it transform?

547
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,100
- No, it doesn't.

548
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,220
- Doesn't transform.

549
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:13,540
- What about a classic toy?

550
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:18,540
Something that one doesn't just go out and get anymore.

551
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:24,000
One finds in say, an attic or under a bed.

552
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,100
An old classic toy, as perennial as the grass.

553
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,580
- Hmm, okay.

554
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,580
- And he takes the red car.

555
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,420
- What?

556
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,300
- And he takes the car and the lawyer.

557
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,500
That's right. He takes the car first. He took the car first.

558
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
He wants the client. He doubled back.

559
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,300
He doubled back. He was like, "Well, I already got the car."

560
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,100
Right. How could this be the perfect day?

561
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,500
He realized he wasn't satisfied with the car. The car wasn't enough for him.

562
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,500
No, it's not. No, he actually thought the car was more than enough.

563
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:56,100
Right. Jossica waltzes over.

564
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:58,900
She's knocking down shit as she's walking by.

565
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,900
She has her hand down. She's just knocking shit over with the...

566
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,300
Does she have a bra on? No.

567
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,500
And she has the-

568
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,800
Awesome, what do you think's knocking everything over?

569
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,300
Mm-hmm.

570
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,800
Mm-hmm.

571
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,300
Mm-hmm.

572
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:08,800
Mm-hmm.

573
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:15,500
And she holds up the Pipe Dream Extreme Dirty Talk Interactive Fuck My Cock Masturbator.

574
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
And she goes, "Can I try it out?"

575
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,500
[Laughter]

576
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
And, uh, he goes, "Yeah."

577
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
[Laughter]

578
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
"Why, of course you can."

579
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Um, I'll- I suppose I'll just-

580
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
"Yeah, well you can watch 'em."

581
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,500
And she goes off to a back room.

582
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,740
- The back rooms?

583
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,540
- Wait, wait, this is actually scary.

584
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:42,300
- No.

585
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,140
- Okay.

586
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,120
- But maybe.

587
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,920
And she goes off to a back room off screen.

588
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,160
And you know what?

589
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,300
I don't wanna do this.

590
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,660
Pat, why don't you describe what she does to you?

591
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,660
- Well, you can guess.

592
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,500
- Well, okay. - No I can't.

593
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:00,260
- So she takes me out of the package, right?

594
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,200
And then as soon as she moves it,

595
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,200
the

596
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,500
- She said she has to pull a ripcord to start.

597
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,960
(laughing)

598
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,160
- But, she also has to do that.

599
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,560
(laughing)

600
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,440
- It's like a chain ripcord too.

601
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,680
It's like a metal chain.

602
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,200
(imitates chain)

603
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:27,040
- He had both extra phlegms going on here.

604
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,460
- And over that with the hi-fi speaker,

605
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:32,500
you can hear the voice go, "Hey baby."

606
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,760
- Yeah, all right.

607
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,260
Shut up.

608
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,480
- You shut up.

609
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,380
She just shoves it up there.

610
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,880
And it's like there's like nothing.

611
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,580
There's like no friction for like it feels like a mile.

612
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,960
And then finally, there's some there's something to go up against.

613
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:55,560
And it's not what you were used to when they tested you in the factory.

614
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,560
I did not even test me in the factory.

615
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,300
They just put me in a box.

616
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,000
They test each and every single one of them.

617
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,040
They don't tell you that. Yeah.

618
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,640
Well, yeah, they test them.

619
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,040
That's why they got they have realistic

620
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:10,040
Weighted balls.

621
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
That's what it says on the package.

622
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,040
So do I.

623
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,040
And uh, I don't believe you.

624
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,040
She does this for like, "Ahh, ahh!"

625
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,040
She does this for like a minute.

626
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:22,040
And then, um,

627
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,040
you don't feel like any

628
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,040
contractions, but you do hear

629
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,040
like a "grrrr"

630
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,040
and not from her mouth.

631
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,040
And she goes, "Ahh." Her stomach?

632
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:34,040
Yeah, and she goes, "Alright, yeah." And she takes it out.

633
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,040
And she uh,

634
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:41,840
put you back in the box. Is there a baby in there? And she goes over to... Is that a baby?

635
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:50,480
Is that a baby noise? Is that a baby? What noise is that? She goes over to the to Mr. Hickory

636
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,520
Bunch and says, "Yeah, I'll take it. Do you have eight others?" He's like, "That's the only one."

637
00:27:54,520 --> 00:28:01,960
Okay. She picked the one that has a butt hole. But there is eight David Kleinfeld's on the shelf.

638
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:09,100
Mm-hmm. No, there's not bro. There's yeah, they can't move them in. Nobody has bought one since 1993

639
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:16,140
It's fully shocked do you want to try to get them to buy it you want to find a way to do that? Yeah

640
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,120
What are you gonna try to do door? Yeah door? I'll have the one at the back

641
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:28,240
We'll push them all off the shelf and have them all land in like cool pose each and a different cool pose like

642
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,940
They all alive

643
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,940
holding a clipboard.

644
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
Yeah, they're all alive.

645
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
They're all alive.

646
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,940
Okay.

647
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,940
Yup, I'm all of them, actually.

648
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,940
You're all of them? You're an army of David Kleinfelds?

649
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,940
Yeah, but each of the different possibilities

650
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
for how my soul got into a toy,

651
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,940
each one of them is a different one of those.

652
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,940
One of them is actually Sean Penn,

653
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,940
one of them is the character that escaped from the movie.

654
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Yeah, the Sean Penn immediately tries to tie up

655
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
the nearest woman he could find and threaten her

656
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
with a baseball bat.

657
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,700
are figuring out their thing.

658
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,540
Yeah, okay.

659
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,900
Roll a, good God, performance check.

660
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:10,460
And based on that, we'll then see what happens

661
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,300
and maybe additional rolls.

662
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,100
- All right, let's see here.

663
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:17,560
Performance, well, performance, I have a plus one, so.

664
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,820
What did I get? - 10?

665
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,540
- 10. - Cool.

666
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:25,700
You managed to push over two other dolls.

667
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,460
Both of them do the worm simultaneously.

668
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,420
- Damn, badass. - Which is pretty good.

669
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,420
And Gary goes, "Hmm, I bet I could sell those maybe."

670
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,060
He's already thinking about being a C Enterprise.

671
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:42,380
And he says, "I'll take those as well.

672
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,220
"Mom, can I get them?"

673
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:49,020
And she goes, "Mmm, okay, that's yes."

674
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,660
And then they go up to the counter, they pay.

675
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:57,400
And before they leave, Hickory Bones says, "Do be warned."

676
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:02,400
What you have just bought may not be what it seems.

677
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,460
And they are already out the door,

678
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,700
they're in the car, they're gone.

679
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,020
- He's talking to nobody.

680
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:08,860
- Yeah, yep.

681
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,360
- He's talking to a wall.

682
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,420
- He's slowly losing his mind.

683
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,260
And now--

684
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,780
- Yeah, a guy who's in the pharmacy

685
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,900
across the mall hallway is buying a box of tissues.

686
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,740
And he's like, "What?"

687
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,340
- He doesn't, he doesn't hear it,

688
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,380
he hears it, he doesn't say anything,

689
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,260
he just puts the tissue box back.

690
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,520
(laughing)

691
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,720
Wipes his nose with his sleeve and just leaves.

692
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,100
And we are now in the home of Gary C. Enterprises

693
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,980
and his piece of shit mom, Jossica.

694
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,900
So you might be wondering, how did they get such a nice home?

695
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,740
- Is there a father in the picture?

696
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,660
- It's beautiful, man.

697
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,140
- This is an incredible home.

698
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,100
- They have a bunch of fried eggs.

699
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,060
- I'm seeing a white square.

700
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,420
I'm seeing a white square.

701
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:04,780
It's because Jossica, and good news for the three Kleinfelds, which I want to know what

702
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,820
the goal for each of those are.

703
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,700
We're all collectively trying to get a million dollars.

704
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,700
You only got three?

705
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,340
I thought it was eight.

706
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,340
They only bought three of them.

707
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:15,340
Oh, okay.

708
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,340
Yeah.

709
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,340
Probably wise.

710
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,700
We're all trying to collectively get a million dollars.

711
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:26,180
Jessica's great-grandfather died due to a misspelling on the will instead of

712
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:33,140
Jessica getting the money she did. And so now she has gotten all this money and

713
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:37,060
hired a designer to help design a nice home. Lord knows she has no

714
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:44,980
taste. And Gary C. Enterprises, in case it's not clear, lives there now as sort of a

715
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,780
new kid in town, he's, you know, wasn't rich beforehand,

716
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,520
doesn't really know what to do with all this money

717
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:53,340
and all this, his mom is still awful,

718
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,740
but he just wants to be happy.

719
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,260
And he's excited to get these new toys.

720
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,100
And he walks in and he's like,

721
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,660
"Oh boy, I'm gonna play with each of you."

722
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:04,980
And not that one, he points to his mom's toy that she got.

723
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,260
And he heads off to his room with the two toys.

724
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,820
- Just let him play with it.

725
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,300
- Yeah, why can't he play with it?

726
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,300
- He can't play with it?

727
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,140
I mean, he doesn't have to--

728
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,100
original song about how I wish I was a normal toy.

729
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,340
It's up to you.

730
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,460
You could do a ballad.

731
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,820
Mm-hmm.

732
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,820
I okay.

733
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,500
So I'm yours.

734
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,220
You wish that the kid would play with you?

735
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,100
Is that what you're going to do?

736
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:29,180
I wish, I wish that I wasn't, um, no, that's a good idea.

737
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,700
I wish that I died in a regular toy factory.

738
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,260
He's playing with us and you're getting all jealous.

739
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,340
Why won't he play with me?

740
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:35,700
Yeah.

741
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,580
Why won't he?

742
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,420
Well, I know why he won't play with me.

743
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,420
But, but sing it in your song.

744
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:40,900
Sing a song about it.

745
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:43,900
sing a song about why you're so upset that he won't play with you.

746
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:49,300
I wish I died in a normal toy factory.

747
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,620
Why did I try to rob the pipe dream factory?

748
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:58,900
And then you keep singing.

749
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:07,980
Is she doing this in the living room?

750
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,820
- No way.

751
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,180
(laughing)

752
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,140
- Seemed really fast.

753
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,340
- It's the master bedroom.

754
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,140
She's like sprinted in.

755
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,500
- Okay, now the bedroom where you have your couch,

756
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,660
and your two tables, and armchair.

757
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
- So some child's play,

758
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,980
and I thought that we were all supposed to be evil murderers.

759
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,420
- You thought that, you heard child's play,

760
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,060
and you thought to be a sexual, sex toy.

761
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,900
- I thought of the most evil thing.

762
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,060
- He didn't even know there was a movie.

763
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,460
- You heard child's play.

764
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,300
- This is so mean.

765
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,540
- No, 'cause child's play is a movie about an evil man,

766
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,220
and I thought that it was going to be a grown man.

767
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,940
I thought that this was going to be about grown stuff.

768
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:43,780
- What are you talking about?

769
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:46,660
It's literally about a doll killing a kid.

770
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,940
There's no grown men in it at all

771
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,580
besides the police officer.

772
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,980
- Well, I thought that the dad was going to buy it.

773
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,380
- There's no dad in the movie.

774
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,220
- Why would it make that better?

775
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,620
- Yeah, it's a single mom.

776
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:59,060
- I think that I fucked up my character so bad.

777
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,420
- No, I think you did a good job.

778
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,420
- It's good, it's good.

779
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,060
You just need to take more risks.

780
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,900
You need to think about--

781
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,740
- Yeah, just lean into it.

782
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:06,860
- Yeah, just lean into it, man.

783
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,900
- No, 'cause now I have a whole different subplot,

784
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,940
and I think I ruined the whole episode.

785
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,620
- No, you could be a--

786
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:16,900
- She's gonna get tired of you eventually.

787
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,820
- And you could be a father figure to this kid.

788
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,220
- Right now, you have an object,

789
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,700
we're just sitting here getting played

790
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,700
by some dumb loser kid.

791
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,340
- You have a chance to fuck her bones out of her body.

792
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,580
- First of all, you have to fuck her,

793
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,180
and you get to have sex with a woman,

794
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,660
which none of us will ever have the opportunity to do.

795
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,460
- Your goal is to fuck my pep talk.

796
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,580
I give up.

797
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,220
- Can I drive while she is sewing?

798
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,940
While she's doing that, can I drive in the gap

799
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:42,540
under the door and then in the box

800
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:45,420
so maybe she thinks that I go in her too?

801
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,160
- Roll a, yeah, roll stealth.

802
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:53,380
- Okay, I'm rolling stealth.

803
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:55,540
Oh my God, my stats are so bad.

804
00:34:55,540 --> 00:35:00,380
Oh, I rolled it accidentally with advantage,

805
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,500
but the first one was an 18.

806
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,980
- That's great, yeah.

807
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:05,480
- Since you're in heavy armor, so you have disadvantage.

808
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,800
(laughing)

809
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,100
That's not advantage.

810
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,580
- God damn it.

811
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,820
- No, yeah, you-- - First one was still 18.

812
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,660
- Why are you wearing heavy armor?

813
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,500
- I don't know. - It still counts.

814
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,340
- It's a car. - You get the first one.

815
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,300
I don't know why you're wearing heavy,

816
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,780
but you still count the first one.

817
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:20,420
You make it through, yeah, you slide under the door,

818
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,580
and now you're in the room.

819
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,020
She, as you can see, is just on top of the machine

820
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:25,980
that is singing.

821
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,280
Who you can understand. - I wanna sit right next

822
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,980
to the open box of him,

823
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,780
so she does maybe get confused and thinks she bought two.

824
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,620
- Okay, cool.

825
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,620
I'll keep that stealth role and you can go in there.

826
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,620
Anything you're doing, Kleinfelds.

827
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:40,920
Yeah, so basically me, the three Kleinfelds are under the bed.

828
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,720
We're standing in a circle and we're talking to each other and

829
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,820
the three of us the main one.

830
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:48,220
I'm Davey and then there's Dave and David and we're like, all

831
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:48,820
right, Dave.

832
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,720
We got to make a lot of fucking money really fucking fast.

833
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,920
I don't know how we're going to fucking do this.

834
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,420
We got it.

835
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,520
Maybe we can rip someone off.

836
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,820
No, I don't and we're going around a circle and what's going

837
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,920
to happen is that Davey is going to send out Dave and David.

838
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,020
They're going to go out and they're going to get day jobs

839
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,920
and try to climb the corporate ladder.

840
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,200
And just since they're toys,

841
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,040
they don't really need to eat or have a place to live.

842
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
So they don't have, they have no expenses.

843
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,960
So they're just gonna go out

844
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,080
and go do some job interviews,

845
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:14,000
try to get into a law firm,

846
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,880
maybe start out as like a, you know.

847
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,280
- So we will head to a job.

848
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,080
- Davey will stay in the house.

849
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,060
Those two guys can go and be kind of offscreen,

850
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,320
passively earning money.

851
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,520
- Okay, I'm gonna put them.

852
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,000
- Those are my cookie clickers.

853
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,820
- All right, cool.

854
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,480
I'm gonna move them into the cookie clicker zone.

855
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,320
We might, maybe we'll see them later.

856
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:36,560
In the meantime, so yeah, she now,

857
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,040
Josska gets tired and she immediately falls asleep.

858
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:46,080
And, eh, eh.

859
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:48,060
- I've room one time to wake her up.

860
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:52,320
- And she goes over to the box where she put

861
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,400
the fuck toy in there, where she put Pat.

862
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,240
And--

863
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,320
- My new goal is to kill myself.

864
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,040
(laughing)

865
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,560
And she goes in there and she sees the car in there

866
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,640
and she goes, "Hmm."

867
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,980
And she goes to put it in her mouth first.

868
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:18,360
- I know she's holding me, but I still,

869
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,280
wheels going reverse, beep, beep, beep, beep, ah!

870
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,480
- And she drops you, scared.

871
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,280
- Okay, let's hurry off into a mouse hole.

872
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,300
- Yeah, okay.

873
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,880
- Oh my god, we should move into the mouse hole network

874
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,960
and befriend the mice.

875
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,040
- It's a very good idea.

876
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,220
- Yeah, you go in there and you do see a little mouse

877
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,840
with a newspaper and some glasses on.

878
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,640
And he's sort of startled by a car

879
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,440
crashing into his living room.

880
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,280
It's like, ah!

881
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,240
- I headlight flash SOS.

882
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:50,960
- It's her again, isn't it?

883
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,040
And he tries to use, he tries to pull you in.

884
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,640
He calls over his family.

885
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,500
And they're all starting to pull you in to the mouse hole.

886
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:01,700
Even the little kid is trying to help out, you know,

887
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,580
and they yank you in and yank you through the hole.

888
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:08,540
And they're all sort of looking at you now.

889
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:10,280
They're trying to understand, like, is he alive?

890
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,040
Like, what is this thing like?

891
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,000
Like to try to get a sense of you.

892
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,680
One of the kids goes in the in the car driver's seat and starts to honk the horn.

893
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,540
Oh, and he jumps out and his mother grabs him.

894
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,380
And the man who, the man mouse who helped pull you in says,

895
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:29,260
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

896
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,860
I didn't know you were alive.

897
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,900
I saw SOS flashing, I assumed there was a driver."

898
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,740
- No, man, it's okay.

899
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:37,640
I'm just a mouse like you guys.

900
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,280
I just wanted to come.

901
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,420
I just, that big old lady tried to eat me,

902
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,140
but man, I just want cheese and shit.

903
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:43,980
Let's just chill.

904
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,860
- Roll deception with disadvantage.

905
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,220
- How, why?

906
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,900
- 'Cause you are not, they are mice,

907
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,340
so they know what a mouse is.

908
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:55,260
They have bad eyesight, famously, man.

909
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:56,460
Look at the smell and shit.

910
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,700
They have to fuck each other.

911
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,460
Can I walk into the mouse hole?

912
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,300
You can walk.

913
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,860
You, yeah, you just roll stealth.

914
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:04,160
It's gonna be a lower DC because she's asleep.

915
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,140
Me?

916
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:07,500
I got a four.

917
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,340
Okay.

918
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,500
Roll an interception roll.

919
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,580
Okay, cool.

920
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,420
And what'd you get?

921
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,240
Let me roll.

922
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,900
Sorry, it's, my thing goes so damn slow.

923
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,740
No, that's life, bro.

924
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,900
It's crazy.

925
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:17,940
Stealth.

926
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,060
It's fucking life.

927
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:19,900
10.

928
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,740
That's fine, that's perfect.

929
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,580
Okay.

930
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:26,180
walk in. Yeah. I'm like, "Oh, did I hear you say, did somebody say that somebody tried to

931
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:29,940
eat you? Did you say somebody tried to eat you?" That's... Yeah, she tried to eat me,

932
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:32,940
man. You know, that's assault with intent to digest. We could press charges. We could

933
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:37,020
really make something of this. Really? I think we could really, I think we could really get

934
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,580
a good result out of this lawsuit here. If you want to move forward, I'm your guy. I

935
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:46,660
don't know. Yeah, okay, well, here. Let's write the papers up and you can serve her.

936
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:48,060
I mean, she's right there.

937
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,460
All right, all I need is a $1 million retainer.

938
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,660
I've been walking--

939
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:54,780
That's a million, it's $1 million a year.

940
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:57,140
I've been walking into the kitchen

941
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:59,140
and I'm trying to jump into the blender.

942
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,400
(laughing)

943
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,620
He says--

944
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,980
Big dick, it's just waddling towards--

945
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:11,980
Waddling around in a Vitamix, just popping up.

946
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,780
It won't kill you.

947
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,620
No.

948
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,460
It won't kill you, it makes you more

949
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,820
- You're so durable, man. - Ribs for her pleasure.

950
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,660
- Yeah. - Yeah.

951
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,140
- Yeah. - 'Cause you ribs.

952
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,380
- It was a rib for her pleasure. - It was a durable thing on her.

953
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:23,500
- Yeah. - Yeah, maybe just,

954
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,380
my goal is to just die.

955
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,260
At first I had all these big dreams,

956
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,220
but now I realize nothing's ever gonna,

957
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,020
nothing good will come from this.

958
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
So my goal is to just die.

959
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,220
- Your dream was to fuck someone's bones out of their body.

960
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:39,900
You were the closest to your dream of anybody else here.

961
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,540
- You had an opportunity. - Yeah, and then I,

962
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:45,260
I realized that I don't even,

963
00:40:45,260 --> 00:40:48,020
what's the point of it all?

964
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,900
- You don't even like sex?

965
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,540
- I don't even, I tried it for the first time,

966
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,640
I don't even like it.

967
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,980
And now I just wanna die.

968
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:00,380
- It's listen, Mr. Talk?

969
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,380
Mr. Talk?

970
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,820
- My real last name was Renfro before this.

971
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,380
- Yeah, Mr. Renfro.

972
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,860
He waddles into the mouse home with the Vitamix

973
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,460
just spinning around his head.

974
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,360
- Really? - Yeah.

975
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,160
- I think I may have an opportunity for you.

976
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,740
If you're feeling your life is forfeit,

977
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,340
maybe we could work something out.

978
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,180
You know what I mean?

979
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,080
Maybe you could do a little something for me.

980
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,940
(groaning)

981
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,060
- Toys! - We could help each other out.

982
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,940
Maybe I'll help you.

983
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,660
You maybe fuck me.

984
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:31,220
- Oh, toys!

985
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:33,420
- I'm too big to even do that.

986
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,180
The only way that we could even do that

987
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,840
is if you crawled into the butt on my balls.

988
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,700
Gary Santerprise is looking for his toys now.

989
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,220
So he heads over to his mother's room.

990
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,140
You guys are not there though, as far as you can see.

991
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,340
Oh, I don't know where they are.

992
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,620
Toys!

993
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,740
Here, I push out the family of mice.

994
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:54,980
Ah, mice!

995
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:55,940
Here we are!

996
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,100
Oh, here are all your toys!

997
00:41:58,100 --> 00:41:59,540
The father turns, he goes,

998
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,620
after we saved you, how could you?

999
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,560
And I block the door with my body.

1000
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,840
I parallel park in front of the door.

1001
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:11,860
Gary screams, mother wakes up, Jossica, she goes,

1002
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,980
"What, oh, mice, those mice again!"

1003
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,940
And she goes over and she takes out a bat

1004
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,540
that says, "Mice killer."

1005
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:23,580
And she just starts going crazy trying to kill these mice.

1006
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,660
And she says, "That's it, this is not gonna work.

1007
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,460
We're going, let's, come on, we're,

1008
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,580
we're going to the office.

1009
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:36,300
We're gonna go see your grandfather."

1010
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,900
office. He'll help us with this. I'm tired of having to do everything myself.

1011
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:48,360
Grand. Are we going in a car? Yes we're going in a car! And she's like, "Why did I

1012
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:54,920
say that?" Guys, I think we have to go to the office. I think we have to go to the

1013
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:59,140
office. I think that's the place to be. Mm-hmm. And what'd you say your

1014
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,500
name was? Roofer? The sex toy?

1015
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,500
My name was...

1016
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Renfair?

1017
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,220
My name was Cody Renfro.

1018
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,820
Renfro. It's also probably, I mean it's an office buddy, it's probably on a pretty high

1019
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:14,500
floor you might be able to jump out of a window or something. Or you could just close yourself

1020
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:19,540
in the corner. I knew a guy who killed himself that way. Alright, let's go.

1021
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,540
Okay.

1022
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:26,660
So, yeah, you guys present yourself. Gary's all happy to see his toys. Well, most of them.

1023
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:28,260
Did the mice family get obliterated?

1024
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,220
Yeah, they're dead and the mom

1025
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,260
also just grabs

1026
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:40,300
The pipe dream extreme just from the head takes it with the Vitamix doesn't remove it

1027
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,820
Rags hidden throws it in the car

1028
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:46,340
Katamari sex toy

1029
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,220
Anything that is attached to it. She's gonna put in her body

1030
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:54,700
Sticky after being up in her that anything it touches is permanently. Yeah

1031
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:59,500
I've got M&M's and McDonald's fries on stuff

1032
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,100
to me because of the car, because it's in a minivan.

1033
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,220
Yeah, you're rolling.

1034
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,820
I would like to under the under the front seat, just collecting every coin,

1035
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:09,700
every coin and every.

1036
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,860
Wait, no, not the coins, not the coins.

1037
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,220
I'm in the couch cushions.

1038
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,060
I'm rooting around.

1039
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:17,180
I'm looking for I need I need to make a million dollars.

1040
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,500
Well, you can put all the coins in my butthole.

1041
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,020
No, I'm going to put them in my.

1042
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,820
It's attached to the thing.

1043
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:25,820
I'm gonna deposit them in my bank account.

1044
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:28,480
That I have.

1045
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:35,340
Would have given me some kind of purpose. I'm trying to find where they keep the gas in the car.

1046
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:41,780
Where oh, yeah, I mean it's in the gas. Okay. I don't know that. You don't know where it is?

1047
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:46,700
Okay. Yeah, I don't I'm just looking. We're just toys. I know that there's gas in a car.

1048
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:51,380
But I don't know. Isn't it kind of interesting that there's parts of a car that are in the car,

1049
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,380
but not in the car, you know, this is the kind of thing that I'm thinking.

1050
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,180
A two different ends almost. Yeah.

1051
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:59,740
Mm hmm. So then you then what do you get?

1052
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:00,680
What are you trying to do then?

1053
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,280
Like because so you're in the backseat right now with Gary

1054
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:08,820
and he's like going like moving you around, going, I'm playing in a car, in a car.

1055
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:11,340
Like he's like attempting to you.

1056
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,020
So how do you what do you do to to get him off of your case in this case?

1057
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,140
My fart.

1058
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:21,380
(laughing)

1059
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:25,860
You make the plastic that makes up the car

1060
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,700
kind of burn slightly.

1061
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:28,540
- Uh-huh.

1062
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:31,660
- And like, he like puts you down for a second

1063
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,780
and he picks up the Kleinfelds,

1064
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:35,300
or the one Kleinfeld he has.

1065
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,100
- Felt good so I keep doing it.

1066
00:45:37,100 --> 00:45:38,680
- Okay, you keep farting.

1067
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:42,700
Sex toy with all the shit,

1068
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,580
you're just on the ground now doing this?

1069
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,720
- Yeah, yeah, I'm just trying to like,

1070
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,480
I don't know. I'm collecting so much stuff that it's weighing me down and it's making me feel even worse.

1071
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,900
If you want to kill yourself, you could try to get in the way of the gas pedal or brake or something.

1072
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:08,620
I am. I'm putting the... I flopped the tip of my head right underneath the brakes so you can't hit the brakes.

1073
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,620
Roll an athletics check.

1074
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:17,000
Negative one.

1075
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,180
I got a negative one.

1076
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:22,180
You just shoot right up inside her.

1077
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:28,220
And you got

1078
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,220
meanwhile, red car.

1079
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,620
You have this opportunity now to sort of try to explore

1080
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,620
the inner workings of the car.

1081
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,400
You find like a little hole.

1082
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,120
It's not a well-maintained car.

1083
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:38,960
Oh, my God.

1084
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,040
Start to explore inside of it.

1085
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:43,200
Now, I don't know enough about the inside of a car, to be honest.

1086
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:45,000
I can't drive because I have no gas.

1087
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,500
I can't drive anywhere.

1088
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,000
So I walk.

1089
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,900
So what do you do?

1090
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,260
You walk with my four wheels.

1091
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,300
Yeah. Like as if they're like, like putt putt.

1092
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,440
Like putt putt. Yeah, I was going to say. Yeah. OK.

1093
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:57,700
So you're putting into it.

1094
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,640
You see after putting roll it actually a roll investigation check.

1095
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:05,580
I think you have like minus five intelligence.

1096
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:08,780
Hold the phone.

1097
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,340
I'm holding it.

1098
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,140
That's a two. That's a two.

1099
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,800
You find the freon

1100
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:28,780
for the air. Oh my God, gas! Yeah. And I start sucking it up. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know, I've

1101
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,300
never drank in Freon. Do you know what happens after you drink it? You turn into cold. You

1102
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:42,020
get cold. I think you turn into Mr. Freeze from Spat. You get ice powers. Oh! Blue car.

1103
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:49,340
with ice powers you're blue now - now your blue car okay yeah and she slams on the

1104
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,380
brake she's at the office she runs in there's like I'm gonna go see your

1105
00:47:53,380 --> 00:48:00,740
grandfather he needs to give us more money and money I need a million dollars

1106
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:05,980
and you're in the office building floor first floor of the office and you see

1107
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:11,920
now. I see the two David Kleinfelts are working here. Yep, they're already

1108
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:19,260
working here. So they go over to confer with you and they say they've been doing

1109
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,060
well. You can get tell you could say how they say that but they've been doing

1110
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,360
well and that they're almost they're they're almost at about 500k right now.

1111
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:34,500
They've been crushing it. Like an hour? Oh my god. They've been doing amazing. They're amazing

1112
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:37,500
lawyers and there's two of them. They're really really good lawyers. I mean David

1113
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:41,940
Klinefeld is a good lawyer. He's a nasty crook but and he betrays everybody in his

1114
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:47,740
life but he's a good lawyer. Listen he acquitted Carlito Brigante. He got him

1115
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:53,380
out of a 30-year stint. Yeah so they've been making money doing criminal

1116
00:48:53,380 --> 00:49:00,380
criminal representation litigation. They somehow made the office. They work for

1117
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:09,980
the DA they made $500,000 a day. Oh Bluecar is here and he says room. I had to see if the

1118
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:17,000
picture updated. It did I think. Yeah I got it. Yeah yeah nice. Yeah and so she's

1119
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:21,420
marching you through the office and you get to the the top floor you get to the

1120
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:26,420
office of the grandfather and he, Mr. Peter Griffin.

1121
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:33,500
And he says, "Eh, what are you doing here?

1122
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:36,000
"I thought I told you to eh, eh, meh."

1123
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:42,380
- Okay, so what I'm seeing here is that not only

1124
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,500
does he sound like a car beeping,

1125
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,900
but he also is a character from a TV slash movie.

1126
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,380
So I feel like me and Caleb's characters both have

1127
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:52,100
some type of kinship with him.

1128
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:52,940
- And he also has a cock. - And it's almost as if

1129
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,060
he's our-- - True.

1130
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:56,780
- He also has realistic balls.

1131
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:57,620
- Yeah.

1132
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,780
- So I feel like maybe-- - All three of you.

1133
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:02,140
- I want to be best friends with this guy.

1134
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,500
- Does he have a stapler?

1135
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:07,500
- Yes.

1136
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,780
- I try to staple my balls to the floor.

1137
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:14,340
- Does it have pullable skin?

1138
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,420
- Hey Doris, what are you doing here?

1139
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:17,260
(imitates cat meowing)

1140
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,220
Why do you got this thing?

1141
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,060
(imitates cat meowing)

1142
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,220
What is this thing?

1143
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:23,340
and he was holding you up, Pat, and waving you around.

1144
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:25,380
He's got a Vitamix on it.

1145
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:28,220
Ah, Grandpa, or my father.

1146
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,620
- Wait, let's talk to his hand now.

1147
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,060
He's part of me now.

1148
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:35,260
'Cause I'm like a Katamari, so he touched me.

1149
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,100
- Yeah.

1150
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:36,940
- Wah, wah.

1151
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,780
He's trying to shake you off.

1152
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,140
- Wait, now Patrick controls him.

1153
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:42,060
Now Patrick controls him.

1154
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,420
- So here's the thing.

1155
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,420
Yeah, this is maybe a good target for you guys

1156
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:50,600
for possession.

1157
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:55,080
Maybe even a three-way possession.

1158
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,920
- Whoa.

1159
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,600
- I try to possess him first.

1160
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,700
- Okay.

1161
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:00,940
- Well, I'm already stuck to him.

1162
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:02,700
- No, but that's only an animate object

1163
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,940
so you can Katamari.

1164
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:05,500
You can't Katamari guys.

1165
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:09,140
- To possess somebody, you have to knock them out cold.

1166
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:12,300
So you have to beat them up, knock them out.

1167
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,140
- I'm swinging the Vitamix.

1168
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,220
- I just start driving kind of over and over into his foot,

1169
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:18,820
kind of just doing nothing.

1170
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,740
Okay, all you guys roll initiative.

1171
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:22,580
Yes.

1172
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,140
I'm swinging the Vitamix to try and hit him in the head.

1173
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,420
I'm rolling initiative.

1174
00:51:27,420 --> 00:51:28,260
Okay.

1175
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:31,460
Oh, I got a nat 20.

1176
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:33,820
Me and Caleb both got nat 20s.

1177
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,940
And I got a two.

1178
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:36,260
All right, let me get the--

1179
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,380
The one roll where the nat 20 doesn't matter at all,

1180
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:39,700
we wasted it.

1181
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,980
It does matter on Patch's system.

1182
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:42,820
It does.

1183
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,460
It doesn't if we both get it.

1184
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:47,420
It's true, it's just whoever has the higher dex.

1185
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,420
We both have the same decks.

1186
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,420
It's whoever...

1187
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,420
is blue.

1188
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,420
I actually don't...

1189
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,420
I guess re-roll.

1190
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,420
It's whoever's better at the game Suica.

1191
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,420
Re-roll.

1192
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,420
Whoever has a higher win rate in the game,

1193
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,420
the web game Suica.

1194
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:07,420
I got a negative two somehow. Re-roll, bitch.

1195
00:52:07,420 --> 00:52:09,420
I re-rolled

1196
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,420
and I got a negative two. Not you.

1197
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,420
And I won the roll off.

1198
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:15,420
I won the roll off with a five.

1199
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:18,180
Ha ha ha ha bitch you got owned.

1200
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:19,020
- All right, cool.

1201
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,840
- Oh well.

1202
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,860
- You got a five.

1203
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:23,260
We got a, so we got, well really it's two 20s.

1204
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,500
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1205
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,700
- That's my guy, my, David Kleinfeld,

1206
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,140
he knows that he rolled badly and he's like fuck, fuck.

1207
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,940
- Blue car with his freeze powers.

1208
00:52:31,940 --> 00:52:35,920
Then we got David Kleinfeld with his lawyer powers.

1209
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,620
Then it's Peter, Grandpa Peter Griffin.

1210
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,640
And then it's Pat,

1211
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,380
aka-- - Pipe Dream Extreme

1212
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,660

00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:52,180
- Just calling you Pipe Dream.

1214
00:52:52,180 --> 00:52:54,500
Cool, hi.

1215
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:57,620
It's just easier for me, that's all.

1216
00:52:57,620 --> 00:52:59,620
I'm sorry, it's not like a big deal.

1217
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:03,500
All right, here, okay, we're in the corner office over here.

1218
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,540
- Whoa, this is a big ass office.

1219
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:06,440
- Yeah.

1220
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,180
Oh, I got a ton of-- - Oh, there's toilets in it?

1221
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:12,240
- Going forward, yeah, there's toilets right in the center.

1222
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:14,940
So if you want to use the center console for toilets.

1223
00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:15,900
All right, cool.

1224
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,660
So first of all, you have also the mom

1225
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,000
and Gary to contend with.

1226
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,520
So I don't know how you guys want to handle them.

1227
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,780
'Cause they are also here.

1228
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,440
- I don't care about them.

1229
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,680
I'll, I'm, I'm, I'll fuck it mask off.

1230
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,320
- Okay, cool.

1231
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,260
So you're up. - This is the part

1232
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:35,800
of the movie when the mom finds out that Chucky is alive.

1233
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,320
- You're up, blue car.

1234
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,160
It's up to you.

1235
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,080
- I am going to use my freeze ability.

1236
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:41,920
- Cool.

1237
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,200
So I can tell you what that'll do,

1238
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,680
'cause we don't have it written down,

1239
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,920
but it will shoot a 30 foot cone of frost damage.

1240
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:49,760
- 30 feet?

1241
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,280
(laughing)

1242
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,880
- I'm one half of it.

1243
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,400
(laughing)

1244
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:56,220
- What?

1245
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,240
- From a toy car, it comes out of the headlights.

1246
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:00,520
- Can you imagine a bug breathing fire?

1247
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,760
(laughing)

1248
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:05,400
- Do you think a dragon amount of fire?

1249
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:08,400
- Okay, and I would like to, does it have a,

1250
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,320
Is there a possibility to freeze them?

1251
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:13,200
- Yes, there is.

1252
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,040
They're gonna have to roll a con saving throw

1253
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:15,880
to see if they get frozen.

1254
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,800
- Okay, I'd like to put all three in my cone

1255
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,820
and then freeze them, my snow cone.

1256
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,180
- All three of your what?

1257
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,600
- All three of them, the women, children, men.

1258
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,440
- Okay.

1259
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:28,360
- In my snow cone and freeze them.

1260
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,400
- You're gonna have to step out of the place.

1261
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:32,240
- Okay.

1262
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,720
- You'll sort of zoom back here.

1263
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,480
And you'll just.

1264
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,640
- Just walk in the office.

1265
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,840
is seeing a small car zoom out of an office room.

1266
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:41,840
And it just...

1267
00:54:41,840 --> 00:54:43,840
(laughter)

1268
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,840
It's a giant cone of ice.

1269
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Okay, I...

1270
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,840
Cool, yeah.

1271
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:48,840
I coned them.

1272
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:49,840
Alright, cool.

1273
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:50,840
I'm gonna roll for them.

1274
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:53,240
It's a deck saving throw and then a con saving throw.

1275
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:56,240
So let's see how they do.

1276
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:59,240
Okay, he saves.

1277
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,200
She saves.

1278
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,280
He does not save.

1279
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,280
Better be Peter.

1280
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,280
And he...

1281
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,520
Okay, yeah.

1282
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:10,800
So they both take half damage, so roll 4d8.

1283
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:12,880
Okay.

1284
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,480
16.

1285
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,760
Okay, so they both take eight damage.

1286
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,440
So they are still alive, the two who got hit.

1287
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,200
Which is the boy and the-- Yeah, and the mom.

1288
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,280
But barely, they are holding on by a thread.

1289
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:32,380
What about the third?

1290
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:35,040
The third?

1291
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:40,880
Oh yeah, him? He failed both in his deck saving throw and he failed in his ability to not be frozen.

1292
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:41,680
So he is-

1293
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,680
So he's frozen?

1294
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,280
He's frozen. He is virtually incapacitated.

1295
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,920
So this would be- you like have a chance here on your next turn to possess him.

1296
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,280
Amazing.

1297
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:54,280
Right.

1298
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:00,040
Um, uh, yeah the boy right now and the mom are just like shivering cold.

1299
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,520
The mom doesn't understand what's going-

1300
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:08,800
"Why? Why? Why?" Like she somehow gets it more than anyone that there's something going on.

1301
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:08,800
You like it, bitch.

1302
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,440
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

1303
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:16,760
Cameron's getting Mio out of the front door. I'm going to get a glass of water while he does that.

1304
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:23,720
For sure. Yeah. The boy is Gary C. Enterprise is in shambles on the floor,

1305
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:27,300
or vowing to never buy a toy again

1306
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,560
and to only make sound investments in hot soda

1307
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:35,280
and cold dog startup type enterprises

1308
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,760
and to never have fun.

1309
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:40,360
- It's ruining his whole life.

1310
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,040
- It's ruining his whole everything.

1311
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:42,880
One toy.

1312
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,720
- One toy has ruined his life.

1313
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:44,540
- This is what Chucky's about.

1314
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:45,380
It's about how toys can do that.

1315
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:46,280
- Well, it's two toys.

1316
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,880
Okay, I am returned.

1317
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,720
- Cool.

1318
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:54,760
So what happened was, was he froze the, he froze Peter Griffin.

1319
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,500
He, um, nearly killed the two, the two other characters, but Peter Griffin's

1320
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:05,680
frozen and incapacitated, so he can be, um, possessed now by you guys.

1321
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,760
All right.

1322
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,120
Is it my turn?

1323
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,160
Is your turn.

1324
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,280
Okay.

1325
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:16,280
Uh, I, um, I'm going to go up to blue car.

1326
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:23,440
And I'm going to start hitting him with a paper clip like it's a

1327
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:28,880
crowbar a bunch of times. And I'm going like, "Fuck you, you

1328
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:33,080

1329
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,560

- Yeah, with that heavy armor.

1337
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:09,960
- It's just a paperclip.

1338
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:10,920
(laughing)

1339
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:11,760
- He has heavy armor.

1340
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,560
- I am hitting you, but it's just going, ding.

1341
00:58:13,560 --> 00:58:14,800
- Yeah.

1342
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:15,640
- And not really gonna--

1343
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:16,760
- You're smart, you tried to use the paperclip

1344
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,560
to reset me, man.

1345
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,560
- And now it's Peter Griffin's turn.

1346
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,640
- I'm blinded.

1347
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,480
- He is frozen, he's not gonna get out of that

1348
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:26,000
for a little bit, so he is just frozen there.

1349
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:30,740
The two other characters are just in shock as well.

1350
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,040
So it is your turn, Fucktoy, Pipe Dream.

1351
00:58:35,660 --> 00:58:38,160
You are right next to him.

1352
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,300
He dropped you and you fell behind the desk

1353
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,840
as the cone of ice flew over.

1354
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:45,960
So you did not end up getting frozen with Peter Griffin.

1355
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,260
- But you can-- - He's Vains?

1356
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,100
- You can possess him.

1357
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:52,460
- I don't know what Vains is, but it says racial fucking.

1358
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:54,580
- You're a guy, you had a backstory.

1359
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,660
- Racial fucking.

1360
00:58:55,660 --> 00:58:57,900
Why does that say racial fucking?

1361
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,740
- I don't know. - It says fuckling.

1362
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,940
- That's my race.

1363
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,060
My race is a fuckling.

1364
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:05,620
- Vains, racial fuckling. - This is the class I made.

1365
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:12,540
I don't think I have a bro you made racial fuckling with veins what has

1366
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:18,900
happened what happens with you use veins what is racial I think it really does

1367
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:24,260
like a Christopher Hitchens insult no I don't like saying that I think veins is

1368
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:30,860
an attribute sir sure what are you trying to do me I'm trying to kill Peter

1369
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:35,420
Peter Griffin and then my, well, if I get into his body,

1370
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:39,500
will I not want to kill myself anymore or?

1371
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,720
- You can only answer that.

1372
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:44,080
- I guess the possession would make me

1373
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,840
not want to kill myself.

1374
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:49,440
I realized all too soon, I realize,

1375
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,800
okay, so in this moment I realize

1376
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:54,600
that if I become human again,

1377
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:57,700
then I will have a part, like I can, you know,

1378
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,080
use my thumbs, I can go and walk around and stuff.

1379
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:02,340
(laughing)

1380
01:00:02,340 --> 01:00:06,060
I can go on a, like if I possess him,

1381
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:07,860
everything in my life is gonna change.

1382
01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:09,980
- Could use my thumbs.

1383
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:13,140
- Yes, dude. - So, I'm gonna try,

1384
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,500
I'm still in the room, right?

1385
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,620
- Oh, yeah.

1386
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,060
- I'm next to Peter Griffin.

1387
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:21,060
- Yeah, they are having like an inter-toy conflict.

1388
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:25,580
- Yeah, okay, then I'm gonna try and possess,

1389
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:28,860
I'm going to try to do the, what's it, the ritual of Dabella.

1390
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:31,900
I'm going to try and do that.

1391
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,000
- What do you chant?

1392
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,140
- Hey Dabella.

1393
01:00:37,140 --> 01:00:42,820
Not really, I fucked up.

1394
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:44,180
I fucked up.

1395
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:49,180
I had a shootout with the cops

1396
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,300
and it kind of made me realize,

1397
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:54,860
this is less like child's play

1398
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,860
it's more like the movie Fluke.

1399
01:00:56,860 --> 01:00:58,860
Uh...

1400
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:00,860
- Debella says, I don't know Fluke.

1401
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,860
What's Fluke?

1402
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,860
- Fluke is a movie about Eric Stoltz

1403
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:06,860
uh... being reincarnated

1404
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:08,860
as his family dog

1405
01:01:08,860 --> 01:01:10,860
and watching his friend from work

1406
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:12,860
steal his wife and he can't do anything

1407
01:01:12,860 --> 01:01:14,860
about it because he's a dog. - Oh, I know about this movie.

1408
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,860
Yeah. - Um...

1409
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,860
I guess it's more like Fluke that uh...

1410
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,860
uh... losing my form

1411
01:01:20,860 --> 01:01:22,860
my...

1412
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:28,940
My human form has made me realize that life is precious, and I shouldn't end the lives of others

1413
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:34,280
I'm actually turning a new leaf. I shouldn't end the lives of others and wait you're gonna

1414
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,780
I can take this this guy. I'm just gonna lead a normal life after this

1415
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:41,660
The worst possible result

1416
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:45,580
What do you mean

1417
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:49,460
I'm gonna get away with all my crimes, and then I'm just gonna walk away scot-free

1418
01:01:50,580 --> 01:01:53,140
'Cause I died in the toy factory.

1419
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,460
- Do you think that's a good result

1420
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,980
for a murderer to walk away free?

1421
01:01:56,980 --> 01:02:00,140
Reveals a lot about your internally held beliefs.

1422
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,280
- So, Democrat, here's how this works.

1423
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:05,260
You can possess him uncontested right now.

1424
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,140
He is frozen solid.

1425
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,700
- Well, I'm just gonna do that then.

1426
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,100
- So you can do that.

1427
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:12,900
You will be frozen solid now.

1428
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,060
You two have a chance.

1429
01:02:16,060 --> 01:02:19,000
The second, like you guys each have a chance

1430
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,700
to like be able to possess Peter Griffin.

1431
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:23,300
If you do it like,

1432
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:25,080
(laughing)

1433
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,340
stupid sentence.

1434
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,120
- So dumb.

1435
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:30,600
- You guys each have a chance to do it.

1436
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,700
You can either do it and it'll be like a contest.

1437
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:37,640
But right now, Pat is gonna have a like plus three

1438
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,160
on the rolls in those contests because he got there first.

1439
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:42,000
- Okay.

1440
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,640
- Each of you have a chance, or you can work together.

1441
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,480
Those are your options.

1442
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:46,520
- Davey Klinefeld is not interested at all.

1443
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,120
Like he probably is.

1444
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:52,060
He probably would be interested in possessing, but he's way too.

1445
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:53,860
He wants to drag everybody down.

1446
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:55,800
He can. That's what he cares about a lot more.

1447
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,900
So I don't even I won't roll to try to possess.

1448
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,300
I'll just try to stop them and try and kill them before they can do it.

1449
01:03:01,300 --> 01:03:03,500
OK, so you're up, Blue Car. What do you want to do?

1450
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,780
I want to possess Peter Griffin, man. OK.

1451
01:03:07,780 --> 01:03:12,920
So you roll up to him and now it's going to be just a straight D20 contest.

1452
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:15,420
OK, here I go.

1453
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,820
And you roll as well.

1454
01:03:16,820 --> 01:03:18,020
Fuck Vibrator.

1455
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:19,220
Oh, fuck me.

1456
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:20,420
I got a 8.

1457
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,920
I'm also doing a contest?

1458
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,520
If you want to possess.

1459
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,920
Well, how can I not?

1460
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:25,720
Holy shit.

1461
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,220
I'm trying to get them to stop.

1462
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:28,920
I'm trying to kill them.

1463
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:29,920
I guess while they do that.

1464
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,820
I don't know how they're going to handle it for me.

1465
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,720
On your turn, you can just attack in that case.

1466
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,520
Okay.

1467
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:34,920
All right.

1468
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:37,620
I'm sorry.

1469
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:38,920
Well, sorry, Blue Car.

1470
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:42,320
I just want one fucking gallon of gas.

1471
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,520
There are other people you could try to possess.

1472
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:47,260
You can finish knocking out the mom or the boy.

1473
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:50,740
The kid is too young, nobody's gonna sell gas to a kid.

1474
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:51,580
The mom?

1475
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,180
It's Gary C. Enterprise.

1476
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,880
The mom probably doesn't even know how to pump gas.

1477
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,220
Wait, I wanna possess Gary C. Enterprise.

1478
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:02,900
Okay, he has two HP left.

1479
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,740
If you knock him out right now.

1480
01:04:04,740 --> 01:04:06,580
I'm gonna knock him out right now.

1481
01:04:06,580 --> 01:04:08,560
Okay, roll with advantage.

1482
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,780
Okay.

1483
01:04:13,420 --> 01:04:16,180
Nice. With that dagger, you knocked him out cold.

1484
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:18,380
And you can now--

1485
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:20,420
- I used my dagger that I come with.

1486
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:23,740
I come with a two-inch recorder, a clipboard, and a dagger.

1487
01:04:23,740 --> 01:04:25,020
(laughing)

1488
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:26,620
- And the boy is knocked out.

1489
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:28,100
You take over his body.

1490
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:31,180
- Okay, I'm in it, I'm in it?

1491
01:04:31,180 --> 01:04:32,100
- You're in it.

1492
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,700
And you're not frozen solid.

1493
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:35,520
- I would just, I'm just gonna leave

1494
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,340
and exit the adventure.

1495
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,260
- You're leaving?

1496
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,420
- Yeah, I just wanted to make it canon

1497
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:46,060
that Gary's the Enterprise and the other campaigns we did

1498
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,580
that all along he was secretly the character

1499
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:50,220
David Kleinfeld from "Frozen."

1500
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:52,340
(laughing)

1501
01:04:52,340 --> 01:04:55,320
- Which makes sense, he's scheming, you know?

1502
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,780
Maybe he gets a little bit softer as he gets older.

1503
01:04:57,780 --> 01:04:58,900
- So maybe this will change,

1504
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:00,700
maybe some of this will come into play.

1505
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:04,700
So I just wanted to make a permanent change to the lore.

1506
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:06,060
So yeah, I'm just gonna walk out,

1507
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:08,260
walk off the screen and never be seen again.

1508
01:05:08,260 --> 01:05:10,100
- Yeah. - Me?

1509
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,260
- You just run away into the woods, blue car.

1510
01:05:12,260 --> 01:05:15,260
- I just go out of the door like Pokemon style.

1511
01:05:15,260 --> 01:05:16,700
I just hear, "Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo,"

1512
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:17,540
and I'm gone into the blackness.

1513
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:22,540
- Yeah, you see your two other Kleinfelds

1514
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:25,140
are just hard at work.

1515
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:26,700
Like, "Wait, what about the billion dollars?"

1516
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:27,540
And they see you walk out.

1517
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:28,560
- They're at each other's throat.

1518
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,820
They're both backstabbing each other.

1519
01:05:29,820 --> 01:05:31,100
- Yeah, yeah, love it.

1520
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,620
- He doesn't want any part of it.

1521
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:35,740
- I am going to knock out the mom and take over her body.

1522
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:40,060
- Okay, roll an attack, roll with advantage.

1523
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:47,500
with it. Wait, so I am Peter, frozen Peter Griffin right now. You're frozen Peter Griffin.

1524
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:53,460
So I'm just waiting to defrost. Once we're ahead of initiative, it'll happen much quicker.

1525
01:05:53,460 --> 01:06:01,220
I use my spear and I hit her. Yeah. Roll for damage. And it's a 20. Yeah, she's knocked

1526
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:07,860
out cold. 6. Nice. You take over her. You feel the worst anyone can ever feel. Yeah,

1527
01:06:07,860 --> 01:06:09,220
I feel really bad.

1528
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:11,300
Just bodily, it's not all right.

1529
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:13,140
I feel like there's a hole in my...

1530
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:15,860
Will I have a hole?

1531
01:06:15,860 --> 01:06:17,700
Yeah, you hear that noise now.

1532
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,140
(growling)

1533
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,180
Like loud and clear.

1534
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:22,820
Like holding a seashell up to your ear.

1535
01:06:22,820 --> 01:06:24,020
I'm just hearing ocean.

1536
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,540
She hears it all the time.

1537
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:27,380
Okay.

1538
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:28,200
Not just when she comes.

1539
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,040
Well, I wanna get out of this body fast,

1540
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:29,880
but I have a mission to accomplish.

1541
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,780
Wait, so now she's in the toy?

1542
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,300
'Cause it's a switch-a-roo, right?

1543
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:35,140
No.

1544
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:35,980
No, I knocked her out.

1545
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,260
The toy is now empty.

1546
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:42,000
I'm going to pick up the blue car and I'm going to go out to the parking lot of the office

1547
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,500
and siphon some gas.

1548
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:45,500
Okay, cool.

1549
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:46,500
You go do that.

1550
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,940
While you're doing that now, Peter Griffin is now unfrozen.

1551
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,300
He still has some HP.

1552
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:52,300
You're still him.

1553
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:53,300
Holy crap.

1554
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:57,300
What do you want to do?

1555
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,300
Holy crap!

1556
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,300
I'm free!

1557
01:06:59,300 --> 01:07:01,500
I'm free from being a sex toy!

1558
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:05,780
A poorly thought out character!

1559
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:07,860
And then I pick up the sex toy.

1560
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:19,080
I pick up the sex toy on the ground, the Pipe Dream Extreme Dirty Talk Fuck My Cock Masturbator.

1561
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,260
And I shove it up my butt.

1562
01:07:22,260 --> 01:07:25,140
Yeah, cool.

1563
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,500
Basically you're shoving your dead body up your own butt.

1564
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,060
Yeah, shoving my own dead body up my own butt.

1565
01:07:31,060 --> 01:07:33,380
And guess what happens?

1566
01:07:33,380 --> 01:07:34,380
What happens?

1567
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,540
- What happened?

1568
01:07:35,540 --> 01:07:36,380
- You die?

1569
01:07:36,380 --> 01:07:39,060
- All of my bones shoot out of my mouth.

1570
01:07:39,060 --> 01:07:40,460
- Fuck yes, yeah.

1571
01:07:40,460 --> 01:07:41,940
(laughing)

1572
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:42,780
You did it.

1573
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,100
You did it.

1574
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:45,920
(laughing)

1575
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,220
- I didn't want to do it.

1576
01:07:47,220 --> 01:07:50,700
I thought that it's a Tales from the Crypt style ending.

1577
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:51,540
- Amazing.

1578
01:07:51,540 --> 01:07:55,980
- Where I accidentally got what I wanted.

1579
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:56,820
- Oh wow, that's amazing.

1580
01:07:56,820 --> 01:07:58,380
- I got what I wanted, but at what cost?

1581
01:07:58,380 --> 01:07:59,700
- You did an amazing job.

1582
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:00,780
You did it.

1583
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,900
I love that.

1584
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:03,380
- Wow.

1585
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:04,380
That was great.

1586
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:06,460
And you siphon gas, mom?

1587
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,620
- Okay, yeah, so I pick up the blue car.

1588
01:08:08,620 --> 01:08:09,740
- That's so good, Package.

1589
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:11,740
- I bring it outside.

1590
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:15,680
I see a Ford Fiesta.

1591
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:17,900
I take a piece of,

1592
01:08:17,900 --> 01:08:18,740
a piece of,

1593
01:08:18,740 --> 01:08:23,060
like a water hose that's attached to the building,

1594
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,500
attached to the hookup.

1595
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,080
Put one side in the tank,

1596
01:08:26,080 --> 01:08:27,420
the other side in my mouth.

1597
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:30,300
And this lady's got some suction action going on.

1598
01:08:30,300 --> 01:08:31,140
- Of course she does.

1599
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,140
So I do a deep pull and oh my God,

1600
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,300
I can already hear the gas, here comes the gas.

1601
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,260
I put the blue car on the ground

1602
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,380
and I just kind of dump a bunch of gas

1603
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:44,060
on a blue Hot Wheels car that's sitting on the ground.

1604
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:50,460
And then I leave this body and I go back into the car.

1605
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,540
I don't wanna be this disgusting body.

1606
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:53,380
- Oh, I love it.

1607
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:57,260
- I finally have gas and I pull out onto the road

1608
01:08:57,260 --> 01:08:58,760
and this is what happens.

1609
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:00,700
I'm in the bike lane.

1610
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:03,700
I'm going about four miles an hour.

1611
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,700
It's fast for a toy.

1612
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:08,700
Call it's all an ass.

1613
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,700
Yeah, fuck.

1614
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:10,700
It's really fast.

1615
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,700
You run out of gas really fast.

1616
01:09:12,700 --> 01:09:14,700
And only it's only it didn't really last.

1617
01:09:14,700 --> 01:09:18,700
It was one gallon, but it barely any of it got in me.

1618
01:09:18,700 --> 01:09:20,700
She was just kind of spraying it on me.

1619
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,700
So I go about 30 feet.

1620
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,700
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm

1621
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,700
like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm

1622
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,700
like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm

1623
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:30,020
I go about 30 feet.

1624
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:30,860
- Yeah.

1625
01:09:30,860 --> 01:09:32,820
- And then the song ends.

1626
01:09:32,820 --> 01:09:34,740
- I like the idea of like,

1627
01:09:34,740 --> 01:09:36,020
the horror movie character.

1628
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:36,900
You're the only one who's like,

1629
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,140
has like a consistent potential horror background

1630
01:09:39,140 --> 01:09:42,780
where you just possess people for like 30 seconds at a time

1631
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,540
to get them to siphon gas for you.

1632
01:09:44,540 --> 01:09:46,620
(laughing)

1633
01:09:46,620 --> 01:09:48,140
- I'm trying to make it all the way through

1634
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,460
Life is a Highway by Rascal Flatts.

1635
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:52,220
20 seconds at a time.

1636
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:56,140
And now also I'm so far away from the office at this point.

1637
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:58,380
It's gonna take me hours to just crawl back.

1638
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:00,860
- Yeah, the trailer would just be like,

1639
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:02,280
yeah, something weird happened.

1640
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,040
I just started sucking on gas.

1641
01:10:04,040 --> 01:10:05,380
And it's like, that's what everyone says.

1642
01:10:05,380 --> 01:10:07,560
And then there's no horror.

1643
01:10:07,560 --> 01:10:11,820
- You drive by me, I'm the kid,

1644
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:16,180
and I have like another, I've cornered another kid

1645
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,340
in the schoolyard, and I'm like,

1646
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:20,140
I don't know what to tell you.

1647
01:10:20,140 --> 01:10:21,380
I got you out of detention.

1648
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,120
You owe me, you owe me.

1649
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,740
You owe me a dessert, you owe me pudding.

1650
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,660
and I'm just, I'm really getting up.

1651
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:29,500
- Yeah, you're finessing.

1652
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:30,780
- And yeah, I'm completely--

1653
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:31,740
- I love it.

1654
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:32,580
- Does it work? - Destroying him.

1655
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:33,680
- Do you get the pudding?

1656
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:34,520
- No.

1657
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:39,000
He starts, he gets his friends to beat me up.

1658
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,780
- And so it goes.

1659
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,020
And that's, and happy Halloween.

1660
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:46,500
- The bag of Peter Griffin flesh

1661
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,500
is sitting on the office floor.

1662
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:53,140
- It's more than a bag, it's blown everywhere.

1663
01:10:53,140 --> 01:10:54,620
- Yeah.

1664
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:58,780
I must have missed something crazy when I went to get that Amazon packet.

1665
01:10:58,780 --> 01:10:59,780
You really did.

1666
01:10:59,780 --> 01:11:02,780
Patrick exploded Peter Garnett.

1667
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:06,620
He did a good job, we'll tell you about it.

1668
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,280
Happy Halloween everyone.

1669
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:09,280
Happy Halloween.

1670
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:10,280
Happy Halloween.

1671
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,280
A blue car.

1672
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:16,280
A blue car.

1673
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,280
And also missed the poop.
