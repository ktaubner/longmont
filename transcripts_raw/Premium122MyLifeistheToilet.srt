00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
He's not going to replace me on the show.

172
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,200
He's not a monkey, he's Jungleskog.

173
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Yeah, he's a Jungleskog.

174
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
I'm sick of his ass.

175
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
His ass is perfectly brown and hairy.

176
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,200
This is probably the one ass I can handle in my damn fucking life.

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,200
He's basically one little shiny pearl.

178
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,200
Jungleskog.

179
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
I looked up how to pronounce it.

180
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,200
Younglskug?

181
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,200
More like, yeah, youngl in the toilet.

182
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,200
Youngl in the toilet.

183
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Give him to me.

184
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
That's a strange name for me.

185
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,200
Yeah, youngl will.

186
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,200
We're putting you in the toilet.

187
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,200
Don't touch my leg.

188
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Give Younglskug.

189
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I'm gonna touch your leg then.

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,200
I'm gonna tickle you.

191
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I wanna make sure he's okay, because you abused him.

192
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,200
You did Ray Rice to him.

193
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,800
One minute ago and I didn't like it.

194
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
What was that?

195
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,320
I saw someone with a t-shirt one time that said "Ray Rice told her twice."

196
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Damn.

197
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,080
That's a crazy public t-shirt.

198
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
That's a crazy...

199
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
Yeah.

200
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,840
Would you guys ever wear a t-shirt with the F word on it?

201
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,080
Yeah, I have before.

202
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,080
I don't like that.

203
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,160
I don't like that at all.

204
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,600
There's a skate company called Fucking Awesome.

205
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,600
Yeah.

206
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,080
It's funny that that's just completely...

207
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,340
It's like the coolest company, I think.

208
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,140
Like their graphics are really sick.

209
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,780
- I would say Google, but go ahead.

210
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:03,620
Alphabet.

211
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,420
- It's a really, like their graphics are really sick,

212
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,780

213
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,020

214
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,860

- That is cool.

222
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,260

00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,460
Oh, he's shy.

320
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,060
He doesn't want to say anything.

321
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,900
- He is really shy.

322
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:40,260
I want to say something I listen to this being it was you just that was crazy

323
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:44,100
frog you you we just heard you do it. No, why would you but you put the

324
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,020
microphone up to his mouth? He said it

325
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:51,420
see, but why would it be quieter yeah coming out of his mouth

326
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,060
Lingling, do you think that's a wingling? No, he's saying being being

327
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:01,940
you're trying to do the ventriloquism. Yeah ventriloquist are like did you

328
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,460
there's actually no difference in the in the sound between B and L. It's

329
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,300
impossible to tell you that's what they always say. Is L the B in ventriloquism?

330
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,700
I don't think it's L. I did yeah. I'm almost certain it's not. I think it might be M.

331
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:18,540
With M you still have to close your lips. I think it's D. I think it's definitely D.

332
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,780
Wait check this out. I learned a few ventriloquist tricks. Okay.

333
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
You stink at ventriloquism.

334
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,280
you

335

403
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,620

465
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,300
other day. So Andrew Jarecki movie the guy did the jinx and it's like this

466
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,740
apparently this guy like was trying to make a documentary about like like like

467
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:53,780
birthday clowns in New York and one of the guys that he got in the first

468
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,320
interview, just like we talked about being a clown for like five minutes and

469
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,920
then just started talking for like two hours about how his dad is like the

470
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:04,860
most horrible pedophile in New York City, and then so he just made this whole

471
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:09,340
documentary about this guy's dad instead. It's so funny dude that the guy

472
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,600
I'm a clown. I'm a clown and my dad is like an evil pedophile who is in jail and

473
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,840
then died. I wonder what the demographics are for clowns on that.

474
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:25,480
As far as pedophile dads. Oh dude it's gotta be huge.

475
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:28,640
Yeah right that's gotta be like yeah it's like one circle.

476
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,520
Everybody's like yeah you're a combination of your mom and your dad and

477
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,600
a pedophile mixed with a girl is a clown. Mm-hmm. Right? It's a pedophile that

478
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:43,720
wears lipstick yeah exactly yeah exactly not every not every pedophile is a clown

479
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:48,240
but every clown is a pedophile every clown was every clown is half pedophile

480
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,800
yeah sometimes it's dominant actually yeah and like blade - yeah yeah the

481
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:58,080
alleles there's one one clown who can walk through the name blue can walk

482
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,320
through the birthday party without even getting turned on yeah that's that's the

483
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
That's clown blade.

484
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
The party walker.

485
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Yeah, the party walker.

486
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:16,320
But he still fights like the reaper vampires with like three mouths or whatever.

487
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,320
They need to do a Dexter for pedophiles.

488
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,320
That's what they should have done. You saw they brought Dexter back or they did a revival season or whatever.

489
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,320
That's what it should have been.

490
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,320
Yeah, yeah, I'm a pedophile.

491
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
Dexter shows up and is just like, "Yup, I'm back."

492
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
"Yup, I'm back, but something's changed."

493
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Yeah, little Dexter.

494
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
That show is so funny.

495
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Dexter's the stupidest show I've ever been in.

496
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
The fact that they make that show and they give him like, it's a,

497
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,320
they give him like, like, sitcom narration.

498
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
Yeah.

499
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,320
Where they give him the exact, he has the exact voice when he's narrating of,

500
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,320
of, "Yup, that's me. You're probably wondering how I got into that situation."

501
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
"And that's my life."

502
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
"That's my crazy ass serial killer life."

503
00:28:57,320 --> 00:29:03,080
if I eat a brain, oh, he's a cannibal. I don't know. I've never he's a serial

524
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:30,820
It's just a show about a caveman guy killing dinosaurs and wizards basically.

525
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,320
Yeah.

526
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,820
How do you read the phone book?

527
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,820
No audio in it or no vocals.

528
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,820
Yeah, no dialogue.

529
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,820
No dialogue, that's the word.

530
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:43,820
Did you guys ever know anybody growing up who wanted to be a forensics person?

531
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:47,820
because I was singing about it. I feel like, you know, that's a job like you did. I don't

532
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:52,940
think I've ever met anybody who was like, I want to be like a forensics.

533
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,460
I knew somebody in...

534
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:58,220
But like, I don't know, I've like, I can't imagine what that person would be like as

535
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,140
like a middle schooler who wants to grow up to be like a forensics person.

536
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:08,460
I knew one guy, I knew a guy like that in college and he had explicit like...

537
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,220
Explicit porno on his phone.

538
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,660
He had schizophrenia and it was like...

539
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,220
Oh yeah.

540
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,980
It was like he... I remember...

541
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,740
He wanted to solve the death of his parents.

542
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,900
Well, I remember we went to... I had two classes with him. One...

543
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,980
Oh, is this someone you both knew?

544
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,780
No, this was at UNCW. I had one class with him the first semester of college,

545
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,700
and then a class with him like a year later than the next year.

546
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,460
We're not listening to you anymore. We're looking at...

547
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,500
I promise you're gonna like this.

548
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:33,980
Jungle Spirit.

549
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,500
And then that first semester, I had the class with him and he was like, "Yeah,

550
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:41,340
I want to be a forensics specialist." And then he was like, "Yeah, like..."

551
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:44,660
And it's crazy, like my dad has like schizophrenia,

552
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:47,320
and I've been like smoking a lot of weed,

553
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,960
which they say like makes it worse.

554
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,940
And I was like, oh, okay.

555
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,260
And then the next time I had a class with him a year later,

556
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,020
he had completely lost his mind.

557
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,860
- Yeah. - Yeah.

558
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,680
He would just like sit there

559
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,100
and just draw a circle on his notebook,

560
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:00,200
like over and over and over again.

561
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
And he would call me different names and shit.

562
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,540
It was awesome.

563
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,200
He had like a full psychotic break

564
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,340
and was just going to like a biology class.

565
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,620
- I feel like if I had smoked weed for another year,

566
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,660
that could have been me.

567
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,500
- That would have been cool.

568
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
if you just completely lost your mind.

569
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,700
It's cool that weed does make you crazy.

570
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,060
- Weed is so bad for you and it's gross.

571
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,900
- It's nasty.

572
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,220
- It is gross, it's green.

573
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:22,060
- It's green like shit. - It's literally green.

574
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,900
- It's green like it's good weed.

575
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,740
- Think about one thing.

576
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:28,840
- Good weed is the same color as a Pepto-Bismol shit.

577
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,960
- Yeah, exactly.

578
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,060
- Like that's how fucking bad weed is.

579
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,660
- Yeah, just a green, black, purple mix.

580
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:36,940
- But same color as a broccoli too,

581
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,780
and broccoli's pretty good.

582
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:42,180
but broccoli is not the black and brown and purple. Hey, if you cook it right,

583
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,180

Yeah, but like a mayo enema and all the shit all the mayo Sam blue jed out

646
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
I think you're a bit of a mayo douche

647
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:36,540
God Wow

648
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:43,620
Why would you say that in front of jungle sku he can't hear you he's covering he's not

649
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,620
sometimes

650
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:52,020

651
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:56,260
before you for you like disrespect to me so greatly. I don't want to in front of my child's

652
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:00,700
feeling. You and me are his parents. Yeah, Patrick's basically his brother. Patrick is

653
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:04,820
like his is like evil babysitter. You're a Simpsons. You're basically Rod. What's that?

654
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,940
You know that you know that baby evil babysitter from the

655
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
I'm Roderick so I'm really cool.

656
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
You're the guy that tries to kill Bart?

657
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
Yeah, I know.

658
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Roderick wasn't cool.

659
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,940
Yeah, that's you.

660
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,940
What are you talking about?

661
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,940
Roderick was cool.

662
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,940
He was a stick man.

663
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,940
He was a fucking ass hat.

664
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Are you talking about the movies?

665
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:18,940
No.

666
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,140
Roderick was a total poop bastard.

667
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,140
Roderick was cool.

668
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,140
He was in a band.

669
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:26,420
Didn't he make, aren't they making like a 25th Diary of a Wimpy Kid book now?

670
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,420
Yeah.

671
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,420
That's so cool.

672
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,420
It is crazy.

673
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
It's so easy to make those.

674
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,540
I remember being like, when they were coming out and being like, "Okay, four, that's a

675
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
little much.

676
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
Slow it down."

677
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:39,900
in an Uber the other night because I just really loudly went through all of the

678
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,460
like I saw they were making a new and I went through like the list of all of the

679
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:49,120
books and just kept being like oh my god dog's day off I mean that's a classic

680
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,860
and just like rating all of them and doing a complete ranking to the uber

681
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:57,940
driver yeah and I was just like asking him if he'd ever read it the books dude

682
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:04,340
it was funny and then I gave him a huge tip like two bucks $30 uber I was

683
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:12,500
way more than that. I ubered home to North Carolina. Oh yeah. Yeah it was a $700 uber.

684
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:18,540
You know you can pay like $300 to go from like New York to Boston. That's not that

685
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:22,700
good of a deal. Yeah it's not a good deal I'm just saying you can do it. I mean maybe

686
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,780
you're on the holidays though. But also like that kind of that sucks because

687
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:30,260
then the guy just has to drive back or hope that there's some other lunatic

688
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:34,180
who's gonna uber from Boston or maybe you guys just hang out.

689
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:38,340
He just waits for you to hang out. He just tags along with whatever you're doing.

690
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,700
Yeah. I mean I feel like if I made enough money I would do I would pay for

691
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:46,740
that ride just for the novelty of spending five hours with an uber driver.

692
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,380
You really could dig deep. Yeah. You could start to learn a lot.

693
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:55,460
It's like a my dinner with Andre where you record the whole uber driver thing

694
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:59,860
you guys just talk about life. I would love yeah that would be like that'd be

695
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,640
- That would be so fun.

696
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,560
- My Uber with Flandre.

697
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,940
- There's nobody named Flandre.

698
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,260
- It's not Flandre.

699
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,080
- No.

700
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,120
- You have not been in the Ubers I've been getting in.

701
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,340
- My Uber with fuck.

702
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,180
- My Uber with--

703
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,020
- Every once in a while you get a guy named fuck.

704
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,360
- I did get a guy named fuck.

705
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,200
- Yeah.

706
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,040
- I've had a couple of fucks.

707
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,620
- I got a guy named surrender.

708
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,860
- That's one of the best of all time.

709
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,700
- That is a good one.

710
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:21,520
- Surrender.

711
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,580
- I got a guy named surrender and I did surrender to him.

712
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,360
- My Uber with surrender.

713
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,200
- Mm-hmm.

714
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,500
- Yeah, that'd be a great conversation.

715
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,340
- Yeah.

716
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,720
Why'd your parents name you that?

717
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,720
Oh no, I changed my name to this.

718
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,720
You're just going, "Surrender."

719
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,720
Surrender. Surrender. Surrender.

720
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,720
Surrender to me.

721
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,720
If I started working as a cab driver, I would--

722
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,720
So what do you-- How long have you been with--

723
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:44,220
Shut up!

Surrender!

725
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,720
I would change my name to something funny.

726
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,720
Yeah, for sure.

727
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,720
I'd probably change my name to Dire Leah.

728
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,720
Dire Leah?

729
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Yeah.

730
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,720
It can't be two on the nose.

731
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:00,520

751
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:31,080
attack board. You better not ruin what I did. How? I know it will work. I just decided it

752
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:35,400
will work. Okay, so here we have our attack board that says mmm poop. And then what's

753
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:43,000
under it? And then there's a star eyes emoji and a dinner plate. Like you're so happy or

00:41:52,200 --> 00:42:04,680
down. Dude. So it says dude. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. But if you mirrored and then flipped it. Right, so if you changed out the

757
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:07,920
letters it would actually spell something different. Shut up man, why you got to

758
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,920
fuck everything up for me. It says boob pretty much. It says dude. It says boob almost though.

759
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:25,120
But hold on. What if you did like. If it said dude and then you flipped it. What the hell

760
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:32,120
it says boop. But I only did one. Yeah you only did one so it says boop. Alright watch

761
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,120
This is really hurting me.

762
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,120
Okay.

763
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:38,120
I can't see it because your hands are in the way.

764
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:40,120
Can you move your hands?

765
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,120
It says boob. I see it now.

766
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
So, do you guys feel like complete fucking asshats?

767
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,120
Okay, now move your hands away because I can't see it.

768
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,120
Yeah, but I would have to look in a mirror.

769
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,120
It just says "mmm-oh."

770
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,120
(Laughter)

771
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:54,120
We're keeping "mmm-oh."

772
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:56,120
That's better.

773
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:58,120
Alright, this is going to go here now.

774
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,120
This is good for...

775
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:02,840
This is a good way for us to distract ourselves.

776
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,840
Exactly.

777
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,720
It's good for me to practice spelling.

778
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,560
Yeah, you're going to get some hours in on this.

779
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,560
Yeah.

780
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,440
Oh, we need to get a wheel-in TV for the office and a collection of Schoolhouse Rock.

781
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,440
Yes.

782
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,720
So that we can, on the days we don't want to work, we can do that.

783
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,720
Yeah, that's pretty good.

784
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,720
That would be so fun.

785
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:25,400
If we just put one day, like the episode is just audio of just an entire Schoolhouse Rock.

786
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,400
Yeah.

787
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,400
Or like it's two people.

788
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,160
Planet Janet, she's a galaxy girl. We should do Mystery Science Theater 3000 with Schoolhouse Rock

789
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:35,560
when I'm sitting in front of a TV. Planet Janet, she's not a galaxy girl, she's only going to two

790
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:41,000
fucking planets, asshole. I didn't watch Schoolhouse Rock when they brought the TV in.

791
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:47,400
Conjunction, conjunction. I think this shows a bunch of junk. Yeah, I'm just a bill, more like

792
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:52,600
I'm just a shill for the government. That's right. These days this bill, this bill would probably be

793
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:57,640
getting molested these days yeah this little he little baby little child bill

794
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,640
probably although he's a child but he has a very deep bluesy voice all those

795
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,720
pedophiles up in Congress probably molest this this bill if you know now

796
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:09,400
yeah and that's true yeah something they would do in Junction Junction probably

797
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,080
as a little kid we get molested probably by the train guys to his function his

798
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:19,700
function is to be a toss-around boy for a congressman what's your function hooking

799
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,820
hooking up boys and man and politicians. That's right, you know, looking up with

800
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,600

804
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,340

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,380
I was seventeen years old, watched The School of Rock.

806
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,380
You didn't watch Beekman or Bill Nye?

807
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:50,380
Bill Nye was an atheistic son of a bitch and I never watched him.

808
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:53,380
True, and Beekman, thanks science for Bill Nye growing up.

809
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,380
I wasn't allowed to watch Bill Nye.

810
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,380
I did a homeschool thing from Bob Jones University for a while,

811
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,380
and they had their own Bill Nye guy who was like doing-

812
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:03,380
Bob Jones?

813
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,380
Yeah, who would like, he would like hold up a banana and he'd be like,

814
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:09,380
"This is why we believe in Christ, because the banana-"

815
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,380
He's a psycho.

816
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:16,180
You'd be like, "That's bananas, why? Look at the banana!"

817
00:45:16,180 --> 00:45:19,300
Why does it have a shell? It makes no sense!

818
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:22,420
You know what makes sense? Taking off the banana's shell!

819
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:27,580
The shell? The shell? The banana?

820
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,580
Yeah, they had their own.

821
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,980
It makes no sense! They're the shell! This isn't even gonna protect the banana!

822
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,580
It's not a shell! It's a wrapper! That's what they should call it!

823
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
I'm a rapper. I'm a rapper.

Google assistant. You're perfect 365. I put it. Can you find my penis? Yeah. And I

978
00:54:56,940 --> 00:55:03,220
called her a genius. Then I put my hands all over her like a clock. Yeah. We ran out of

979
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:09,220
good abs. Yeah. Is that the end of the episode or we got more time? We got like five minutes.

00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:14,820
We got more time. We have five minutes? Here wait, pause it. I have to pee so bad. Okay.

981
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:19,620
That's a good thing that we have to watch out for now. Well, no we're not going to say

982
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,500
anything about it because you never know when we could do the thing we were just about to

983
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,100
That's true. Stop fucking over all the plans man. It's true. I'm sorry.

984
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:29,620
Best five minutes ever go.

985
00:55:29,620 --> 00:55:35,140
Joke joke joke joke joke joke. Two peepees next to each other.

986
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:40,620
Me and Patrick's peepees right next to each other look at that. Yeah, and they're the same.

987
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:47,540
And he pulled my penis out of my pants. Yep. Oh my god. I just I just broke this chair. Really?

991
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,140
because you never have to wipe your butt you can just sit on this and all the

992
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,980
hell the hair hairs go up there's your butt for you and kind of filter it out

993
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:08,180
I can kind of see like a like a 3d animated like kind of Swiffer

994
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:12,980
commercial get your phone away from the mic I think it's making the okay what

997
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:25,580
I didn't, no it was important. Oh it was important. I bet you a hundred dollars it's about lunch.

998
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:32,060
It's not about lunch. What's it about? It's about someone coming into town. And five minutes

999
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:35,420
is really going to make or break it? Yes. Just because you're worried that Santa Claus

1000
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:40,020
is going to skip over your house? Yeah. Are you serious? Do you want me to call him? Do

1001
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:43,060
you want me to call him so you can talk to him? We've already talked to Santa Claus. I'm

1002
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,460
I'm done with this next time I'm at the mall, though I am taking my wedding ring

1003
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:46,880
off.

1004
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,880
Hey Santa

1005
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:58,660

1006
00:56:58,660 --> 00:57:01,280
wedding ring off and not knowing where to put and just putting in your mouth.

1007
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:07,160
This is embarrassing, but I am I've like been a huge fan of you like for so long

1008
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:12,060
is that is that just weird to say that weird by the way is that your sleigh? Oh,

1009
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:16,400
is it go fast oh and that's and that's that's probably like Dasher right I

1010
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,600
don't know yeah I knew it was - I knew it was - sure I don't tell them they all

1011
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:26,240
look the same to me well there's only one that I really can tell different

1012
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:33,280
yeah and like is Rudolph is he like a diva about it he seems like he would I

1013
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,160
think I'm not gonna be able to look anywhere else is it weird if I do the

1014
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:46,600
but about his nose red nose nose red nose he knows he knows he would probably

1015
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,920
be mad offended by some bullshit like that he's so Hollywood now things about

1016
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,360
Rudolph Rudolph has at this point he's got more fucking movies in Santa Claus

1017
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:58,240
himself that's true that yo-yo fucking red nose ass down that's right he

1018
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,160
forgets the people he came up with yeah yeah yeah Rudolph Rudolph started

1019
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:06,440
drinking juice and forgot he was who is drinking water with I heard that he was

1020
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:12,120
at the 40/40 club and like Dasher tried to get in, right? And Rudolph wouldn't list him.

1021
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:13,120
Whoa.

1022
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,360
Isn't that fucked? And the thing is, Dasher's a huge fan of Jack Harlow who was there that

1023
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,360
night.

1024
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,360
Yeah.

1025
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,360
And he was like trying to chill with Jack.

1026
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,600
Well, Rudolph and Jack Harlow go back pretty far.

1027
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,200
Not further than him and Dasher, though.

1028
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,200
Yeah, I guess that's true.

1029
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:28,200
Like him and Dasher, like literally, literally they're both reindeer.

1030
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,840
They were in the reindeer games together.

1031
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:35,160
They literally, but like originally it was like kind of fucked. You know what? I bet

1032
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,360
Rudolph's the holes of that shit against true like dude they were kids of course

1033
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:41,480
you either weren't letting you play in the ring your nose was big red and ugly

1034
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,440

1035
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,200

1036
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,840
surgery oh yeah that's pretty iced out his nose well that's like the stupid

1037
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,440
because now you can't does it make him see better at night well he doesn't have

00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,640

1039
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:04,880
see I think he just chills he doesn't have to work anymore yeah yeah he doesn't

1040
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:07,760
have to I mean yeah I heard a guy for that I heard him talking about it on that

1041
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:12,160
podcast with Lil Xan and he was just saying like yeah he did the Tim Dillon

1042
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:19,360
show yeah he just watches his movies now tell me what it's like what's it like

1043
00:59:19,360 --> 00:59:26,040
having Rudolph be the big star is that ever in all you yeah I don't know what

1044
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,560
Donner sounds like you bet you so funny if it's Tim Dillon talking to like a

1045
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:35,880
real reindeer and the reindeer just fucks up his whole studio. That's gotta be hard.

1046
00:59:35,880 --> 00:59:41,360
That's gotta be really hard. And it just fucking takes out a studio monitors just

1047
00:59:41,360 --> 00:59:46,760
like ah fucking Christ he's broken everything in here. I kind of felt like I

1048
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:50,480
was the Rudolph of my group yeah cuz but instead of a red nose I had my big fat

1049
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:57,960
gay body. Yep. Yep that's pretty much what that would sound like. Don't do that.

1050
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:03,680
Don't do that. Don't sell it out. I'm out here. Anyway, Christmas is basically fucking

1051
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:13,000
Invented to sell planes and basically Christmas used to be about playing Santa Claus

1052
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:16,640
He's basically only invented to sell nose coverings. Mm-hmm

1053
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:22,540
To cover up people's bright nose. Yeah, and all these women are now getting all these Rudolph surgeries

1054
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:24,620
And that's what they're called Rudolph surgery

1055
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:29,100
And now that you can be, you can be fat, you can be a fat model, you can be a model in a wheelchair,

1056
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:34,620
you never see someone with a red nose. Yeah, if you ask me, the only surgery a woman should be

1057
01:00:34,620 --> 01:00:40,220
getting is a c-section. Yep, keep that, keep that thang. Unless it's not my wife, in which case,

1058
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:46,060
no c-section. Also, while you're at it, leave the c-section open. Yep. What if I want a piece of

1059
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:51,260
that? How come my son get a piece of that? Not my sapphic ass getting a c-section. Keep my shit,

1060
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:53,740
Just keep my shit clean down there. That's right.

1061
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:59,260
You should get a c-section. Yeah. You should get a c-section to get a McDouble out of your stomach

1062
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:03,900
before it turns into nasty farts that I have to deal with. You should do it. I gotta take this

1063
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:10,540
fart mask off that's plugged into his butt. Yeah, I've been messing up. Yeah, I would love to get a

1064
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:15,500
c-section every single day after I eat something. Know what the c in c-section stands for? What?

1065
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:20,700
Caesar. Really? Like Caesar salad? Yeah. Yeah. Or like Caesar

1066
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:25,760
from Planet of the Apes. I don't know actually which

1067
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,200
the guy who invented the salad or the

1068
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:33,520
I don't know which one yeah, they should stop making those movies.

1069
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:38,040
What what plan they did, but they should never make another one. Why

1070
01:01:38,040 --> 01:01:41,440
not because what if an ape sees it and get some ideas true? Yeah,

1071
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,300
the original five point of the literally giving them you're giving they're all

1072
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:48,280
really good, but you're giving all of the good except for even himself or

1073
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:53,840
I'm giving them a bird on the whole plan start to finish how to ape the world

1074
01:01:53,840 --> 01:01:56,440
Well, I know they're not yeah, they are

1075
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,020
No, the it takes place it takes place way after they don't show any of the plan

1076
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:05,080
I mean know the new ones oh the new one. Yeah, the new ones they gave them

1077
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,180
Well, that's not the ape that's not the apes that do it

1078
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:10,520
It's the humans that do it to themselves and those ones and actually in both of them

1079
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:17,020
I guess it's actually our own that I'll be real though the apes actually learned how to pick up Xbox controllers and beat people

1080
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:21,500
That's true. I think there's a scene in that where the a literally a full ape team beats faze clan

1081
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:25,220
And that's like the point where they're like there's no turning back

1082
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,820
This planet is of the apes now

1083
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:30,980
They beat faze clan yeah

1084
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:33,580
Yeah

1085
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,380
Yeah

1086
01:02:35,380 --> 01:02:41,180
All right, don't just say yeah when you have nothing to say yeah, yeah, I need to learn some radio etiquette, okay?
