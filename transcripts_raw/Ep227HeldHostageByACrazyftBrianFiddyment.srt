27
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,820
- Your first thing is, oh, I'm gonna get tangled up

28
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,660
in the cord. - First thing, first thing.

29
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,820
- Damn!

30
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:05,060
- Foot locker.

31
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,860
- Cameron's a sneakerhead now.

32
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,100
Foot locker, y'all. - What type of these?

33
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,940
Adidas.

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,100
Ow!

35
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:10,940
Ow!

36
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,700
- Don't take 'em off the, dude.

37
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,540
- Why did you try to attack me?

38
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,540
- 'Cause you hurt me and I yelled ow and you kept going.

39
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,660
- Do you see what happens when you get

40
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,500
the first thing in the episode?

41
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,260
- No, he did second thing bad.

42
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,820
Second thing was bad, first thing was good.

43
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,160
- You did the first thing and you introduced a toy

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,000
that he could play with.

45
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,840
- That's not a toy, it's on my body.

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,320
- Your foot is my toy.

47
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:30,700
it's not a little bit like a little like told you that i don't know if you would

48
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,600
you start with you if there was a parrot or a parakeet sitting in a cage at

49
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,940
vicious lips which you stick your finger in that cage

50
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,040
i would ask what he did he's that

51
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,940
you stuck your finger in the cage

52
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,080
no he had a kiss finger you might have to know i think it was my foot you put

53
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,380
your fight directly him into my life that is the only i had to do it no no no

54
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:53,760
no no so i don't have a lot of the one who attacked him and that's what's

55
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
getting your retribution you don't attack the parakeet the parakeet attack

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,680
text you. You're completely reversal of everything. He's ruining this already. I'm not ruining

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,280
anything. I was going to start with mine. He's going to ruin this. With my new parody.

58
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,680
Go first thing. Okay, here's my parody. You guys are going to do the song. You guys are

59
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,280
going to do the song. You start over. You know that song, it's like pretty woman, walking.

60
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:15,720
Okay. It's not a boulder. Squidward, it's a rock. It's not a boulder. That is how you

61
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,080
do first thing. Squidward, it's a rock. It's not a boulder. That's the second part. Ready?

62
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,720
That pizza makes me smile, the pioneers rode these for miles.

63
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
Not once did he put his fingers near me.

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Until that point.

65
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
I'm scared.

66
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,720
But that's pretty good.

67
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,720
If I genuinely did hurt you and you weren't doing a joke, I'm very sorry.

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,720
It hurt me, that's why I yelled ow.

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I thought you were doing a joke.

70
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,720
I don't have flexible legs, I have very inflexible legs.

71
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
I actually have a problem with my legs.

72
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
I think you have maybe all of your bones fused together.

73
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,220
- It's my muscles that's the problem more than the bones.

74
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,800
My bones are probably strong.

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,100
- You don't even never ask me for a massage.

76
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,460
- You don't even never ask him for that.

77
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,700
- I don't even like massages because they injure me.

78
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,540
- I really am scared of getting a massage.

79
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,380
- What kind of crazy person are you?

80
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,580
- Nobody likes massages, okay.

81
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,420
- I like a massage from a big--

82
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:07,780
- I've had to be in full traction from a massage before.

83
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,620
- I would never have that hospital.

84
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,460
- I like a massage from the biggest woman ever.

85
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,300
- No you don't, no you don't.

86
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,980
- And she steps on my back and I go, "Oh!"

87
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,820
- I would never get a massage.

88
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,660
- It's an involuntary noise.

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,620
- Massage is a slippery slope.

90
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,100
I was talking to somebody about this the other day.

91
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,860
I would never get a massage for the same reason

92
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,260
I would never join the military.

93
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,460
- You'd never get a massage from like--

94
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,740
- Wait, okay, no, I need to hear what the same reason is.

95
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,860
- Okay, so I would never join the military

96
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,920
because I would be afraid that I would be

97
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,860
a perfect killing machine, and I would never join,

98
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,540
or I would never get a massage because I would be afraid

99
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,940
that I'd be too, just--

100
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,940
- You'd be too good at killing masseuses.

101
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,100
- No, I think I'd be too seductive.

102
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,900
I think whoever it was, they couldn't help themselves

103
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,940
and they'd end up molesting me.

104
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,100
- I don't think so.

105
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,900
- You know, okay, so--

106
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,580
It does suck when you get like the massage and they slip their thumb in your butthole

107
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:56,620
I've never had a massage. So I've been watching a lot of curb your enthusiasm. So I'm been kind of recently seeing etiquette through a different lens

108
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,860
and

109
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm wondering what would happen in a scenario when you go to the masseuse and they say undress to your level of comfort and I'm

110
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
like this

111
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,140
Yeah

112
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,700
Well, that wouldn't be that would probably be the more like

113
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:19,000
They're like kind of low, but and then I take I take I take off everything I leave on undies and socks

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,200
Yeah, missus comes back at a wine on the table. Did you leave your socks on?

115
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,740
Man I hate that I'm gonna curb your enthusiasm real-life scenario

116
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,620
Stop I haven't seen

117
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,920
To somebody basically half of the scenarios are he's that's true. Yeah

118
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:46,580
It is I was gonna say I haven't seen I've seen maybe the first season that show I was gonna say I get into a lot

119
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:51,060
Of those scenarios in my real life probably because of my level of intelligence and your race race

120
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,060
We're your racial remarks that you make

121
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,560
They're not on purpose Brad Paisley wrote a song about me

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,140
Honky-tonk lady with big-ass jokes

123
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:05,240
You're not there's no part of that's what the song's called

124
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,620
Paisley is that type of country song? I'm hung William

125
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,180
(laughing)

126
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,020
- Yeah, William Hung.

127
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,860
- I didn't know that about you.

128
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,140
- I'm hung like a horse down there.

129
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:15,980
(laughing)

130
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,300
And that's the reason why I can't go to the masseuse.

131
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,980
Is that, you know what I would just hate, dude?

132
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,540
- I've seen, you are a liar.

133
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,500
I've seen your penis.

134
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,860
- I'm hung like a fucking horse.

135
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,380
- You're hung like a church mouse.

136
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,260
What you are.

137
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,100
- Why you looking at mice penis?

138
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,580
- I'm hung like a church bell.

139
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,140
- Gay pedophile.

140
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,260
A mice is a child.

141
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,100
- A mice is not a child.

142
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,220
- A mice is a...

143
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,060
- A mouse is a baby.

144
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:36,980
- Is a rat the, no.

145
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,820
- No, it's not like veal.

146
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:44,820
Like that what's a mouse's baby called a mouse's baby or well what a cub

147
00:06:44,820 --> 00:07:00,600
Sensitive shitty says I can't say the c-word on YouTube man walking around saying the c-word yeah, we're 90 minutes in right 90

148
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,560
We should not have eaten that subway subway we got worms now

149
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,160
You claim that there was worms in all Subway food.

150
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,820
What's the kind of bread called that I got? Italian herbs and spices. That's what I thought. Herbs and cheese I mean.

151
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:24,920
Yeah, okay, because I always order I say that the one with herbs. Was yours crunchy at the end?

152
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,560
At the end? Like the part where the loaf starts.

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,720
The crunchy part of the bread. The part where the loaf starts because mine was crunchy. I think they over toasted it.

154
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,440
Oh.

155
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,900
You know, what's weird is subway leaves much to be desired. I don't know if anyone else has what the fuck

156
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:45,280
Hello

157
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280

158
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,360
Jubio did you do that?

159
00:07:49,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Fucking nightmare

160
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
You can all take a move

161
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,560
Why did you

162
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,080
Why did you tape our mouths shut if we're doing a podcast it doesn't make that much shot

163
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,780
I lost I lost two mustache hairs on this piece of tape man. I got a little mustache. I lost how did you lose more than me?

164
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:40,720
But now it looks like we're asking I need to I need to switch the levels can I put both tonight

165
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Fine everyone just be nice to me. Don't move. Don't don't be crazy. Okay, okay

166
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,880
All right, I've been a crazy situation, but sometimes a crazy guy

167
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,560
I thought that's a normal guy has to do crazy things. Okay, you just listen you seem like a good guy. Okay, I

168
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,760
Think I check your microphone. I think your mic is

You seem like a very very nice guy you seem like a normal guy the microphones not working

00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:18,460
Check oh my god. Is it working now? I fixed it for our captain

172
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:26,400

177
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:49,580
You know what I want. What do you want? You know what I want. What do you want?

178
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:56,880
Episode again, why why don't you do the Mad Libs anymore? I don't know it was like a three

179
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
It was just a thing that we are doing

180
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,620
Outside nobody likes the

181
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:13,500
Did you

182
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:21,060
What why does this look like

183
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,780
Dragons episodes or having Felix

184
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:39,260
episode with Brian! Is that your name? That's... hi! Hi! Oh my god! Hey Brian! Nice to meet you Brian! Today's been a crazy day! Hi! It's nice to meet you!

185
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:48,260
That was a nice try but he's crazy. That was a nice try you son of a bitch! I didn't plan that with him, he actually did that on his own.

186
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:54,260
Brian I'd just like to make it pretty clear that I didn't try to get the gun or distract you. They told me to do that. I didn't tell you that!

187
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,260
They both whisper. They told me to do it in my headphones.

188
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,760
I didn't say shit.

189
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,260
I didn't say anything.

190
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,260
Sounds like you told him to do it.

191
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,260
Cause he did. He seems pretty sure.

192
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,260
He's pretty sure you did it.

193
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,260
I didn't do shit to him.

194
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,260
Well now it's time for you all to dance.

195
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Bang, bang, dance with me.

196
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,260
Woah, woah.

197
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,260
I'm gonna shoot your feet.

198
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
You're pointing at your own feet.

199
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
Ow, ow, ow.

200
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,260
I was dancing too.

201
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,260
You need to calm down.

202
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,260
You need to calm down, Brian.

203
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,260
You're being a little bit crazy.

204
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,260
Jesus, it's been a crazy week for me. Let me tell you that.

205
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,260
I can imagine.

206
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,260
What's going on with you?

207
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:29,260
I was trying to get on comedy bang bang. I was trying to audition for comedy bang bang. I went to a room.

208
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:35,260
A guy who looked just like Reggie Watts, I swear. A guy who looked just like Paul Scheer.

209
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
You look like both. There was two different guys.

210
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,260
You look like two different guys.

211
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,260
Oh, okay.

212
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,260
You just don't try to point out any logical fallacies in what I say.

213
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,260
Okay, I'm sorry.

214
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:50,260
I'm just not in this real life. I'm not just messing around no more, okay?

215
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:50,760
Okay?

216
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,260
I can tell you're very serious.

217
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,760
Now, we're gonna do some mad lips.

218
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,260
Okay.

219
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:55,760
Okay?

220
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,260
Okay.

221
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,760
*sigh*

222
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Yeah, this is gonna be a good time.

223
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,760
You underhand slamming me?!

224
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,760
No editing tricks!

225
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,260
Don't-

226
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Don't you shut off my audio!

227
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,760
Don't you try and make me look short!

228
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,260
Don't you try and make me look-

229
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,760
*stutters*

230
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,260
We're not gonna try and make you look short.

231
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,260
We're not doing anything.

232
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:08,260
How's this? How's this?

233
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Yeah, we'll all get low.

234
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Everyone get low!

235
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:10,760
Okay.

236
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,260
Alright.

237
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,760
I got a small torso!

238
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,760
I understand-

239
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,260
I got a one foot torso!

240
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,760
You understand me?

241
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
People can't see at home, but his legs go-

242
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,260
Long legs.

243
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,980
- My legs are cramped up underneath this table,

244
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,900
but that's neither here nor there.

245
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,420
- It's not here or there, guys.

246
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,420
- Thank you.

247
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,260
- Okay.

248
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,500
- Thank you, Cameron, you're my favorite one so far.

249
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
That's two less caps in your ass.

250
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
- Okay, two less.

251
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,820
I don't know, are we getting to zero caps,

252
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,660
or is it just--

253
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,480
- Now it's time for the Mad Lib!

254
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
- Okay. - Okay.

255
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:45,060
- Mad Lib is called Brian's Birthday.

256
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,220
- Is it your birthday?

257
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:48,420
- That's neither here nor there!

258
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,460
Okay. Okay. That's also not here in North America. Alright. Alright. We'll do the Mad Lib.

259
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:57,620
Alright. We'll just do the Mad Lib. We don't have to have the gun in my face and the legs.

260
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:03,460
I'm not comfortable doing that yet! And stop playing footsie with me. I'm not comfortable stopping that either!

261
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:10,260
Alright. I'm very nervous. Okay. And it makes me feel comfortable. I'm stimming with your feet.

262
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:15,940
Okay. Alright. So don't mind if I, you know, play around a little. Okay, anyway!

263
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:18,660
Brian's birthday is the name of the ad-lib.

264
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,420
And I just found this one too.

265
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,740
I just found this one too, like you guys are saying.

266
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,340
OK.

267
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,300
You found this on the street?

268
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,020
I found this on the street, just like you guys are saying.

269
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,260
That's why there's dirt on it?

270
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,940
That's-- uh-huh.

271
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
Yeah.

272
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,660
Uh-huh.

273
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,160
OK.

274
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,660
All right.

275
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:32,780
Uh-huh.

276
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,540
That's why there's--

277
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,180
And that's dirt.

278
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,420
That's why there's dirt on it.

279
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,100
We believe dirt.

280
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,820
And it's dirt.

281
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,580
I believe you.

282
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,220
We believe you.

283
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:38,500
I have no reason not to believe you.

284
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,740
That's why there's dirt on it, and the smell is dirt too.

285
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,460
I can smell-- it smells just like dirt.

286
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,820
It smells-- it smells--

287
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,580
oh, yeah.

288
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,940
All I smell is dirt.

289
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,440
It's dirt!

290
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,740
It smells like the garden section at Home Depot.

291
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
You at home?

292
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
You at home?

293
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
You listening?

294
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Hands up!

295
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
Don't shoot into the microphone now.

296
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Don't shoot him.

297
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,100
Everybody listening at home, hands up right now!

298
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,060
You can shoot us, but don't shoot our listeners.

299
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,620
Don't point that gun into that microphone.

300
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,820
Don't you dare try to shoot our listeners.

301
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Let's just go with the mad lip.

302
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
Let's do the lip.

303
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,820
Alright, alright.

304
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,820
This is a mad lip I found.

305
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,820
I didn't make.

306
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,980
This is a mad guy who's making us do this.

307
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,980
Jesus Christ.

308
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,980
I'm sorry.

309
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,980
He said that.

310
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,580
Our voices, it's pretty easy to confuse our voices.

311

We have a lot. Yeah. That's why we did video. I do have a hard

312

Is that funny? Is that good for the video?

343
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,240
It is! That's funny!

344
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:27,240
Brian...

345
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:33,240
So, Brian went to go get them.

346
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:37,240
So that they could come to the fun gathering with celebrities.

347
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,240
Can we think of a name for a fun gathering with celebrities?

348
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,240
Gala.

349
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,240
Gala! Yes!

350
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,080
- Yes! - Okay, gala.

351
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,900
- Gala. - Gala.

352
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:45,740
- Yes!

353
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,580
- We'll do gala. - Gala, yes!

354
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,400
- Gala's funny.

355
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,240
- Birthday gala. - Gala.

356
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,360
- Birthday, so-- - Brian's birthday gala.

357
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:52,760
- Brian went to get them so that they could come

358
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,200
to Brian's birthday gala.

359
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,440
(clicking)

360
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,960
First, he went to the store where you buy hardware.

361
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,720
Anyone know, can think of a store where you buy hardware?

362
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,920
- Ace Hardware Store. - Hardware store.

363
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,120
- Hardware store. - Ace Hardware Store.

364
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,200
I'll just combine them, Ace Hardware Store.

365
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,480
- Okay. - All right.

366
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,320
- This is coming along good,

367
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,400
I can't wait to hear the finish.

368
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,040
yeah product me funny and bought some things I could hit your what can I hit

369
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:22,720
your head with thing I could hit your head the pillows pillows something a

370
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:29,160
little harder hello filled with the brick oh I guess a hammer hammer

371
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:37,320
we don't want to do a paintbrush or I wish I'd come up with something else but

372
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,480
spray paint, sandpaper. And Brian said, "Oh, these will be great to use for..." What's a

373
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:48,480
word for hitting you on the head if you disobey? What's a word for hitting you on the head?

374
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:57,000
Great for hitting... Punish? No, we're not going to... Not punishment, right? Retribute?

375
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,200
We don't want that. Maybe a reward. Reward. Reward. I like punish. We'll go with punish

376
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,800
Punish you in the head if you disobey.

377
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
I think reward is maybe funnier.

378
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,680
And then they would say, and then they would say,

379
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,840
what's an exclamation ending in ouch?

380
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,680
Youch?

381
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,640
Couch.

382
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,600
Like, ouch.

383
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,680
When you're walking down the street,

384
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,000
you see a new--

385
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,120
Couch.

386
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:22,960
Used couch.

387
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,800
Yay.

388
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Secondhand couch.

389
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,640
Or just out for a second.

390
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,460
Free couch.

391
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,300
That's kind of funny.

392
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,500
Green couch.

393
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,320
I like green couch, that's kind of funny.

394
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,240
I'm gonna go with green couch.

395
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,080
Okay.

396
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,920
Green couch.

397
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,540
be real funny. Yeah. It's done. Then, Brian waited at uh a

398
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,500
restaurant where you can have it your way. What is a

399
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,080
restaurant? You're going to have it your way. I mean, most

400
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,240
restaurants, I think you can kind of have it your way,

401
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,120
right? Yeah, I think that's true. I've been told no. I I

402
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,880
I very rarely. Sometimes, there's no substitutes. I

403
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:54,120
couldn't have a whopper in my way at most restaurants.

404
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,200
Something like that. Okay, well then, I guess if you're

405
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,040
saying, you're kind of leading us a little bit. I'm going to

406
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,960
be honest. It's not really how Mad Libs is supposed to work

407
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,280
and I, you feel like you're acting a little bit kind of

408
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:09,280
of like a loof when you really, you know, I'm going to say Burger King. Burger King.

409
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Burger King, that is such a good, Caleb!

410
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
Yeah, yeah.

411
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,280
Patrick, I'm liking Cameron and Caleb so far, you are pissing me off.

412
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,280
Oh, Pat.

413
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
You're pissing me off a little bit.

414
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
You have a good answer.

415
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,280
I said Burger King.

416
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,280
Well, Pat, you take the next one, Pat. You think you have a good one for the next one.

417
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,280
Yeah, come on.

418
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,280
Alright, let's drop Burger King.

419
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,280
We'll give the next one to you.

420
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,280
Until it was time to, synonym for capture or abduct.

421
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:39,280
Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse.

422
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,280
Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse.

423
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:51,280
Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse.

424
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:57,280
Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse. Abuse.

425
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:58,560
I forgot that you told me you liked it.

426
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,160
- Well, thank you for getting the message out.

427
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,160
- I said, "Sign up for the Patreon right now

428
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,120
and watch the Patreon Mad Libs!"

429
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:09,120
And then I followed up and said, "Did you do it?"

430
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,560
And if they didn't, I said, "Why not?"

431
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,260
And if they stopped responding, then I'd go,

432
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,720
"Please, please don't ignore me."

433
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,360
And then if they continue to ignore me, I go,

434
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,120
"What, did I do something to piss you off?

435
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm so sorry!"

436
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,260
And then if they kept ignoring me after that,

437
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:31,860
then we'd end up in a very similar situation to this,

438
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,580
where I kidnap them.

439
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:37,280
- Okay, well, thank you for all the fans at home.

440
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,120
You can maybe learn something.

441
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,260
This is super fun.

442
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:41,200
- What's a nicer word for victims?

443
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,040
- Friends.

444
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,780
- Nicer word for victims, friends.

445
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,760
- Hostage.

446
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,940
- Hostage is a little nicer than victim.

447
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,780
- Guest.

448
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,620
- You haven't heard of hostage yet.

449
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,440
- Guest.

450
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,120
- Guest, I like that.

451
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,700
Guest.

452
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,240
And then they all hung out together

453
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,160
and they had

454
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:59,200
thing you have when it's a good time

455
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,560
boner

456
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,640
boner?

457
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,000
you want to get a boner?

458
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,560
I like you guys but not like that

459
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,160
yeah that'd be gay

460
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,760
you're fitting right in

461
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
you fit in

462
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,680
oh no

463
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,120
is that a

464
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,120
okay i think we missed our chance

465
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,120
missed your chance

466
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:26,120
you had me down didn't ya

467
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
uh we were pretty close

468
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
you got me slipping and that was the last time

469
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
listen i'll admit it i have a 6 second reaction time

470
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
ok i've had it tested by the doctor

471
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
i kinda went like this a little bit

472
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
i was about to

473
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
that's why you can trust me

474
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
and uh

475
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
see it's just so late my reaction time

476
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
i was not so fast

477
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
you were lucky

478
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:52,340
Press the button again on accident. Yeah won't happen again though. I'm sure it won't

479
00:22:52,340 --> 00:23:00,860
Definitely won't happen again. So is there anything else in this matter? Okay, and then Brian Patrick and Caleb did

480
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:06,400
Something that should have been a long done a long time ago the podcast

481
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:14,440
Why is it Ryan Patrick and Caleb it's something that was supposed to be done a long time ago wait

482
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,400
Wait something that's supposed to be done a long time ago, but you didn't include Cameron

483
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:25,600
Caleb went back to Brian's what's an awesome thing party the party that I was having earlier Brian's birthday gala

484
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:34,800
And recorded an episode called name of the greatest podcast episode ever I guess it would be the new

485
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,660
That's what you think the whole so the episode is called the new

486
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:48,080
Madlibs episode the first of the rest which is all Madlibs

487
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,800
That's the episode

488
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,220
Featuring

489
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:02,460
Okay, so why is camera

490
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:09,360
God my fucking react guys. I want to grab it, but I have to do the levels terrible

491
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:17,360
I really got this close.

492
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,360
I was scared.

493
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,000
You had me scared for a second.

494
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,640
You should see me at the NFL combine.

495
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
It was pretty bad.

496
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,840
It was really, really bad.

497
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:31,240
The word for ending and the end, I guess the finale, the finale, the finale, the finale,

498
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,240
the finale.

499
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,240
All right.

500
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,240
So let's go.

501
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,240
OK, so that was the Mad Libs, right?

502
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,240
So, oh, excuse me.

503
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,240
We got to read what we have.

504
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,080
- Wow.

505
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,800
- Excuse me, we gotta read what we have.

506
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,980
- What?

507
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,280
- Gotta read what we have.

508
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,400
- Okay, so what do we have?

509
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:50,600
- All right, there was a big party at Brian's house.

510
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,160
Everybody was invited and they all showed up

511
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,920
except for the guys from Pot About List

512
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,040
even though I know they saw my email.

513
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,720
So Brian, the birthday boy, went to go get them

514
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:05,480
so that they could come to the Brian's birthday gala.

515
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,840
First, he went to the hardware store and bought some hammers.

516
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,400
And Brian said, oh, these will be great to use

517
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,020
for hitting, punishing.

518
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,360
And then they would say, a green couch.

519
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,240
[LAUGHTER]

520
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,560
Couch!

521
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
Then Brian waited at Burger King until it

522
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,360
was time to kidnap his guests.

523
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,160
I remember that.

524
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,540
And then they all hung out together and they had fun.

525
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:35,040
And Brian, Patrick, and Caleb did a podcast.

526
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:40,040
Brian, Patrick, and Caleb went back to Brian's birthday gala

527
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,760
and recorded an episode called the AdLibs episode,

528
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,880
which is now the first one of the rest of all of them,

529
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,320
which they're now AdLibs.

530
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,160
The end.

531
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,040
- Wow, that's a very nice story.

532
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,920
- So that was pretty, that was good, right?

533
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,040
That's what you wanted for your birthday,

534
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,840
was a whole Mad Lib.

535
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,320
- Not so fast!

536
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,160
- Okay, that--

537
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,440
- Not so fast, wait a second!

538
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
That is a scary--

539
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,800
I don't want to hear that from you.

540
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,320
OK.

541
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:07,840
That's enough.

542
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,560
Jesus Christ.

543
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,040
That is an intimidating--

544
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,960
We rent this place.

545
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
You can't--

546
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
We don't own this table either.

547
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,600
This table is not ours.

548
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,020
We rent this table month to month.

549
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:20,160
You must have seen no Gats Aloud sign on the front door.

550
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,800
There's another Mad Lib.

551
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,760
What the hell is this?

552
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,560
No, I've got a list!

553
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,360
I've got a list!

554
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:24,860
Oh, good.

555
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,880
Oh, he's got a list.

556
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,760
I've got a list!

557
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,600
You find this one on the street too?

558
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,640
I found the list outside.

559
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,360
In the same place?

560
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,040
I found the list outside.

561
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,360
Were these in your back pocket?

562
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,400
Why do they look like this?

563
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,760
I found the list also outside and it's got dirt on it.

564
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:41,760
I found the list but it also just happened to be all the demands that I have.

565
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
Alright.

566
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:43,760
I found the list.

567
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,760
I found it!

568
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Okay.

569
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:46,760
Alright.

570
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
I can tell that, yeah.

571
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
It's dirt.

572
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
It looks dirt.

573
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,760
And you take a smell.

574
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:51,760
What's that smell?

575
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
I already smelled it.

576
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,760
It's clearly dirt to me.

577
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
It's dirt.

578
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,760
That's a dirt smell.

579
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,760
That's a dirty dirt.

580
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
I actually don't think I need to smell the dirt.

581
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
I don't think you need to smell it.

582
00:26:58,760 --> 00:26:59,760
You know what dirt smells like?

583
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,760
Yeah, I guess I was a little.

584
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
Hello!

585
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
Excuse me.

586
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,760
excuse me hello

587
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,160
it's just dirt

588
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,240
it's just dirt

589
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,200
it's just dirt

590
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:10,760
okay

591
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,320
excuse me i've got a new piece of paper to read out loud

592
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,220
okay what's this one

593
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:18,320
this is called

594
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,280
reasons why i have to replace

595
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,480
cameron from pod about list

596
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,540
from podcast about list on the podcast about list

597
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:30,320
that's the name of the list?

598
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,840
that's yes

599
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,840
Yes! That's the name of my list!

600
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:39,840
The name of my list is the reasons why I will replace Cameron as the new podcast host.

601
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,840
So this is why the Mad Lib ended with just me, you, and Patrick going.

602
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
That makes so much sense.

603
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
I was wondering what one of you guys were going to pick up on that.

604
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,840
I think he picked up on it, but I was ignoring it.

605
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,840
None of you noticed.

606
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
I didn't know. It was too clever for me. I didn't know that.

607
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,440
- It was a little too, you're a little, listen,

608
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,280
we do something called lowbrow humor,

609
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,680
if you wanna check our TV Tropes page, Brian.

610
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:06,040
- I know I'm a big fan, except for only the

611
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,800
Mad Libs episodes, I think everything else is mid!

612
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,560
- You think it's mid?

613
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,920
- I think everything else is mid, except for the Mad Libs!

614
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:13,760
- Okay, that's fair.

615
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,680
- And there's a big reason why, and I'll tell you what,

616
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,080
it's this big dork right next to me here.

617
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,360
So number one reason why I'm gonna replace Cameron.

618
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,320
- If he didn't have a gun, I would defend you.

619
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,300
- Thank you.

620
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,140
but he's got a gun.

621
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,060
- Reason number one!

622
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,620
- Okay, what's number one?

623
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,460
- It's my birthday.

624
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,300
- Oh.

625
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:31,140
- It's my birthday.

626
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,460
The whole, remember in the Mad Lib when I was saying

627
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,300
it was Brian's birthday? - Oh, I thought

628
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,120
that was just a Mad Lib.

629
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,180
- Oh, me too.

630
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,220
- It's actually your birthday.

631
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,540
- It's actually my birthday.

632
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,500
It's my birthday today.

633
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,780
- Oh, that's nice.

634
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,220
- I wanna say I'm sorry.

635
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,260
- That's nice.

636
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,100
- Happy birthday.

637
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,300
- Happy birthday, Brian.

638
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,140
- Oh, let's do it.

639
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:51,060
- It's your special day. - Happy birth.

640
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,060
- I thought we were, that's copyright.

641
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,060
Oh shit.

642
00:28:54,060 --> 00:29:00,060
Happy birthday Brian, it's your special day.

643
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:04,900
Happy birthday Brian, hey hey hey.

644
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,580
And then go away.

645
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,580
And go away for your birthday.

646
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,420
And then go away on vacation.

647
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
On vacay.

648
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
Vacay.

649
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,420
That sounds nice.

650
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,420
But!

651
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:19,580
I don't know, because I have to work around the podcast schedule.

652
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:22,580
Because I'm going to be the new host!

653
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,580
I have a new host and we're gonna... maybe this guy goes on vacation forever.

654
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:33,580
Okay, number two! Reason why I should be the new host instead of Cameron...

655
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:38,580
'Cause I got... I have a lot of funny ideas! I have so many funny ideas!

656
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,580
Uh-huh. Like what?

657
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,580
Okay, here's... uh...

658
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:46,260
Ha! Okay, I have a funny idea.

659
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,860
For what if Lena Dunham

660
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,100
met Jake from State Farm?

661
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,100
I like this already. Which... Lena!

662
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,860
Oh, from Girls. Lena Dunham from Girls. The one and Jake from State Farm.

663
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:06,020
The old Jake or the new Jake? The new Jake from State Farm. The new and improved Jake from State Farm.

664
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,780
Okay. The buff one. Oh, he doesn't...

665
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,780
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

666
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,780
I could definitely not put up the numbers.

667
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
I know I could put up a pair of numbers.

668
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,780
Wait, you were saying that what if they met?

669
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,780
So this is what if

670
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,780
Lena Dunham and Jake from State Farm

671
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,780
met. You're going to act this out first?

672
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,780
I'm going to act this out. This is something I

673
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,780
do instead of whatever Cameron does.

674
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,780
And here it goes. End scene.

675
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,780
And please don't interrupt me.

676
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,780
End scene. And please, please don't interrupt me.

677
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:35,780
Okay. Okay. End scene. And please don't interrupt me.

678
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,780
Oh god, fuck.

679
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:38,780
Okay.

680
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,900
Um, uh, oh, Jake from State Farm.

681
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,540
Oh, I, my pussy.

682
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,900
Oh, I, my, I hurt my pussy.

683
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:52,820
I felt, I fell down on my pussy, uh, the other day and I think I bru, I, I broke it.

684
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,820
I think I broke my pussy.

685
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,420
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Lena Dunham, relax.

686
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:04,420
You don't have to get that personal to get State Farm's personal policy price plan.

687
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,540
That's my funny idea.

688
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:09,620
I don't know if I would have--

689
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,860
That's actually pretty funny.

690
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:15,900
That sounds like something we could do on the show.

691
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,540
That's what I'm saying, right?

692
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,100
I mean, my methods are a little extreme, but you see--

693
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,420
I mean, Lena Dunham--

694
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,180
you had me at broke my pussy.

695
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:25,180
That's already pretty funny.

696
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:27,780
That's something she would probably blog about or something.

697
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,460
She'd probably show it, too.

698
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,900
And then Jake from the same farm--

699
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,980
Probably pull down her pants and show it to Jake.

700
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:40,500
I feel like that was implied in the scene is that she's kind of showing the phone.

701
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:45,560
She's like has a big red kind of mayor phone that she's aiming at her broken pussy.

702
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,560
And Jake's like, "Ahh."

703
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
It's broken.

704
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,560
Yeah.

705
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,020
Well, because she's probably also on her period.

706
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,860
She's so stupid that she thinks that it means her pussy broke out.

707
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,860
Oh my God.

708
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,860
Oh my God.

709
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
Maybe I'm intellectualizing this too much.

710
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,860
No, no, I like it.

711
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,860
No, it's thematic.

712
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,980
Well, that's the kind of thing you're going to have to get used to if you're the new, if

713
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,980
you replace Cam.

714
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,980
I guess if you replace it listen

715
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:08,940
I

716
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:13,620
Agree, so if camera if you're gonna replace Cameron Cameron's kind of known as the kind of

717
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:18,740
The gentle giant first of all but also kind of the voice of reason you know

718
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,380
So I would need you to bring some element of that to the table

719
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,220
Because we already have like basically a crazy guy and a mentally disabled guy, and he's the voice of reason

720
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:31,380
So we need you to fill that you just have another funny guy. Just another crazy just three

721
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:37,140
crazy wild guy. I don't think you can do three crazy guys. I think you can do two crazy guys.

722
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:42,540
Reason number three that I will be number one on the host list. Also by the way I will

723
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:49,220
get first billing when I'm the new host. Okay. We don't really do billing. Well you got to

724
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:54,940
do it somehow. How do you order it now? Whose name goes first? Be honest. When what? I think

725
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:01,220
it's alphabetical. I think it's Caleb Cameron Patrick. Wow. Okay so it works alphabetically

726
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:03,360
- I'm gonna start, 'cause my name's Brian.

727
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,200
- So you-- - Oh yeah.

728
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,740
- Oh yeah, you'd be Brian or Brian.

729
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,400
- Brian, Caleb, Cameron.

730
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,720
- Well no, Cameron is already not.

731
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,440
- Maybe Brian, Caleb, Cameron.

732
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,520
Brian, Caleb, Brian, Patrick, Cameron,

733
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,320
Brian, Caleb, Cameron.

734
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,680
- I feel like it's one too many names.

735
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,880
- What if it was Caleb, Cameron, Patrick,

736
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,520
and then separately, Brian?

737
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,360
- Featuring Brian?

738
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,160
- Brian, and then another, a different podcast.

739
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,000
- Introducing Brian.

740
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,040
- Brian.

741
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,200
You say that to me and then I start seeing red.

742
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,040
You know what I mean?

743
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,840
- Okay, so scratch what I don't--

744
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,720
- I can foretell down the line--

745
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,320
- That could be your own sort of like,

746
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,560
you could do like a Bill Burr kind of Monday morning

747
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,440
podcast called like Brian Sees Red,

748
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,560
and you're in there and I bet you hate traffic

749
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,120
and bad weather, right?

750
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,400
So we could just get you, you could use the studio,

751
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,720
you could just click record.

752
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,520
- Hold on, let's do a test run right now.

753
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,240
Yeah, let's hear you talk about traffic.

754
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,200
- Okay, oh Jesus Christ.

755
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,480
Here it goes.

756
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,620
Hi, my, um, hello, welcome to the new episode of Pot About List

757
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,880
called Brian Sees Red, the new feature on Pot About List.

758
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,520
And I hate traffic.

759
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,320
Fuck. Fuck you, traffic.

760
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,660
Do you have a car?

761
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:19,160
I know.

762
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:22,460
I thought there was a solo thing, man.

763
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,820
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, that was the guy.

764
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:26,460
Come on, man. Kill me over.

765
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,360
That's my bad. I'm sorry.

766
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,920
Come on brother, alright now.

767
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,920
I like this "come on brother" that could be your catchphrase.

768
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,920
Kind of a southern...

769
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Come on brother, come on.

770
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,680
Put your thumb like this way.

771
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm just getting going here, about to drive in now.

772
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,200
See that's good man.

773
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
That is good.

774
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,080
It's way better than you being a new member of the podcast.

775
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,080
That's better.

776
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,080
You think that's good?

777
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Yeah.

778
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,080
Well I'm not satisfied!

779
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,080
Okay.

780
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,120
Because nothing makes me feel as good.

781
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:54,920
When I was listening to the Mad Lids episode about Pod About List, I was in the best relationship

782
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:03,320
life. I had a six-figure job. I had a full head of hair. I was six foot two. I was cruising

783
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:11,640
down the boulevard every day. I went to clubs. I went to football games. And now look at me.

784
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,000
Sounds like the perfect life.

785
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:20,120
Yeah. Now look at me. I wake up at 5 p.m. every day. I got a job working for Uber Eats,

786
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,240
Testing out food, testing out the bad deliveries

787
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,020
that didn't work out.

788
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,860
You test the bad food.

789
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,100
Everyone has to test, when the delivery doesn't work,

790
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,220
somebody, it gets thrown into a little,

791
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,320
well basically every restaurant has a tube.

792
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,040
And I'm sitting there at the other end of the tube

793
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,580
with my mouth open.

794
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:45,440
They put the, forgot to put the ketchup on the burger

795
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,280
or whatever, classic.

796
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,120
Yeah.

797
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,960
I hate when they do that.

798
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,780
That happened to me before.

799
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,620
And it shoots directly to you like a grenade.

800
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:54,120
And I'm on the other end, I'm getting paid, you know, the more I swallow, the more I get paid, okay?

801
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
It's commission?

802
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:03,120
It's commission based! So I gotta be sitting at that tube 20, sometimes 18 hours a day. 18, sometimes 20!

803
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,620
Wow, I didn't know that was a job.

804
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,620
Yeah.

805
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,620
You know what, my question is, where do I sign up for this job?

806
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,620
Honestly, you're making it sound pretty awesome. 18 hours just sitting there eating burgers with no ketchup?

807
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:15,620
I hate ketchup!

808
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,620
Yeah.

809
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:24,860
Oh well. It doesn't compare to the life I once had. I ruined it. I ruined it all. I kept waiting

810
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,180
for the new Mad Libs episode to come out. But it never did. And slowly but surely I fell

811
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:37,860
to the perils of online gambling. No. Don't even talk to me about it. We're very familiar

812
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:43,220
with online gambling. We're very, you know, pro. I'm pro online. I like gambling. We're

813
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:47,360
you're very pro. We're very pro

814
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:50,560
or steak.com. Yeah. Use code

815
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,160
Brian. I owe every cent I'll

816
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,960
ever make for the rest of my

817
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,100
life to Draftkings.com. Don't

818
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,560
end up like me kids. Don't ever

819
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,300
online gamble on pot about

820
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,100
list. I was I was going to be

821
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,580
mad any day. Every day. They

822
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,300
had an option on that. Oh, they

823
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,140
got all the action on draft.

824
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,120
Well, technically, I didn't even

825
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,720
right now. Technically, don't

826
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:14,780
we have to sign off on it can we get that taken down and i can't believe you're betting on

827
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,620
whether or not we're gonna do another madlib. They got all sorts of bets on there.

828
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:22,340
What hats are you gonna wear? Wait is that why you made us do a madlib?

829
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,540
That's... I...

830
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,780
Oh, you know what? I didn't even think to fix it like that with the gun and all.

831
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,260
You're gonna go to jail for that. I already ran out of money so that would have been a good first move.

832
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:36,380
You didn't even make the money off that? I just did this out of desperation.

833
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,940
And I want to be on the show.

834
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
yeah what i thought i was a little is

835
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,940
everybody i got a new list for you

836
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,940
list isn't it yes it is

837
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:45,940
alright now everybody

838
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
shut up

839
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,940
number three i'm an expert audio engineer

840
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,940
i'm looking at cameron doing these levels

841
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,940
that might could be louder

842
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,940
my voice should be way louder right now

843
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,940
i'm whispering you want me to turn it up

844
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,940
he keeps turning me down and i'm like whispering

845
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,940
over here i'm like i don't think anyone can even hear me

846
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,940
turn it up

847
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,940
turn it up all the way

848
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,940
This is perfect, okay

849
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:17,660
Well when you become the host will do that

850
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:27,140
He's laughing already

851
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,900
I'm funny volume the fun is a really funny voice

852
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:37,860
Well

853
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,860
You're not gonna need a much longer

854
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,540
You can use them to do whatever you like you'll be out on the street

855
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:48,300
You'll never podcast in this town again asshole. Can I podcast in Boston?

856
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:55,380
You can go to Boston podcast with the small fishes if you want, but the big boys, but I'm not getting killed

857
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,380
I

858
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:02,260
Might not kill you if you if you seed your seat without too much of a fight, okay

859
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:06,420
We can maybe make this we could let's let them continue the little edge

860
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,740
We'll hear the rest of this far on the list is I?

861
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,100
It's my birthday

862
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,000
Today, but also my birthday's could come up next year, too

863
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,220
So that's I guess that's my birthday right now, but also later. It's gonna be remember my birthday, too

864
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:22,220
So then you have to be nice to

865
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:27,380
Okay, I mean, I don't really see how that's different. I guess you're gonna have that every year - yeah

866
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:34,420
By this day and then you'll have you'll have to be nice to me

867
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:39,020
And then you'll wish you had already done it by now just being pretty nice to you right now

868
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:45,420
I think we have been called the cops or yeah, there's not even a single. There's no button as we don't dial 911

869
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,420
That's right

870
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:57,980
But you still have to keep his hostage

871
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:12,140
I thought you do I want that I guess I want to host it with you. So don't please don't know that's fine

872
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:15,020
I'm fine. Okay. Oh, no, this isn't cool. I don't like this.

873
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,020
Keep it like that. That's fine. You can continue the Lord.

874
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:19,020
Just for safekeeping, I might hold on to this for a second.

875
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,020
Okay. Yeah. I don't know why you gave it to me in the first place.

876
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,020
Well. It's funny. It's funny.

877
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:30,020
He's crazy. I'm crazy, alright? Okay.

878
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:33,020
I lost everything I have. I lost my six-figure job.

879
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:36,020
Yeah. Alright? What was that job?

880
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:42,020
I was working in sales. I was working in, I was doing customer, I was a customer service rep.

881
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,740
For for for zales you seem like you would be really good at

882
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:53,040
Working in sales at zales as a customer service rep. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you sold like jewelry to rappers

883
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,960
Did rappers go to zales?

884
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,580
Stout Rolex at zales

885
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:03,740
I'm not you know me. I'm not a jewelry man. You can get a rolling face at zales

886
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:08,380
Can you get do people go to like it's like polo G going to like K jewelers

887
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,420
Every kiss begins with Claire's wife

888
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:18,540
Claire's ears pierced your yg or one of the jeans

889
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:27,100
You know hip-hop's not the same since since Mac Miller left the frame that's true, but anyway number four I

890
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:34,940
Number five Cameron cut his hair recently and let's be honest folks. Yeah, that's best look

891
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:39,160
I like it was a cooler rocker. I liked him when he was a rocker

892
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,580
I'm still a rocker

893
00:41:42,580 --> 00:41:47,180
Look at that look at that right there. I will say that's pretty limp. That's pretty well

894
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,400
That's what rockers do like this right you look like you're gonna fit a fucking dick and balls

895
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,860
Yeah

896
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,500
You have to admit that

897
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:02,100
That's that's a gun that doesn't really prove. Yeah, I guess but but like this is like kind of like when you hurt

898
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,820
You know when you're a kid you know when you're a kid you start first I guess

899
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,500
I don't like this you know you do like the okay sign on your penis

900
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:15,780
That limp that looks like shit. What no you're so you're he's right your hair changed you the change the hair is

901
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,460

I think I'm on his side on this one. Yeah, you guys are on his side get your old hair back

903
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:31,100
Although maybe you want to keep it short cuz you'll be doing job interviews

904
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:35,700
soon. Um alright, number seven, everyone's afraid of Cameron.

905
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,500
Cameron's a scary guy. Cameron's got a scary uh scary look in

906
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:42,740
his eye. I don't like to make uh close eye contact with him

907
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:46,340
cuz he cuz he I've never seen such a glare. We don't talk

908
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:49,160
about it that much but yeah, me and Pat, we are, yeah, we're

909
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,280
scared of Cameron. Yeah. You guys are, you're scared of me?

910
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:56,480
I mean, just like I, you are bigger than us and you kind of

911
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,280
have a temper on you. I don't have a and you have a history of

912
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,520
violence so I just feel yes I'm a little bit scared of you there you think I have

913
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:13,900
a temper Patrick there well I'm speaking to you I'm speaking to you there's a lot

914
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:20,880
of glass on the on the ground here I don't know why what what don't know why

915
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:22,880
there's a lot of glass.

916
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,880
What are you saying?

917
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,880
What are you talking about?

918
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,880
His fluorescent tube parties.

919
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,880
Where he smashes the fluorescent tube.

920
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,880
I don't have fluorescent tube parties.

921
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,880
He smashes the fluorescent tube.

922
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:36,880
I don't do that.

923
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,880
I've never heard of that.

924
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,880
Yeah, because you're not the target of the tube.

925
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,880
Does he hit you with fluorescent tube?

926
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,880
You are not my tube target. I wish you were my tube target in a different sense.

927
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,880
He calls me.

928
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,880
He says I need you to come to the office and print something for me.

929
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,600
print something for me, my phone doesn't connect to the printer.

930
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
My phone doesn't connect to the printer.

931
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,040
His phone doesn't connect to the printer, so he...

932
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:01,360
And so I dropped six to ten times worth, days worth of fluorescent tubing.

933
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,160
Days of fluorescent tubing?

934
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,200
What happens six to ten times on six to ten different days.

935
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:06,720
Okay.

936
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,800
And maybe a day's worth is about ten tubes.

937
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,840
Sixty, ten?

938
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:10,320
Seventy.

939
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,400
Sixty to seventy.

940
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:14,360
He says that there's no ink in the printer, I lean over, I crouch,

941
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,360
and then he breaks a tube over my head.

942
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,200
That is...

943
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:17,800
Okay, that is...

944
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
That's not a temper thing though.

945
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
You said they were parties?

946
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,800
He calls it a party because he has snacks.

947
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,800
Ryan, you're... listen.

948
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,800
He's crazy and he even seems

949
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,800
taken aback by kind of how rude and...

950
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,800
A tube? Everybody in America

951
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,800
has tube parties.

952
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:35,800
That's like apple pie

953
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
or hot dogs on the 4th of July.

954
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,800
Not everybody has apple pie on 4th of July.

955
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,800
I said apple pie or hot dogs

956
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,800
on 4th of July. Some people have cake on 4th of July

957
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,800
because it's their birthday.

958
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:53,800
And on their birthday they think we're gonna tape four tubes together. I've never done a tube party on my birthday. That's - I wouldn't waste

959
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,760
Midnight you know you wouldn't do it

960
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,120
Would you do a two-party today? You wouldn't right?

961
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:04,120
We've been over the two-part, you know what I

962
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,760
I would rather hear the next reason that I have to die then keep talking about it

963
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:15,040
You know actually this is going into my this is my next point. Here is that Cameron is he's got he's got mass shooter in cell

964
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,900
vibes doesn't he? And I don't fuck with that.

965
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,200
I don't have mass shooter incel vibes.

966
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:21,200
You kind of do have.

967
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,640
My shirt has pets and animals on it.

968
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,640
But that's clearly ironic.

969
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,040
It's not ironic, it's cute.

970
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,800
You kind of do have a little bit of a mass shooter.

971
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:33,400
I'm not wearing it to cultivate a cute and affable thing so I can go up to anybody and

972
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,400
get into a building.

973
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,520
I don't think that's cute or affable. I think that it's really like your eyes.

974
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,520
It's not?

975
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,520
No, no, no, no.

976
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,080
I think it's your personality.

977
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,960
Yeah, and like kind of the way that you walk and move and look and talk.

978
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,660
and your beliefs as well.

979
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:46,500
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

980
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,520
Some of the things I've heard you say too, yeah.

981
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,120
- Yeah, you say shit all the time like,

982
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,320
eat the rich, you know?

983
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,240
And it's like, what are you, a mass shooter inso?

984
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:58,720
- Okay, well, didn't want this to get political.

985
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,120
- But everything is political to you.

986
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,760
- You guys might wanna look up a little thing called Chapo.

987
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,600
- Okay.

988
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,120
- And you're gonna look it up and you're gonna think,

989
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,360
the Mexican?

990
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,720
No, brother, and you shouldn't say the Mexican.

991
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,000
You should say the Mexican guy.

992
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,680
You're giving honestly, not just incel, kind of SJW vibes as well.

993
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,200
I'm not an SJW mass shooter vibe.

994
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,440
You kind of seem like a combo between an SJW and an incel mass shooter.

995
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,680
Those things can't be combined.

996
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:24,960
Okay, so choose one.

997
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:25,960
Incel or mass SJW?

998
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:26,960
You gotta pick one.

999
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,960
I mean, you're the one who loves them both so much.

1000
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:28,960
I don't have to pick one.

1001
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,960
You just pick one.

1002
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,680
Alright, are you an SJW or what are you?

1003
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,680
I'm just me.

1004
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,680
You are either an SJW or an incel.

1005
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,680
Alright, he's, so that's another.

1006
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,680
And what's the next one?

1007
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:36,680
I know the answer, it's incel.

1008
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,680
What's the next thing?

1009
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
And, okay, listen, listen, alright, I'm not an SJW.

1010
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,520
So what's the next thing?

1011
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,420
- And, okay listen, listen, all right.

1012
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:45,080
Now I said I used to be six foot two,

1013
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:47,120
I'm six feet tall now.

1014
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,320
- You lost two inches?

1015
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,840
- I lost two inches. - That's horrible.

1016
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,200
- It's just, it was--

1017
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,640
- You know what can help that is good posture.

1018
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,800
- And zinc. - Oh no.

1019
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,880
- You gotta start taking zinc.

1020
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,360
- Zinc and good posture, maybe get like a back aligner.

1021
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,520
- The rack.

1022
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,360
- The rack.

1023
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:05,640
- I'm hunched over on this tube about 18 hours a day.

1024
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,480
- Oh, so it's shrinking it around.

1025
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:07,760
- I've got murder on my back.

1026
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,240
Drinking me right not a lot of calcium in that food either

1027
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:17,840
No and Cameron's too tall this is my point is a camera Cameron Cameron's too tall. I mean what is this guy?

1028
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,840
He's like he's like a he's like

1029
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:22,600
Dikembe Mutombo

1030
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:26,480
That sounds like a mouse

1031
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,120
Pretty small mouth okay wait. I'm not a mouse

1032
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:36,120
I'm not a liar. I'm a jokester. I don't want to have to work with a liar. Are you really?

1033
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,120
Though my methods may be mad, there's a madness to them. There's a method to them. And that's

1034
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:43,120
what I'm saying is I'm opening your eyes now, I think.

1035
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,120
A little bit.

1036
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:50,120
Is that this guy is just dragging you guys down. I mean, where have you gone with this

1037
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,120
podcast? It's gone nowhere.

1038
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,120
I'm not a liar. I'm a jokester.

1039
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,120
I don't want to have to work with a liar.

1040
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:59,320
is that is that this guy is just dragging you guys down. I mean,

1041
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:01,560
where have you gone with this podcast? It's going nowhere.

1042
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,680
You know what I mean? Fast. Definitely. You know, so hitting

1043
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,440
the brick wall. I mean, this guy, do you think it's his

1044
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,600
fault? I think this guy is in control. He's he's like the

1045
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,960
puppet master. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I am not a puppet. He's like

1046
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:19,560
wait. I just shut up. I just imagined an SJW puppet master.

1047
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:22,360
Yeah. Actually, it's giving me a free song. Oh my god. Well,

1048
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:27,160
about it he's got a puppet fud. True. That's not a puppet that's a baby.

1049
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:32,520
Baby puppet. He has a little puppet mascot. That's not my mascot it's our mascot.

1050
00:48:32,520 --> 00:48:38,600
It's just as much you guys as puppet mascot. So you are a puppet master. That wasn't in the Madlibs episode.

1051
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:44,120
That wasn't in the Madlibs episode guys. Puppet master says what?

1052
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:49,400
What? Puppet master confirmed. What did you say? Moving on. I couldn't hear you.

1053
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:52,280
Moving on, my reason number 11 is that...

1054
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:54,200
Is that I'm...

1055
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,700
Is that I'm...

1056
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,040
I'm cute as a button!

1057
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,440
I'm so nice!

1058
00:48:58,440 --> 00:48:59,280
I'm sweet and cute!

1059
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:00,120
- Oh, wow.

1060
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:02,360
- I'm not gonna hurt you.

1061
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,960
- You do look really cute.

1062
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,360
- Don't I look so sweet and cute?

1063
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,800
- You remind me of Harry Styles.

1064
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,560
- Don't I look like Harry Styles right now?

1065
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,440
- Yeah, or, wow.

1066
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,480
- I'm so sweet and red.

1067
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,480
- God, you're good looking.

1068
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,680
- Don't you wanna just love me all day?

1069
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:18,520
- I wanna pinch your little cheek.

1070
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:22,520
I'm a nice looking man. I'm a tall drink of water.

1071
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:24,520
You're a hot tall cup.

1072
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:36,520
And also is that number 12 is that with the various things that I have said online and done in public as well as my criminal record,

1073
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:42,520
I'm thinking podcasting is the only job that will be acceptable, is tenable for me really.

1074
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:46,520
Well, I mean you know that we do background checks, right?

1075
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:50,120
We let's do a check right now. Okay.

1076
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,720
Well, do you have any criminal history?

1077
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:55,820
I knew this was coming.

1078
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:56,520
Yes.

1079
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,220
Have you ever done any drugs?

1080
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:03,220
Yeah, this is coming one and a half one and a half one and a

1081
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:06,620
half one and a half drugs one and a half of what drugs I do

1082
00:50:06,620 --> 00:50:07,520
one and a half.

1083
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,320
Zans I do one and a half Zans at the club the other day.

1084
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,420
That was your first time and only every time doing drugs.

1085
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:23,500
It was the other day, it was about two days ago, and I just said, "You know, I wanted

1086
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
to do some Zans."

1087
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,500
Yeah.

1088
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,540
So you said, "I'm going to do one and a half Zans."

1089
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,980
I said, "Well, I did one," and then I said, "This thing's not kicking in.

1090
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,020
This Zan ain't shit," you know, like that meme.

1091
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:37,020
And then, so I said, "Give me another one!

1092
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,020
Give me another one!"

1093
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:41,300
And I tried to wrestle it out of this motherfucker's hand and I only got half of it.

1094
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:42,300
It split in half.

1095
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,300
It split in half.

1096
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:44,300
Like a wishbone.

1097
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,300
A slow-mo probably.

1098
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:50,820
very strong grip strength. What were the effects of the Zan? I was barred out

1099
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:57,980
essentially. I actually was out like a light and slept through the flight.

1100
00:50:57,980 --> 00:51:07,780
Yeah I took a flight. You took a flight? Right after that? Yeah. You jumped out of a plane to nowhere?

1101
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:14,500
I wanted to go to LA. Two days ago you went to LA? Yeah, just for like vibes right? I wanted to go

1102
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
See if I could pitch some pilots

1103
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:22,980
Have some meetings. Okay, and what happened at the meeting with these producers?

1104
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:28,140
There wasn't a meeting. Let me tell you let me tell you that much right now. Is it similar to this?

1105
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:35,540
It was similar to this except this is actually you guys are a lot chiller about it than yeah

1106
00:51:35,540 --> 00:51:38,940
I mean adults whim I would say keep

1107
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:44,140
Don't change Rick and Morty you better not fucking change anything about Rick and Morty. Yeah, yeah

1108
00:51:44,140 --> 00:51:48,820
This was voices the same, but this was only two days ago. Just two days ago. Yes

1109
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:51,540
Man, yeah, they didn't like our pitch either

1110
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:58,060
We pitched a travel show where you go we would go and see all the famous spots where all the famous vines happened

1111
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,660
So we'd go to like the Zendaya is Michi wall

1112
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:05,660
Be cream the wall where dad backflip though, yeah

1113
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:12,540
Do the the place where the guy hits the skateboard or whatever and they said they said that nobody would recognize it. That's a street

1114
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:17,540
That's a wall. The Zendaya is Michi sign isn't even there anymore. Yeah, they change it to a different move

1115
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,380
So they just basically have no taste in comedy. Yeah, they're falling they fell off

1116
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:25,500
I mean, yeah, it's crazy. I mean you just gotta fucking

1117
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:30,940
Pitch it to it's it's all on FX these days all the real shit. I mean for sure

1118
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:34,020
Roku yeah

1119
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,140

1120
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:42,420
Samsung TV Samsung TV is on yeah, it's like all they want is animation anyway pretty much no travel shows

1121
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:48,660
Hey, hands up you motherfuckers. You thought I was running low on energy because I came in so hot. No

1122

1124
00:52:55,340 --> 00:53:00,620
Please hire me and don't do a background check into my criminal history

1125
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,540
We won't background check

1126
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:09,460
Don't ask me don't ask any of my friends about the contents of my character for character references

Cameron's not taught us how to have any riz?

1138
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,900
Cameron's never taught us anything.

1139
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,900
I know that he eats pussy all day.

1140
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,900
I tried to teach you guys some riz,

1141
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,900
you guys were not receptive.

1142
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:09,900
He comes in here and does this.

1143
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:11,900
He asks us to smell his double finger.

1144
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:13,900
And we say, "Why would you put two in there?"

1145
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:15,900
And you know, I'm so riz-less and I'm a wimp,

1146
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,900
I think, "He's doing the improv gun!"

1147
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,900
No, no, no, no, no.

1148
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,900
As I, what really happens, I tell you

1149
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
to smell my finger and it smells like my penis

1150
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,140
I jacked off into a girl from across the room into a girl. That's Riz. That's Riz

1151
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:38,240
It's called all these dope-ass fucking kung-fu Riz moves, and he's not teaching us bullshit Brian

1152
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,580
I wish I could take you guys to the Riz dojo, but you would not cut it the hojo

1153
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,620
Yeah, so you'll teach us how to fucking finger fuck

1154
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:50,620
How's about this? I'm gonna go to the bathroom really quick, and then cuz I

1155
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,620
I ran here.

1156
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:55,620
You've been sipping on that ginger ale.

1157
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:57,620
I've been sipping on the zero sugar ginger ale.

1158
00:54:57,620 --> 00:54:59,620
Thank you to Schweppes.

1159
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:01,620
You got that from Schweppes?

1160
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:03,620
Yeah, I went to Schweppes.

1161
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,620
This is the one,

1162
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:07,620
my one friend who still talks to me,

1163
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,620
he...

1164
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,620
You went to Schweppes? You went to our university?

1165
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:13,620
I, well, no.

1166
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:15,620
I mean, there's a campus there, but it's for the

1167
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,620
interns.

1168
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,620
But I went to Schweppes. I went to Schweppes HQ.

1169
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:26,620
My one friend who still talks to me is HRW Schweppes, and he has given me

1170
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:30,620
He's given me a lifetime supply of zero sugar ginger ale.

1171
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:31,620
That's very subtle.

1172
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,620
My favorite.

1173
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,620
I didn't know you knew Schweppes.

1174
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:38,620
That's just another thing that you bring to the table is that you could probably give us...

1175
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:43,620
Literally, literally. That's funny, right? Can I stay?

1176
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:45,620
We'll talk about it while he's in the bathroom.

1177
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:49,940
the battle. I've been sipping on the Schweppes awful. I gotta go peep and poop.

1178
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:54,740
But I'll be right back. You guys do me a favor and just don't call the cops.

1179
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:59,660
No, we're not gonna call the cops. There's no service in here.

1180
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:03,540
Yeah, it's in a basement. Okay, okay. I really don't want to kill anyone.

1181
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:08,100
I don't want to make you dance. We don't want to dance. You have no motive for this.

1182
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:12,020

door and the toilet yeah might take a minute you're bringing the Schweppes in

1186
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:33,380
the bathroom with you and I'm gonna take my ski mask just in case anyone

1187
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:35,780
recognizes me on the way the bathroom okay okay

1188
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,780
Usually my gun

1189
00:56:37,780 --> 00:56:53,620
We can't call the cops we lose our cred

1190
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:58,900
No, we call 3-1-1

1191
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:04,820
Or is that 411?

1192
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:05,820
Wait, what's your idea?

1193
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:06,820
Traveling?

1194
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:07,820
I was going to call 411.

1195
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:08,820
That does nothing for us.

1196
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:09,820
Yeah.

1197
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:13,820
Because, I mean, we've just had this back here for like a month or something.

1198
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:14,820
Oh, yeah.

1199
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:15,820
This gasoline?

1200
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,820
Jerry can.

1201
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:17,820
This gasoline.

1202
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:18,820
One gallon gasoline.

1203
00:57:18,820 --> 00:57:19,820
Oh my god, and I have my lunch.

1204
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,820
You brought your lunch?

1205
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:21,820
Oh.

1206
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,820
Big bowl of popcorn.

1207
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:26,820
And he's a food tester.

1208
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:28,820
Holy shit.

1209
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,820
We could tell.

1210
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,820
Oh my god, that is so sweet.

1211
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:35,320
- Okay, you go ahead. - Look out, look out.

1212
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,160
Okay.

1213
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,920
- And gasoline is poison, right?

1214
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,360
- I don't think you can eat it.

1215
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:43,340
- I think it ruins popcorn.

1216
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:44,680
- It definitely ruins popcorn.

1217
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:46,280
- It's melting the popcorn.

1218
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,760
- Yeah, I think it's corrosive.

1219
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:49,400
- And the-- - Shh, Kyle, he's gonna hear it.

1220
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,880
- Oh, I'm sorry, hold on, I'll keep my voice down.

1221
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,200
- Okay, just pour all the gasoline.

1222
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,200
- Yeah, just pour all the gasoline onto the popcorn.

1223
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,400
- Shh, shh.

1224
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,880
- Shut the fuck up. - Quiet.

1225
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:59,280
- Sorry, I have an Irish whisper in my voice.

1226
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,320
- That's probably enough.

1227
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,840
Okay, that should be all the gasoline on the popcorn. I hope he comes and eats this and kills him.

1228
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:06,840
Maybe in front of his seat. He's gonna smell it, man.

1229
00:58:06,840 --> 00:58:08,840
I just heard the toilet flush. It smells like fucking gasoline.

1230
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:12,840
Oh, hey, Brian! Oh, Brian!

1231
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,840
Hey, guys! We got you...

1232
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,840
I'm gonna get my ski mask. Yeah, get your...

1233
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,840
We got you this. You said...

1234
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,840
So, we had an idea...

1235
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,840
And it's your birthday.

1236
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,840
And because it's your birthday, we didn't have a cake.

1237
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,840
We had Caleb's lunch lying around.

1238
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,840
Uh-huh. And since you're a food tester...

1239
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,840
- Why don't you, um, taste--

1240
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,840
- Eat the popcorn.

1241
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,840
- The present.

1242
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:38,840
- Popcorn, huh?

1243
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,840
Well, hmm.

1244
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
Hmm.

1245
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:42,840
Hmm.

1246
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,840
- Smells pretty good.

1247
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:47,840
- It smells--

1248
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:48,840
- It does smell great.

1249
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,840
- It's heavily buttered.

1250
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:51,840
It's got a lot of butter on it.

1251
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:52,840
- It's an oily butter.

1252
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:53,840
It's an oily--

1253
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,840
- And you didn't eat anything before you came, right?

1254
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:07,280
Oh, no, no, just a banana and toast this morning with some coffee, of course, with my French

1255
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,280
press.

1256
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:09,280
Okay.

1257
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:14,320
You must be hungry then for, it's almost, what, almost three o'clock.

1258
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:21,680
You know what?

1259
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,160
I'm not hungry.

1260
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,480
You're not hungry.

1261
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,320
Actually, my appetite was spoiled.

1262
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,320
But it's good.

1263
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,860
really nasty crap in there and I just I don't want to I don't want to have to do

1264
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:33,480
that don't you want to refill I don't want to have to take another

1265
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:40,040
it's really good right lunch he eats every day popcorn and paper it's good

1266
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:47,840
it's good but it's good it's birth I can't eat it cuz it's but oh it's if I

1267
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:51,000
had eaten it this is what I would do it

1268
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:56,080
yes oh wow and I like and I like it even though I'm not hungry

1269
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:02,360
I'm not hungry. On second thought, you know what? I just really don't want to have a crap

1270
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:07,560
again later, you know? I just, I don't. I know if I eat now, I'm going to crap later.

1271
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,240
I just don't want to do it. I'll put this over here and when you do get hungry, you

1272
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:18,480
can eat it. Yeah. Right? That's very thoughtful. But until then, you should, we definitely

1273
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,040
should, let's not make any rash decisions on the future of the podcast and who's going

1274
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:25,200
to live or pass away.

1275
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:26,680
- We're not making any rash decisions.

1276
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:28,640
I thought we were making rash decisions.

1277
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,520
- Popcorn gives me a rash.

1278
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,360
- That's what we were talking about.

1279
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,280
- If I decided to eat it, I would get a rash.

1280
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,360
- And an incision.

1281
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,640
- Yeah.

1282
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,520
- And you know when you bite the popcorn kernel,

1283
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,600
it makes an incision in the roof of your mouth.

1284
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,120
- The corn gets stuck in the, ah, yes of course.

1285
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:44,960
My mistake, I'm so sorry.

1286
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,800
- No, it's okay.

1287
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:48,280
- I won't look at you that aggressively.

1288
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,400
But I still gotta keep an eye on you.

1289
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,240
- Okay, gotcha.

1290
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,400
So, okay, so you've hung out with us?

1291
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,440
- Let's look at the facts.

1292
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:55,280
- Let's look at the facts, all right?

1293
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,100
- Let's look at the facts, all right?

1294
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:56,940
- Let's look at the facts, come on.

1295
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:58,320
- We hung out, we had a good time.

1296
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:59,160
- We had a great time, right?

1297
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:00,000
- Yeah, we had a good time.

1298
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,240
- So here's the thing, man.

1299
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,080
- Yeah?

1300
01:01:02,080 --> 01:01:04,480
- We don't have to kill Cameron, or--

1301
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:05,320
- No.

1302
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,140
- Right?

1303
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,940
- I kind of was thinking we were all on the same page

1304
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,360
about this, we're all gonna kill him now.

1305
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,200
I thought we--

1306
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,020
- But--

1307
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:11,860
- Come on.

1308
01:01:11,860 --> 01:01:12,680
- Well, okay, we're not all on the same page.

1309
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:13,520
I mean--

1310
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:14,360
- Well, three against one, you know what I mean?

1311
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:17,920
versus one is still, I mean some cultures they don't,

1312
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,620
a one beats the three.

1313
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:23,180
- What culture would that be?

1314
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,020
- Polish.

1315
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:24,980
- Native American.

1316
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:29,780
- So you're saying we go by Polish rules

1317
01:01:29,780 --> 01:01:33,860
where minority rules in a voting situation.

1318
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:34,700
- Yeah.

1319
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:35,540
- Okay.

1320
01:01:35,540 --> 01:01:38,940
- Well, this minority right here,

1321
01:01:38,940 --> 01:01:40,620
in terms of who has a gun,

1322
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:44,100
I'm the, in that case I am the minority,

1323
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,180

Yeah, you said it's your birthday, so how old are you turning?

1336
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,860
How old am I turning?

1337
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:17,860
You mean in terms of years?

1338
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,860
Years, yeah, your year age.

1339
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:25,860
I guess today, if I go by today and then count back, 365, 365, 365, 365, 365, 365, 365, 365,

1340
01:02:25,860 --> 01:02:28,860
if I go by today and then count back...

1341
01:02:28,860 --> 01:02:33,860
365...365...365...366...

1342
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:37,860
Excellent sleep here...365...366...

1343
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:40,860
I think I'm turning... gosh...

1344
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,860
900 years old!

1345
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:44,860
I'm turning 900 years old, actually.

1346
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:45,860
900?

1347
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:46,860
Yeah, 900 years old.

1348
01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:48,860
That makes not even a lick of sense.

1349
01:02:48,860 --> 01:02:49,860
Wait, Brian.

1350
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,860
You can't live to 900 years old.

1351
01:02:50,860 --> 01:02:52,860
Nobody lives to be 900 years old.

1352
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,860
That's impossible.

1353
01:02:54,860 --> 01:02:59,420
Except for Yoda, but he disappeared and he turned 900.

1354
01:02:59,420 --> 01:03:00,420
Wait.

1355
01:03:00,420 --> 01:03:01,420
But that can't be.

1356
01:03:01,420 --> 01:03:02,420
But that can't be.

1357
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:03,420
Wait, what's happening to you?

1358
01:03:03,420 --> 01:03:04,420
But that can't be.

1359
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:05,420
That can't be.

1360
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,420
That can't be.

1361
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:07,420
No!

1362
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:08,420
No!

1363
01:03:08,420 --> 01:03:09,420
I've been defeated!

1364
01:03:09,420 --> 01:03:10,420
Wow, that solves that problem, I guess.

1365
01:03:10,420 --> 01:03:11,420
It's not that big of a deal, right?

1366
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:12,420
Yeah.

1367
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:13,420
And now we've got a free gun.

1368
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,420
That's cool.

1369
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:15,420
Whoa!

1370
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:16,420
Whoa!

1371
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:17,420
Whoa!

1372
01:03:17,420 --> 01:03:18,420
Whoa!

1373
01:03:18,420 --> 01:03:19,420
Whoa!

1374
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:20,420
Whoa!

1375
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:21,420
Whoa!

1376
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:22,420
Whoa!

1377
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,420
Whoa!

1378
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:24,420
Whoa!

1379
01:03:24,420 --> 01:03:32,020
Oh nice gun time gun time gun time gun time gun time gun time

1380
01:03:32,020 --> 01:03:32,520
Bye!

1381
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:33,020
Stop!

1382
01:03:33,020 --> 01:03:36,380
