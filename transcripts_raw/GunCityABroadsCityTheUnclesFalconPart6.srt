1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,980
Last time on Gun City, a broad city, the Uncle's Falcon. Our boys finally went into the Matrix 2

2
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:18,260
with all of its splendid second life type perverts, its vaporwave aesthetics, shifting architecture and

3
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:23,520
landscapes, the posts and the vibes. But before they did that, they visited the Mad Suckler with

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,020
John Carlo the Bullfrog in tow. They sucked on some fingers and they made a deal. Take care of

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:34,340
Jeff Tiedrich, the king of posts in The Matrix 2, and then they can use his The Matrix 2

6
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,340
ports whenever they want.

7
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,700
The detectives agreed, and after belittling a pig, they strapped in, sucked on a binky,

8
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,260
and became the selves they always dreamed of being.

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,620
Ray William Johnson became Jack Black.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:50,340
Blotas Pits, whoops, Blotas Pits became Caleb Pits.

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,180
And Patrick Yoder became Caleb Pits 2.

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:58,340
Upon entering, they received a call from Mommy Goodlegs, telling them to go track down freaking

13
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,820
Carol Baskin, an associate of hers, and a message from an unknown sender saying "he knows."

14
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,120
They went into Dematrix 2, sponsored by Teen Vogue, and began to make some noise.

15
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,860
They went into Jeff's pagoda on top of Mount Paul and embarrassed him with sly trickery,

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,620
disguises, and good old-fashioned posting your dick and balls on the internet.

17
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:21,180
Sufficiently beaten down, physically, emotionally, and financially, after his entire V pagoda

18
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,540
was destroyed, Jeff T. Dritch and his Totemo Warui Itto, or "Very Bad Men," got the message,

19
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:31,700
and the gang was free to pursue their next lead, courtesy of the mysterious mommy, freaking

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,540
carol basket, who lives up on sway lake.

21
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:39,960
So, blow toss, reminders for the session.

22
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,220
You have no techno slime points, so you might want to recharge.

23
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,460
If you do, we'll have to roll to see if you OD and shit.

24
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,460
Also, you have a monkey.

25
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,140
I used the monkey last time.

26
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,220
It's so funny that every time you have to remind him that he has a monkey.

27
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,780
I remember I have the monkey now.

28
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,580
just takes a while to get used to having a... it's like having a third arm.

29
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,580
Oh yeah, you had a third arm all the time if you had one.

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,580
I would never forget.

31
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,580
You would forget it all the time.

32
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,580
I would know... I would use that shit.

33
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,580
Everyone else would remind me.

34
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,740
I would use my third arm like every day.

35
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,420
It's like if you had a pet dog, you wouldn't feed it for like months on end.

36
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,580
You'd keep forgetting about it.

37
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:16,580
Okay, alright, maybe... maybe that'd be the...

38
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,580
Oh yeah, also, did you have to feed the monkey at some point?

39
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,020
Yeah, this monkey is malnourished.

40
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,020
I feed it you.

41
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,020
I feed pieces of you when you're sleeping.

42
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,660
I didn't make it a feeding mechanic, but we can do that if you want.

43
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,160
- No, it doesn't eat.

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,100
- It doesn't eat?

45
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,420
- No, it likes it better that way.

46
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,740
- To the Lord.

47
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,700
- No, dude, he likes it.

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:34,580
He loves not eating.

49
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,620
What are you talking about?

50
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,300
That's what I say to everyone.

51
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,860
I look at my poor malnourished monkey.

52
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,100
- Just sad, a sad monkey.

53
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:42,940
- Yeah.

54
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,980
- No, dude, he looks awesome.

55
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,480
He looks like the Slender Man.

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,980
Ray William Johnson, you still have disadvantage

57
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,140
on dexterity saving throws for the day.

58
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,980
- Let's go.

59
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,260
- And if you take techno slime,

60
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,060
You have to be careful because you risk becoming fully addicted because of what you've done.

61
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,060
Not worried about it.

62
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,060
Uh, Patrick Yoda.

63
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,820
I wrote, "Oh, great job last session trapping Jeff Teejers inside your weird hoverboard house."

64
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
Okay, yeah, that's basically all I wrote for you.

65
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,820
You're fine.

66
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:13,220
Do you have anything nice to say to me?

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,220
Yeah, what about us?

68
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,780
I did the best.

69
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,260
I guess I just liked that.

70
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,540
You don't get to dole out MVP awards, dude.

71
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,660
Okay, all right, all right.

72
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,180
I have something for all of you.

73
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:26,280
Lotas's Jeff Teder's disguise was inspired.

74
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,240
I would have to say.

75
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,160
- Okay.

76
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,980
- Ray William Johnson,

77
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,360
I believe you were the one who posted your dick and balls.

78
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,320
I think.

79
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,200
- Sounds like me.

80
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,640
- That was pretty good.

81
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,480
- Yeah, you all think I would do.

82
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,820
- I think the bit was that only one nice thing,

83
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,000
but you guys are kind of children.

84
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,840
So I was good.

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,660
I'm glad I, yeah.

86
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,500
- I feel better now.

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,340
- Yeah, yeah, good.

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,280
- Yeah.

89
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,120
- Yeah.

90
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,480
So right now you guys are outside of the Mount Pole.

91
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,880
just humiliate fucked up Jeff Tiedrich. That's right. And that's sort of where you're at.

92
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,360
So you can go to Soy Lake to meet with freaking Carol or you can do whatever. That's the game.

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,720
That's what's happening, baby. Whatever. Hmm. Damn. Do you guys want to open a restaurant

94
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:18,960
and do that for a few episodes? That sounds like a knockoff idea. Oh, that sounds great.

95
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:24,320
great for me. We're going to open a restaurant that takes three episodes to build.

96
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:31,600
Patches is literally a thousand yards staring directly. He just can't believe it dude. He

97
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,600
can't believe that we do this to him every week. There are, it's just like there's a

98
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,960
lot I'd let you do, you know. There's a lot I'm open to. I'm even open to that. Just have

99
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,640
to figure out how to do this Bob's Burgers subplot I guess.

100
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:51,040
Alright guys, here's my idea.

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,280
Hit us with it.

102
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:55,920
Tall burgers with tiny buns.

103
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:59,960
Tall burgers, short prices.

104
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:04,280
That sounds great.

105
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:10,560
What about hot dogs at cold temperatures?

106
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,120
I think we're gonna try it.

107
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,100
Let's call it the opposites restaurant.

108
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,540
Let's call it cold dogs.

109
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:21,460
Let's call it cold dogs.

110
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,460
And we give you hot mustard.

111
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,460
Wow.

112
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,800
I don't know why.

113
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,940
Hot soda.

114
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,900
Let's start a hot soda restaurant.

115
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,900
Freezing cold hot dogs.

116
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,300
It's called the hot soda shop.

117
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,020
And boiling hot beers.

118
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:39,900
Oh this is perfect for a Yoda like me.

119
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,780
all right is anybody know how to start a restaurant

120
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,260
actually i guess we have to go to college for it first okay

121
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,340
first we're going to need two years of college

122
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,140
okay yeah so there is a uh... is that i did is my idea okay okay one of us

123
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:59,540
handles culinary school

124
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,300
the other one handles marketing

125
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,140
and then one of us handles

126
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,380
met restaurant managing

127
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:11,740
okay those are the three things that it takes a restaurant luckily that that

128
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:15,180
they just started this semester

129
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:19,700
on that little and and will continue to be college well if they just started

130
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,320
we're gonna be late

131
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,740
white registration

132
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,400
the guys can probably go online and registered late for that because of

133
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,700
covid nineteen's covid nineteen

134
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:35,220
uh... and we just say can we say we open the restaurant

135
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,700
and then we go do whatever we can just come back to check in and absolutely

136
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,580
and other related to a rather head you know what yeah i want that we don't need

code pushes

217
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,000

that all the people at the lake leaks the

265
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:16,140
kind of in pockets

266
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,300
turn their heads towards you.

267
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:24,180
Not like, whatever it is, could be their heads, right?

268
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,380
And not all at once, but every once in a while.

269
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,700
And they have this blank, vacant stare as they do it.

270
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,040
And both of you guys actually, roll a history check.

271
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,300
- Finally.

272
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,140

273
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:41,060
- I've been waiting so many weeks for this.

274
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,300
- For the history check.

275
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,420
Nice, okay.

276
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,660
- Dude, 24.

00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,900
Yeah, um, uh, yeah, Patrick Yoda, this, this, this all doesn't,

278
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,480
this all feels kind of new to you.

279
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,000
The way that they're looking at you, the way that they're.

280
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,140
Motioning towards you, Ray William Johnson, you start to sort of, as you, as you see

281
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,140
how obviously they're sort of looking at you all with their vacant, strange stairs,

282
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,380
you start to recall that as you've been walking through to matrix too, you've

283
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,340
noticed that actually quite a bit that people seem to just turn their heads

284
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:16,300
towards you three, stare, and then just go back

285
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,400
to what they're doing.

286
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:21,060
And you also start to notice that some of them

287
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:26,060
walk towards you a bit, cock first, and then just stare.

288
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:30,040
And then they almost like snap out of it out of nowhere

289
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,660
and go back to doing what they're doing.

290
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,360
- It's the cockulous riff, dude.

291
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,540
- I think, I think I might be a celebrity.

292
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,780

293
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:46,300
I think i may be famous wow.

294
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,300
So this is what it's like.

295
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,300
What do we do now boys?

296
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:59,300
Well you can look a bit further down and see that there is the house that is carol baskins house.

297
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,300
You can obviously tell because it is completely painted in tiger stripes.

298
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,300
Well we gotta go there.

299
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,300

302
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:18,420
Yeah, maybe what we'll say

Yeah, the polar bear turns to you and says

307
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,540
All right, buddy, I'm gonna be honest. I was not ready for that voice. I'm gonna leave this conversation

Alright, well-

375
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,340
Alright, forget this! We're not gonna get them to drown themselves in the ocean!

376
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,340
We'll leave you alone, spiders.

377
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,840
But I ask you this.

378
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,840
Do you know of anybody on this beach who is extremely gullible?

379
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:43,440
Hmm, so the spider starts looking around with all the question I have a question. What's up?

380
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,840
Have you seen the spider that hides from gay people

381
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,840

*laughter*

385
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840

386
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,840

388
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,840
if i were you

389
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,840
i would kill myself by running into the ocean

390
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,840
i would jump in the ocean and stop breathing

391
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,840
he does he does

392
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
i made these NPCs

393
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,840
so you could kill them all

394
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,840
what's the deal

395
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,960
I see in the on this map in the middle of the ocean there's a giant dragon and also a giant

396
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
worm.

397
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480
Yeah, those are just people hanging out.

398
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,920
I yell from shore, "What up, worm?"

399
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,360
The worm swims over and he says, "Hey man."

400
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,200
"Hey man, you should go on land."

401
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,680
Okay, and he just does.

00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,680

451
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,040
uh...

452
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,040
and uh... freaking carol baskins ranch style home

453
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,940
looks like a rejected boogie nights location

454
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,700
covered head-to-toe in gaudy seventies decor and tiger stripes covering every

455
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,360
surface it strains the eyes to get a sense of where the floor begins in the

456
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,960
walls and

457
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,520
the other thing about freaking carol baskins ranch style home is

458
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,760
carol baskins freaking dead

459
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,560
You see the unmistakable visage of the glassy-eyed psycho laying dead in a pool of her own blood.

460
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,760
The stench is bearable.

461
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,560
Must have only been a couple days.

462
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,680
You see some choice bite marks as well, meaning her tigers have perhaps been well-fed during

463
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,680
this time.

464
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
There goes your contact.

465
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:23,520
Oh my god, husband's revenge!

466
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,920
Wait, she was our contact?

467
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,880
I thought we were supposed to come kill her.

468
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,320
Was I just not paying attention?

469
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,920
Yeah, I think so.

470
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,360
Alright, that makes sense.

471
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
I don't know how to clear that up.

472
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Shit.

473
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,360
You guys have full access to Carole Baskin's vast home.

474
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
I'm a tea bagger.

475
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Yeah, you tea bagger?

476
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,360
Yeah, a little bit of BM.

477
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Yeah, you tea bag her. That happens for sure.

478
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
Describe it to me.

479
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
You're Jack Black.

480
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,360
I'm Jack Black.

481
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,360
Tea bagging dead Carole Baskin.

482
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,360
Yeah, I tea bag her and I use her like Mr. Krabs uses the big dollar.

483
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:20,320
all

484
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,320
little dark in here so i turn on the oven to make it

485
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,040
uh... i'm

486
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:28,920
since i had inside and looking around for clues okay i i i have an idea it

487
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,880
would not go ahead

488
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,100
obviously you enroll in investigation check

489
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,240
sure yeah

490
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,920
uh...

491
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,680
pull this up

492
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,080
seventeen

493
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,120
and will resolve and second k

494
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,440
uh... i have

495
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,480
they have an idea i uh...

496
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,120
well we need a figure it is a book active crime scene we need to figure out

497
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,280
out some clues we have funds and looms

498
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,800
here i'll try

499
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,720
i'll trace smelling the body

500
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,580
which i get a pro-conservative person if

501
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,920
here all i guess

502
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,720
a perception check for that

503
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,280
okay

504
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,920
perception but i get

505
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,360
reasons and it's okay so that's pretty

506
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:12,920
the other side it would be a lot of us

507
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:19,920
you still a lot like my dick in my balls and

508
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:24,440
that's all you get out of that

509
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,320
uh... i'd like to let me try

510
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,920
yet

511
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,220
i wrote the fourteen

512
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,160
okay yeah

513
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,280
so you smell something other than her dick interval his dick is ballerina

514
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,080
so it may be said that there are

515
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,200
is taking balls

516
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,520
and uh...

517
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:52,520
You smell, obviously, the smell of, you know, some sort of awful musk that that real-life woman probably has

518
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,520
from just hanging out with tigers all day.

519
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:02,520
But you also smell that... you also smell, I would say, with your extra-sensitive Yoda nose.

520
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:07,520
There isn't... she hasn't been, like, visited by anybody.

521
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,800
Or rather it hasn't been anybody outside of here

522
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:22,320
Okay, the killer is in the house and also Cameron with that 17

523
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:30,600
As you're looking. Oh, sorry with the Yoda nose. I also smelled the Gats in the oven is getting really bad

524
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:36,940
Yeah blow toss is just like his eyes are just bloodshot he's just like

525
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,280
(laughing)

526
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,000
- Head just in the oven, just.

527
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,520
But with that 17 investigation in the kitchen,

528
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,860
you do sort of see behind the oven,

529
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,460
you like take your head out for a second

530
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,760
and you look behind the oven

531
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:53,280
and you see a series of ledgers tucked away,

532
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:58,280
of cyber ledgers for past businesses

533
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,960
that are tucked away in there.

534
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,160
Okay, I turn off the oven.

535
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,240
Mm-hmm.

536
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,120
Okay, good.

537
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,600
Yeah.

538
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,440
Yeah.

539
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,000
Well, I already looked inside the oven for long enough,

540
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,080
so I think it's okay to turn it off.

541
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,160
And I turn it off, and then I just fall over

542
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,760
and chip my tooth on the table.

543
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
Yeah, great.

544
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,760
And then I pick up the ledgers,

545
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,840
and I walk back to Patrick and Ray William Johnson.

546
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,080
Yeah.

547
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,400
Hey, guys, I found it.

548
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
What happened to your eyebrows?

549
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,760
Uh, yeah, yeah.

550
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,760
They're gone! It smells like fucking burnt hair in here!

551
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
You have, do you have alopecia?

552
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:44,500
What, did you just lose all your hair going through here? What's going on?

553
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,500
I was hanging out in the kitchen.

554
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
What did you do in there?

555
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I was looking around.

556
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,500
Did you do something with the oven?

557
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,000
What's in your hand?

558
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,000
No!

559
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I smell oven!

560
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
No!

561
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
You know I can smell things!

562
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
I turned on the light, that's it.

563
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Everyone perception check

564
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
Ted

565
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,800
All right, Patrick Yoda notices that the worm is gone

566
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,800
No house dust. Oh

567
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,120
Crap, where'd he go?

568
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:20,840
I'm right here. No the worm where the worm go. He's pretty good. Investigation worm is gone. Thank you

569
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,720
Do an investigation? Oh

570
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,440
Okay. Yeah, you go over to where the worm was and you notice a struggle. Oh

571
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:38,520
the

572
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:45,520
that

573
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:53,080
yes

574
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,880
the

575
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:02,880
the

576
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
That's right. 19, dude.

577
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Okay. So, Ray William Johnson, you at the sort of site of that struggle, realizing that that happened, you wander a bit more through, and you end up in the living room over here.

578
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:23,240
And what you start to see is what looks to be a iPad of some sort.

579
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:31,240
And it has no password on it.

580
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,240
And you're able to open it and see a few messages on it as well.

581
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:39,240
You realize that this is freaking Carole Baskin's iPad.

582
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Yeah, so you can definitely check the history.

583
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:45,240
I'm going to scroll through the messages for a minute.

584
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Yeah, you scroll through.

585
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:56,240
So you start to see that she had like a pretty hefty correspondence with a number of people that you guys kind of know.

586
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,240
One of them is a good old mommy, good legs, which makes sense.

587
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,240
She was her contact.

588
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:13,100
you see that they had a sort of a back and forth sort of complaining about

589
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:19,460
Papi Chuko and it seems like that they might have both owed him some sort of

590
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,300
money or something at some point and then it just sort of ends with her

591
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,980
saying mommy saying we'll talk but not here XO mommy and that correspondence

592
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:43,980
and

593
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:52,260
Jeff Tiedrich? No, you guys let him out. You see that they were probably, they looked like

594
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,620
they were kind of lovers at some point and also kind of colleagues. Like they kind of

595
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:04,660
would try to basically having a group DM to workshop posts kind of thing. And also you

596
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:10,580
see that at some point he was asking her insistently to send her tigers after the Sucklo's drug

597
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:13,620
Runners, which is kind of consistent with what the sucka was saying

598
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:20,980
But that she was kind of refused she was not interested and the last message from him was I

599
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:28,840
Know Carol that you're being a bit difficult, but we have a fucking tiny brain freak running his techno slam garbage across my realm

600
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:33,860
Yes, my wrong fuck face. Sorry. We need a bigger piece of the pie for us

601
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,180
What kind of psycho ass fucker shit do you have to be to not get that?

602
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:44,040
Whatever China if you're listening, let's get freaking Carol on board with the plan and that was sent like two months ago. I've had nothing

603
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:52,580
You also scroll a bit further down and you see a correspondence between her and Haseki tsune

604
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:57,420
It seems that they were like pretty good friends

605
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,140
And then it seems like there's a falling out at some point and they're kind of talking around

606
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:10,200
What seems to be maybe an affair between Ma between them?

607
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:17,160
Carol and freaking Carol and Sean and it kind of ends with Hussie the last thing she said

608
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:25,480
OMG Carol you're being so annoying RN literally done with you and him for good can't believe you do this to me

609
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,880
lol, I'm going to deal with this myself literally by

610
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:33,280
Then it ends

611
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,820
and that's kind of all the messages you could see that she has.

612
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
Actually, you know what? Roll another investigation check.

613
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:41,820
Okay.

614
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,820
19 again.

615
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:47,820
You can see that she has in her contacts, she also has Papi Chuko,

616
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:49,820
and she also has Sean McElwee.

617
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,820
But all the conversations for both of them are deleted.

618
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,820
I have an idea.

619
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:55,820
I've been reading over...

620
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,820
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Before you do anything.

621
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,820
Mm-hmm.

622
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,820
Caleb...

623
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,100
Ray, plug your USB penis into the lightning dock.

624
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,100
But I just have Jack Black's penis. By the way, Jack, nice.

625
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,100
[laughter]

626
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Crap!

627
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,100
I've been reading these messages over Ray William Johnson's shoulder

628
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:27,100
and he only notices it because a giant splatter of drool falls onto the screen of the iPad.

629
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
I'm gonna text Sean.

630
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,100
Do it.

631
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:36,260
I'm gonna message Sean you text Sean. So what do you say pretend to be Carol say something sexy?

632
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,620

634
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:44,300
That I message blue bubble sends

635
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:51,060
But you have like it's a red the red exclamation point with the circle around it. Oh

636
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:55,500
No, that was my only idea I

637
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,140
I have an idea.

638
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
We prank call him.

639
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
No.

640
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,140
Oh, okay.

641
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,140
Well now I forget my idea.

642
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:14,140
I think your idea was to prank call him.

643
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,140
Well I was gonna

644
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140

Uh-huh.

You have disadvantage on the deck rolls for the next in-game 10 minutes.

677
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:04,500
I need you two boys who are outside the role of Perception Check.

678
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:08,500

679
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:16,020
Okay, Patrick Yoda, you hear like, sort of, some sort of scratching going on in the bedroom.

680
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,420
Some sort of scratching and like scuffing noise.

681
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,420
Oh.

682
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,420
Oh, no.

683
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:29,940
I don't know if it's just the techno slime right now, but I'm hearing some shit in the

684
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,100
bedroom.

685
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,100
Let's go.

686

I

690
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,600
You try to grab him by the scruff of his neck and he...

00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,400
-uh, shakes you off. -I do a tuck and roll.

692

Yeah, yeah, you roll.

693
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
-Alright, fine. -I have a plan!

694
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,000
I have a plan!

695
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,100
What's the plan?

696
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,900
I'm gonna knock on the door.

697
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,700
No.

698
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,700
No, trust me. I'm gonna knock on the door and see if there's an ask.

699
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,100
-Can I peek under-- -If anyone's in there.

700
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,400
Can I peek under the door?

701
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,800
-Is it closed? -Yeah, you can peek.

702
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,100
-No, yeah, it's closed. -Hold on, I've got a better idea.

703
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,400
Will you shut up?

704
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,800
And I hit the-- I hit console commands.

705
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Okay, and then what happens? I want you to describe it.

706
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:40,800
I do the console command, I do a wall, I do wireframe mode, I type in the wireframe code,

707
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,800
and now I can see the whole house in wireframe.

708
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,800
Okay, it doesn't work. What you just described doesn't work.

709
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,800
That's the worst thing I've ever done as a DM, but I did it. I finally did it. I finally just said no.

710
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,800
I'm sorry, you're not making any goddamn sense.

711
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I peek under the door to try and see what's going on in there.

712
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,800
Okay, yeah, roll a...

713
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Stealth? I mean, yeah, stealth first of all, because if you're trying to peek, that's a good call.

714
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,800
And then I guess an investigation?

715
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:19,800
Alright. Insight. My stealth is 20.

716
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Alright, yeah, and then just roll an insight check. I guess I'm just trying to get insight

717
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,060
to what's going on there.

718
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,560
- Crap. - Ooh.

719
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,880
- Holy shit, wow, okay.

720
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,780
Let me just, one second.

721
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,920
- Yes.

722
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,380
- Unless they-- - I'm about to solve

723
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,760
the mystery, guys.

724
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,760
- Yeah, so you are going under and look under the door

725
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:45,440
and you don't see anything at first,

726
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,040
but then you catch a glimpse of a shadow.

727
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,980
And as you sort of move your who ass head over,

728
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,800
you notice that it looks like

729
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,200
strange looking tiger

730
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,320
uh... is sort of like

731
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,260
white as a ghost

732
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:05,480
in the corner scared out of its mind

733
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,800

737
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:16,120
yeah with that insight check to you with the crit you can tell you doesn't seem

738
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,640

739
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:22,440

You're scrubbing down.

Well, I was playing with my ding and using the iPad.

So I'm going to get out of the bath.

I'm going to dry off and I'm going to head outside.

750
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,200
I put a chair under the doorknob so Caleb can't get out of the bathroom.

751
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,160
No, you haven't done that yet.

752
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
I did that already.

753
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,160

00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160

00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,440
He's in the bedroom.

757
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,080
You guys are in the bedroom and you see this funny looking tiger.

758
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,080
He's looking real scared.

759
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,080

Well, I already made a pact with myself that no one was gonna do that this session

776
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:28,560
My name's Tigger, um

781
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:54,360
Well, I was just cutting up those cucumber slices for her, like she likes, and if I get it wrong, she hits me.

782
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:59,360
So I was trying to make sure I got it right, and then I went to go bring it out to her, and I said, "Oh, freaking Carol!"

783
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:06,360
And then I go into the lobby, and there's blood everywhere, and she's dead, and there's a slash across her neck.

784
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,720
and oh that's then I I just I I panicked and I took a bite out of her and I ran

785
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,920
away in here and I've been in here ever since

786
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:24,440
wait freaking Carol Baskins is dead this place really is much all of my imagined

787
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,440
This place really is heaven.

788
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,440
What?

789
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,440
This place really is a dream.

790
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,440
This place really is the hall of my imagination.

791
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,440
What does that mean, dude?

792
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,440
This really is the hall of my imagination.

793
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:38,440
No.

794
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,440
Wow, this really is the hall of my imagination.

795
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:46,440
Do you think this was called the hall of imagination?

796
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,440

804
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,640

00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,880
any idea why the people in this

869
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,600
in the matrix to

870
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,560
might be pointing their penises at me

871
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,760
i think it's maybe cuz i'm a celebrity so i wanted to know if you've heard of me

872
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:21,860
maybe do i look very familiar to you

873
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:24,440
at this uh...

874
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,560
uh...

875
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,940
triggers face

876
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:30,420
kind of contorts for a second and he looks at you

877
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:32,080
uh...

878
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,000
and all of sudden he looks

879
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,500
really really fucking scared

880
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:38,000
uh...

881
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,600
and he starts stammering again.

882
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,000
He was just starting to calm down.

883
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,100
Now he's like, "I know who you three are.

884
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:48,400
I know who you three are.

885
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,320
Oh God, oh God, get away, get away from me, get away."

886
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:55,000
- We're not Alvin and the Chipmunks.

887
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,120
He's not Alvin and the Chipmunks, okay?

888
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,560
(laughing)

889
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,080
You get that all the time, but it's completely different.

890
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,640
- I know there's three of us,

891
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,120
but we're not Alvin and the Chipmunks.

892
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:05,640
- We all dress in different colors.

893
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:08,640
there's a tall one, and there's a fat one.

894
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:09,940
- Of course I'd be Alvin.

895
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:10,780
- Alvin!

896
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:11,600
(laughing)

897
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:14,520
- And roll, okay yeah, not roll anything actually.

898
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,800
- I scream Alvin from the bathroom.

899
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,800
- You guys get a ding on,

900
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,520
you get a little ring on your PSPs,

901
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,120
and it's Sullivan the frog, who's calling you right now.

902
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,040
- 'Sup bro?

903
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,360
- Yeah, and as you guys pick up the phone,

904
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:34,000
or whoever does, you hear a lot of fucking background noise,

905
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:35,000
like a huge fight.

906
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,300
Like your crashes and bangs,

907
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,200
gunshots, lasers.

908
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,960
And you hear Sullivan sort of trying to cut through it.

909
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:45,920
Hey, guys, sorry to bother you,

910
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:49,200
but it seems like the suckers den is getting raided.

911
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,800
I don't know what's going on.

912
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,880
You're like another crash sound.

913
00:48:55,880 --> 00:48:58,160
Turn that movie down, Sullivan.

914
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:05,080
Yeah, we can barely hear what you're saying, man.

915
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:08,080
"Ahh, it's on the move, you guys! It's real life!"

916
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:12,680
"Ahh, the pig is dead! I can't come in to see you guys!"

917
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:13,880
Serves him right.

918
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:18,480
And, uh, you see that the tig- the pigger is getting, like, more and more scared.

919
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:24,280
Uh, and then, all of a sudden, you hear Solvin, um, you hear a huge crash on the other line.

920
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:29,680
And you hear Solvin go, "AHH!" And you hear, um, a thump.

921
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:34,680
And then you hear some muffled voices over the phone.

922
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:39,760
Roll an insight check, Caleb, to see if you can hear it.

923
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,680
It seems like you're the one who answered the call.

924
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,020
- I've been so good with my checks.

925
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:44,860
- You're drinking it.

926
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,680
- Yeah, I can.

927
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,680
- It's not bad.

928
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,020
You can kind of make out some of the voices.

929
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:52,980
You can make out Sullivan whimpering softly,

930
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:54,640
like he's in a lot of pain.

931
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,900
And it's hard to tell though,

932
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,860
because meanwhile the the tigress is also freaking out the same time it's just like oh god get

933
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:09,260
away from me it's like this all this crazy shit and uh you hear a voice you think you

Oh, where is everybody?

944
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:15,220
I and Patrick are in the living room or the bedroom.

945
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,900
No, that's me.

946
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:18,060
Oh, you mean the camera?

947
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:19,300
Me and Blutos are in the.

948
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,180
And in what way are you?

949
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:22,420
Are you a lie? Are you?

950
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,860
This is where you guys are standing.

951
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:27,220
Yeah, I'm standing in the doorway and I'm still in the.

952
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:29,300
Caleb's hugging and kissing.

953
00:51:29,300 --> 00:51:30,140
Take her. OK.

954
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:31,460
All right. I'm right there.

955
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,020
I'm like one step past Blutos at the doorway.

956
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,700
And this is definitely where you guys are.

957
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,700
And then and this is where you are Patrick Yoda.

958
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,600
Are you are you running out of the tub scared?

959
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,500
I'm dunking my own head in the tub.

960
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,700
Okay, cool.

961
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,700
Okay.

962
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:54,180
You see the call hangs up and then that exact when you hear

963
00:51:54,180 --> 00:51:57,500
Papi Chuka's voice and in that exact same moment,

964
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:05,680
you guys hear a squish and your heads whip towards Tigger and

965
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,020
and you see a

966
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:09,380
and sticking out of the skull

967
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:14,880
and all allies my gosh when you realize his whimpering stopped

968
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,380
and he slumps over

969
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,780
and all you guys role a perception check

970
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:24,640

00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,900

Um, ooh, actually roll again with disadvantage just because you're all the way in the other room.

974
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:38,680
Me?

975
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,140
I just realized. Yeah, because I just-

976
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:40,640
Fuck.

977
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:41,640
What's about to happen?

978
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:43,920
23.

979
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:44,700
Damn. Nice, dude.

980
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:45,200
Whoa.

981
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:45,700
Okay.

982
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:46,800
Um...

983
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,300
So...

984
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,740
Wow, that's pretty impressive.

985
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:53,240
So with your extra perceptive Yoda ears,

986
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,240
you are able to make out

987
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,240
something lurking in the distance that then

988
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,440
fucking crashes right the fuck into the bedroom.

989
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:20,200
Somehow, Patrick Yoda was able to pick up on it.

990
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:26,840
And you see a sweaty, one-eyed, ink and dirt blotted, hulking freak of a man, with sinister,

991
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:29,000
curly black hair.

992
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,000
His devilish pointed teeth peek from beneath a mouth too wide for his strange knotted swirling

993
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:35,000
head.

994
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,280
His hulking body dawns a reflector vest.

995
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:41,200
His legs are bare, completely black, and his toes are talons.

996
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,400
His eyes glare mockingly at all of you.

997
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,840
He looks like he might draw something really fucking edgy right now, like cow and chicken,

998
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,640
but one of them has a fucked up eye, and the other one is so crazy that he might hop right

999
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:56,400
out of the drawing and just like fucking kill you.

1000
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,840
and the figure just looks directly at all of you.

1001
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:04,840
And he says, "I told Poppy you lot were no good.

1002
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:08,040
"Now I can finally finish you off.

1003
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,040
"Here comes my dirt and ink!"

1004
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:13,640
And everyone roll for initiative.

1005
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:16,240
- Oh my God, you put Kai in the game.

1006
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,720
(laughing)

1007
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,520
That's so funny.

1008
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:23,880
- This is going to be a little DM secret.

1009
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,120
This is gonna be your toughest fight by far.

1010
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:31,900
Wait, we should all probably just say our initiatives. Yeah, I got a six. Yes. I got a nine

1011
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,340
I got a 31 you got a 10 you had you got a 10

1012
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:39,020
10 and Kai

1013
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:43,540
Unfortunately, the killer Kai Klops goes first. So no

1014
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:46,760
All right. Let's do this. So

1015
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:51,320
Oh boy, this is gonna be kind of kooky. Okay

1016
00:54:53,680 --> 00:55:00,700
All right, cool. So because I guess because yeah, this is gonna be he's fucking all those noises make me really worry

1017
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:06,480
Yeah, okay. So Kai burst through the window after just obliterating Tigger

1018
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,320
And he runs

1019
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:12,880
He sort of like tries to sidestep you

1020
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:18,780
Ray William Johnson and he takes out his his massive

1021
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:26,760
Landscaping shovel and he makes an attack on you. Let's see how he does. Oh, yeah, that beats your AC for sure

1022
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,280
fuck

1023
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,280
no, and

1024
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,720
Dude, I'm gonna be dead in one hit

00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:39,700
Yeah, I think I only have like 21 HP right now. Okay roll a also roll a strength saving throw right now

00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,200

1031
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:08,360
Stop eating. Okay, terrible. I can't believe I just caught you doing that. Stop eating for the rest of the episode

1032
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:13,280
No, don't take a dinner. I don't care. You should have eaten dinner. That's not our fault

1035
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,560
I'm literally charging up a Falcon punch and when I see you I'm gonna punch you in the face

1036
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:32,200
Don't put another goddamn fry in your big mouth

1037
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:35,940
Say yes, sir

1038
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,600
So, here's what happens.

1039
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:50,200
Kai sidesteps over, catching you off guard, Great William Johnson.

1040
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:51,200
He goes like, "YEAH!"

1041
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,320
And he whacks you in the fucking head with a shovel.

1042
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,640
Dealing 12 damage to you.

1043
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,360
And then, as you're falling over, just as quickly, he whips around the shovel, fucking

1044
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:12,240
like Ip Man style, and scoops you up and tosses you.

1045
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:18,440
like he would toss fucking dirt. And he tosses you over his shoulder out the fucking window.

1046
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:22,280
What the fuck, no. No, dude.

1047
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:27,640
And I use my reverse time ability. And I go back in time.

1048
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:34,000
And you take another five points of falling damage as he fucking knocks your ass out.

1049
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,200
Dude, I have three HP. Can somebody help me out?

1050
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:47,920
And you're not prone as well. Now at this point by the way, you look over and you

1051
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,700
look in the tree and you see that the worm just is like pinned to a fucking

1052
00:57:52,700 --> 00:57:59,780
tree with like ten ink pens inside of it. And you get a buzz now in your

1053
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:06,860
pocket, your Jack Black pocket, and it's a PSP buzz and you see a text that says

1054
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:13,580
go to the basement and Carol's from that from that mysterious non number that

1055
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:20,940
you saw before and it says go to the return pods underneath Carol's home and

1056
00:58:20,940 --> 00:58:30,540
that's all it says and now it is Patrick Yoda's turn okay hmm how tall is Kai

1057
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:58,980
I

1058
00:58:58,980 --> 00:59:03,100
Let's take a look at this ruler, handy dandy ruler tool.

1059
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,340
You're 45 feet away from me.

1060
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,340
Okay, wait, hold on.

1061
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,340
If I'm 45 feet away.

1062
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:08,540
You have 30 feet of movement.

1063
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:12,340
30 feet of movement.

1064
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:14,020
So you have- Hold on, hold on.

1065
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:21,340
Let me reconsider my move.

1066
00:59:21,340 --> 00:59:22,660
Peace for Yoda, peace for all.

1067
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,740
You're going to do it?

1068
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,740
Yeah.

1069
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:26,740
All right.

1070
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,740
That's a good move.

1071
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:28,740
Okay.

1072
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:35,740
So this is a very broken ability that Patrick Yoda smartly took.

1073
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:38,740
Patrick Patrick smartly took.

1074
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:41,740
Here, I put it in the chat now.

1075
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,740
So what it is, is, "Peace for Yoda, peace for all.

1076
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,740
Patrick Yoda creates a realm of mental stability,

1077
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,740
instantly calming any conflict he is in for ten minutes.

1078
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,740
This means a fight can be stopped and turned into a conversation.

1079
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:56,740
Not everyone will be friends, but everyone will refrain from violence

1080
00:59:56,740 --> 01:00:03,740
until the peace subsides. You can use this ability once per long rest.

1081
01:00:03,740 --> 01:00:09,740
So, what... oh shit, yes, what you'll have to do is you'll have to roll a resistance to that.

1082
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:15,740
Let's see if he can resist it.

1083
01:00:15,740 --> 01:00:18,740
Okay, it's +2, alright. You might be able to...

1084
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:22,740
Where's your DC? No, no, Patrick Gunn might pull this off.

1085
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:26,740
I'm so sorry.

1086
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:30,740
No!

1087
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:34,740
Your DC is crazy and he still beat it. So here's what happens.

1088
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:38,740
You reach inside in your counselor

1089
01:00:38,740 --> 01:00:42,740
Jedi ways and you find the inner ability to

1090
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:46,740
cast peace and you watch it wash over this dirty

1091
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:51,740
inky man and you see he starts to consider what it would be like to just

1092
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:56,540
sort of hang out and play crunker with the boys and maybe just have a nice

1093
01:00:56,540 --> 01:01:01,740
conversation about things and then you see he starts imagining and then Eddie

1094
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:06,740
like sucking each other's dicks and having like something like that or maybe

1095
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:13,340
the rug rats just like biting into Timon and Pumbaa and he just gets crazy again

1096
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,340
and you're unable to calm him down.

1097
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,340
And I also lose 7 Techno Slime points.

1098
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:25,340
Damn. I thought you were going to beat that too.

1099
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:29,340
Well that would have been too easy. We like a challenge.

1100
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:33,340
Yeah. We all want to die.

1101
01:01:33,340 --> 01:01:37,340
Sounds like everyone in the game loves a challenge.

1102
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:41,340
But you still have your movement that you can do too.

1103
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:45,440
you can or you can also take a I guess you have another action but you can take your

1104
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:51,900
movement still okay so I can't attack him now that was like your that would've been

1105
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:56,220
your attack action so that's your action so now you can do your movement I go outside

1106
01:01:56,220 --> 01:02:10,580
I so yeah there is guys abandon me again I I stand I stay I hide under I hide right here

1107
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,580
under one of these crates.

1108
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:15,580
Okay, um, you can't technically take a quarter-to-quarter hide action.

1109
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:19,580
I hide, I crouch behind the thing, but he can still see my ears.

1110
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:22,580
Yeah, so I'll say that you'll have three-fourths cover,

1111
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,580
so that means he's gonna have disadvantage on ranged attacks against you

1112
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,580
'cause you're hiding behind this box.

1113
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:30,580
Um, and now it is RayWilliamJohnson, it's your turn.

1114
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:31,580
You got fuckin' party rocked.

1115
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,580
It's gonna take half your movement to get up,

1116
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,580
but you still have the other half.

1117
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,580
You have ranged attacks, too.

1118
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:44,580
to

1119
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:48,740
- No, you know what, I'm gonna stand and I'm gonna,

1120
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:49,580
you know what?

1121
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:50,780
- To note, you would all have gotten

1122
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:52,420
that same message, by the way.

1123
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,100
I was just illustrating it that he got the message

1124
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:55,940
'cause it was--

1125
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,140
- Oh, true.

1126
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:59,680
- Oh, so I could have ran to the basement?

1127
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:02,100
If you wanted to do that, I'm sorry if that wasn't clear.

1128
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,560
- Or we could kill the guy.

1129
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,620
I think we can kill him.

1130
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,620
I think we can kill him easily.

1131
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,460
I'm gonna use--

1132
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:09,900
- You can always run, so just letting you know.

1133
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:12,180
- I'm gonna use hacker mode.

1134
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:13,620
- Do it, fuck yeah.

1135
01:03:13,620 --> 01:03:16,760
let's go to the moment at this mother fucker

1136
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,920
it's what i would

1137
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,200
all you got click attacker mode

1138
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,720
okay let's take a look at that so

1139
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,880
hacker mode

1140
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:27,040
uh... cost three tickets i gotta make that cost more

1141
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,060
uh... so you uh...

1142
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,120
yes intelligence saving throw

1143
01:03:31,120 --> 01:03:34,480
he can watch your computer into him

1144
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:35,720
take control of him

1145
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:41,940
for up to ten minutes as crazy i have to nurse stuff i think i'm not a saving me

1146
01:03:41,940 --> 01:03:48,940
right now. We're gonna lose this fight if you nerf any of this stuff.

1147
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:55,940
Okay and it's intelligence, what's his intelligence? Where is it? There it is, beautiful. Alright,

1148
01:03:55,940 --> 01:04:04,940
let's see how it goes. Alright yeah, it failed. You got it. He's too fucking strong, you made

1149
01:04:04,940 --> 01:04:06,940
Strong I

1150
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:09,860
Pretend to be dead

1151
01:04:09,860 --> 01:04:13,140
Yeah, okay

1152
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:16,340
Roll a

1153
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:18,060
try this

1154
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:22,420
Roll performance check. I'm a natural performer

1155
01:04:22,420 --> 01:04:33,900
Get 18 yeah, he thinks you're dead. I just rolled for him. Okay. I like my tongue out

1156
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:40,900
know

1157
01:04:40,900 --> 01:04:55,140
a

1158
01:04:55,140 --> 01:04:59,140
I don't have any fancy tricks I can do.

1159
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:01,140
You're explaining this to him?

1160
01:05:01,140 --> 01:05:06,140
I didn't do it in the voice, so I wasn't.

1161
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:08,140
Use your brain next time.

1162
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:11,140
I don't have any powers to fight you, but I'm going to try my best.

1163
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:19,140
I use my sickum ability to throw my monkey Patrick onto Kai's face.

1164
01:05:19,140 --> 01:05:22,140
Which costs 2 Techno Slime points.

1165
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:22,640
Mm-hmm.

1166
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:26,140
Uh, "Bloodthirst Monkey grabs onto an enemy's face or face equivalent,

1167
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:28,640
blinding them and dealing damage until they can shake the monkey off.

1168
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:31,740
Enemy needs to beat DC 12 Dex at the end of their turn.

1169
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:36,440
On a failure, the monkey causes disadvantage on attack rolls and deals 1d6 damage.

1170
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:40,640
Then an additional 1d6 damage per turn, the monkey stays on the face."

1171
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:42,040
Hell yeah.

1172
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:44,440
So it looks like it is a Dex thing.

1173
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:48,040
He's probably gonna beat it, but let's see. Maybe he won't.

1174
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:49,840
He's got pretty good Dex.

1175
01:05:49,840 --> 01:05:52,920
let's see maybe he'll fucking fail

1176
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:56,720
fingers crossed guys

1177
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,480
the monkey you throw the monkey at him

1178
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,520
and kai just fucking bats him away with the shovel and the monkey just

1179
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,440
flies right back at you. you have another attack though

1180
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,600
yeah

1181
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,160
what should i do

1182
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:13,080
are we gonna try to get to the basement

1183
01:06:13,080 --> 01:06:15,600
uh... i

1184
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:18,320
should we try to beat him or should we try to get to the basement?

1185
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,720
it's up to you man, I'm pretending I'm dead

1186
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:23,660
where's the entrance to the basement?

1187
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,660
yeah, where's the entrance?

1188
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:26,300
yes, good question

1189
01:06:26,300 --> 01:06:29,420
it's right, it's under, it's a trap door right under me

1190
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:32,140
it's under each of you, yeah, it's under each of you

1191
01:06:32,140 --> 01:06:33,660
each one of you, uh no

1192
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:34,300
that's sick

1193
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:38,780
the basement is, uh, the entrance to the basement, like in all homes

1194
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:42,980
is right in, uh, right, where did I put it?

1195
01:06:42,980 --> 01:06:45,620
Oh, here, yes. It is right, uh, like here.

1196
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,940
Oh, okay.

1197
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,220
Oh, I can get there pretty easy.

1198
01:06:49,220 --> 01:06:52,660
Yeah, well, I'd have to, okay.

1199
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:57,380
I guess I'll fight him for now to let

1200
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,340
Caleb, to let Caleb get back around there.

1201
01:07:01,340 --> 01:07:04,100
Cause if I run away, then Caleb's fucked.

1202
01:07:04,100 --> 01:07:05,980
He's sacrificing himself.

1203
01:07:05,980 --> 01:07:07,060
I'm not sacrificing.

1204
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,180
I would never sacrifice.

1205
01:07:08,180 --> 01:07:09,540
I'm sacrificing.

1206
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:12,220
Listen, he doesn't want to, he's being modest.

1207
01:07:12,540 --> 01:07:17,060
he's sacrificing his life it's just so i want to know you because you know you'd

1208
01:07:17,060 --> 01:07:21,100
rather just let all your friends die so that you can do a funny marriage scene

1209
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:26,580
he's sacrificing his life for another man and buddy that's us

1210
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:30,140
i says pause when he realized that i just run straight to the basement i don't

1211
01:07:30,140 --> 01:07:35,880
know how to wait on how to get back i'll help you take it back

1212
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:36,600
the event

1213
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:40,840
take a look at the i don't have a good idea i read it as a i don't think that

1214
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:43,420
that you know that it's just

1215
01:07:43,420 --> 01:07:45,140
okay

1216
01:07:45,140 --> 01:07:49,340
you could almost get there with the right i go almost there yeah i got right and

1217
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:52,260
then i see that uh... kyle with my grinch gun

1218
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,400
from the stage

1219
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:54,720
yet do it

1220
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,120
twenty one nice and it's role for damage

1221
01:07:58,120 --> 01:08:00,480
eighteen damage

1222
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:04,000
no i wasn't a damaged uh... i would like to write the wrong thing sorry i was like

1223
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:08,640
seven damage. That makes way more sense. I didn't know you could do 18. Still pretty good.

1224
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:15,280
Yeah, you shoot the... yeah, you like start sprinting away because Ray William Johnson's

1225
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:20,400
calling you gay and you shoot the Grinch gun. You didn't have to say anything in game, I could just

1226
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:24,800
sense that he was thinking it. Yeah, you could just sense it. And you shoot the Grinch gun.

1227
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:31,280
He set his status on the PSP discord to thinking Blowtoss Piss is gay.

1228
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,280
*laughter*

1229
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:41,280
And it pierces Kai right in like sort of the upper like collarbone zone and

1230
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:45,840
He just like breathes it in like a freak like

1231
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:55,140
Like madder at you and he really wants to fucking kill you now. Oh no weird, bro. Yeah, that's even more sus

1232
01:08:55,140 --> 01:08:57,140
Yeah, do you see my discord status?

1233
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:04,520
Yeah, okay, and that's the end of your turn so it is now Kai's turn

1234
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,700
So first I'm gonna have him do is I'm gonna have him with your performance check

1235
01:09:09,700 --> 01:09:11,820
We have a roll against it again to see if he notices

1236
01:09:11,820 --> 01:09:14,620
That you are pretending you're dead

1237
01:09:14,620 --> 01:09:22,160
He still doesn't notice he keeps he keeps he runs over here and

1238
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:25,020
he aims a

1239
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:28,740
website a certain dart for a Patrick Yoda and

1240
01:09:30,580 --> 01:09:37,580
the

1241
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:41,180
patrick it'll it doesn't hit

1242
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:41,940
was not

1243
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:43,840
movement it doesn't hit

1244
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:44,940
we don't know yet

1245
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:49,420
we just don't know how you have a bad a cf regard does not hit regardless

1246
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:54,300
outside our yes cover yes covered as i'm covered that's true he does have covered

1247
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,260
i do have to roll with this damage

1248
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,300
it doesn't hit

1249
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:06,940
doesn't it doesn't it didn't hit it did not hit it hit so let's let's go through

1250
01:10:06,940 --> 01:10:10,660
a couple other things and there's a couple of things gotta happen now I need

1251
01:10:10,660 --> 01:10:18,660
you to roll a constitution saving throw 16 nice good okay so he slings a dart at

1252
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:25,820
you and it does get you right in the neck and dealing nine points of damage to you

1253
01:10:25,820 --> 01:10:32,380
And you start to see the dart shake while it's inside of you and what's spewing out of the

1254
01:10:32,380 --> 01:10:40,340
top is another pen tip and it starts to form something like in the space and the ether

1255
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:45,180
around it, but you sort of resist it.

1256
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:48,780
Something inside you tells you to resist that and it just swallows back up in the pen and

1257
01:10:48,780 --> 01:10:49,780
the pen falls off.

1258
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:51,900
So you still take the nine points, but nothing else happens.

1259
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:53,380
No, I don't.

1260
01:10:53,380 --> 01:10:59,380
I'm gonna I will I will just make it happen. I took the nine points. I will make it happen.

1261
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:05,380
Okay, thank you. So now it is your turn though. Okay.

1262
01:11:05,380 --> 01:11:11,380
I don't have enough to oh I can't even try Yoda's calm mind again.

1263
01:11:11,380 --> 01:11:17,380
How fast can I just make a run for it to the basement?

1264
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:21,100
Absolutely can try okay go for it. What would I need to roll?

1265
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:23,760
Nothing, you just gotta move

1266
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:26,160
Yeah, so you are in

1267
01:11:26,160 --> 01:11:31,020
The basement. So here's what we're gonna do for that. I'm just gonna move you

1268
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:37,860
Just like over here to show that you are tip right now out of range of Kai

1269
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,780
Which is what's happening?

1270
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:44,160
But you are sort of running down the stairs to the basement and as you run down you start to hear echoing

1271
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:51,840
like as you're running like it's like you're kind of entering like a not just a basement but like a tunnel or a cavern of some kind and

1272
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,240
If that's all you do it is now

1273
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:59,360
Wait, can I do one more thing? Yes, absolutely

1274
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:02,320
You need two more things. Oh

1275
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:09,920
Okay, you can only do one more thing I'm sorry that's gonna confuse you I should have been careful with that

1276
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:14,040
There's got to be

1277
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,600
Can I have a you can I shoot at him with the needler while I'm running away?

1278
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:22,800
All out. Yeah, actually bro. Just roll in athletics check to see if you can know actually no

1279
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:27,800
You don't have to consider it like you're in mid movement. You do some of your movement and you shoot it go for it

1280
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:36,880
That's right that hits baby, that's the 22. Yeah, nice. Yeah. So yeah, you're running away

1281
01:12:37,560 --> 01:12:42,180
Patrick Yoda and you do some I'm running away, but I'm just like I'm spraying the gun like yeah

1282
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:51,220
And

1283
01:12:51,220 --> 01:12:56,340
Kai is just like a couple of the needler bolts getting to side of him and he's

1284
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:00,520
Like burst him out, but he still did nine damage. It's quite good

1285
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:06,680
Okay, which means he is at that I'm out of HP

1286
01:13:06,680 --> 01:13:11,480
Just say it. Just say the number.

1287
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,720
I can't say it. It's illegal.

1288
01:13:13,720 --> 01:13:17,080
If I roll a natural 20 right now, will you say the number?

1289
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:20,680
Yes. Let's do it. I'm a gambling man.

1290
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:24,680
What do I get as a reward? You need to establish that.

1291
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,380
Nothing. Yeah, alright.

1292
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:33,180
I got a 2. You will never know.

1293
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:35,180
You won't even know your own HP.

1294
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,180
That's what we're doing.

1295
01:13:37,180 --> 01:13:43,180
But, you know what, it is Ray William Johnson's turn.

1296
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,180
I thought it was your turn, but it didn't.

1297
01:13:45,180 --> 01:13:47,180
Okay, I...

1298
01:13:47,180 --> 01:13:49,180
So Kai thinks I'm dead.

1299
01:13:49,180 --> 01:13:51,180
So my plan...

1300
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:55,180
You could do a stealth.

1301
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,180
I messaged him on Discord and I said, "You should sneak."

1302
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:59,180
Thank you, Mettatoss.

1303
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:05,820
for messaging another man i_m_ i'm going to

1304
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:09,700
trying crawl about about here

1305
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:13,580
uh... is that yet that's a refit

1306
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:17,560
no it's not so well here's the thing if you used to use both your movements you

1307
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,040
can do sixty feet

1308
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:22,880
okay i use both and and make it to the estimate

1309
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:26,700
uh... well let's see because here's the thing to do you have to like

1310
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,320
so imagine like okay forty here

1311
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:31,720
and then like you have to walk through the house

1312
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:35,540
i don't make it to the basement you can make it like a rat like here

1313
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:39,820
uh... wait sorry like here

1314
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:44,840
and you can't stop the role stealth

1315
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:48,640
and again do it at stealth remember

1316
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:50,820
eleven follow yeah so

1317
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,900
you do make it there

1318
01:14:52,900 --> 01:14:54,340
but he knows

1319
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:58,380
you step on you can i can i rule another step so i don't care about it

1320
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,940
Yeah, you step on Carol's body like 10 times.

1321
01:15:00,940 --> 01:15:03,740
And he was like the wet bunch of bones.

1322
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,740
I gotta give her a little, you know...

1323
01:15:05,740 --> 01:15:08,340
If he sees me, can I do another performance check?

1324
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:10,100
Yeah, with disadvantage though.

1325
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:11,580
Okay, alright.

1326
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:12,700
Alright, just I'll pretend...

1327
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,060
Yeah, you tricked me!

1328
01:15:14,060 --> 01:15:16,380
I'll pretend to be dead again.

1329
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:16,620
Okay.

1330
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:17,980
Hold on.

1331
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:21,980
Did it go?

1332
01:15:21,980 --> 01:15:22,780
Dude, I kinda...

1333
01:15:22,780 --> 01:15:23,980
Okay, I rolled...

1334
01:15:23,980 --> 01:15:25,180
I rolled with disadvantage.

1335
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:27,900
1, 5 and 1, 23.

1336
01:15:27,900 --> 01:15:34,900
but

1337
01:15:34,900 --> 01:16:03,900
I

1338
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:11,420
All right, I'm gonna shoot him twice go for it. All right. My first shot is an 11. It's not gonna do it

1339
01:16:11,420 --> 01:16:14,420
Alright, then my second shot is a 16

1340
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:20,700
It's not gonna do it. Damn. Yeah, dude. All right. I jump I jump into the basement

1341
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:23,880
Yes, you just shoot twice and Kai

1342
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:30,020
Like Dodge is the first one it knocks the other one out of the way with the shovel and you're like and just yeet into

1343
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,820
the basement as they say

1344
01:16:31,820 --> 01:16:34,440
uh... seer you're way out of range now

1345
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:37,060
of himself so you're like an over here

1346
01:16:37,060 --> 01:16:38,680

he uh... for some reason thinks you're dead again and just like

1363
01:17:25,340 --> 01:17:27,240
throws it at something else, throws it at something else,

1364
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:28,540
and is like, "Wait, no."

1365
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:29,940
Remembering that you're-- - He just hit it, Carol.

01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:32,340
- Yeah, yeah. - Dead body.

1367
01:17:32,340 --> 01:17:34,140
- Yeah, she just, like, moves a little bit.

1368
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,840
A bit of gas comes out. - He couldn't remember

1369
01:17:35,840 --> 01:17:38,140
what looking alive looks like

1370
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:40,440
and what looking dead looks like,

1371
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,640
and he mixed them up with his head. - He got very confused, yeah.

1372
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:47,440
Okay, yeah, it is now Patrick Yoda's turn.

1373
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:49,240
- So I'm in the basement now?

1374
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:54,440
- Yeah, you're in the tunnel area in the basement.

1375
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,440
can I use my needlers light?

1376
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,440
shoot, wait you should shoot

1377
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,440
Kai from below

1378
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:02,440
ohhhhh

1379
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:04,440
okay

1380
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,440
if you try to shoot

1381
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,440
if you try to like shoot him from down there

1382
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,440
almost in like, I'll have you

1383
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:12,440
um well no because you're kind of like

1384
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:29,920
of

1385
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:36,920
is

1386
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:41,600
yeah

1387
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:48,600
it

1388
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:53,760
rare

1389
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:55,360
Dude, this is nothing to me.

1390
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,960
Yeah, you have some pretty badass moves, too.

1391
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,160
Yeah, that's why I'm trying to use one.

1392
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:06,660
Can I go in front of Patrick in the tunnel just so like, uh, Archie Patrick can go behind me?

1393
01:19:06,660 --> 01:19:07,860
There we go.

1394
01:19:07,860 --> 01:19:09,360
Yeah, can I move behind Cameron?

1395
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:11,160
So that if Kai comes down I can tank it?

1396
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:12,160
Yes, you can.

1397
01:19:12,160 --> 01:19:13,860
Okay, I moved myself.

1398
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:15,660
Mm-hmm.

1399
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:17,560
Cool. Now go. Sorry.

1400
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:21,860
I use my dong blade.

1401
01:19:21,860 --> 01:19:23,560
You're gonna fucking charge his ass?

1402
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,560
I'm gonna get a melee.

1403
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,560
I jump up.

1404
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,560
I attack him.

1405
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,560
Fucking hell yeah dude.

1406
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:30,560
Roll that.

1407
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:31,560
Five.

1408
01:19:31,560 --> 01:19:32,560
Fuck dude.

1409
01:19:32,560 --> 01:19:33,560
I'm gonna die dude.

1410
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:44,560
You just are like, "Uhhhhhh."

1411
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:47,560
I also think Carol is who I'm fighting.

1412
01:19:47,560 --> 01:19:52,160
I run at her.

1413
01:19:52,160 --> 01:20:04,000

1414
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:21,000
I

01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:58,120
are just sort of like literally like dueling shovel and duel pipes just like fucking Darth

01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,600

1423
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,280
he turns to you and he thinks for a second there you go real think about it

1424
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:28,920
long time big guy wait I'm not gay that's right I'm not gay I'm not gay

1425
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,920
Then don't kill me

1426
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:44,040
Starts sucking it. Yeah, pretty gay, buddy

1427
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:49,760
Yeah, he he's gonna attack you with this

1428
01:21:53,840 --> 01:21:57,240
Fifteen minutes thinking about that. Yeah, that's pretty good. Uh-huh

1429
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:03,040
Hey, man, it might not turn out so fucking well for him. Let's find out. Oh

1430
01:22:03,040 --> 01:22:05,680
Yeah, he gets you. Oh

1431
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,440
Oh boy, let's see what happens. He'll probably

1432
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,240
He's gonna kill me did oh

1433
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:14,200
fuck

1434
01:22:14,200 --> 01:22:19,840
I'm so afraid to die. You got very unlucky that he just jumped out and fucked you up first thing

1435
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:27,660
Yeah, he fucking just like you say like like what you said, which is if you kill me or you're gay and

1436
01:22:27,660 --> 01:22:34,920
Chi our friend says I am gay and just hits you over the head with the shovel

1437
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:39,080
And you are like seeing birds. You're knocked out cold

1438
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:46,980
Holy crap. Yeah, you got some death saves coming up for you brother. Hey, dude first Patrick Yoda. It's your turn

1439
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,860
All right, so I changed my mind shoot the needler at him more

1440
01:22:50,860 --> 01:22:56,440
So Patrick it what do you do by the way before for

1441
01:22:56,440 --> 01:23:03,700
Do I see now I don't know cuz now I'm down

1442
01:23:03,700 --> 01:23:07,760
So I'm halfway in between

1443
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:15,660
Finding out what's down here. Oh, yeah, and then I'm depending on what you do. You're gonna kind of move into a new sort of situation

1444
01:23:15,660 --> 01:23:29,540
the

1445
01:23:29,540 --> 01:23:36,540
But if you go ahead and leave the Matrix, then we can't rescue Caleb.

1446
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:37,540
Right.

1447
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:41,540
He's pretty low, I'll say that much.

1448
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,540
Didn't he say he was beaten up?

1449
01:23:43,540 --> 01:23:45,540
I said yeah, he's bloodied.

1450
01:23:45,540 --> 01:23:46,540
Dude, let's go.

1451
01:23:46,540 --> 01:23:48,540
Alright, you know what, I'm going up.

1452
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,540
That means he's under half.

1453
01:23:49,540 --> 01:23:51,540
That's right. Very good.

1454
01:23:51,540 --> 01:23:53,540
I'm smart. I know the D&D words.

1455
01:23:53,540 --> 01:23:54,540
That's right.

1456
01:23:54,540 --> 01:23:58,540
He's, yeah, we can do this. You shoot him with the Needler a few more times.

1457
01:23:58,540 --> 01:24:00,540
Yeah, I'll do the Needler.

1458
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:02,540
Do it, Pimp.

1459
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:03,540
Alright.

1460
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:04,540
19.

1461
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,540
19, yeah!

1462
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,540
I pop my head back out.

1463
01:24:07,540 --> 01:24:08,540
You're fucking...

1464
01:24:08,540 --> 01:24:13,540
I just start spray firing the Needler, but you can't see my head, so I don't know where I'm shooting.

1465
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:16,540
Is this your second successful Needler attack in a row?

1466
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:17,540
This is my third.

1467
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:21,540
No, in a row, in a row. Oh shit, it is.

1468
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,540
Yeah.

1469
01:24:22,540 --> 01:24:27,580
Oh my god, I'm sorry. You should have been doing extra damage. So let's do that now. Whoa

1470
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:33,840
Wait, no, dude Patrick MVP. Yeah, so just like in real life the real needler life

1471
01:24:33,840 --> 01:24:36,580
when you do a

1472
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:41,680
You do extra damage if you get multiple hits with the needler. So right now you're gonna do

1473
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:48,900
Because it's we missed one you're doing 8d for fire damage extra right now. Okay, so just roll

1474
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:53,700
Just hit the needler explosion thing needler explosion. Yeah

1475
01:24:53,700 --> 01:24:57,740
Ten holy shit and then hit it again

1476
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,780
Seven Wow

1477
01:25:00,780 --> 01:25:07,980
Fuckin holy shit 25 damage just now. Yeah. He's Wow cuz he kept fucking hitting him right in a row, which is Wow

1478
01:25:07,980 --> 01:25:09,500
Yeah

1479
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:15,860
This man shit Kai had so many cool abilities, but that's - that's the name of the game folks describe your kill

1480
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:19,460
So I don't see what's going on

1481
01:25:19,460 --> 01:25:25,280
Just I'm under I'm in the tunnel and I'm just spray firing a bunch

1482
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:30,420
And so so many need like I'm hitting like direct hits

1483
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:38,100
This must be this must be just some of my force power, but I I don't know and I'm just sitting there and I'm like

1484
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:44,300
Yeah, I don't even see my kill

1485
01:25:44,300 --> 01:25:57,780
the

1486
01:25:57,780 --> 01:25:59,780
Caleb killed himself. I mean, oh

1487
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:03,740
Jesus Ray William Johnson killed him so good that he killed himself

1488
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:08,540
Yeah, I must it must have been all me you can't talk. You know, he's

1489
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:13,260
Let it be revived. There we go. Yeah, I basically yes like no

1490
01:26:13,260 --> 01:26:19,780
No in order to be revived you have to sit through a 30 minute wedding. Sorry

1491
01:26:19,780 --> 01:26:26,500
To come back. Sorry blowtos. Did you did you come up to like kiss me or something?

1492
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:28,500
I step on his face.

1493
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:30,500
Why are you talking?

1494
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,500
No.

1495
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:34,500
It just happens.

1496
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:36,500
Yeah, that could have ended very... Patrick Yoda had

1497
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,500
literally the best roles he's ever had.

1498
01:26:38,500 --> 01:26:40,500
And that was...

1499
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:42,500
That was Patrick Yoda just on maximum power

1500
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:44,500
right now. It was impressive.

1501
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,500
It was fucking rocked. Yeah.

1502
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:48,500
And the Kai...

1503
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:50,500
[gurgling]

1504
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:52,500
And he just like...

1505
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,500
sort of like dies and lights on fire

1506
01:26:54,500 --> 01:27:02,180
explosion and he just sort of collapses in front of you. Pour one out for a real one.

1507
01:27:02,180 --> 01:27:09,620
Yeah. R.I.P. Kai. I take Caleb's supplies of techno slam and start pouring them on the ground.

1508
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:12,740
You can't take these.

1509
01:27:12,740 --> 01:27:19,220
So yeah, that's the fight. You guys want to go into the tunnel?

1510
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:26,500
Let's go the ladder and I fall down also, I'm too excited. I just go like well

1511
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,700
Hey you guys kill Kai

1512
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:34,140
Our friend and you walk down the stairs and you once again

1513
01:27:34,140 --> 01:27:41,460
Once again you find another basement layout this time it leads to way out of here

1514
01:27:41,460 --> 01:27:47,100
You know weeds to a way out of the matrix to the tunnel to the exit pods

1515
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:51,820
As you traverse the strange crystalline tunnels, the darkness overwhelms you.

1516
01:27:51,820 --> 01:27:58,060
This is maybe the first time you've been without the cold comfort of those hellish lights that permeate Gun City.

1517
01:27:58,060 --> 01:28:04,300
You also notice as you traverse through that it's getting colder and colder, not drastically, but enough to notice.

1518
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:07,460
Then you start to hear the echoes of laughter and play from above.

1519
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:13,900
You see a gentle light at the very end, almost like a floor light, white and eerie.

1520
01:28:14,260 --> 01:28:19,800
The tunnel opens up to a vast room where that light creates an strange glow that rises up

1521
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,320
And colors the rest of the chamber

1522
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:29,720
There are dozens of pods meant for leaving the matrix - they're all shaped like Lincoln town cars and 401ks

1523
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:31,720
Which if you didn't know are shaped like a pinwheel

1524
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:35,700
as you look above you see young men and women and

1525
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:40,340
Who's and Shreks and dragons and worms and dogs and furries and Ron Paul's?

1526
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,640
Diving into what must be Soy Lake, but as they enter it

1527
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:51,220
They merely float just above you clipping through you. They must be experiencing a different reality from you

1528
01:28:51,220 --> 01:28:55,220
They think they're swimming through a vast ocean of soil and motion

1529
01:28:55,220 --> 01:29:00,980
But they seem to be to you floating in space not aware of your existence entirely separate from you

1530
01:29:00,980 --> 01:29:03,520
But somehow within the same area

1531
01:29:03,520 --> 01:29:07,900
as you all crawl into your Lincoln town cars and your

1532
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,340
in your 401k pinwheels

1533
01:29:11,340 --> 01:29:17,860
That they begin to turn you turn the car on and the spin wheel start to spin so rapidly

1534
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:23,960
It's creating a gyroscopic effect. You feel your digital selves disassemble and enter into the negative space of that tubular

1535
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:29,360
Transportation zone that you were in before the massive holographic Cortana greets you once again

1536
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:35,020
Thank you so much for visiting to matrix to be sure to come back soon to check out husky

1537
01:29:35,020 --> 01:29:41,580
Tsune live in concert featuring immortal hip-hop legend and genius pedophile 69 and

1538
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:49,340
Suddenly Cortana's face that's a twitch error error like from before his voice sounds like Zordon

1539
01:29:49,340 --> 01:29:53,380
Do you guys remember what Zordon sounds like from the power rangers? There we go

1540
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:56,540
interception interception interception

1541
01:29:56,540 --> 01:29:59,380
interception the massive holographic

1542
01:29:59,380 --> 01:30:04,660
Quatana ages thousands of years and collapses onto itself. The blue tunnel that connects you to the

1543
01:30:04,660 --> 01:30:09,220
real world from the Matrix 2 and vice versa dissolves all around you leaving a black void

1544
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:14,100
and suddenly that sensation of falling becomes all too real. You fall through the inky black space,

1545
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:18,020
gravity the only thing assuring you of some connection to the physical world and then

1546
01:30:18,020 --> 01:30:25,540
thump you land one at a time on top of another like in a cartoon in a strange laboratory not

1547
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:29,680
Not unlike the one you saw in the abandoned porno factory yesterday, a voice from behind

1548
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:32,620
you calls out, "At last!

1549
01:30:32,620 --> 01:30:34,120
We finally meet, fellas!

1550
01:30:34,120 --> 01:30:35,120
Good to see you!"

1551
01:30:35,120 --> 01:30:36,120
Oh my goodness.

1552
01:30:36,120 --> 01:30:37,120
Guys, I'm so excited for this next one.

1553
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:38,120
This one is going to be the eye of your life.

1554
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:39,120
Patches, I think you should write a book.

1555
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:39,120
Yeah, I think you should write a book.

1556
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:43,120
This one is going to be the eye of your life.

1557
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:45,120
Patches, I think you should write a book.

1558
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,120
Yeah, I think you should write a book.

1559
