[MUSIC]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Last time on Trebuchet Village, we were introduced to Trebuchet Village,

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,640
a village that existed long ago on planet Ebound.

4
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,280
And the kingdom of the terrifier, a kingdom filled with orcs, goblins,

5
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:33,200
trolls, and other nasty beasts that won a great war against the forces of good. Chief among

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,080
these beasts were the Nards, terrifying furry beasts with yellow eyes, a terrible fanged

7
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,540
underbite, six legs with talons on the ends of them, two arms and a penis tail that blossoms

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,200
when they turn 18 and whispers dark thoughts in their ears. We also met our three heroes,

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:54,760
Dogen the Dirt Goblin, Paladin and Dirt Enthusiast, Patrick Jodar, Master Shoplifter and nephew

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:01,760
of a famous uncle, Evil Stevel, a vile cleric with a hip-hop edge. When they began their

11
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:17,040
day, our heroes were just simple sales associates at ye olde Sullivan's General Store who moonlight

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,920
as adventurers. They dispatched some unruly teenage grimlocks threatening their place

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:27,640
of work, and then split off afterwards to perform their adventuring duties, which took them

14
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:32,400
all to Mount Honestoodle, where the Crown Prince of the Terrifier Kingdom, the Nard Prince

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,960
Jumanji, was celebrating his fifth birthday. For Nards, turning five years old is an important

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,760
event, because the young Nards will perform their first kill in front of their community,

17
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,760
and in this case, in front of much of the kingdom's important monsters and beasts.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,920
Mount Honestoodle is a mountain sacred to the Nards, prominently located near Trebuchet

19
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,440
village just outside the royal family's home of Claw Castle.

20
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:58,120
There, Dogen the Dirt Goblin was tasked with protecting the boy during this celebration

21
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,040
by a group of paladins hired by King Nardwaur, the prince's father.

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Patric Yodar was meant to perform the greatest of heists by kidnapping the young prince in

23
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,300
order to further the ends of the Sticky Fingers Guild.

24
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,440
And Evil Steva was sent by the Pleasure Men, a cult who worship Discharge, the disciple

25
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,520
of the Terrifier, to destroy the boy and many prominent leaders of the Terrifier Kingdom.

26
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,160
The ceremony itself was a controversial affair with King Nardwar amending the ceremony.

27
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,600
Instead of any of these things happening however, our heroes, along with the entirety of those

28
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,640
in the ceremony, were launched at possibly high by some unknown force, possibly volcanic,

29
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,520
bursting forth from the mountain itself.

30
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,200
Dogen, Patric, Evil, Sullivan, and the Prince awoke to find themselves in Whippet Woods,

31
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,860
a dangerous and bizarre woodlands, nearly two weeks by carriage from their home.

32
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,200
As they began to acclimate to their situation, Patric Yodar grabbed a sword, sticking out

33
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:54,040
of a cheeky stone that begged for its sword to be pulled. This act awoke one of the many

34
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:59,520
strange beasts that threaten our heroes in these woods. So far from Trebuchet Village

35
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:05,880
and a battle ensues. How did our heroes survive? How did they land intact with a child prince

36
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:11,420
and their frazzled supervisor, Sullivan? Is it the work of the gods or the natural tempur-pedic

37
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:14,420
cushion that lines the forest floor.

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,420
Who's to say?

39
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:28,220
But what is known is that there is a lost prince and perhaps a reward for his

40
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:32,140
return would be greater than any reward offered for his abduction or destruction.

41
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,420
So yeah, you all were supposed to roll for initiative I think at the tail end.

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,420
But let's just install that.

43
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,420
I just did.

44
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:43,420
That Cameron, that is...

45
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,420
Oh Cameron, that's a...

46
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,420
I think you just sort of got a little

47
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,420
confused here. I think that's how it works.

48
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,420
I rolled for initiative, I got 139 successes.

49
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,420
No, so that's 100 D4s.

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,420
I got 134 successes this time.

51
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:59,420
Okay, let me roll for...

52
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,420
I got 18.

53
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Okay.

54
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,420
I got 15.

55
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:08,420
I got nine twice. You got nine twice somehow, yeah.

56
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:11,420
Okay, nice. You seem to get to go twice, dude.

57
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,420
Oh, is that true?

58
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,420
And what did Sullivan get is the greatest question of all.

59
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Ice me out.

60
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,420
Oh, no, you don't, sorry.

61
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,420
Ah!

62
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,420
I'm gonna ice you out when I get there.

63
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,420
What did Sweet, my Sweet Sullivan get?

64
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:40,180
if I remember his dex is yeah so I'll make everyone wait oh okay not bad Sullivan all right and

65
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:48,020
Sullivan got a 12. You are going to go first uh Dogen the dirt goblin so uh what happened was

66
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,940
is Patrick Yodar you grabbed the sword from the stone that was saying uh come on give it a tug

67
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,100
who knows and uh it then sort of pulled out from the sword's hilt you pulled out like a giant stone

68
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:07,860
worm monster that said I'm gonna eat you and so dog in the dirt goblin you're

69
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,300
sort of like on you're sort of got the jump on this thing so what do you want

70
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,420
to do

71
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:23,660
hmm you know I just want to say it's a worm and you are a dirt guy okay but

72
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:28,340
it's also it's made of stone right mm-hmm and stone is like that's like the

73
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:36,460
natural enemy of dirt. Well you were talking to the kid in the campaign about loam and stuff.

74
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:45,300
That's dirt. What was your plan if he was into dirt? I thought he had an advantage. Was he going

75
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:50,900
to climb through him? You're right Patrick. Seeing that it's a worm, a natural friend of the dirt,

76
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:58,140
and stone, the greatest enemy, it's shaking me to my core and I can't take my turn. Nice job,

77
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
Really, really clean.

78
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:05,140
I have to spend the whole turn commuting with my god to restore my faith.

79
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:12,140
And as you, what do you do to commute with your god?

80
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
I kneel down.

81
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:19,140
And is there dirt on the ground?

82
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,140
Yeah, yeah.

83
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,140
I scoop up a handful of dirt and I put it in my mouth.

84
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:26,140
Because that's how I, that's how it gives me a vision, you know?

85
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,540
You know, yeah, like I have Oscar or something.

86
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:35,340
Yeah, you hear a familiar voice of the dirt God himself Dogan.

87
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:35,440
Yeah.

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,640
Yeah, as he says through a mouthful of dirt, what's the

89
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:42,140
problem?

90
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,840
What's going on?

91
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,240
Oh Almighty Dogan hat tell me that riddle me that worship pray

92
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,140
tell me this.

93
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:51,640
Yeah.

94
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,340
Okay.

95
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:59,980
How can a worm, which is a friend of dirt, also be a stone, the opposite?

96
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:04,780
It's shaking me to my core so much I can't even take my turn.

97
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,900
This is a good question.

98
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,500
From my experience, when you see stone, think of it as just really hard dirt.

99
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,940
That's what I did.

100
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,420
Oh, okay, thank you.

101
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,420
Yeah, no problem.

102
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,940
And so, you're gonna give me the tithes next week, right?

103
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,940
What?

104
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,420
tithes do you know what tithes are?

105
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,420
you say tithes.

106
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,420
alright I gotta go.

107
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:29,580
I spit out the dirt.

108
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,580
you hear ptah.

109
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,900
can we hear the dirt god?

110
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,900
no just dogen.

111
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,460
he just edited me out saying it.

112
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,940
yeah so that's your turn.

113
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:46,500
it is now patrick.

114
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,900
it is your turn.

115
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,420
so you're face to face with this thing as it's sort of towering over you.

116
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
And do I have the sword?

117
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,420
Uh, no. So the sword like stayed inside of it. It was almost like his, it's like a baby's single hair sticking out.

118
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,420
Yes, exactly.

119
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:06,420
Uh, well, uh, well sir, I just want to say I'm uh, I'm very sorry for, for pulling your hair.

120
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:20,420
Uh, I really don't want any, any trouble at all. Uh, if there's any way that I could, uh, you know, get you, get you a glass of water, get you a glass of water or something, get you, uh, get you some...

121
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:40,240
to

122
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,720
a sandwich that I have in my bag.

123
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,400
That's just, you see how big I am.

124
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,640
Yeah, you know that is a good point.

125
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,640
It's just not sufficient.

126
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,640
I, honestly.

127
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,880
How about this, how about this?

128
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,880
You come with us.

129
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:58,480
No, I'm gonna eat you.

130
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,080
No, no, no, no, hold on.

131
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:07,280
We can ride on your back and we can find you an even bigger meal.

132
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I mean, yeah.

133
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,800
Wait, can I add something to this?

134
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:16,100
Yeah, you should tell Patrick tell him because we're all tiny. We're all small. We're dwarfing goblins and shit. We can't find him a person

135
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:19,560
Yeah, we'll find you some humans. We'll find you some big people

136
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,800
You know cuz I mean, we're all we're all tiny people roll a persuasion check. Let's see how this goes

137
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,860
We have a big fat friend in the other neighborhood

138
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,200
See it. Okay. Yeah, he goes

139
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:38,160
You say you have a fat friend. Yeah, and this guy he is big

He is one of the biggest guys. Oh, he's gigantic roll deception now

141
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:49,820
Why'd you have to add that little fucking icing on the cake biggest guy we know 10

All right, you caught us he's the second biggest guy we know all right, you know I he's the biggest guy

143
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:04,800

144
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,040
Yeah, big pun

145
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,560
(laughter)

146
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,080
Those are two friends of his.

147
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:10,580
Yep.

148
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,040
Um, I only know that 'cause I, I, we were talking as we were falling down.

149
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,640
If you...

150
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,040
Yeah, and I know a guy named Patrick Doran is what I would have said a few weeks ago.

151
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,640
(laughter)

152
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,240
Now that, now that's just wrong.

153
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,360
(laughter)

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,040
Well, if you can find me a fat friend...

155
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,920
Well that's the thing, we're gonna ride on your back to the city to find you a fat guy.

156
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,320
You can't ride on my back.

157
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,120
I don't trust you.

158
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,880
What's that supposed to mean?

159
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,400
You could eat us so easily.

160
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,400
I mean...

161
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,720
Why would you say that?

162
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Alright, roll persuasion.

163
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Me?

164
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,720
Dogen.

I got 26.

166
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
Nevermind, we'll just keep yours.

167
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
That's about right anyway.

168
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,720
You kind of said the same shit.

169
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
Fine, you may ride on my back.

170
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Ah, well that is great.

171
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,720
If you do not find somebody fat, what if we find somebody fat?

172
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,720
I'm not going to ride on your back.

173
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,720
I'm not going to ride on your back.

174
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
I'm not going to ride on your back.

175
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
I'm not going to ride on your back.

176
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,720
I'm not going to ride on your back.

177
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
I'm not going to ride on your back.

178
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,420
if you do not find somebody fat

179
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:09,100
what if we find a couple hours what if we find a big tree on the way that is

180
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,900
like a reason i was no i need organic

181
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,160
but me and other organic that's

182
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,140
what i mean it me what if we would have we had a lot of field and i misspoke

183
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,280
i'm a stone

184
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,240
it's the way i think i think you can't

185
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,720
you did you know there's something that you can

186
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,300
if you find cows that would be great that's a great start

187
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,720
there are no cows or have you seen this place it's all like

188
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,240
momentarily i don't

189
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,220
well he's a good deal here with the area monkeys any thrown poop in

190
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:41,520
and weird birds that way that she sees and speak spanish it's not like a normal

191
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,660
place i need food well you speaking spanish is a normal

192
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,160
with the birds hold on where you are not going anywhere with you

193
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,320
i don't know

194
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,800
and deals all here the deals are prepared to have a lot on our races back

195
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,920
to dot what is the idea of yet just reality of the deal i was all i'd say

196
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,640
roll initiative. Nope, we already said it.

197
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,240
The deal's off.

198
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,240
For 18.

199
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,640
18 hits, yeah. Roll for damage.

200
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,640
8. Or would that be 10?

201
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,520
No because you're the only one who's in like 5 feet of him. If somebody else was also in

202
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:24,520
5 feet of him, then like you would get the sneak attack bonus too. Yeah, you get him for

203
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,820
eight damage but as the uh... arrow sort of uh... and by the way told nerds out

204
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,120
there were saying well it's supposed to be disadvantaged if you're using a

205
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,560
brain's weapon in

206
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,640
five feet of range fuck

207
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,360
that makes

208
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,760
that doesn't make sense and i was going to use my dad

209
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,180
and i'm not a good guy just don't i just don't agree with that

210
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:47,760
yeah i'm bits this is better i was supposed to be funny it's funny to shoot

211
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,520
a bow and arrow up close that's right a hundred percent

212
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,880
Yeah, but you see that it's sort of a, it doesn't seem to do as much damage as you thought it would.

213
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,880
Um, I've obviously...

214
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,880
What if I just use the two as a subtraction?

215
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,880
I bet, I bet because he's a rock, I bet you need, you gotta do something, you gotta do something.

216
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Yeah, so we didn't do this much in...

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,380
Water.

218
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,380
...in, when we were in our last session.

219
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:16,880
It's not Pokemon, but we didn't do this much in Gun City, but some creatures are gonna have resistances.

220
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,880
So, when they do, I'll sort of be kind of coy about it like that.

221
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,880
But, since it's like the first creature you're coming across that has that, basically it just means that he's taking half damage for like, physical attacks.

222
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,880
This guy in particular.

223
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Some will take half damage just from piercing attacks versus blunt attacks.

224
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,880
But in this case, it's just a big stone guy.

225
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,880
So if you shoot an arrow at him, you know, he's still organic enough to move around and stuff, but...

226
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Okay, so we will ride on your back after all.

227
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,520
It's his turn now.

228
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:55,000
And so he got he got sort of checked there by Patrick Yodar.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,920
It was a pretty hefty blow, even though it was it was sort of cut in half there.

230
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,040
So he's going to sort of bear down on you, Patrick.

231
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,640
He's going to try to attack you.

232
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,360
See how he does.

233
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,320
And I'll describe what he's doing to attack you and everything.

234
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,320
What's your AC?

235
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,080
My AC is 14.

236
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,080
Okay, yeah, so he

237
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:21,640
Like gets shot by the arrow goes oh we were good up you were gonna show me a fat guy

238
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Yeah, but then you said something racist and he whips himself around. It's I don't want I did

239
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,800
I tell you whips himself around and tries to like, you know

240
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Get you in like a coil like a snake like a snake do but you managed to sort of just

241
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,740
You miss about you. He's the he was bounce on your balls

242
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,700
Bounce above him as he tries to do that and he misses

243
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,920
And now it is actually

244
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:53,140
Sullivan the frogs turn and so do not fuck this up Sullivan

245
00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,380
You what what do you mean? It's all on me. I believe in you something to let us ride on him again

246
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:05,120
You're such a good boss Sullivan and you're a great person. I'm your biggest fan

247
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,160
But I won't be if you don't

248
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:17,080
There's a lot there's a lot riding on this you see also that the little kid you know who seemed sort of brave before Prince

249
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,080
Jumanji is sort of cowering behind Sullivan now in the face of this monster loser

250
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:25,640
Five

251
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,240
And that's the guy that you chose to cower behind

252
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,520
He was nearest to me

253
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,260
You got to grow up. It's very funny. You're gonna do a lot of growing up in this

254
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,400
I forgot to choose spells or solve it hold on

255
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,000
I just didn't give him any spells.

256
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,500
He's kind of spelled.

257
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,700
Yeah, he's a bard.

258
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:49,300
Yo, yo, magic Sullivan.

259
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,000
Fuck.

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:50,700
All right.

261
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,400
All right, I'll give him this is a good one.

262
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:58,300
So you see him you see Sullivan takes out his piccolo and

263
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:03,600
begins to play it and it plays like I'll just a sort of weird

264
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,500
horrifying screeching note and he casts a fairy fire.

265
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,200
Um, and I think he is so bad.

266
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,500
Like, I made him so bad.

267
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,200
Alright, so let's see how this guy does against, let's see if this guy is able to resist fairy fire.

268
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:26,200
So you see this like, like weird like sort of uh sparkling flame start to go around this uh snake stone monster thing.

269
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:34,200
Um, as it tries to roll uh resistance against being uh entrapped in this thing and set a glow.

270
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
Which would mean you'd all have advantage on attacks on it.

271
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,700
So fairy fire does.

272
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,100
And he actually fails.

273
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,100
Yo!

274
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Yes.

275
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,700
So, Solvin finishes his weird screeching note that blasts from his piccolo, and this thing

276
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:54,260
is sort of glowing now with this amber light that sort of shifts between amber and blue.

277
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:59,080
And you can see now, like, the vulnerable spots on him.

278
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,940
You can see sort of his movements become almost like, you can see the echoes of them.

279
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,860
You start to understand his patterns better.

280
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,660
He just says fuck.

281
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:14,860
So it is now your turn evil Stievel and Sullivan is a smiling smiling quietly to himself.

282
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,360
Okay, good.

283
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:25,040
So I'm thinking because Pat was able to lift him out of the earth by that little sword.

284
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,080
That's got to be some some weakness area up there on that sword.

285
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,740
So this thing is just onyx right?

286
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,740
Pretty much.

287
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:33,740
I'm realizing.

288
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:34,740
Yeah.

289
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:41,740
But I'm gonna use my chill touch and I'm gonna try and grab his sword and fling him around like Bowser.

290
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
Go for it.

291
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:49,740
Okay, that hits. That's gonna do necrotic damage regardless. If you wanna try...

292
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,740
Yeah, I would like to Bowser him, please.

293
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
To Bowser him?

294
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:53,740
Yep.

295
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,740
I mean...

296
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,740
We're on a big floating platform, right?

297
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:03,740
Yeah, I forgot to mention that earlier. You're on a big floating platform in like negative space.

298
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,340
That's great.

299
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:09,540
You're going to have to roll a strength check to do not a

300
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,040
problem.

301
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,740
Yeah.

302
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,940
Okay, go for it.

303
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,140
Six.

304
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,240
Okay, so you do that you see the hand sort of just like the

305
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,540
ghostly hand to sort of like get tired and go like like it

306
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,840
sort of like waves itself like it's panting and but it then

307
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,340
in in that it grips the sword handle harder and you see the

308
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:35,140
the Onyx guy go, "YOUCH!"

309
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:39,140
'Cause it's just like, it's just sort of like concentrated more necrotic damage.

310
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,240
And that, that does, that does full damage.

311
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,740
So you, you did hurt this guy quite a bit.

312
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,140
He's not looking too hot.

313
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Um, uh, okay, cool.

314
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,140
So we're back to the top of the order.

315
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,140
Um, uh, Dogen, it's your turn.

316
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:58,640
Now that you've communed with your god, and he told you to think of dirt, stone, as just really hard dirt.

317
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,440
Yeah.

318
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,140
Does that help?

319
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,840
So I can't hurt dirt.

320
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,240
I could never attack something made out of dirt.

321
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,240
You could like mentally hurt it though.

322
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,240
Okay.

323
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,240
You're not even dirt!

324
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,440
You see, I turned to my friends and was like, "That'll really get him!"

325
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,920
Try stabbing him while you say it.

326
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:30,640
When I turn around to whisper that to Evil Stievel and Patrick Jodar, I'm holding my

327
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,160
war shovel over my shoulder and I turn around and it just hits him by accident.

328
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,280
Yeah, it counts as an attack. Roll attack roll yeah.

329
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,760
16. That hits.

330
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:45,280
It's 11 damage. Fuck yeah, yeah. So you're just like,

331
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:51,840
yeah you just uh, donk, like donk him on the head. You say that to him he's like, "What?"

332
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:58,080
And then you whip around and hit him with the shovel. And uh yeah he takes uh, so he takes

333
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:04,080
some pretty significant damage there. It still is going to be like halved, but he's looking really

334
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:11,920
bad off now. He's sort of like, is kind of woozy. He's probably regretting not taking you guys up.

335
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:18,080
Let's get him. Let's now, let's get, take him to the city. Let's get him to drive us somewhere.

336
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,520
Now that you're about to die, you ready to go on a road trip?

337
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,960
Roll persuasion.

338
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,460
Whoops.

339
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,360
You take the first one.

340
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,520
Well, I do.

341
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,060
Yes, wow, that's a great 20.

342
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,660
You see him do the

343
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,600
do the from the Hercules cartoon.

344
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I'm not worthy.

345
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,660
I'm not worthy.

346
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,760
Worm bow and you see him go.

347
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:53,560
Just.

348
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:55,960
Okay.

349
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,080
You want me to stab you to death?

350
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,080
No, don't do that.

351
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:02,120
That's actually, that's something I'm very much into.

352
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,480
I, I love murder.

353
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,280
*groans*

354
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:13,480
You see his face sort of change back to the chipper, uh, happy, cartoonish sort of looking stone that you saw earlier before you pulled the sword out or tried to pull the sword out?

355
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,120
*inhales*

356
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:19,400
He goes, "Come on, I'll put my back! It'll be a good time! Who knows what'll happen, where you will go!"

357
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,880
See, I like this guy. Let's keep this guy around, alright?

358
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,700
Maybe we won't have to do that again.

359
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,560
You're like the mayor from Nightmare Before Christmas.

360
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,760
I don't know what that is.

361
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,800
Yeah, me neither.

362
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,740
Sure, it's awesome.

363
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,800
Sure, basing your personality around that's fine.

364
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,240
Yeah, I'd love to get some fingerless gloves from that movie.

365
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,920
Up on my back, you see he coughs up like a couple of pebbles.

366
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,420
He's just in a lot of pain.

367
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,120
Is the sword still in his head?

368
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,720
Yeah, it's still in his head.

369
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:55,080
So we don't have to find you a fat guy or a cow now?

370
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,800
No, no, just don't kill me, you know?

371
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,880
Alright, alright, and I like put my knife away.

372
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,960
I sit on his head, on his sword like a dildo bicycle.

373
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,280
Yeah, I like stuff in my ass, I told you I'm evil.

374
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
What about that is evil?

375
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,800
I don't know, I'm evil and I like it.

376
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,440
Alright, well your logic there is sound.

377
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:21,440
I'm not going to look into that any further.

378
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Thank God!

379
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Okay. So you all hop on his back, including, you see the Prince Jumanji is a little hesitant,

380
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,440
but he manages to sort of just crawl and get himself up there.

381
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:42,440
And Sullivan's on the back as well. And this thing now, he says to you,

382
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:47,440
"Where do you fellas want to go then, huh? Where do you want to go?"

383
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,000
- Where, what, I don't think we know.

384
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,880
- So, out of the woods.

385
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,720
- Out of the woods.

386
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,080
- Over the river.

387
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,920
Through the woods.

388
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,120
- Through the woods to grandmother's house.

389
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,840
- Oh, take us to grandma's house.

390
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,000
- All right, sounds good to me.

391
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,880
And you see him just about face

392
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,920
and dive deep into the woods at like a very quick speed.

393
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,760
- Uh oh.

394
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,560
- Yeah, you guys pass by all these weird woodlands

395
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,480
these these sort of this brush and this this like these weird critters and

396
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,560
plants that are like squawking and chirping it's a very weird surreal sight

397
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:27,400
and he just sort of abruptly stops in front of this clearing and you see a

398
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:35,240
massive tree in front of you in front of this clearing and he says grandma's in

399
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:40,000
there if you want to see her now I feel I feel like there's a little bit of

400
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,080
deception here I think that you're a little bit mad at us your voice is

401
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,240
starting to change a little.

402
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,560
- No, come on.

403
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,120
I mean, I am, look, I'll be honest with you.

404
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,320
I'm very scared of you.

405
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,160
- Yeah?

406
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,960
- So I'm not gonna do anything crazy.

407
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,800
- How scared?

408
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,620
- On a scale.

409
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,200
- Is this like your grandma?

410
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,320
- No, she's sort of the grandma of the area.

411
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,880
You know what I mean?

412
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,680
- I know exactly what you mean.

413
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,440
- Every area has a grandma.

414
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,220
I think we all know that.

415
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,960
- Well, the Kubler elves sort of have

416
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,600
a matriarchal structure, right?

417
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,160
So she lives in here.

418
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,560
- The Kubler elves.

419
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,560
Yeah, they're kooblers.

420
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Alright.

421
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
Say no more.

422
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Yeah, I get that one too.

423
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
Yeah, we know. We know.

424
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Is it crystal clear?

425
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
Mhm. Okay.

426
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
Right as rain.

427
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
So, koobler elves.

428
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
Yeah, anyway, so, this is the grandma in here.

429
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Okay, I go knock on...

430
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
What, did grandma's in the tree?

431
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
That's what he said.

432
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,560
This guy's weird. I'm gonna go knock on the tree like a door.

433
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:51,880
Mm hmm. As you do, you see uh the sort of an outline start to

434
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,800
form in front of the tree that looks like a door and you see a

435
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,960
little, you know, little slider slide through and you see these

436
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:04,840
uh little spectacles peeking through and you hear uh uh who

437
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:11,400
who is it? It's your grandson. Oh dear, please do come in and

438
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,800
And you see the door sort of start to peel away bark by bark

439
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:21,100
and then just sort of fall away into the ground and you see a

440
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:26,100
really beautiful little like hobble and a beautiful little

441
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:32,300
grandma and she's she's got a little coobler elf ears like a

442
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,300
seven described the grandma.

443
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,900
Yeah, so she has in detail.

444
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,200
Yeah, so she's head to toe.

445
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:47,300
Okay, sorry sizes bust size bust is a triple H like the

446
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,900
wrestler.

447
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:59,500
And her hair is of course a it's just sort of like a turf

448
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,600
bang sort of look.

449
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,800
She's very in these days.

450
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:10,200
Not that turfs are and she now I love her.

451
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,460
(laughter)

452
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,360
- Dogon.

453
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,580
- That's what turf bangs are in this fantasy world.

454
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,640
(laughter)

455
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,140
- It's the blade of grass.

456
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:24,080
It's the grass that's hanging on your forehead.

457
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,360
- Yeah, it's the turf bangs.

458
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,200
- Yeah.

459
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,960
And she's wearing otherwise,

460
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,600
sort of like a very like dowdy,

461
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,800
sort of worker elf kind of outfit.

462
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,680
And she sort of like looks around

463
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,480
and she sees the sword and the stone and you look now if you turn around you see it is

464
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,280
now just a stone again.

465
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,680
And she's like, "Oh, you ran into old sword stone over there."

466
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,000
Is it sword stone stuck in my butt?

467
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
That's his name?

468
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,960
I don't think his kind have names.

469
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,160
They're just sort of mean, you know?

470
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,280
Oh, you're a racist grandma?

471
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,280
No.

472
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:09,780

485
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,580

Anything other than dirt?

496
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,500
When I tried it, can I use my um

497
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,620
Divine sense to see to detect a good and evil. Yeah, absolutely

498
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:30,060
Okay, I'm gonna use that. Mm-hmm. I

499
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,340
I use it.

500
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
Mm-hmm.

501
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:36,900
Yeah, so when you do that, it's basically you're checking to see if there's anything

502
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,180
in the location that's affected by, you know, that is a...

503
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,540
Yeah, I just want to see if the cookies are like evil magic or something.

504
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,540
Yeah, no.

505
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
Yeah, they're just cookies.

506
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
They are straight-up cookies.

507
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:51,420
You're not detecting anything crazy about them at all.

508
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,260
Do I detect evil Steevel?

509
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,780
Yeah, you just...

510
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,780
Oh, yeah.

511
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,780
Yeah, when you look over at evil...

512
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,900
Do I have to use detect Steevel for that?

513
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:09,900
When you look over at Evil Stevel, you just hear the seer in its entirety somehow in a moment.

514
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,900
I'm popping my balls with a needle while you look at me.

515
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,900
[laughter]

516
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:24,900
You see Sullivan the Frog, he takes off his hat. He's wearing a hat, Joey, if you're listening to this, somehow.

517
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:30,340
It's all that says, uh, uh, uh, Ms.

518
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,000
Ms.

519
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,780
Grandma, uh, you see me is okay.

520
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,060
I got some info.

521
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,780
Did you do see that?

522
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,340
She, uh, does not have a ring on her finger.

523
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,060
Baby.

524
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,660
You ever thought of being a movie star?

525
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:51,180
Where he, we're three casting directors.

526
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:54,820
You're looking for our, our, our lead role.

527
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,820
I guess roll deception.

528
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,820
Mike love 3.

529
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,820
I'm going to put my foot down if he has to roll deception.

530
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:10,820
I've already rolled it. No I have not.

531
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,820
Oh no.

532
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,820
I'm not going through with this.

533
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,820
It's a hand.

534
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:27,300
What is happening?

535
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:30,180
Never mind I guess.

536
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,740
Kind of another reality up.

537
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:36,740
It got kind of stopped, kind of halted.

538
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,980
I'm sure there's a world.

539
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,580
You know what I want to do right now.

540
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,260
Oh it's crystal sir.

541
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:49,460
I'm sure there's another world and another podcast where this all ends very differently.

542
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:56,460
It's probably on Gas Digital.

543
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:04,740
Yeah, probably.

544
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,460
Yeah, anyway, continue with the cookies or whatever.

545
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:17,460
By the way, we're three casting directors.

546
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:28,660
to cast you in our play and it's nothing nothing sexual about it.

547
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:32,620
No, but do you have a black couch in this hobble?

548
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,120
No it's not that.

549
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,460
That is not what's gonna happen at all.

550
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:41,100
uh... probably problem

551
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:45,380
it's because do you know what do you do you know do you know oklahoma

552
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:49,400
can you see you sing a few bars from oklahoma for us

553
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,040
that exists in this time

554
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,380
uh...

555
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:53,940
all

556
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,340
all right you guys i don't know we're feeling that he's really not a citizen

557
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,640
she's horrible and uh...

558
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,140
and i know why we ever wanted her in our sexual play

559
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:11,620
So what ails you my children?

560
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:14,900
I was trying to distract you.

561
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,540
So I could talk to my boys.

562
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:20,780
We're trying to get back to Trebuchet village.

563
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:25,780
We got launched here by a volcano.

564
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:28,140
With a force of 1000 dragons.

565
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:32,580
It's 10,000 first of all.

566
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,980
Oh, it was even worse than we thought.

567
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:37,220
(laughter)

568
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:44,820
Oh, when she hears 10,000 dragons, her eyes go wide.

569
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,220
You better believe it.

570
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,860
Which is incidentally the name of our play, too.

571
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:57,980
Well, wow, that's quite the story.

572
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:05,380
I haven't heard of this kind of being launched so far.

573
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,380
This is, this is, you're quite far from the village then.

574
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,860
Yeah, we know.

575
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,860
As far as getting back.

576
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,500
We've already said this lady.

577
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,820
This lady's old.

578
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,420
God damn it, she's so old.

579
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:27,900
As far as getting back goes, you'll have to probably have to cut through, well, the bog

580
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,260
of the mud men.

581
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
At least-

582
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
Ooh!

583
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,940
I like the sound of that.

584
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:39,420
I figured you would since you hoped there was dirt in my food.

585
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,460
I thought you thought I meant chocolate.

586
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:44,620
No, that's what the DM said.

587
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:48,540
How'd you hear that, bucko?

588
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,860
I'm confused now, these men are made of chocolate?

589
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,860
Like a...

590
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,980
Well, some say they're made of chocolate.

591
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:58,020
Wait, the DM is making us go through the land of the chocolate men?

592
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,180
And some say they're made...

593
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:03,540
I don't know if I want my character to be in this campaign anymore.

594
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:10,540
You know, you're now sort of bringing the racial elements to the one.

595
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,020
That's sort of on you a little bit, right?

596
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:18,500
No, actually, we're trying to go back to trebuchet, so that we can meet racial elements.

597
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
uh, it's a girl I had back then.

598
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
[laughter]

599
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
It's a girl, it's a girl I was, uh,

600
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,500
quite fond of.

601
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,500
[laughter]

602
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,500
Oh, yeah, we're trying to, we're trying to rescue

603
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
the princess Rachel Lee charged.

604
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
[laughter]

605
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,500
[laughter]

606
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
So how far

607
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,500
away's the bugman

608
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,500
bought, the

609
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
uh, mud bought

610
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,500
the place?

611
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
How far away is that shit?

612
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Hey, uh, hey, hey, grandma, I just, uh, not to alarm you,

613
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:56,500
but your carbon monoxide detector has been beeping this whole time we've been in here.

614
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Which is magically powered by the--

615
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Yeah, your carbon monoxide bird has been squawking.

616
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Yes, like the Flintstones.

617
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,500
Yeah, like the-- yeah, I'm getting a little confused by the setting of this whole thing.

618
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,740
(laughing)

619
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:27,700
She says, "Well, to get to the Mudman Bog,

620
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:32,860
you'll have to cut through a good few hours journey

621
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,520
north of here.

622
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,920
I would suggest you take your stone friend.

623
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,780
It'll make the going a bit easier.

624
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:44,420
And and I also suggest you take this and she and you got each a little sack

625
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:46,960
filled with

626
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,000
An extra day's rations. So you guys have sort of two days rations now. Oh, I already have one day's rations

627
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,580
I don't need this. Oh

628
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,840
Okay, well, actually I'll take his rent

629
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,260
Sure, and

630
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,020
she

631
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,660
turns to

632
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,380
the the little prince and

633
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:09,100
she says

634
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,100
now

635
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:16,820
Do you are you safe with these men and you see the prince no

636
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:23,340
Not at all and you see the prince sort of look to you all and

637
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:29,140
He remembers Dogen and yeah, I smile really big at him and then my teeth are just covered with dirt

638
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:36,540
Yeah, and he sort of like the kid sort of like laughs at this, you know and goes yeah, I'll be okay

639
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:41,640
All right. Yeah, and they're safe with me with me. He's saved with me, too

640
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:50,060
Yep, and so you seem nervous Sullivan do you have a crush on this grandma?

641
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:54,200
We can we can arrange we had a we had a nat 20 roll we can

642
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:00,140
Up, I don't think that carries over the way you think it does. It's pretty much

643
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:06,460
For the that, you know that action, please don't I'm tired of fucking things in these things

644
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,460
I just I want to be normal

645
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,700
All right. Let's go to the bog frog

646
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,660
There's something about it's like a black hole we try to recall that yeah

647
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:24,380
Mud bug bug yeah, but the bug box and

648
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:29,860
As you guys are bugged as you guys are leaving. She says to you and and do

649
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:33,100
Beware that the mud men are not

650
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,100
their

651
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Kind they're fearful

652
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:41,900
But do stay away from the kitsune. They are

653
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:47,940
Terrible fox creatures that worship the jester of the woods. I

654
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:57,580
Know that's what sounds like a lot of a lot of information right sort of wrapped in that I'm realizing now a little confusing even

655
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:01,600
There's a jester in the woods a jet. They the Fox

656
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,220
Foxes are the it's oh, so this is like a worthy Fox

657
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:14,020
It's the jesters in the box and the bugs are in the box is like a Fox worthy of of it being exalted

658
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:17,980
it's the whip it would be where the laughter and

659
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,500
She shuts her door and

660
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:29,100
That's kind of weird now we got another step all right, I guess I'll open his door I

661
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,560
I open it and I leave.

662
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:38,220
You see her like, when she shut the door, she just like, was like, hmm hmm, like carrying

663
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:42,020
on doing her things like you guys weren't there.

664
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Uh, yeah.

665
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
And you turn-

666
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,180
You guys, just real quick, uh, I think that lady's completely out of it.

667
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,620
I think I'm gonna, I think I might, I think I'm gonna do some thieving.

668
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,860
Yeah, okay, here.

669
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,420
I can distract her if you want.

670
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,940
Yeah, that'll be great.

671
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,940
Can you actually, uh-

672
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,340
No, I got a whole, I got a-

673
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,780
Yeah. Thank you so much. That'll be amazing. I go back inside. I don't say anything. I take out my

674
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:14,060
what's it called my pouch of forever dirt, which is a it's a magical pouch that's filled

675
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,380
with infinite dirt and I open it up and I just spray dirt into her face.

676
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:27,740
Okay, I'll have her roll a god I guess it doesn't deal any damage. I know that I'm just thinking

677
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:31,580
I'm double-checking for myself. I don't want to hurt so I don't stealth right now. Oh

678
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:37,640
They do take damage if you spray 30 feet of dirt, okay, okay

679
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:44,700
Wait, I don't would be very funny if you just kill her just fill her whole house with dirt

680
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:49,920
Okay, I started I shoot it around her feet I started casing her in dirt

681
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:57,820
Okay, she's like oh, oh your pouch is spilling and my bad Patrick. Yoda. Are what are you up to?

682
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:00,340
I'm just like looking through

683
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:04,820
What does she have in there describe the house? Yeah, sure

684
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:11,980
So it's sort of you know, it's sort of a classic like a like gnome hobble looking kind of place except it's a cooler elf

685
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,700
so there's like wooden cupboards and

686
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:22,100
Like pots and pans some like vases that are like made of wood that hold little flowers

687
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,940
It's like a very homey looking place

688
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:28,180
So kind of Nate if you want to look at one in the coverage you can but also name something

689
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,660
That's kind of like that and I'll I'll sort of be able to figure out if it's in there or not

690
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,940
I

691
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:35,940
Find this safe

692
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,660
You find

693
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:49,040
If you look in a cupboard I look at covered this just a safe on the wall

694
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,140
If you want to do this stealthily roll roll stealth

695
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:00,800
It'll be a little bit easier because she's a little distracted by all the dirt 25. What are you doing? What the fuck?

696
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,860
What is happening? It's amazing

697
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:08,340
All right. I mean, yeah, you get you kind of get free range of the cupboard

698
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,420
I just take the safe out of the wall

699
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,660
You uh, I'm trying to think what you get from this. Let me look at my notes for

700
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:24,860
I've organized everything very differently from this. It's very exciting for me. I can't wait to share it with everyone

701
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:34,820
Yeah, okay cool so she has in here you managed to get from here like a

702
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:41,300
About 45 gold pieces and a wand of some kind

703
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,540
as well as sort of a box of her cookies that are sort of like boxed up.

704
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:50,540
So you managed to get all of that and just like shove it in your

705
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,540
like sack and just sort of bolt out of there.

706
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,540
So wait, what do I get now? So you have 45 gold pieces.

707
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,540
How do I add this? So go to your

708
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,540
in your equipment, there's like a currency option.

709
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Yeah, you can add the gold in there. 45

710
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,540
And then what else?

711
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,040
You also got a wand. It's unidentified right now, so just put it in your notes.

712
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,040
And if you... somebody has an identify spell, they can figure it out.

713
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:21,040
I'll just...

714
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,040
Anywhere.

715
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:26,040
Like in other possessions, in equipment, you can put it there.

716
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:30,040
And then also you got a box of cookies.

717
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:34,540
So, those box of cookies count as three uses of a healing potion.

718
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,040
Okay.

719
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,040
So, you can add three healing potions if you click "Manage Equipment".

720
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,040
and add those in there.

721
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,040
And that's basically the same amount.

722
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,040
Wand and cookies and other possessions and then three healing potions.

723
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,040
Perfect.

724
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,040
Do I have healing potions already?

725
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:52,040
No, you don't. So this is good.

726
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,040
Healing potions are very valuable.

727
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,040
I have healing too, just so you guys know if you ever need.

728
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,040
Yes, you have Lay on Hands.

729
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:00,040
Okay, so I just added those.

730
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,040
Okay, cool.

731
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:04,040
Yeah, so the dirt is just slowly filling up.

732
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,040
Like, Dogen, are you just like

733
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,040
looking at her? Just like...

734
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:10,640
I'm looking the other way. It's an accident.

735
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,140
Oh, okay. So, uh, yeah.

736
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:15,140
Boy, I sure hope my pouch is closed.

737
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:17,140
[Laughter]

738
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:21,140
So you manage to pick up some of the dirt, I guess, and sort of help her clean it up.

739
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,140
Oh, no, I don't.

740
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,140
You don't? You just leave?

741
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,140
I shovel her out.

742
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:31,140
She's free, but the dirt's staying in. Dirt belongs in houses.

743
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,140
That's one of the main tenets of my religion.

744
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:35,140
Yeah, she's sort of all turned around by all this.

745
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:42,140
this

746
00:43:42,140 --> 00:44:07,140
I'm

747
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:14,640
Okay, cool. So you guys get out of there and you look back to

748
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,740
find that the the stone guy is gone. I mean he ran like the

749
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:27,040
second he got a chance to my **** started frowning.

750
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,440
Yeah. So what do you guys want to do? You can head start

751
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,740
heading north. It's a few hours journey. She said to get to the

752
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:41,440
mudman. If you'd like to start on that journey, I start the

753
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:46,940
journey. Yeah, I want to meet these bugs. I gotta see these

754
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:51,840
mudmen. So you guys are traveling through the woods and

755
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:57,740
you reach the sort of you reach a another sort of point in

756
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,340
this. You've been traveling for a few hours. You're getting

757
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:02,040
a bit tired. You know the kids getting a bit tired too. He's

758
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:05,340
sort of trying to keep a brave face on. He's a nerd. so

759
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:11,340
They're pretty tough, but you know, it's a few hours of travel, so it gets a little exhausting.

760
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:17,140
And as you it starts to feel like a little bit, you know, more humid around here.

761
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:21,140
You think you might be approaching some sort of bog or swamp or something, but instead you

762
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:24,340
sort of come upon a small Creek.

763
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:30,540
It's flowing gently through the woods and you see on the other side of the Creek, you

764
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:31,740
know, that's further north.

765
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,740
That's kind of where you need to go.

766
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,040
The Creek's not going to be hard to get through.

767
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:39,540
It's not like you have to roll or anything for it, but you see on the other side of the creek also a sort of

768
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:46,160
mangled like tent like the first signs of like other sort of you know

769
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:52,220
Bipedal, you know like creatures with you know who are normal regular

770
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:56,960
And you see just like a completely mangled tent and you also see they like

771
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:59,880
massive like

772
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:04,240
15 foot by 15 foot iron cage with the bars bent

773
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:28,660
and

774
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:31,160
Sorry if the person in there can't hear me.

775
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:31,920
Whoa!

776
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,040
Hey, you know, I'm, uh...

777
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:36,700
Oh, keep going, man.

778
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:40,120
You know, I take pride in good design.

779
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,200
Oh, yeah!

780
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,240
And this is actually upsetting me.

781
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,240
He's very upset.

782
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,240
I don't have any other emotion than this.

783
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,080
Can I go? I'm gonna go inspect the cage.

784
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,920
Yeah, yeah, yeah, go for it.

785
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,020
Yeah, you have to roll for that.

786
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:01,960
I mean, you could just walk over and inspect the cage.

787
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,920
It is indeed like a iron cage where the bars have been bent.

788
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:10,360
You see, you do also as you get closer to it, you like your

789
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:17,300
and you see like a pile of like shit, like big, like a big pile of shit.

790
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,200
And, you know, and look at that.

791
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,040
I mean, they know that makes more sense.

792
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:26,180
You can leave the cage bars nice and big because that shit ain't going to escape.

793
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:31,020
You know, when I when I first first second there, I thought this was a hotel.

794
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:33,660
That is a bad hotel.

795
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:35,460
Yeah, this would have been the worst hotel I've ever seen.

796
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,360
When I see the big pile of poop, I scoop up a handful of dirt

797
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,860
and I put into my mouth because I have a question for Dogen.

798
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:44,360
The dirt God. OK, yeah.

799
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,140
No, what's up?

800
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:48,760
Well, how am I supposed to feel about poop?

801
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,700
What's the relationship to dirt there?

802
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,700
It's this brown portion, you know?

803
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,380
Oh, well, you know, so

804
00:47:55,380 --> 00:48:00,660
I'm trying to really figure out the voice for this guy and I think I think this is kind of funny if a guy sounds like this

805
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,100
so

806
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:08,980
Real poop's not really dirt, right? Yeah, I mean, it's not really dirt. It's brown. It's brown and people don't like it

807
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:12,940
So the sort of like a cousin, you know, right? It's like the cousin you don't like

808
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:21,500
It's just you know, you can see it as like a I your sexy cousin no, that's not don't take I would

809
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,740
Can you get straight to the point here?

810
00:48:23,740 --> 00:48:25,900
So you can, what the hell are you talking about?

811
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,020
You can talk to my God right now.

812
00:48:28,020 --> 00:48:28,380
Okay.

813
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:33,580
Patrick, can you, you can look, you can regard poop as something that is to be

814
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,060
respected, but not necessarily touched.

815
00:48:36,060 --> 00:48:37,540
Okay.

816
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:38,380
All right.

817
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:38,540
Good.

818
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,060
That was okay.

819
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:39,820
That was a close one.

820
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:41,100
They will not touch the poop.

821
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:41,500
Okay.

822
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,740
And, uh, yeah, he sort of vanishes.

823
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:46,140
Okay.

824
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,620
I just needed to establish that.

825
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:58,020
was

826
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:04,260
I have a minus one investigation. I'll invest in mine though. I have a pretty good investigation. I got an eight. Mm-hmm

827
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:07,260
I got a seven

828
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:13,780
Damn that's not very good. Are you gonna invest? I guess I can

829
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:19,660
20

830
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,420
Yeah, thank God I saved your ass. Yeah, so you

831
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:30,660
Evil Steve-el from your time seeing causing messes like this where there's mangled

832
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:36,640
Shit everywhere and actual shit everywhere. You sort of are able to parse the wreckage

833
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:44,420
You see in the tent as you sort of peel through it. You see what looks like a flyer

834
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,080
for

835
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,080
Something it's it's it says

836
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:54,560
Come one come all see the magnificent Vegas brothers in our beast. That's too strong to hold in this cage

837
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,160
And as a picture of the cage you see there.

838
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:06,160
And also next to that note, you notice actually a severed hand

839
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,960
resting on it and you see a picture of the beast in there.

840
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:13,760
It's not a picture of it rather, you know, it's first of all the

841
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,560
drawing but second of all, it's like silhouette right?

842
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:21,160
So it looks like a big hulking creature from what you can tell

843
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,160
sort of like troll like almost or like an abominable, you know, Sasquatch-y type of guy.

844
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:37,720
And you also find a small iron dagger that seems pretty unused,

845
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:48,840
as well as 15 gold pieces also sort of lying around, abandoned presumably in haste maybe as they left.

846
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,480
But also with that 20, I'll say that you can also sort of see

847
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,280
you start to get the sense of where of tracks of where

848
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,280
this beast could have went.

849
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,480
They're pretty big.

850
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,280
You see sort of claw marks in the ground going further down

851
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,080
the Creek, which isn't explicitly North, which is where the

852
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:14,780
mud men are, but it is sort of that's sort of where you're

853
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:15,880
seeing those tracks going.

854
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:24,480
can can also it will all take a gold

855
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,840
he he he he

856
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,640
well you know that nobody else is going to jump on it output fifteen gold pieces

857
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,480
in my

858
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:35,120
inventory what's mine is you and then you know all all all all lick the

859
00:51:35,120 --> 00:51:37,800
footprints or whatever the fuck patrick was to do

860
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,280
fifteen

861
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,680
you want to have it do you have a uh... relationship with dirt

862
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,720
so yeah yeah

863
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,920
you know it away and i'm gonna make you stop i think that i pick up the dirt

864
00:51:48,920 --> 00:52:08,780
from the

865
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:14,220
I could let it out in the money for one instead. No, it's a survival is all about tracking. Oh

866
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:22,260
13 roll again, you got advantage advantage. I didn't hear that for it. Okay. Wow

867
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:28,900
Yeah with that 14 you have a pretty good sense of where this guy where this beast

868
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:35,140
went you could see sort of it probably went down the creek because it was

869
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:42,780
Either it was chasing something or because it just would stay by the creek as something that creatures tend to do.

870
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:48,280
And the creek you can also see bends a bit north.

871
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:52,280
So there is a chance that it could lead into the bog, which makes sense because it's a creek.

872
00:52:52,280 --> 00:53:00,280
So you could follow this track to, at the very least, make sure you're not ambushed by something like this.

873
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:03,780
That would be sort of the advantage you're gathering from this.

874
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:08,380
But there's also no reason why you can't continue to cut through the woods where you were going

875
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,780
also, so you guys landed here probably closer to

876
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:17,120
Where you woke up sort of towards daytime right the ceremony was kind of in the evening

877
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:22,140
And now it's about mid afternoon approaching late afternoon. So

878
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:26,380
You know you travel a few more hours. It'll be night. You might want to rest

879
00:53:26,380 --> 00:53:29,060
Set up camp or something

880
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,120
traveling at night in the woods is not always advised.

881
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,400
I say we I say we follow the footprints because that sounds fun.

882
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,500
Is there like a

883
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,600
you're like a hotel around here or something?

884
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,400
Why are you asking me?

885
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,280
I really I'd love to, you know, I'd love to just go to like a restaurant

886
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,740
that's inside of a hotel.

887
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:57,840
That's kind of kind of my thing as a man who was was born with luxury.

888
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:00,540
I uh, you know, I have to say that actually that sounds pretty good.

889
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,380
I mean, I know restaurant right now.

890
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:05,640
I like the little, what they have, the little butters wrapped up.

891
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:07,320
And oh my God, you are so right.

892
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:08,480
Sullivan, I love you.

893
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,820
I'm your biggest fan.

894
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:10,020
Yeah.

895
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:11,420
Can I bunk with you tonight?

896
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:16,180
Uh, well, there's no bunks, but yeah, really close to you.

897
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:18,680
Uh, I mean, I don't see why not.

898
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:20,380
I'm such a big fan of your work.

899
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:25,580
So I haven't, I haven't rolled it in the way you played the piccolo is so allure.

900
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:30,860
okay so i i uh... sort of a workplace violation maybe

901
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:34,700
i don't really know what's going on between you two but uh...

902
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,180
if we could find like uh... maybe like a four star maybe a five star hotel

903
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,660
that's kind of the uh... the life i'm uh...

904
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,780
accustomed to

905
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,580
why not a six star one

906
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,140
you know i i don't- it's fantasy world that gets infinite stars

907
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:50,780
yeah let's try and find a one hundred

908
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:56,480
six-star can was just talking that's ice high sorry sometimes you guys

909
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,540
and jim on g_ the prince you have not said a word this whole goddamn time

910
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:05,480
i said why said was that he said some words that i i i guess i just uh...

911
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,740
i'm sorry listening to you 'cause your child yet that's

912
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,060
like it that a lot

913
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,540
at home so yeah

914
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,420
responded to that whole life

915
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,620
that's bad

916
00:55:14,620 --> 00:55:17,620
the

917
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,440
so now that you've bought it

918
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,100
what don't want become a some hotel

919
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,720
yet think i think you would probably i mean

920
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,380
is the uh... the son of

921
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:27,460
of a royal

922
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,860
you probably uh...

923
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,840
yeah probably the most about

924
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,340
hotels well there there's a six star when i was just saying inside clock

925
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:35,660
hassle

926
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,500
uh... maybe when we get back we can all go

927
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:41,040
also you're not talking about right now you're talking about

928
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,080
no let's go back to trebuchet village uh... i'm five so you know

929
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:49,720
i've never really been to the woods i'm pretty scared

930
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:53,640
now that's probably why you've been so good anyway stay quiet also i was sick

931
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:57,560
of hearing you talk also i'd like to apologize to the frog here

932
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,720
uh... i wasn't gonna stab you five hundred times in the leg on our

933
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,520
i'm over that

934
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,760
is it does although i would have had to have addressed that earlier

935
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,840
that to make logical sense i feel like i can't

936
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:13,880
among keep up that emotion now

937
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:18,080
that's all gone now

938
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,080
all right now we've forgotten that up. I forgot where I was going with that bit

939
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:25,120
anyway can we just go on with the story?

940
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:27,760
yeah sure. Should we follow the footprints?

941
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,280
all right I think we should follow the footprints

942
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,380
yeah let's just go

943
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:34,060
we can just like step in them like it's

944
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,280
plus none of us took any damage right? we should be good to just keep going.

945
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:40,480
actually i'm gonna use my... who's damaged?

946
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,120
uh... it's good i have a look at the negative two health points and less

947
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,760
than a year old all-time and also

948
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:53,760
i do not have a negative two point sorry i'm subtracted to have seven sorry

949
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:58,200
you know i don't really think it's not a good idea but i have actually

950
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,600
you've been a ghost this whole time that's a plot twist that would be a fun

951
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:05,920
yeah i'll tell you all feel you to for me and you both the full age because i'm

952
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,360
missing again i can feel up to five h p prolong rest

953
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,320
Just in case, because I figure we're going to, we're going to rest pretty soon.

954
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,760
Anyway, you never know.

955
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:17,720
All right.

956
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:18,440
All right.

957
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:19,720
So you keep following the footprints.

958
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,320
Yeah, me too.

959
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:25,640
So yeah, that 14 again, you're pretty, you're able to keep track of that.

960
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:28,380
Those footprints you're able to sort of get the sense of, of, uh, you're able

961
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:32,480
to sort of keep up with them even as they grow a little bit fainter as you, they,

962
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:37,000
the, the running, whatever sprinting this beast was doing got more intense and you

963
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,200
follow along the creek. You see sort of a you see a birds

964
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:45,080
jumping out of the water and fish flying in the air above

965
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:48,360
them swooping down to eat the birds in the water. You know

966
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:54,200
that's so that's seriously strange. It's **** wacky here

967
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:58,120
and you also as you follow the creek, you also start to start

968
00:57:58,120 --> 00:58:05,000
to hear. A bit of laughter you start to hear a bit of that.

969
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:09,620
Oh boy, that sounds great. We should know what's up with it.

970
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:12,740
Uh, it's not coming from any particular direction.

971
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,100
And you guys walk for another hour or so.

972
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:22,420
And, uh, it doesn't feel like...

973
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:24,820
Uh, actually, you know what?

974
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:28,500
What's everyone's passive perception?

975
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,460
Ten.

976
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,180
Mm-hmm.

977
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,900
Um...

978
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,260
Fourteen.

979
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,940
Mm-hmm.

980
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:34,980
Do you wish you...

981
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:39,300
evil swell you for a day

982
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,300
weird

983
00:58:40,300 --> 00:58:43,140
that patricia are yet yet you got such good

984
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:47,900
you know you know you know i don't know if it will be crazy okay uh...

985
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:49,660
so yeah patrick you know there

986
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:50,300
uh...

987
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:51,140
youth

988
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,220
began to notice that

989
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,300
the sun has not moved

990
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,500
uh... or whatever

991
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:02,100
plenty but i'm not touching that it's a football yet he had that the son of the

992
00:59:02,100 --> 00:59:05,160
Hey, you guys, the the king's son has not moved.

993
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:09,140
He's still he's all the way back there.

994
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:12,000
Oh, yeah, we got to go get off.

995
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,400
And as you walk back to pick up the boy,

996
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,040
you realize that the sun in the sky is also not moved.

997
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:21,500
Maybe he can try.

998
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:24,940
And as the sun moves, the sun in the sky moves.

999
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,940
It's a puzzle. You see, it's like brain

1000

courtesy of Jonathan Blow.

1001
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:37,140
So yeah, but you notice that the sun in the sky is not moved as you guys have been walking down the creek.

1002
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:39,840
Hey guys, the sun in the sky hasn't moved either.

1003
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:42,640
And as you...

1004
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,640
I just realized this.

1005
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:51,840
And as those words sort of leave your mouth, sort of leave your mouth,

1006
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,440
so you hear the laughter grow a little bit louder

1007
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,240
and you see what looks like kind of

1008
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:05,320
pixies of some kind sort of fly around your head patrick she o'derr

1009
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:12,320

01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:17,160
uh... it's not going to make it

1011
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:19,920
it twice as long

1012
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:21,920
Yeah, literally, yeah, just double it.

1013
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,920
I'm doing this for the fans!

1014
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,920
[laughter]

1015
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,920
That's right, you guys want long episodes, right?

1016
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,920
This is...

1017
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,920
This is how we do it.

1018
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,920
[laughter]

01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:35,920
Yeah, and, uh, they, they, uh,

1020
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
they, they are

1021
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,920
flying around your head, and they're,

1022
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,920
they're sort of giggling and laughing,

1023
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,920
and, and, uh, um,

1024
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,920
you see them sort of, uh, uh,

1025
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:47,920
look toward you all, and they say,

1026
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:54,080
here to see the jester? No. To see the jester and you see them

1027
01:00:54,080 --> 01:00:56,880
they're kind of repeating it back and forth and laughing as

1028
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,360
they're saying it. So the the jester the uh the kitsune

1029
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:06,080
jesters? Oh no not the kitsune. They just worship the

1030
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,480
jester. They worship the jester. They see

1031
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,440
they're just they're sort of like talking in time in like a

1032
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:14,720
weird rhythm. And that's and that's the and that's the uh

1033
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:18,960
The worthy fox you were you were talking about jester fox worthy

1034
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:23,840
That's what worthy fox meant, okay

1035
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:27,840
All right. I'm back now. I get it now. Um

1036
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,040
uh, you see them say

1037
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,240
Uh, if you wish to see the jester you can if you want to see the jester and they say that again again

1038
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,640
No

1039
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:39,680
Uh

1040
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,920
And you see them one of them starts to cry

1041
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,000
When you say no

1042
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:48,160
Alright fine, I guess we'll I guess we'll see the no don't

1043
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,960
They unless we should I agree. I said it was like evil or something

1044
01:01:52,960 --> 01:02:01,600
Grandma was an evil because I'd use detect evil when we were in the you did just use it on the cookies

1045
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,280
You guys could roll an insight check. See what you think. Yeah. Oh, yeah

1046
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:13,040
I'll use it again right now. I got a 15 in sight. Yeah

1047
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:20,040
I mean, the divine sense is only going to be able to tell you if something is celestial or fiendish really.

1048
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,040
Which in this case, no, I mean, they're neither celestial nor fiendish.

1049
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:30,040
So they're not good nor bad from what you can tell, at least in that classical sense.

1050
01:02:30,040 --> 01:02:39,040
For example, like if you used divine sense on a demon, you would know it was on somebody and they were a demon.

1051
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:42,040
You suspected they were a demon, then you'd be like, oh, shit, that's a demon.

1052
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:45,480
Um, uh, but yeah, sorry with 15 insight.

1053
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:48,480
What are you trying to get insight on exactly?

1054
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,600
Evil.

1055
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:59,120
If the, if the, um, you can't really just gather like from what they're saying,

1056
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:04,880
whether or not the jester is bad, but what you can gather, I'm trying to get insight

1057
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:05,800
on vibes.

1058
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,160
Yeah.

1059
01:03:07,160 --> 01:03:08,200
Yeah.

1060
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:09,040
That's a good thing.

1061
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:14,760
I mean like they're fey creatures like pretty clearly.

1062
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:21,920
So the vibes you're getting are like they are dangerous and weird.

1063
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,600
And there's no real way to know how to predict what they're going to do next.

1064
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:33,960
Let me ask you all a question.

1065
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:44,420
to you like to play tricks on uh on guys like me see you see you're laughing

1066
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:50,400
right now I you're laughing you're laughing harder after I say that all

1067
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,000
right you're laughing is as hard as you can I don't want anything to do with

1068
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:59,240
these pixies yeah and it seems like you're gonna get very upset if we don't

1069
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:03,360
see the jester so we don't have in a it's kind of a we don't know that I mean

1070
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:05,800
Let's just try walking away.

1071
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,640
Yeah, maybe we should...

1072
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,200
Maybe we should walk.

1073
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:14,640
Let's just keep going. Maybe we should walk and like make sure that there's none of

1074
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:18,600
them behind us. So maybe we'll walk. Yeah, one of us can face backwards.

1075
01:04:18,600 --> 01:04:19,920
I'll stand guard.

1076
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,720
Okay, one of us stands.

1077
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:26,440
You stay here, you make sure the pixies don't follow us and then

1078
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:29,480
we'll keep going. Yeah, no, you guys go on without me.

1079
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,280
Yeah, we'll do something like, okay, so we go forward.

1080
01:04:32,280 --> 01:04:35,320
And if the pixies start to move, you run and catch up with us.

1081
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,320
Tell us and then you can go back to see where they went.

1082
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,560
Something like that.

1083
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:43,060
But when you do that, make sure you walk backwards so you don't lose an eye.

1084
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:44,400
You don't want to lose sight of the...

1085
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,400
Yeah, don't lose us.

1086
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:48,300
Maybe I'll do the moonwalk so they think I'm actually walking towards them.

1087
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,100
Hey, if you can do the moonwalk...

1088
01:04:52,100 --> 01:04:53,200
Not a problem.

1089
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,000
A dance created by the ultimate evil.

1090
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:05,980
most evil dance you can do. Moonwalk. That would be amazing. That would just be top notch.

1091
01:05:05,980 --> 01:05:12,980
I would absolutely love it. Evil Steve, roll performance. I don't have to start yet, right?

1092
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:17,980
No, you don't have to do it yet. No, you know what? I'm calling your bluff. I'm about to

1093
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:24,980
fucking blow your mind with this performance check. Wow. A pretty fly moonwalk. You see

1094
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:31,260
You see them like sort of like, huh? I'm almost at you guys pretty soon here. Give me a minute

1095
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:37,380
They're like watching and they're like, huh? Like like confused. I'm almost there

1096
01:05:37,380 --> 01:05:48,780
You can see I'm walking towards y'all I'm like I'm like I'm about to be at y'all so you gotta fucking chill right now

1097
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:50,900
Cuz I'm almost there. Here I come

1098
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:56,220
My also I could be under some sort of shrinking spell also

1099
01:05:56,220 --> 01:06:02,220
Logan and I have not left yet

1100
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:11,000
I might have pop my shit too early

1101
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:20,740
See the pixies are laughing - they're laughing along and they say the Chester will see you later

1102
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:26,580
and they just poof they vanish and sort of like a cartoon you see the sunlight

1103
01:06:26,580 --> 01:06:34,620
and it becomes night. I turned to the party and I just say now you

1104
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:40,100
see that that does not bode well. I mean that right there that's good

1105
01:06:40,100 --> 01:06:43,900
conflict resolution I don't see any way that that could you know that's that was

1106
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,220
fine that was easy we didn't have to fight anybody. They said the jester will

1107
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:51,680
see us later that's that's a that's like maybe maybe it's like how they say

1108
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:56,040
goodbye yeah right yeah maybe or maybe the just oh my god Sullivan we are on

1109
01:06:56,040 --> 01:07:01,980
the same wavelength that's crazy I have a nice wide sleeping bag by this is so

1110
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:08,220
much worse how far away is evil Steve oh I'm super far away and I see that they

1111
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:15,060
left and I open up a notebook to a page it says dance offs one and I put a tally

1112
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:22,540
the

1113
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:28,380
the

1114
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:51,300
was

1115
01:07:51,300 --> 01:08:13,420
is

1116
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:18,660
not a map that's not what I was asking. No, I could draw a map. Yeah, that would be great.

1117
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:21,860
We could actually figure out where we're going. Okay, I draw a circle and then I put a dot

1118
01:08:21,860 --> 01:08:28,340
in the middle that says "us." Something like that. I like take the paper out of his hand

1119
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:39,060
and I just kind of like slap with my back hand. I'm like, "Yeah, this is perfect." Yeah,

1120
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:45,540
So it's night time now, so you guys can either set up camp or keep walking to the creek.

1121
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,220
I can't wait to set up camp.

1122
01:08:48,220 --> 01:08:49,220
Okay.

1123
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:53,900
So you guys spent some time getting some logs together.

1124
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:57,940
I'd say you're all adventurers, so you have some experience and knowledge of how to set

1125
01:08:57,940 --> 01:09:00,460
up camp.

1126
01:09:00,460 --> 01:09:06,500
You see while you're doing that, little Prince Jumaji is trying to do the moonwalk with his

1127
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:09,540
six legs and he's just not quite able to do it.

1128
01:09:09,540 --> 01:09:11,380
It's just kind of a little confusing.

1129
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:16,900
Wait, can evil Steve just like be like a dance mom for him now?

1130
01:09:16,900 --> 01:09:17,400
Yeah.

1131
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:17,900
Yeah.

1132
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:23,300
It's just like getting mad at him for not doing the steps correctly.

1133
01:09:23,300 --> 01:09:25,140
You're still walking forward!

1134
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:28,100
I just, I don't, I have too many legs for this I think.

1135
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,540
Who made this dance you said?

1136
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:32,180
Stop making excuses. It doesn't matter who made it.

1137
01:09:32,180 --> 01:09:33,700
He was, man he was evil.

1138
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:38,100
Okay, uh, alright. So let me try...

1139
01:09:38,100 --> 01:09:42,900
No, also the talons I'm realizing now also make it really hard.

1140
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:45,160
'Cause I have talons.

1141
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:47,580
Maybe you just weren't built to dance.

1142
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,580
I don't know if I was built to dance.

1143
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:53,020
Then stop trying. Go ahead, give up. See if I care.

1144
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:56,140
I'm not gonna give up!

1145
01:09:56,140 --> 01:09:57,980
I'm not gonna give up!

1146
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:01,260
You know what happened to me? You know why I'm so good at dancing?

1147
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:02,500
Wh- why?

1148
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:04,940
'Cause I lost my entire family.

1149
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,460
Oh, yeah. So now you still want to quit?

1150
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,660
That's what made you evil. No. Yeah.

1151
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:14,460
Wait, that's what made you evil or that's what made you good at dancing.

1152
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,460
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

1153
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:19,800
You guys are sitting like cooking up food for you.

1154
01:10:19,800 --> 01:10:23,040
I think we're sitting on those chairs where, you know,

1155
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,940
you know, conversation hits different in those chairs.

1156
01:10:25,940 --> 01:10:29,140
That's so true.

1157
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:33,180
So like, tell me about like your experience before your family was gone.

1158
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:37,100
I mean, pretty much I pretty much I had a family before that.

1159
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:40,140
Damn. And I didn't know how to dance.

1160
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,140
You know, I didn't. And then I did.

1161
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:44,840
I I didn't believe them when they said conversation hit different on these chairs.

1162
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,840
I mean, it's got to be something in the in the craftsmanship of these chairs.

1163
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,840
I mean, maybe maybe a witch put a spell on them or something.

1164
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:56,540

What, do you think I am a freak?

1182
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:43,660
Fellas, if we return this prince to the village, to the king,

1183
01:11:43,660 --> 01:11:45,900
we'll have all kinds of walls to fuck.

I'll tell you that. We're gonna have just...

1185
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:52,160
- Even really... - You wanna fuck a wall?

1186
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:53,860

01:11:57,760 --> 01:11:59,400
- I was trying to... - Why'd you bring it up then?

1190
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:02,840

1191
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:03,840
yeah

1192
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,320

1193
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,800
you're sitting on the prince

1194
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,800

You know like a five-star hotel a five-star hotel or like a king size king size bed

01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:43,040
You guys can do a watch too so you can have like somebody watch for half the night and somebody watch for the other half

1207
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,040
Yeah, I'm not gonna watch it all

1212
01:13:10,080 --> 01:13:15,960
Gonna completely ignore all of you and go to sleep. Okay, so you're going to sleep

1216
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,760

1217
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:35,760
Hitze Sullivan. You can like... roll perception, Dogen.

Okay.

You can't... you love watching Sullivan soundly sleep.

1221
01:13:43,760 --> 01:13:48,760
I was gonna say, if you got high enough, your character would be able to tell by his breathing,

1222
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,760
he is not asleep and he's just...

1223
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:57,760
just

1224
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:01,000
like a little ways up from camp

1225
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:05,160
uh... sleeping like a log

1226
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:06,760
uh... but you're awake

1227
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:07,880
uh...

1228
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,880
the prince tried to stay awake and he fell asleep

1229
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,640
uh... rolled for him

1230
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:13,640
uh...

1231
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:16,080
so it's good that you're awake though dogan so

1232
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,640
and then do now

1233
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,640
Is you're you're dogan

1234
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:26,400
You hear a cry from in from in the woods beyond past the creek, right?

1235
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:29,600
You guys have been walking along the creek or sort of further wooded area

1236
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:32,240
uh, um, you know nearby

1237
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,360
And you hear like a cry a yelp of pain

1238
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:38,080
like oh

1239
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,240
Um from deep in the woods

1240
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:46,240
You don't have to do anything with that

1241
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:51,320
I take a mouthful of dirt and I just say, "Hey, what's up?"

1242
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,320
And I just have a conversation with it.

1243
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,320
Oh, what's going on, man?

1244
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,320
How you doing?

1245
01:14:56,320 --> 01:14:57,320
I hope I didn't wake you up.

1246
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,320
I'm just bored.

1247
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:01,320
I mean, there's literally nothing going on.

1248
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,320
Yeah, no.

1249
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:08,320
If you try, it's a kind of dirt.

1250
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,320
It's outside Granite Town.

1251
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:12,320
Oh, the granite dirt.

1252
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:13,320
I've heard about that.

1253
01:15:13,320 --> 01:15:14,320
Yeah.

1254
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,320
I heard about that in the dirt newsletter.

1255
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:17,320
You got to try that because

1256
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:22,900
Sorry, yeah, you gotta try that because it gives you a little bit of a bush - you know

1257
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:25,620
I don't tell you that but some dirt she kind of fucked up

1258
01:15:25,620 --> 01:15:32,560
You know that I I actually didn't know that that's you know, this just goes to show you how much interesting stuff

1259
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:37,400
There is to learn about dirt. Yeah, I think anybody who denies that is, you know, yeah, you know that to me

1260
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:43,120
They're heathen, you know to be honest, you know, and you know, I'm your loyal servant or whatever

1261
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:47,320
I would probably kill them or you know, maybe no, you know knock him around a little bit

1262
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:52,340
So I'll get a cleric in there see if you can convert them and if they still are pagans, you know

1263
01:15:52,340 --> 01:15:55,060
Then you could do your work, you know, yeah, it's not a problem with me

1264
01:15:55,060 --> 01:16:06,240
Can you keep that down over I really I need eight hours I kick him in the head

1265
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:12,680
And who do you kick in the head? I'm Patrick

1266
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:19,200
I'm not I'm not asking you to keep it down. I'm asking the person screaming to keep

1267
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:25,600
Kicking me was very unnecessary and I'm okay. Sorry. I misunderstood that. Yeah, you know what?

1268
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:29,280
I do I feel mad at you. I feel really bad. Uh

1269
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:37,560
You here, you know have some dirt the stuff tastes really good this I can actually I can do nothing with this but I do appreciate

1270
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:42,880
You hate I know this means a lot to you. Oh, I'm not handing it to you. It's going in your mouth

1271
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,240
I

1272
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:50,000
Don't believe a lot of you with your brother

1273
01:16:50,000 --> 01:17:02,080
If you could actually just get

1274
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:14,480
In my bag there's a magic epi-pen. If you could grab the magic epi-pen and just DM me at the leg real quick.

1275
01:17:14,480 --> 01:17:18,480
Please, I mean look at my face, it's swelling up.

1276
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:20,480
I can't see, it's so dark.

1277
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,480
I can't wait.

1278
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:24,480
You know my god says dirt heals all wounds.

1279
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:30,480
No, it's not gonna, actually I'm pretty allergic to dirt and I need you to hit me with an epi-pen.

1280
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,480
Fine, I'll do the epi-pen.

1281
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:39,480
the

1282
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:43,640
and then uh... as you're going to have a good patrick you know it are with the

1283
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:45,200
epi

1284
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:49,180
you here don't get any guess you've had to answer your week

1285
01:17:49,180 --> 01:17:52,040
you've made your point

1286
01:17:52,040 --> 01:17:55,680
and

1287
01:17:55,680 --> 01:18:00,960
you know anything else for the rest of the night

1288
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,960
Well, that was random.

1289
01:18:02,960 --> 01:18:08,400
And yeah, it's a long rest even though I took watch

1290
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:13,520
No, that's why you do it trying to do it in shifts so you can fuck you guys

1291
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:19,840
You literally wanted to stay up and watch fucking i wouldn't have done it if I knew I couldn't like sorry

1292
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,280
You don't know the rules. I can't heal you guys now. It's your your fucking funeral. I'm fucked. I'm full

1293
01:18:25,280 --> 01:18:29,200
My belly's full dude. I feel like fucking thanksgiving

1294
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,600
I could kill you in your sleep if you don't wake up.

1295
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:32,600
Okay, wait.

1296
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,600
Well, actually, I should say...

1297
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,680
I shake evil people awake and I say, "I'm going to kill you right now unless you take

1298
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:38,680
a second watch."

1299
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,680
Well, actually...

1300
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:40,680
Don't care.

1301
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:41,680
Well, actually, you know what?

1302
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:47,080
Because a long rest is technically extended downtime of light activity.

1303
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:53,920
So it could be sleeping, but it could also be eating, drinking, reading, and tending

1304
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:54,920
to wounds.

1305
01:18:54,920 --> 01:18:55,920
Or standing.

1306
01:18:55,920 --> 01:18:56,920
That's right.

1307
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:57,920
It better be...

1308
01:18:57,920 --> 01:19:01,920
We're standing watch for no more than two hours.

1309
01:19:01,920 --> 01:19:03,920
So, that's the only thing here.

1310
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,920
Is there short rest at least? Please?

1311
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:07,920
Um, well yeah.

1312
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:09,920
I guess the short rest doesn't help me at all, does it?

1313
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:13,920
I mean, you definitely got, yeah, you could use a hit die for that.

1314
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:16,920
But I have full health. No, I can't. I just can't recharge my abilities.

1315
01:19:16,920 --> 01:19:17,920
Yeah, no.

1316
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,920
I mean, I guess it's you guys that suffer.

1317
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:21,920
Yeah, you guys suffer.

1318
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:22,920
How do we suffer?

1319
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:23,920
I don't care.

1320
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:24,920
Because I can't heal you anymore.

1321
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:27,320
You didn't heal me in the first place, so...

1322
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,820
And I was already kinda mad about that, so that's... that's fine.

1323
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:31,820
You did heal me. You said you were full health!

1324
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:33,320
No, I lied.

1325
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:35,320
I wanted to, I wanted you to... I'm so much healing on Patrick,

1326
01:19:35,320 --> 01:19:37,820
and he thanks me by having a fucking allergic reaction

1327
01:19:37,820 --> 01:19:39,820
and making me tense again for a little bit.

1328
01:19:39,820 --> 01:19:42,320
I wake up, I wake up, and because of the EpiPen,

1329
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,820
my just, like... I'm like shaking.

1330
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:46,820
That was a...

1331
01:19:46,820 --> 01:19:50,320
That was a pretty weird night. Okay, I took all of their gold in the night.

1332
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,320
You didn't take all my gold! No! No, I did.

1333
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,820
Okay, then no! Oh, I thought you were asleep the whole night!

1334
01:19:54,820 --> 01:19:56,820
Because if you're sleeping at night I can take your gold.

1335
01:19:56,820 --> 01:19:58,820
You gotta at least roll a fucking stealth check.

1336
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:00,820
I woke up with an epi pen.

1337
01:20:00,820 --> 01:20:02,820
And then you went back to sleep, right?

1338
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,820
Yeah. Or did you stay up and take watch?

1339
01:20:04,820 --> 01:20:06,820
Because I need an

1340
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:08,820
it's an either or here.

1341
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,820
Do you want gold or do you want me to have my ability stashed?

1342
01:20:10,820 --> 01:20:12,820
I woke up, okay?

1343
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,820
But I stayed in bed

1344
01:20:14,820 --> 01:20:16,820
and I acted like I was asleep.

1345
01:20:16,820 --> 01:20:18,820
So you didn't

1346
01:20:18,820 --> 01:20:20,820
Well that's

1347
01:20:20,820 --> 01:20:22,820
that is long rest territory.

1348
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:23,320
it.

1349
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:23,820
All right.

1350
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:26,420
So everyone had a long rest then.

1351
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:28,520
Okay, it sounds like everybody.

1352
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:31,220
Yeah, anytime anytime sweetheart.

1353
01:20:31,220 --> 01:20:36,020
So I think you all got a long rest except Sullivan who was

1354
01:20:36,020 --> 01:20:43,220
terrified the whole night of something happening to him at

1355
01:20:43,220 --> 01:20:44,520
4 30 a.m.

1356
01:20:44,520 --> 01:20:46,920
I walk over to Sullivan and go how do you sleep?

1357
01:20:51,220 --> 01:20:54,900
that you know if he's like so pretending he's asleep anybody starts a

1358
01:20:54,900 --> 01:20:56,380
fine

1359
01:20:56,380 --> 01:20:59,980
uh...

1360
01:20:59,980 --> 01:21:03,740
uh... so yes the next morning uh...

1361
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:09,300
you hear a cock a doodle do you hear all the the critters start to stir about

1362
01:21:09,300 --> 01:21:12,660
uh... and yet the path the path along the creek

1363
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:15,820
same as always so you can still make it to the mud village

1364
01:21:15,820 --> 01:21:18,820
where the mud man's uh... bog

1365
01:21:18,820 --> 01:21:19,760
uh...

1366
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:23,640
uh... you can keep walking there for a couple more hours and uh...

1367
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:27,360
do you guys want to do that or do you want to do something else?

1368
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:31,760
I think we head to the box. Yeah, so you walk a little bit further along the

1369
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:36,000
creek for a couple more hours and it's sort of mid-morning now

1370
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,520
and you reach

1371
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:43,960
a sort of a more of a really dense forested area, right?

1372
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:47,320
uh... you hear lots of croaks of

1373
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:50,040
non bipedal frogs.

1374
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:57,240
And you start, you know, weird fungus that like hisses as you walk by, things like that.

1375
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:03,120
And you come across a bit more of a clearing and a bit more sort of reed sticking out of

1376
01:22:03,120 --> 01:22:10,080
a swampy muddy water, sort of cakes along your legs.

1377
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:14,440
And you see a mud hut.

1378
01:22:14,440 --> 01:22:15,920
And you start to see another mud hut.

1379
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:24,440
And you see sort of these mud men poke their heads out of the windows of these little mud

1380
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,880
hovels, these mud homes.

1381
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:32,720
And as they pop out, each of them smells either like poop or like chocolate.

1382
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:39,880
And it's sort of anyone's guess which one they smell like at which time.

1383
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:46,920
And you see now as you guys are walking through and you hear like a lot of hum and a hum

1384
01:22:46,920 --> 01:22:53,300
and a and then you see sort of three larger ones sort of gather in front of you as you're

1385
01:22:53,300 --> 01:23:00,280
walking past these little hovels and you see the mud mud children sort of like hiding behind

1386
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:06,760
the skirts of their mud mothers and you see these three ones who say.

1387
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:21,600
the

1388
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:47,760
as

1389
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:53,120
Please don't do that. Please don't do that. Please don't do that. Yeah, come on. Hey, is this chocolate tastes like some damn mud?

1390
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:58,260
That's right. We're made of mud, but just we smell like poop or chocolate

1391
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:03,360
You see one of them to the right goes like yeah, I got the short end of that stick. I

1392
01:24:03,360 --> 01:24:06,720
Like that one

1393
01:24:06,720 --> 01:24:11,240
What is your name sir

1394
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:15,040
Who are you? My name is my name is mud kip

1395
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:18,420
That is that like one of the laziest

1396
01:24:18,420 --> 01:24:21,600
things I've ever heard

1397
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:24,300
Look I'll admit

1398
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,300
Didn't come up with a name for this guy

1399
01:24:26,300 --> 01:24:31,320
Okay, I've been trying to have less named NPCs. His eyes are white right now

1400
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:45,280
But you my name would not be understood by your kind you may call me mudkip, how's that is that chill

1401
01:24:45,280 --> 01:25:00,200
the

1402
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:05,480
seem like you're around from around here you know. Because we're not made of mud.

1403
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:14,880
Well yes but I mean the woods do you wish to leave? I don't remember. Yes yes yeah

1404
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:19,280
we're trying to get to trebuchet village. Didn't you want to go to a hotel? Oh yeah

1405
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:24,480
that's yeah do you have like maybe like a mud hotel or something here? Yes one star.

1406
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:44,440
the

1407
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,440
That's what it's called.

1408
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:53,280
Maybe there's like a maybe like a resort or casino here or something.

1409
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,520
No, I'm just looking. There's no gambling allowed.

1410
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:04,880
It's something I like to do. No, we understand. Many people do. We simply cannot afford to gamble.

1411
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:06,880
We are made of mud.

1412
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,880
Our gamble was made long ago.

1413
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:14,180
You know, we were once not made of mud. What were you made of?

1414
01:26:14,180 --> 01:26:27,860
of

1415
01:26:27,860 --> 01:26:28,860
clean it off, don't...

1416
01:26:28,860 --> 01:26:31,360
I just, I look at, I look at Dogen.

1417
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:32,360
Yeah, you really...

1418
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:34,860
You think I didn't realize what mud was?

1419
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:38,360
You really, you're just, uh, you're made out of dirt and water.

1420
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:42,860
Do I, what are you trying to do here?

1421
01:26:42,860 --> 01:26:49,860
I put, I put the mud man's fingers in my mouth and I ask my god, do I like water?

1422
01:26:49,860 --> 01:26:56,860
Dogen does not answer.

1423
01:26:56,860 --> 01:27:02,360
Thank you.

1424
01:27:02,360 --> 01:27:03,660
He nods to you.

1425
01:27:03,660 --> 01:27:12,160
We do not normally take to outsiders, but you see we were

1426
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:16,960
recently ransacked by some beast that tore through here and

1427
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:23,560
you see sort of a destroyed mud huts a little mud house.

1428
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,560
It's all like kind of like broken into.

1429
01:27:26,560 --> 01:27:32,360
He says it was a terrible sight to leave.

1430
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:34,260
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

1431
01:27:34,260 --> 01:27:34,860
Oh, please.

1432
01:27:34,860 --> 01:27:35,260
Yeah.

1433
01:27:35,260 --> 01:27:38,460
What did this just suffered a lot of trauma but go on?

1434
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,560
Yeah, I don't care.

1435
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:42,660
What was the what did the monster look like?

1436
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:47,260
He looked like a big

1437
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:54,760
looked like some type of Sasquatchian type of creature.

1438
01:27:54,760 --> 01:28:00,200
Very furry, covered in fur,

1439
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:05,040
and when he moved, he would stomp on the ground

1440
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:08,160
with these fearsome claws and then roll.

1441
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:10,560
- Did he leave footprints?

1442
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:13,040
- I mean, yes.

1443
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:14,600
- I think this might be the same beast

1444
01:28:14,600 --> 01:28:16,640
that we were following before.

1445
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:18,680
- I mean, they all got sort of absorbed in the mud

1446
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:25,440
any, you know, sort of, uh, you could, you could certainly look to see if, is that going

1447
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:28,160
to look, we just, I'll help you.

1448
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,920
Uh, I can help you leave here.

1449
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:31,580
We will.

1450
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:35,300
And typically we will not show the way to outsiders.

1451
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:40,040
We don't want people to come in and find us, but if you are able to find this

1452
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:47,160
beast and perhaps slay it, bring honor to our people, we can show you out.

1453
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,680
and we have to slay it i can't just uh...

1454
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:52,400
who established like a friendship

1455
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:55,880
there's something in the maybe straight away we'd like to have my thing is that

1456
01:28:55,880 --> 01:29:01,560
we have some we exchange harsh words and it knows it we it understands no

1460
01:29:08,340 --> 01:29:11,540
destroyed our people we have so little

1476
01:29:55,740 --> 01:29:59,420
I'm putting it on lipstick and I look- I don't hear him and I look at him and I'm like "What?

1477
01:29:59,420 --> 01:30:01,700

1482
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:18,180
spraying dirt all over the ground oh that's lovely wait I've got an idea and

1483
01:30:18,180 --> 01:30:22,780

1484
01:30:22,780 --> 01:30:26,780
bucket of water and I start throwing it at the dirt trying to make a mud guy mm-hmm

1485
01:30:26,780 --> 01:30:41,540
we can make you a baby please do not see you guys know about spelling it cuz

1486
01:30:41,540 --> 01:30:49,140
we're with a child you see that you turn you see that Prince Jumanji is like

1487
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:56,140
a half way in the mud. And he's like, "Get out of there!"

1488
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:58,640
"That is their home! Get out of their home!"

1489
01:30:58,640 --> 01:31:05,640
"I'm not, no, I'm sorry, I'm sorry." And you see the mudmen, they go, "Oh, nard."

1490
01:31:05,640 --> 01:31:10,640
While all that's happening, I have Sullivan and I'm taking some of the Forever Dirt and water and I'm just like...

1491
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:15,640
They realize Sullivan's there for the first time. "Oh, shit! We just thought that was like a frog."

1492
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:20,120
