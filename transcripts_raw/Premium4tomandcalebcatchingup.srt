26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
- Yeah, as he's stabbing you to death for 75 cents.

27
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,640
- Right, exactly.

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,840
- That was great, so Patrick--

29
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,960
- I got paid yesterday.

30
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,040

00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,920
Oh yeah, you got your refund too?

32
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,760

33
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,760
- You got a refund?

34
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
I said a refund from Subway.

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,720
- Oh, yeah, a Subway refund.

36
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,320
- Yeah, for the finger that was in your sandwich.

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,520
But point is, Patrick came to the dorm

38
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,360
and he hung out with a bunch of my fellow med students.

39
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,240
- Yeah, and then Tom left me in the room.

40
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,100
- I left him in the room for like 20 minutes

41
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,440
'cause I was talking to one of my friends in the hallway

42
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,040
and I was really nervous about what I was gonna come back to.

43
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,640
(laughing)

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,000
Patrick alone.

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,800
- Patrick alone in a dorm.

46
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,960
- Yeah, just drooling. - With med students, yeah.

47
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,320
That I don't know.

48
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,980
- Yeah, so do you live with other people in this dorm?

49
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,520
- Yeah, so I have a single, I have this one other dude.

00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,240
- Jean-Luc Picard.

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,780
- Jean-Luc, I'm not gonna say his last name.

54
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,620
I don't know. - No, say it.

55
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:58,880
(laughing)

56
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,720
- He has a Patreon, they gotta pay for it.

57
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,920
- Yeah, yeah, that's whatever.

58
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,640
- Actually, you know what, if it's Patreon,

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,840
it's people who look him up. - Literally, so he's

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,560
this cool dude. - True.

61
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,080
- He literally looks exactly like Steve Harrington

62
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,240
from Stranger Things.

63
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,360
- Oh, my brother met him.

64
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,760
- He's very handsome. - Exactly like who?

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,680
- Oh, it is 50 Hours.

66
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,160
- Steve Harrington from Stranger Things.

67
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
- Yeah. - Yeah.

68
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,760
- I know.

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,320
- Yeah, I've had a couple drinks, so you know.

70
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
This might not come up clean.

71
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,640
- You can tell me what part of town you're living in.

72
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,400
- So I live in technically the South End.

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
- The South End-y, baby.

74
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,320
- No, I live by Boston Medical Center.

75
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,240
- South End is the nicest part of the city, I feel like.

76
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,080
- Yeah, well it turns real quick,

77
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,720
'cause it does turn into like basically--

78
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,000
- At night it's a whole different place.

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
- Are you saying the part by the trains is the bad part?

80
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,040
- Yeah, I mean like, yeah.

81
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,160
I wouldn't call it, yeah.

82
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,560
- This is awesome.

83
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,260
I will, safe isn't the first word.

84
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,440
- What stop are you closest to on the orange line?

85
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
- Mass Ave, probably.

86
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,940
- Oh, yeah, okay.

87
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,780
Come on, I can, yeah.

88
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,980
- But you're like a mile away from Mass Ave.

89
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,580
- Oh, word, okay.

90
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,580
- Just Patrick kick-flipping his way.

91
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,420
- Yeah.

92
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,380
- I am actually neighbors with Lloyd now.

93
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,980
- Oh, yeah. - I see Lloyd all the time.

94
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,820
- Really? - Oh, we have--

95
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,500
- Yeah, yeah, the-- - We should have Lloyd on

96
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,820
when I get back.

97
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,220
- Honestly, it would rule.

98
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,340
- Oh, it'd be so good.

99
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:20,680
- It would be so fucking good, dude.

100
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,720
- I'd love that, man.

101
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,000
- I wanna ask him about his gloves.

102
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,560
He wears finger, he's a Boston comedian,

103
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,720
wears fingerless gloves everywhere he goes.

104
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,040
- I wanna see him do karaoke.

105
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,200
He does like, so he does comedy, he also does--

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,560
- Yeah, he's a Michael Jackson impersonator.

107
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,400
- Yeah, he does like, basically,

108
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,200
he's basically a Michael Jackson impersonator.

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,280
And he's probably like,

110
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,800
he's too nice to be in Boston comedy.

111
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,640
- Right.

112
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,600
- Yeah.

113
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
It's not great.

114
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,900
- You gotta be hard, you gotta be hard

115
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,040
to be in Boston comedy.

116
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:48,980
- Patrick, shut up.

117
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,640

00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,000
LA's a never-ending nightmare.

123
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,560

I think I've been thinking about that line.

177
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think I've been thinking about that line.

178
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,720
drive Tom has one of those little like wine tumblers and they're pouring him a

179
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:11,440
shot and then Tom takes the bottle and then pours fucking four shots worth of

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,280
alcohol into the thing and they everybody at once like once they noticed

181
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:22,480
they were all like what are you doing people are taking shots of rum at

182
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:29,720
medical school yeah I never want to go to the fucking wasteland shots of rum

183
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,520
don't go to the dentist already ruining I'm so depressed yeah I can imagine

184
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:46,480
yeah you look terrible I was thinking I was thinking on the way over here how

185
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,640
funny it is that like you like at the end of this will like plug your Twitter

186
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:57,440
account and then it'll just be like 10 more strangers who follow you as you just tweet

187
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
like another day in hell.

188
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Like every 16 minutes.

189
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,400
I love being Irish.

190
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,120
Just oscillating between like I'm getting drunk right now and then I got too drunk and I'm

191
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,920
thinking about dead people I used to know.

192
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:16,820
Honestly it rules because it's like I feel like every once in a while like a couple people

193
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:21,220
that I've known like you guys or like other people online will like retweet me

194
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,460
and I'll pick up like 10 followers and then I'll tweet something like "oh went

195
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,700
on this date with this girl didn't go well gonna kill myself later" and then

196
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:39,220
I'll just lose them immediately. As it should work. People are like "oh maybe this guy's funny" and I'm just like "no."

197
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,340
Because you don't you don't even put jokes online. It's just people who only

198
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,540
know me intimately might enjoy. Yeah exactly yeah it's more theater than

199
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,940
anything else. Theater of the mind. I would describe myself as an artist and I have.

200
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,940
He did five minutes ago. Yeah some girl was like I'm upset you guys aren't coming out

201
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,300
with us to Fabrico which is just like a yeah a club in Cambridge and there's like

202
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,100
you're not coming out that's upsetting I'm like I'm sorry we're artists we have

203
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,300
the podcast. Yeah this is art baby. Yeah just the fact that there's just a

204
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:18,740
woman's titties over your right shoulder is beautiful. It's called a pinup, Tom.

205
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,420
It rocks, honestly it rocks because it's just like I know the reason it's there.

206
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:27,740
This is your brother's room? This is, for the last time, this is the office in his

207
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,060
house. You wanna know why I love that? Because it's your brother's too cheap to

208
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:37,580
buy internet to have porn. So you can just...

209
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,980
Yeah, I'm not connected to the internet right now.

210
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,180

It's just me and Tom catching up.

225
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,020

227
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,100

I work at a pool place.

229
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,540
- Okay.

230
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,380
- Yeah, I install pool tables.

231
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,780
- You don't wanna talk about it on,

232
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,040
- Oh, you sell pool tables?

233
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,880

234
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,700

237
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,860
- No, I only lose money on pool.

238
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,700
- Oh, hell yeah.

239
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,140
- Yeah, no, I play Filipino eight year olds

240
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:45,420
and they beat my ass for $15.

241
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,100
Yeah, it's really cool.

242
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,940
- That's cool, man.

243
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,420
- But I mostly, I just sell like pool sticks

244
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,420
to just like cranked out fucking maniacs in Santa Clarita.

245
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,260
That's pretty cool.

246
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,180
- Yeah, just looking at what you're gonna be like.

247
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:06,580
Yeah, just tiny little chicken legs, giant fucking veiny forearms, and a constantly runny

248
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:11,460
nose asking about where they can get the new--

249
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,180
Just a grown man who maybe has two weeks left.

250
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,180
Right.

251
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,180
Yeah, yeah.

252
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:19,860
I mean, there are people who come into the shop who have done so much meth that their

253
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,860
hearts are blue.

254
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,860
Jesus.

255
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,060
And you can see it bumping out of their chest.

256
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:33,520
they're like what kind of sticks you got yeah yeah this poplar yeah what is this

257
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:49,100
you just saw a guitar and there's like it'll shoot good there is a guy who

258
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:54,660
comes in and looks like a like a juiced-out ghoul I swear to God he looks

259
00:11:54,660 --> 00:12:00,020
like a 250 ghoul. Hell yeah. Yeah and he sounds like that too. Yeah. He's always

260
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,500
saying smooth skin. He's always saying smooth skin. I only have three options of

261
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:10,980
dialogue when I talk to him. If your charisma goes up any higher you may unlock a fourth. I get a

262
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,340
fourth one that says in brackets charisma. Yeah. I can use my charisma points to say

263
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,340
"Fuck you, man."

264
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,180
(laughing)

265
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,940
And he'll go, "I like the sound of you.

266
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,560
"I like your style, kid.

267
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,860
"I respect you."

268
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Yeah, man, it's awesome.

269
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm gonna buy out the whole store.

270
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,380
We, did I already talk about the guy who tried to sell,

271
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,220
or tried to buy a pool table

272
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,540
with a stolen credit card on here?

273
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,940
Oh, you might know, I think this is good for Patreon.

274
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,900
What a king, what a king.

275
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,660
True, yeah, so we got--

276
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,540
Can you drop the credit card number also?

277
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,740
(laughing)

278
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:51,740
Yeah, I don't care. I don't think I have the credit card. I do have the guy's, uh, the fake

279
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:59,060
I do here. I'll just so yeah, the guy called one day and he was like, um, he sounded like

280
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,700
like that like old clips of like Woody Allen stand up. He's like, um, excuse me, do you

281
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:11,420
have a pool table available? And I was like, yeah, man. Yeah, we sell pool tables. And

282
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,220
He was like good. I want to buy one for my son. He lives in Santa Clarita

283
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:17,860
I live in New York City as you can imagine and

284
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:24,980
And I'll because I am Woody Allen. Yeah, he's really just hamming it. Yeah, Woody Allen. Yeah

285
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:31,100
And he so basically I was just like yeah, we have pool tables for sale

286
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,460
But like he was like, yeah, I want to buy one today

287
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:40,780
I want to buy it today and normally you have to like buy a pool table then schedule a time for us to come deliver

288
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:47,260
it and set it up and shit and he was like no I just I'll have somebody come pick it

289
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,700
up and so already I'm like okay that's weird cuz like you have you need somebody

290
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:57,340
who like knows how to install a pool table and but he did seem to not care

291
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:00,340
and I talked to my boss my boss was like if he just wants to buy the pool table

292
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:08,260
whatever it's like less work for us so he he we go to I like take his car wearing

293
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:14,340
What is this guy wearing? To me he's a phone. He called.

294
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:17,300
Oh he called. Oh wow, I really missed that.

295
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
Yeah, that's a whole part of the story.

296
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:25,300
He called from New York City. He called from New York City.

297
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:31,140
He called from New York City and then so he gives me a credit card and I

298
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:36,180
put the credit card in. It's like a $4,000 pool table. And I put the

299
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,780
credit card in and I'm like what's a zip code and he gives me a Chicago zip code

300
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,380
and I'm like okay so your son's in Santa Clarita, you're in New York and you have

301
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:50,640
a Chicago zip code on your credit card. I don't care because I get a

302
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:54,700
commission on all the sales so I'm really pushing for this to not be a scam.

303
00:14:54,700 --> 00:15:01,140
So then it doesn't go through and he's like okay I have to go to the bank and

304
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:08,020
and um put some money into the bank today and i was like i was like okay yeah man that makes perfect

305
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:14,580
sense to go to the bank yeah i was like yeah dude that you're right you need to go to the bank if uh

306
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:20,820
because the the the charge is declining the only problem is that it's sunday and there's no banks

307
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:27,380
open right now and he was like oh no my bank's open on sundays and i was like okay what fuck

308
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:34,680
Yeah, yeah, it was a Chase card, but Chase is not open on Sundays. But again, I want

309
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,180
that $30 so bad. Also, it's a credit card. Right. What do you mean you have to put money in?

310
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,640
It makes no sense. So then he tells me, then he calls back like an hour and a

311
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:53,700
half later and he's like, "Hey, I, um, I'm sorry. Hey, I need you to run it on two

312
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,380
separate charges okay so half and half so I do one charge $2,000 the other one

313
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:03,860
$2,000 and it goes through and my boss is like okay just get a picture of his ID

314
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:09,980
for the for because we need to we need to have an ID for a sale this big like

315
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:15,940
over the phone so he sends me a picture of his ID and it's a Pennsylvania ID for

316
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:26,140
a guy named Robert Schwarzman and I'm like, "Sure, again, like I need

317
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:31,980
$30 so badly." But so then he's like, "Okay, I'm sending like a group of guys to

318
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,700
come pick it up in about an hour." But so the group of guys, so the shop

319
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:42,140
closes, the shop closes because it's like and my boss comes over to the shop to

320
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:46,720
like basically do the the handoff of the table but I leave because I have to go

321
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,580
to a pool league because we close at 5 they were the guys were coming at like

322
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,200
545 or whatever I leave the shop and start driving to pool league and my boss

323
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,700
tells me he's like he's testing me in text and he's like that that that ID

324
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,840
photo that he sent you you have that right and I'm like yeah and he's like

325
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:08,460
okay it's a live photo I want you to press play on the live photo so then I

326
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:13,020
I open up the live photo and I press, I like hold it down and so it's a picture

327
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:17,540
of an ID and then the picture moves up and it's a guy like

328
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:24,700
it's clearly a black guy's voice saying "I gotta make a couple runs real quick"

329
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:33,220
and then my boss two seconds later sends me a screenshot from Square that says

330
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:42,220
like you have used a stolen credit card. This credit card was just reported stolen. I was

331
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:49,100
like dude fuck yes dude. Here's the best part I still got the commission because my boss

332
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:55,180
paid me before I left. What a king. What a king. Hell yeah. But yeah man it's Santa Cruz

333
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,820
Paradise. That's LA. That's LA baby. That's not even LA that's north of LA. That's like

334
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,420
This is where that mass shooting happened the other day.

335
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,620
- Oh Jesus. - Oh yeah, that's right.

336
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,540
- All right, did you mark yourself as safe on Facebook?

337
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,880
- I did, yeah, I had to.

338
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,340
- Yeah, yeah. - That kid--

339
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,420
- I was not a student at the high school, but the kid--

340
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,260
(laughing)

341
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,180
- Yeah, weirdly I was at the high school for other reasons

342
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,140
on the day, but I'm safe, everybody.

343
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,340
- I remember, yeah, I was at work and you fucking texted me

344
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:24,420
and I had to deal with all these fucking rich people.

345
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,860
Like, I was like, "Oh, it's not a gluten allergy,

346
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,640
"but it's a sensitivity."

347
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,440
And I was like, hey, my friend--

348
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,800
- Don't you serve coffee?

349
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,040
- No, we don't just do coffee, we do food.

350
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:40,040
And I was like, hey, my friend is near a mass shooting.

351
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,960
- Yeah, my friend's visiting his girlfriend

352
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,320
at the Santa Cruz High School.

353
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,760
(laughing)

354
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,000
I don't know if he's safe.

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,120
- Yeah, that's right, she's the guidance counselor.

356
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,080
Okay, and she actually, she lives for those fucking kids.

357
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,540
Thank you very much.

358
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,120
She's teaching them about Shakespeare,

359
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,200
but she's doing it in a way in which they can understand.

360
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,040
So she's a--

361
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,560
- It's almost like peer learning.

362
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,760
- She's saying like, yeah, did you know

363
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,400
that Shakespeare was the OG rapper?

364
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,640
(laughing)

365
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:14,000
The kid who did the shooting, he was--

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,120
- I don't know anything about the kid.

367
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,600
I don't know anything about this situation.

368
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,840
What was his vibe?

369
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,680
- What was his vibe?

370
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,500
- What was his vibe?

371
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,120
(laughing)

372
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,200
- That's Tom asking what race he was.

373
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,440
(laughing)

374
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:33,000
- He lived down the street from my brother.

375
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,160
- Damn.

376
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,760
- Like, yeah, like 10 houses down.

377
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:40,040
- Yeah, that's his house right here.

378
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,440
- Every night he poked his head in the window.

379
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,400
- Did he have like a manifesto or anything?

380
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,680
- No, that's the cool thing about him

381
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,680
is that he kinda did it.

382
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
- That's the cool thing?

383
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,880
(laughing)

384
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,640
- He did it for the lulz.

385
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,900
(laughing)

386
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,740
- It's true.

387
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,380
- That's so sad, god damn it.

388
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,220
- Yeah.

389
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,480
- That's wild.

390
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,600
- I was hoping he would have a cool manifesto

391
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:07,520
that like mentioned my brother, you know.

392
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,760
- There's this guy.

393
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:09,600
- Yeah.

394
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
- Who has this absolutely gorgeous.

395
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,080
- And I can't get over it.

396
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,120
- Absolutely gorgeous painting at his office.

397
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,240
- She's good looking, dude.

398
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
She's really pretty.

399
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,320
- Who was the incel, not shooter, but the guy.

400
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,160
- Elliot Rodger?

401
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:47,360

It's so funny.

00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,580
I wish I could do it.

417
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:17,220
Cale, when are you coming back to Mooyahs?

418
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,060
Not to do like a show, but to do the open mic.

419
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,460
Not to Boston, to Mooyah.

420
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,980
I will be back in Boston.

421
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:29,420
I'm doing, beginning of December, me, Neil, and Gus V,

422
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,260
are all--

423
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,620
we're doing a tour back to Boston.

424
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,340
Wow.

425
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,700
Beginning of Dece-- like after the 14th, or?

426
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,300
Yeah, yeah.

427
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,800
I think--

428
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,900
Are you staying in Boston, or?

429
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,380
So on the 15th, we're leaving.

430
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,220
I think we're doing like--

431
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,420
- So what does a tour back to Boston look like?

432
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,260
What does that mean?

433
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:47,020
- I think we're doing Flagstaff, Albuquerque.

434
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:49,260
- Oh, that's what that text was.

435
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,660
- Yeah, I think we're doing the Dallas Improv

436
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:56,900
somewhere in Atlanta and DC.

437
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,620
And then on the 22nd, we have like a two-hour spot

438
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,660
at the Comedy Studio in Boston.

439
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,340
- You have a two-hour spot at the Comedy Studio?

440
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,980
- Wow. - Hell yeah.

441
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,620
- So that'll be-- - You each get two hours?

442
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,340
- Yeah, yeah, me and, I'm doing an hour 45

443
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,500
and then Gus and Neil can split the rest.

444
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,340
- Yeah.

445
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,500
- Yeah, it's gonna be great.

446
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,300
But I think that's only 20 seconds, so.

447
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,180
Oh, and we're doing one in my hometown in Wilmington.

448
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:24,480
- Are you staying in Boston or?

449
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,180
- Yes, I'm coming back to Boston.

450
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,980
Then I'm leaving, it's basically the day

451
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:32,140
after I get to Boston, I'm leaving to North Carolina

452
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,820
for Christmas and then I will be back and living.

453
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
- It's like a full time back.

454
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,500
- Hell yeah, he's coming back.

455
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,340
- Nice.

456
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:44,500
Oh what can you still go to the show me the body show?

457
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:52,620
Where is that? That's at the Paradise on the 22nd or the 21st. I will not be in

458
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:57,300
Boston on the 21st. God damn. Alright then I'm gonna bring Cameron. That makes sense

459
00:23:57,300 --> 00:24:01,860
you should do that. Yeah on the 22nd. That's more of a me and Cameron thing. Come on.

460
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,020
Come on, dude.

461
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,140
That's a me and Cameron thing.

462
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,300
I love fucking music, man.

463
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
Music's my life.

464
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,900
I just told you I listen to Evenflo right before you called me.

465
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,580
Come on, dude.

466
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:18,620
I was imagining playing Guitar Hero while I listened to it.

467
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,620
Yeah.

468
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:21,120
What Guitar Hero was that?

469
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
That was Three.

470
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
That was Guitar Hero 3.

471
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
That was Legends of Rock.

472
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
Yeah.

473
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
That was one of the first sets.

474
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
That was the one with the guy with the giant chin.

475
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
Yeah.

476
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:30,220
And he wears the leather wristband.

477
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,320
That guy did more for music than anybody.

478
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,540
He was sexy dude.

479
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,740
I liked when it would accidentally make him have girl vocals.

480
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,020
Yeah, like when they did Hit Me With Your Best Shot.

481
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,620
Yeah, and you'd be like, "This kid has range."

482
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:45,580
Yeah, he's got an amazing falsetto.

483
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:49,980
He can do Hit Me With Your Best Shot, he can also do Jack Black in Tenacious D.

484
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,980
He can go, "Rick-a-cake-cake-cake-cake-cake-cake."

485
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:56,140
My favorite part about Guitar Hero is that they always made the girl songs be in the

486
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,540
shitty backyard show that you do.

487
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then any male vocalist is in Madison Square Garden.

488
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:09,540
That's not entirely true. Guitar Hero World Tour, they had a Hayley Williams from Paramore.

489
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
Shut up! Shut up! Literally.

490
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Jesus Christ. Shut the fuck up.

491
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:18,540
I'm just saying, Hayley Williams from Paramore was in Guitar Hero World Tour,

492
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,540
the one with Steely Dan, Do It Again.

493
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:23,540
Steely, okay, we're talking specifically Guitar Hero 3.

494
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Yeah.

495
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Do you have a fact for that now?

496
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,820
Guitar Hero Steely Jay?

497
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,820
I just feel like I never knew how to use my pinky

498
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,340
until I started playing Guitar Hero.

499
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,340
Yeah, I can still play on medium, but I think that's it.

500
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,840
Really?

501
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,840
What was the one where it was like a...

502
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,840
I went up to... what's the one before Expert?

503
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,840
Why am I talking about it?

504
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,840
Hard. There's easy, medium, hard, Expert.

505
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,840
Yeah.

506
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,840
And then I could do hard for a little bit.

507
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,840
Yeah.

508
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,840
And then I stopped playing because I turned 11.

509
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,840
Okay.

510
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,840
And people said that it was gay.

511
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:01,840
- It is gay, yeah, Guitar Hero is a gay CIA psy-op

512
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,460
to convince, or to teach.

513
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,980
- I played Guitar Hero well into my 15s.

514
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,460
- Damn, you know what it was?

515
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,300
- Your 15s?

516
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,880
- I sold my penis too.

517
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,720
That was a crazy year for me, honestly, wild year for me.

518
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,640
I like went to high school, it was crazy.

519
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,840
- Yeah, Tom is like two years older than us.

520
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,680
- Yeah, he's old.

521
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,640
- So when you were playing Guitar Hero, I was 11,

522
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,120
so it was probably the same time.

523
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:23,960
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

524
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,400
- When people were calling me gay.

525
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,240
- And you know what?

526
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:34,240
It is gay to play guitar here. I guess it is a CIA psyop to teach young men how to do gay stuff like finger pussies on expert mode.

527
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
Someone's been listening to Red Scare.

528
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
It's a clit over here. You're wiggling a big clit.

529
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,240
We know you're a Red Scare guy.

530
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I think I am subscribed to the Red Scare Patreon.

531
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,240
You've explicitly told me that fact.

532
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
That's true. Yeah, I remember you telling me that.

533
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I thought I unsubscribed.

534
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,080
- Like, perfect.

535
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:55,920
- The what?

536
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,840
- The People's Republic.

537
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,880
- That's where I told you that?

538
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,720
- The bar?

539
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,540
- Yeah, remember we went there one time?

540
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,380
We had that great night.

541
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,880
- Yeah, with Colin, that was fun.

542
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,400
- Dude, that night ruled.

543
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,000
- Yeah, I wasn't there.

544
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,280
- Not yet, you weren't invited.

545
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,760
- People's Republic is a great bar.

546
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,680
- I was living in Revere, I couldn't go anywhere.

547
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,720
- That's so, it's so funny that I like hung out

548
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,280
with you guys like as often as I did.

549
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,000
And like, I was losing so much money

550
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,840
every time I came to hang out.

551
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,040
- The last half of every hang with Patrick

552
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,960
was him stressing about how to get home.

553
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,120
- Yeah. - He was just trying to walk.

554
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:28,160
- And you just being like, "Hey man, it's gonna be okay.

555
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,760
"You do it every time, somehow."

556
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,160
- Just Patrick walking through the Ted Williams tunnel.

557
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,600
- Right. (laughing)

558
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,880
- Trying to skateboard through the Ted Williams.

559
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,600
- Yeah, on a skateboard.

560
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,100
I'm at that fucking, what's it called?

561
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,880
What's the, what's that highway in, it goes to Revere?

562
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,960
- 93?

563
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,720
- Route one, I'm on route one.

564
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,480
- This is what the people have always wanted

565
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,880

00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,540
- We'll just name him Fat Fucker.

572
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,000
(laughing)

00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:11,840
- He's in medical school now.

574
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,920
- Dude, I lived off of Route 1.

575
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,920
- You lived off of Route 1?

576
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:15,960
- Yeah. - That's disgusting.

00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,860
- I know, I lived pretty close to Kowloon.

579
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:20,960

Yeah, I can't tell which one is which but one freaks out and just runs into a wall and fucks his shit up.

00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,960
Can you tell which one is which?

00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:09,280
Yeah, well they look exactly the same except the fucker is an inch shorter than Yoda

00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,320
and Yoda has blue eyes.

590
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,760
You should just put like a sharpie thing on the side of it.

591
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,260
- You should, yeah, yeah.

592
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,100

593
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:18,940
- Yeah.

594
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:19,760
- I might.

595
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,780
(laughing)

596
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,500
Just like a cool, do a super S.

00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,440
- Yeah, the Stussy logo.

599
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,720
That'd be cool.

600
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,580
- If he did that, and they had the lines,

601
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,520
like the three lines.

602
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,120

00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,960
- Yeah.

608
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,080
- I will say, Caleb, honestly,

609
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,620
I'm looking past my computer right now

610
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,740
and there's a jar of peanut butter

611
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,280
and I'm going to go to town on that tonight.

612
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,120
I'm gonna finish that bad boy.

613
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,640
You're gonna fucking K. Love butter. Well, I mean

614
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:55,040
There's a huge hole in the peanut butter, yeah, I mean I've obviously already fucked it but like, you know, come on

615
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,760
Yeah, you just gotta fuck the peanut butter. Yeah when you see it

616
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,320
It happens. Hey Ben, dude, you look good. Thanks, man. I've been up in

617
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,660
I've been pretty shitty. I mean LA just sucks so bad. Yeah, it sounds terrible Neal

618
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:14,200
Yeah, as a man is Oh Neil is Neil is killing it

619
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,040
- Yeah, dude.

620
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,860
- Yeah?

621
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,700
- Yeah, man.

622
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,320
- I haven't, yeah, I haven't really,

623
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
I think it's mostly just 'cause I'm like,

624
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,000
if we didn't have this podcast,

625
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,600
I'd probably like, would just like,

626
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,560
you would come back to Boston and I'd be like--

627
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,680
- Patrick's shouting right now.

628
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:28,520
- What?

629
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
- Patrick's shouting right now.

630
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,340
- I'm shouting?

631
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,180
- Yeah, yeah.

632
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:32,020
- Oh.

633
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:32,840
- He was just shouting so much.

634
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,520
- Well, if we didn't have this podcast,

635
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,440
I probably would like, not see you guys

636
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,680
for the entire duration of you guys being there,

637
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,360
and then you come back and then I catch up with you.

638
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,640
- Yeah, odd.

639
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,200
- I realize, being out here has made me realize

640
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,200
that I have no ability to maintain friendships.

641
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,840
I don't call anybody ever.

642
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,680
- Me neither.

643
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,600
- It's so stupid.

644
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:59,680
- I text Neil out of the blue,

645
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,300
and then we'll say something,

646
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:06,040
and then I'll get distracted by something else,

647
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,920
and then I won't respond to him.

648
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,520
And then I'll just send him another text two weeks later.

649
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,480
- I feel like you and I have a good thing going.

650
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,640
I'll text you every once in a while.

651
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,040
- Right, yeah. - If something happens.

652
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,320
- Right. - I'll hit you up.

653
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,960
- Yeah, or we're going to the same thing.

654
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
- I'll pretend to be friends with Anjan.

655
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,200
(laughing)

656
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,920
- Patreon, baby.

657
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,080
- I'm just trying to talk to Caleb and Theo.

658
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,760
- That's true, yeah, yeah, in our group chat.

659
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,400
- Yeah. - Yeah, about Sam Hyde.

660
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,240
- Sam Hyde.

661
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,320
We did have that conversation about Sam Hyde recently.

662
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,960
- Yeah, that's for the Patreon only.

663
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:40,880
- Yeah. - The Sam Hyde.

664
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,320
Unlock the Sam Hyde conversation and see me and Tom's opinions.

665
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,840
I'm not telling.

666
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
Yeah, I'm not telling.

667
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,440
I'm not telling who's pro, who's against.

668
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,760
Yeah.

669
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,600
Both pro.

670
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,640
(laughing)

671
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,640
Both pro. Shut up.

672
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,200
Like violently pro.

673
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,080
Yeah, weirdly pro.

674
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,600
It's so funny how like many of--

675
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,400
Yeah, we use the word genius too much.

676
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,240
Yeah.

677
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,080
(laughing)

678
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:02,900
Hyper genius.

679
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,120
Tortured genius.

680
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,960
Yeah.

681
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,520
It's so funny how many of like Sam Hyde's fans,

682
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,880
like you fucking, when you tweeted that thing

683
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,920
that was like something about like inherent racism

684
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,520
and like, oh, you can't, yeah,

685
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:18,520
like no amount of class consciousness will ever like,

686
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,000
I don't remember what the fucking tweet was,

687
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,840
but then someone said some like diehard--

688
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,920
- Basically people from New England are racist.

689
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,440
- Yeah, yeah, that's the gist of it.

690
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,440
And then some like diehard Sam Hyde fan was like,

691
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,120
oh yeah, big words make you smart.

692
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,520
And it's like-- - Fucking owned.

693
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:34,360
- For like, for a group of people who were like, oh--

694
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:36,880
- A grown man whose Twitter account is called Brain Getter.

695
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:37,720
- Right, yeah.

696
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:38,560
(laughing)

697
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,900
- We were like, we were engaging.

698
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,520
For a group of people who were like,

699
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,240
"Oh, you just don't get Sam Hyde," or whatever,

700
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,800
it was like, "Oh, well you don't get other things,

701
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:52,680
"'cause you're so deeply involved into this one guy."

702
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,180
- I mean, the TED Talk ruled.

703
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,020
- Oh, no, I'm not saying--

704
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:57,240
- Did you show up to a TED Talk lying your way into it

705
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:00,020
and just planting for the first 10 minutes?

706
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,400
- He was like, "Other stuff is bad."

707
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,260
I'm not saying I'm not one of those people who's like--

708
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,040
- As Patrick says as he crosses his legs with a pink sock.

709
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:18,640
this is the this is the this is a media criticism Patrick using a bubble pipe I

710
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,520
will say I will say Patrick asked if it was okay if he hit his jewel and my

711
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,800

712
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,400
like yeah Pat it's fine you've changed Pat Pat used to come over and sit on my

713
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,740
bed and fart for an hour while we recorded the podcast that's true yeah

714
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:39,420
- Yeah, 'cause I would go to McDonald's or the Middle East.

715
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,060
- Yeah, and just get loaded up.

716
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,420

718
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,900
and I think about you every time.

719
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,020
- That's a long run.

720
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,500
- I went to Veggie Galaxy with Dom the other day

721
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:52,180
and fucking just walking past 35, I was like, ah.

722
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,020
- It's like, fuck.

723
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:53,860
- Old times.

724
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,220
- My boy.

725
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:59,940
- My UCB teacher, he used to live in 35.

726
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,760
- Really?

727
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,600
- Yeah.

728
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,820
- Wait, so what are you doing at the UCB?

729
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:05,180
Are you taking classes there?

730
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:12,060
No, I'm taking a class through college that is a UCB class, but at the UCB I am a...

731
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,500
I gotta stop telling people this. I know.

732
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:19,900
It's the most embarrassing thing. It's just for another month. Nobody can get me...

733
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:27,340
Patreon challenge, get me fired from the UCB in the next month. It won't be that hard.

734
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,980
How do you get fired from taking a class? I know.

735
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,340
No, no, no, no, no. So I work front desk at the UCB.

736
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:33,840
Okay.

737
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:34,340
Okay.

738
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:34,840
Yeah.

739
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,340
Okay.

740
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,340
So you let Aaron Glazer in.

741
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,840
Yes, exactly.

742
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:39,840
I put a stamp on his hand.

743
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,340
Tap him off and you're like, "Hey, what's up, homie?"

744
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:41,840
Yeah.

745
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:42,340
Yeah.

746
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:42,840
What's up, dog?

747
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:43,840
You're my best friend.

748
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,840
You're my best friend here.

749
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,340
Hey, hey.

750
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:47,340
I don't believe a word they say.

751
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,340
You just tap him off.

752
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,340
Look, I haven't heard anything about it, but you seem like a good guy.

753
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:51,840
Yeah, yeah.

754
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,340
Yeah.

00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:52,840
Cool.

00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,840
Yeah, he's funny.

757
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,340
Yeah.

758
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:57,840
He does his thing.

759
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
He was great in Wolf of Wall Street, baby.

760
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,840
He was in Wolf of Wall Street?

761
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Yeah, he was really good.

762
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,340
Damn.

763
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:08,260
He played Jonah Hill. No, he played the other guy. He played Jonah Hill's brother. He played Leonardo DiCaprio

764
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,480
Yeah, he played Leo. He played the other guys one time

765
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:16,740
Do this but like I was with my friends who were all taking acid. I've never done acid

766
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,260
It's fun too much of a coward

767
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,260
Caleb and I did acid and then we watched Wolf of Wall Street and

768
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:29,500
Then they just like as we finished I was like babysitting. Yeah, like as we finished there's like let's play it again

769
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:35,600
again. And then finished again, they're like, one more time.

770
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,300
We watched nine hours of Wolf of Wall Street.

771
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,900
Three and a half hour long movie.

772
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,300
God damn. Jesus Christ.

773
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,700
That's the whole fucking trip pretty much.

774
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:53,300
I went from hammered to like drunk to hungover over the course of the movie.

775
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,500
When me and Pat did Abso together, we just watched Awesome Powers.

776
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,020
and you know what really you hit Neil in the head with a shovel no no that was a

777
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:06,460

778
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:12,420
no Toy Story it's Toy Story 2 oh is that what he got yeah it was so easy but it

779
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,620
was the scene where I feel bad talking about this it's not the Woody getting

00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,180

781
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:25,340
that like dream where he's like oh and he's gonna throw me away and then like I

782
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:27,340
I understand where Neil's coming from here.

783
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,340
Oh, that is a scary part of that movie, yeah.

784
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,340
Yeah, that is a very scary part of that movie.

785
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,340
That's a great movie, though.

786
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,340
Yeah.

787
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,340
Played by Wayne Knight.

00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:45,340
And then we walked, and then we did a, we took a long walk to a, just a part of, it was like around a lake, it was where we were staying.

789
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:50,340
Dude, I wore fucking, I wore a pair of like, chucks.

790
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,340
And I walked through.

791
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,180
- Hell yeah.

792
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:57,300
- I walked through like two inch deep like snow.

793
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,380
Not even like, no that wasn't two inches,

794
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,220
I'm fucking bad at math.

795
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,540
- Yeah, it was more than that.

796
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,340
- Yeah, it was like, it was at least a foot of snow

797
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,500
that I walked through in caves

798
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:09,100
and I didn't feel anything. - Just so wet.

799
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,060
- Yeah, it was fun.

800
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,940
I wanna do it again next time I'm back.

801
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,820
- Yeah. - Or when I'm back.

802
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,420
I guess I am moving back, I keep forgetting that.

803
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,260
- Yeah. - It's gonna be weird.

804
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,580
I think I'm gonna be working at a children's museum.

805
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,400
- Really?

806
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,240
The children's museum?

807
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,120
- The one on the water?

808
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,960
- I don't know.

809
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,900
- Did I love that name? - It's just a name of science.

810
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,960
- Did your girlfriend get you that job?

811
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,600
- I fucking wish.

812
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,080
No, it was, I think Gus.

813
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,400
I think Gus is, Gus told me his mom runs some--

814
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,760
- Gus was on camera the other night.

815
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:39,080
- Yeah, I saw that. - It was cool.

816
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,760
He was super pumped.

817
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,680
- Yeah, he really did enjoy that.

818
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:47,680
- Yeah, he wore that shirt for quite a while.

819
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,560
- Like a whole week?

820
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
- Oh wow, that's a bad look.

821
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,960
You know, it was cool. It was cool.

822
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,560
As much as I wanted to make fun of him for it, it was like, yeah, you have it.

823
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,920
You're the first person I know with a TV credit.

824

00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,920
I mean, he's not wrong.

828
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,040
No, it's technically true. He just got molested by Ray Romano on stage.

829
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:15,760

00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,120
literally like the least I fucking hate medical students I'm the least fucking

847
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:53,000
worried worrier person yeah you were just what have you had come back and

848
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,760
they were doing gastric bypass surgery

849
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:05,160
gonna happen. They're just pinning him against the wall. It's like, "You need it!"

850
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:15,120
"I'm not that big!" "But you will be!" Patrick just hitting his jewel on there too.

851
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:21,040
My guts are out. People are just so rude. It sucks. There was this kid, I was walking

852
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,200
across, I was trying to cross Mass Ave a couple days ago and I saw this kid who I go to school

853
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,200
with this like other like med student with his girlfriend he was holding her

854
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,700
hand and we were crossing in the crosswalk and I was like hey man like

855
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:37,240
what's up like it was so excited like excitedly being like hey how's it going

856
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,280
man it's like it was like outside of school and then he was just like I had

857
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,320
sunglasses on and I guess I was like a partly cloudy day he just goes

858
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:49,640
sunglasses really well and then him and his girlfriend just start cackling at me

859
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,840
And I was so humiliated so that is a white microaggression

860
00:40:53,840 --> 00:41:00,780
One of a white man for having sunglasses on on a cloudy day, that's our culture, buddy

861
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:06,400
And I was in the middle of a fucking intersection. I could I had no response. I just I

862
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,000
Just ran out

863
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:16,640
I was I was weeping I was weeping damn damn cold. So that's so that's why you've been so depressed

864
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:26,720
Yeah, yeah, it's because a guy said, the guy acknowledged you had sunglasses on.

865
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,720
A guy and his girlfriend made fun of me.

866
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,760
God, dude, medical school sounds tough, man.

867
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:33,000
It sucks that in three years you're going to be a millionaire.

868
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,000
God, what a nightmare.

869
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,560
Yeah, and Caleb and I are going to be interns at like fucking, some shit.

870
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:43,440
I can't wait to cut you open for whatever surgery you need.

871
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,440
And then like, we get into your guts and it's just like, "Oh, I'm going to have to cut you

872
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:49,640
and he's just like, "Oh my God, he's had seven 7-Eleven hot dogs

873
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
the past 48 hours."

874
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,640
We specifically asked him not to eat.

875
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:56,440
I get bottom surgery just to get a new asshole.

876
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,940
You get another stomach where your penis would be.

877
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,940
You remove your penis to make room for another stomach.

878
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:06,940
Yeah, my girlfriend really doesn't like it, but uh...

879
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,940
I've been just pounding on it.

880
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,440
My body, my choice.

881
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,940
Patrick asked for his stomach lining to be replaced with Teflon.

882
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,200
(laughing)

883
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,620
- Yeah, he has to be replaced.

884
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:22,120
He has to be replaced with fruit roll-ups.

885
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,020
(laughing)

886
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,620
Stitch together fruit roll-up.

887
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:26,460
- Hell yeah.

888
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,380
- The only thing that can withstand

889
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,180
all the fruit roll-ups that you eat.

890
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,420
(laughing)

891
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,340
- In six years, I mean.

892
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,740
- I already tweeted this, but.

893
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,020
- Yeah, tweet it, talk about it.

894
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:42,180
- Yeah, I was at work, I had to leave the,

895
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:45,260
It was really busy, we had like four lunch rushes today.

896
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:46,500
It was fucked.

897
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,860
And we were like so busy.

898
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,540
- Patrick has pink socks on,

899
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,380
I can't take him seriously.

900
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,380
- But we,

901
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:59,660
I left the register to go in the back

902
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,060
'cause I was laughing.

903
00:43:01,060 --> 00:43:02,360
'Cause there was like this,

904
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,780
there's just like this dude,

905
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:06,660
like this type of dude that comes in,

906
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:09,100
he doesn't take his AirPods out.

907
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,420
Like there was a dude I had the other day

908
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,640
He was on a very important business call

909
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,940
and his car, the internet shut down

910
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,900
so all the pin pads weren't working.

911
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,000
And I was trying to take his order to just get him a coffee.

912
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:24,300
And he was like, hold on, I need to call you back.

913
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,860
What's going on?

914
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:28,380
And I was just imagining just a guy

915
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,800
with that same attitude just walking up

916
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,680
to the register stand and just being like,

917
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,340
yeah, let me get a fruit roll-up.

918
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:38,980
- Fine, fruit by the foot, whatever.

919
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:41,300
- Whatever. - You don't have,

920
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,740
oh hold on, let me call you back.

921
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,660
And he just takes out like the one AirPod

922
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,980
and he's like, oh, you don't have,

923
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,020
what do you got, Gushers?

924
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,980
(laughing)

925
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,060
You got Gushers or something?

926
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:50,900
You got like fruit leather?

927
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:52,140
- Just like a Starbucks or wherever.

928
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,380
- Yeah, well, oh, this is an organic place.

929
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,620
You guys got fruit leathers, you got fuckin'.

930
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,820
(laughing)

931
00:43:57,820 --> 00:44:00,380
You got the apricot fruit leathers from Whole Foods.

932
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,380
- Shit's nasty. - One's on the counter

933
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,700
for 79 cents.

934
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,540
- I don't want that bullshit, man.

935
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,500
- So does your brother know the person

936
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,980
whose titties are on that photo,

937
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,020
or like what is that?

938
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,420
Is that like-- - That's actually his brother.

939
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,660
- Is this the first time you've seen a naked woman, Tom?

940
00:44:11,660 --> 00:44:13,420
You seem obsessed.

941
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,980
- Honestly, it might be.

942
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,660
- First time in a while, I'm guessing.

943
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:17,620
- First time in a while, dude.

944
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,040
- I gotta tell you, this is a drawing.

945
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,700
- Someone drew that?

946
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,420
Pull that off the wall, bring that closer, baby.

947
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:26,260
- Yeah, bring it here. - Okay, hold on.

948
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,100
- Yeah, bring that shit over here.

949
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,900
- Describe the image. - Come on, come on, come on.

950
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:29,860
- He's got the headphones out,

951
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:31,460
he can't hear us talking shit.

952
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,780
- Caleb, he looks so handsome.

953
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:34,740
I'm gonna talk shit, he's so beautiful.

954
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,700
- He looks like normal.

955
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:37,180
- Listen, I love Caleb a lot, and I miss him.

956
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,140
- Caleb looks normal.

957
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,260
- Well, no, okay.

958
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,660
- Okay. - That's a drawing?

959
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,700
Oof, my run.

960
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:46,680
- You didn't even say that Italian word right.

961
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,700
- I mean, goddamn, dude.

962
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:51,820
- Who's the, show me, yeah, show me the,

963

- Let's see if we can get an angle where her vagina--

965
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,220
- Who's that artist?

966
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:59,260
Who's that artist?

967
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:01,940
- Says 19-- - Alberto Vargas.

968
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,380
- Alberto Vargas.

969
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,340
- Alberto Vargas, 1928.

970
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,460
He drew that in 1928.

971
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:09,820
That's all they had, dude.

972
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,660
- Yeah.

973
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,980
- Wow.

974
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,820
- Damn.

975
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,460
- Imagine if you had to draw your own porn.

976
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,780
I would suck.

977
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,380
- People do that still.

978
00:45:17,380 --> 00:45:19,300
People have to draw their own porn still.

979
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,940
Like furries and shit.

980
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:21,780
- Furries?

981
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,660
- Furries are like people who are really into Overwatch.

982
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,500
- Yeah.

983
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,340
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,300
Yeah, I know one of them.

985
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,140
Yeah.

986
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,180
- You know one of them?

987
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,020
- Dwo.

00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:30,840
- Yeah, what do you mean?

989
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,680
- Who?

990
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:33,020
- Well, I would refer to her as those people.

991
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:33,860
- Her?

992
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,680
- But--

993
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,020
- Her?

994
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:36,860

our patreon she's hearing this right now absolutely respect how you doing Alex I

997
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:59,260
guess it's been like a thing cuz like they just released new skins for the

998
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:05,260
game and like people are like they released new skin yeah awesome it's so

999
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,260
funny talking to Tom about video games.

1000
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,260
Because he's so clueless.

1001
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,260
I played Call of Duty.

1002
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,260
I played Red Dead.

1003
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,260
I feel like Tom stopped playing video games.

1004
00:46:15,260 --> 00:46:17,260
Tom, you're not a true gamer.

1005
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,260
You're not a gamer, Tom.

1006
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,260
I played Red Dead.

1007
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,260
Red Dead 2?

1008
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,260
I have a PS4, dude.

1009
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:27,260
I feel like,

1010
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:29,260
it's just like the skins,

1011
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:31,260
they're making new skins for Overwatch,

1012
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,260
but then there's one that they released that's very similar

1013
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:38,260
to an Overwatch porn video.

1014
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,880
And I didn't understand it.

1015
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,740
I had to read all the replies in the thread.

1016
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,180
- Interesting, interesting.

1017
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:45,980
- And they didn't even link to the video.

1018
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:47,740
- Yeah, did you have to go find the video?

1019
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:48,900
- I didn't find it.

Yeah, I mean, yeah.

00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:42,600
Exactly.

1041
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,760
Once you've, once you've run through it all.

1042
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:47,880
There have been, truly been some times where I'm like, I've seen every video that I'm going

1043
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:50,400
over and it's, it's disgusting.

00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:37,160
It's like a 10 or 15 minute walk to your place. Yeah, it's not even right by Cityside

1077
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:43,440
Yeah, oh, yeah, very close to Cityside. I miss Cityside man. They've they've been doing really good shows

00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:53,500
- They did get Pepe the Frog.

1082
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:55,380
- They got Pepe the Frog to headline a hideout.

1083
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,220
It's crazy.

1084
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:57,060
- That's nuts.

1085
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:57,880

1091
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:08,380
- I've never met, I have not met anyone in Boston comedy

1092
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:09,980
that hasn't done mooyahs.

1093
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:10,800
- Really?

1094
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:11,640
- Yeah.

1095
00:50:11,640 --> 00:50:12,460
- Yeah.

1096
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,680
Pretty awesome.

1097
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:14,520
- I don't, I don't go to Mike's.

1098
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,340
- No, we talked to Janet though at that show that we did.

1099
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:18,780
- Oh yeah, she, yeah.

1100
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,780
J.M. Actionary?

1101
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,900
I mean she's probably going to win Boston Comedy Festival.

1102
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,780
Oh, she's so funny dude.

1103
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:24,780
She rocks.

1104
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:25,780
Yeah.

1105
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:29,180
She literally walks, she's kind of an asshole, but she's just rules.

1106
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:30,940
It's like she's an asshole in the best way.

1107
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:36,340
Yeah, she went up on a whole thing about how she doesn't tip at like restaurants at the,

1108
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,300
like the restaurant that I work at.

1109
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:42,780
Honestly, she's like, just like one of the wilder people I've ever talked to and I loved

1110
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
it.

1111
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,780
It's just because she's an asshole.

1112
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,420
You know she was on American Idol?

1113
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,420
Yeah.

1114
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,340
- She rolled up to this show and we were standing outside

1115
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,700
the fashion show or whatever, there's a fucking--

1116
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:53,540
- Oh yeah, I was--

1117
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:54,380
- Big window and she was--

1118
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:57,100
- Was that before or after we were sharing the 40?

1119
00:50:57,100 --> 00:50:58,020
- That was before.

1120
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:00,300
I think you were literally on stage,

1121
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:01,460
or about to go on stage.

1122
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:02,700
I rolled up and she was like--

1123
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:05,260
- I was drinking, I drank two White Claw Tallboys

1124
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:08,300
before I went up and then I just did the worst set

1125
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,380
I've ever done.

1126
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,380
- Nice, dude.

1127
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,200
- Honestly--

1128
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,820
- I did fairly well, they have a video of it

1129
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,340
and I'm gonna tell them not to post it.

1130
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,620
I mean I thought yeah, yeah Tom immediately crushed

1131
00:51:19,620 --> 00:51:23,540
He's a comic

1132
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:28,120
Yeah, Janet walked up and like someone outside was just like is this a good show and she's like absolutely not

1133
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,120
I'm the only person on here with the TV credit

1134
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:37,780
For American Idol, yeah for being like ironic on American, that's awesome

1135
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:45,180
Yeah, probably when Boston Comedy Festival, it's gonna win American Idol. She's she's going back for a redemption episode

1136
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,500
She's doing she's doing a web redemption. I love it

1137
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:53,560
You watch that American Idol episode and she's like, yeah, I was on American Idol and it's like, oh, yeah

1138
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:55,560
You're on American Idol in 1999

1139
00:51:55,560 --> 00:52:01,900
I'm gonna make my wife do a web redemption for the video that I have of her fucking the milkman

1140
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:07,660
That's gonna cost you a web redemption for giving birth to your first son. Yeah. Yeah

1141
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,460
- I love it. - I mean, I'm gonna

1142
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,660
videotape your wife giving birth to your first son.

1143
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:15,100
- Thanks, buddy.

1144
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,940
You will be there.

1145
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:18,140
Well, you'll be the doctor who delivers the baby.

1146
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,380
(laughing)

1147
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:21,140
There's pretty good odds.

1148
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,940
- Just, I bring my medical degree

1149
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,580
into whatever operating room here.

1150
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,820
It's just like, free.

1151
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,600
- I'm supposed to be here.

1152
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,420
What is the, what kind of doctor are you becoming?

1153
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:32,260
- I don't know.

1154
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:33,080
I honestly don't know.

1155
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:34,600
I have to decide that at some point.

1156
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,860
- You're like a free-range doctor?

1157
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:37,940
- Yeah, I don't know.

1158
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:38,780
Honestly, we'll figure it out.

1159
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,220
- If you're a free agent, you can just pick one.

1160
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,340
- You do your first couple years and then you decide.

1161
00:52:44,340 --> 00:52:46,260
- Look, I'm not trying to become a specialist.

1162
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:49,580
I'm just trying to learn the basics of everything.

1163
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,180
And then just kind of like, it's like,

1164
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:53,380
oh, you need an OBGYN, I'm right here.

1165
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:54,220
- I'm not gonna be an OBGYN.

1166
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:55,700
- Be the master of none.

1167
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:56,820
- Dude, honestly.

1168
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:57,660
- Tom wants to be an OBGYN.

1169
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:59,260
- It's so weird.

1170
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:01,460
- Something just fell off of your head, Tom.

1171
00:53:01,460 --> 00:53:04,220
- There are dudes that roll in and they're just like--

1172
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,660
- Tom wants to be the first male OBGYN.

1173
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:10,260
- Thank you, I mean, dudes in school who are just gung-ho

1174
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:12,660
on OB-GYN, just red flag.

1175
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,500
- Yeah.

1176
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,320
- I don't--

1177
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:16,220
- Yeah, I would say the most obvious red flag

1178
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:17,060
in the world, maybe.

1179
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:19,020
- In the world, dude, it's so uncomfortable.

1180
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,560
- It's like, you remember Good Luck Chuck?

1181
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:21,400
- Yeah, that's literally--

1182
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,420
- Yeah.

1183
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,340
- It's like the guy who's like,

1184
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,900
"Oh, I'm a breast augmentation doctor."

1185
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,740
- Yeah.

1186
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:28,380
- It's the guy from Fantastic Beasts.

1187
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,020
- Yeah, it's literally Dane Cook.

1188
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,860
- Yeah.

1189
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,540
- Yeah, those are those guys.

1190
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,460
- Dane Cook and his best friend.

1191
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:36,380
- His brother who stole all that money from him.

1192
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:39,780
Yeah, and made him and then made him date that 17 year old.

1193
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:44,580
If you want the money back you have to fuck a 14 year old.

1194
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:48,180
Dude, my bloated face King.

1195
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:50,680
Can you imagine having sex with Dane Cook?

1196
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,280
It'd be so tiring.

1197
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,280
Jesus.

1198
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,480
I'm over here now.

1199
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,380
Yeah.

1200
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,580
Get over here.

1201
00:53:57,580 --> 00:54:01,880
Yeah, he's very screaming into your ass.

1202
00:54:01,880 --> 00:54:04,960
I mean, he just literally had one good bit about like being nice to

1203
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:07,080
someone who might shoot up an office.

1204
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,140
- Yeah.

1205
00:54:08,140 --> 00:54:08,980
- He had good--

1206
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:11,580
- I really liked his bit as a kid about people,

1207
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,300
about the drive-thru.

1208
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:14,140
- Oh, that was good.

1209
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:14,960
- BK Lounge?

1210
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,800
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1211
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,640
- That's like one of the first things

1212
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,900
I downloaded on LimeWire.

1213
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,740
- Yeah, man.

1214
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:20,420
- I was a big Dane Cook guy back in the day.

1215
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:21,500
- Oh, yeah, when I was nine?

1216
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,900
- Yeah, when I was like a child.

1217
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,260
- I was big into Dane Cook and Carlos Mencia.

1218
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:26,100
- Oh, dude.

1219
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,980
- It's probably, it's because like--

1220
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,060
- Because you're a thief.

1221
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:30,140
- Yeah.

1222
00:54:30,140 --> 00:54:34,020
No, it's 'cause just like, they were on TV,

1223
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:36,740
So I was like, these are the coolest guys.

1224
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,700
- Yeah, and then Gabriel Iglesias was another big,

1225
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:42,300
I was big into Gabriel Iglesias,

1226
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,740
into Fluffy when I was a kid.

1227
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:44,580
- Yeah.

1228
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,580
- Remember how they had Carlos Mencia

1229
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:48,580
on the first two episodes of "Bernie Mac"

1230
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:50,380
and then they took him out like immediately?

1231
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:51,220
- Yeah, they did, yeah, yeah.

1232
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,040
- Yeah.

1233
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,140
- Damn dude, "Bernie Mac" RIP, what a king.

1234
00:54:54,140 --> 00:55:00,180
- I have such a distinct memory of watching "Bernie Mac's"

1235
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:06,020
is like that Apollo set where he does the dance.

1236
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:07,620
Yeah.

1237
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:08,460
- Yes.

1238
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:09,740
- That, because it was on Comedy Central,

1239
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,100
like they would just play like 90s standup,

1240
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,100
just all day, every day on Comedy Central.

1241
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,940
- Yeah, I heard of it. - In like 2005.

1242
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:18,700
- I saw a big Jay Oakerson thing at 4 a.m.

1243
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:19,860
when I was like 12.

1244
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:23,900
- Nice, and you were like, I wanna look like that guy.

1245
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:25,620
- I wanna look exactly like him.

1246
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,700
- Just honestly, being 12 years old

1247
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,020
and being up at 4 a.m., like what?

1248
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:32,660
- Yeah, yeah, what was your life like?

1249
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,820
- I was gaming.

1250
00:55:34,820 --> 00:55:36,640
- True. - I was gaming, yeah.

1251
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,180
- What were you gaming?

1252
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:42,180
- I got really big into Gmod and TF2.

1253
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,500
- Oh my God. - Did you guys play RuneScape?

1254
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,900
- Yeah, of course I played RuneScape.

1255
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:46,300
Come on, dude. - I didn't play RuneScape.

1256
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,700
- I had a level 102 main.

1257
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,300
- Dude, I fucking love RuneScape.

1258
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,300
- I had 98 wood cutting.

1259
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:54,380
- I didn't get into it, I didn't get it.

1260
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:57,060
- So I have a funny story about RuneScape.

1261
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,460
Before I got into it, my neighbor,

1262
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:59,900
who was a couple years older than me,

1263
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,540
like introduced me to it.

1264
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,780
And he like, he waited for me to get like a couple months in.

1265
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,980
I like built up my like stockpile and shit.

1266
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,620
And I was like gaining stuff.

1267
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:09,500
And he was like, yo, come with me.

1268
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:10,940
We gotta go on this quest.

1269
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:13,420
And he like took me out to that part of the woods

1270
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,740
where you could just assault people

1271
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:15,580
and steal all their shit.

1272
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,660
- The wilderness.

1273
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,260
- Yeah, he took me out into the wilderness

1274
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,080
and he was like, yo dude,

1275
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,340
there's like a fucking dragon out here.

1276
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,660
We're gonna get all this money.

1277
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,540
And he took me out there and just beat the shit out of me

1278
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:25,540
and stole me and robbed me for everything.

1279
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:26,380
- Damn.

1280
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:27,500
- And I saw him the next day at the bus stop

1281
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,860
And he was like, "Welcome to the real world, asshole."

1282
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,140
(laughing)

1283
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,340
I was like crying.

1284
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,260
I was like, "Why would you rob me, Tyler?"

1285
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:39,540
- I had an account and played for a long time,

1286
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,220
and then when I was like 13, I just decided,

1287
00:56:42,220 --> 00:56:43,820
I was like, "You know what, I'm done playing this game.

1288
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:45,460
"I've put enough time into this."

1289
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:49,100
And then I gave my account to some neighborhood kid.

1290
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,800
And then like a year later, I was like,

1291
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:54,140
"You know what, I kinda wanna start playing RuneScape again."

1292
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:57,180
And then just logged in and changed the password

1293
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:58,940
so he couldn't get back on it.

1294
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,860
Just stole the account back.

1295
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,860
Yeah, and then just like for quite a while

1296
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:05,180
would message his friends and be like,

1297
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,820
"Hey man, I'm gonna kill myself."

1298
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:09,140
(laughing)

1299
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:10,620
And they thought it was still him.

1300
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,180
- Caleb, you were truly a monster.

1301
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,740
- I know, I know.

1302
00:57:13,740 --> 00:57:16,860
- Caleb child story is like some insane shit.

1303
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:18,900
- I love your story about you and your brothers

1304
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,580
where it's just like, yeah, if we had a younger brother,

1305
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,940
we'd just kick the shit out of him

1306
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:23,540
and like make him wanna die.

1307
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:24,380
- Yeah.

1308
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,400
- That's pretty much how it went, yeah.

1309
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,400
- That's my older brother.

1310
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,620
- Here, you bullied your older brother?

1311
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:34,700
- Yeah, me and Eric bullied Paul.

1312
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,540
- Damn.

1313
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:39,940
- We like, so Paul and I had to share a room,

1314
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:43,040
and then one day we just got into a small fight,

1315
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,940
and then he left, I think he had football practice,

1316
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,100
and Eric and I just moved all of his stuff upstairs,

1317
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,180
and just didn't tell him.

1318
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,020
like had to come home.

1319
00:57:56,020 --> 00:58:01,020
He kept all, he stole a shopping cart from Walmart

1320
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,700
and then kept all of his clothes in a shopping cart.

1321
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,400
So Eric and I had to carry the shopping cart

1322
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:11,420
from the basement to the upstairs like part of the house.

1323
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:13,660
- Just like imagine someone's sharing blood with Patrick

1324
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:14,580
who played football in high school.

1325
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,740
- Right, yeah.

1326
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,260
- It's wonderful.

1327
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,060
- They both did. - Patrick is a,

1328
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,180
- They both played football. - Patrick's a skater.

1329
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:23,060
- That's an athletic, he's an athlete.

1330
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,540
- Honestly, Patrick, you should leave

1331
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,320
before the trains close.

1332
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,300
- Oh yeah, what time is it?

1333
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:28,140
- It's 11.40.

1334
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,960
- Oh no.

1335
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,800
- Yeah, I might be late.

1336
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,340
- Yeah, goddamn, what are we at?

1337
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:32,660
- We're at an hour, that's fine.

1338
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:33,500
- Oh, cool.

1339
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:34,320
- Okay, we're at hell, yeah.

1340
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,780
Honestly, Caleb, I miss you so much.

1341
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,620
- Yeah, I miss you too, buddy.

1342
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:38,220
- And every day without you here is a nightmare.

1343
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:39,060
- I'll be back in a month.

1344
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:39,900
- I'm so happy to see you.

1345
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,300
You look thin, you look handsome.

1346
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:42,420
- Thank you, you as well.

1347
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:44,580
- Yeah, you should look into hair plugs before you come back.

1348
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,420
(laughing)

1349
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:46,540
- Thanks, thanks.

1350
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:47,900
Thanks.

1351
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,980
Yeah, I will.

1352
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:49,820
You look healthy though.

1353
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,860
You should look into SSRIs maybe.

1354
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:52,700
(laughing)

1355
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:54,940
Honestly, salute dude.

1356
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,780
Couldn't be me.

1357
00:58:55,780 --> 00:58:58,140
All right.

Doer, D-O-E-R-I-F-I-T.

1360
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,380
That is not how you spell it.

1361
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:06,220
You already fucked it up.

1362
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,040
Doer of it.

1363
00:59:07,040 --> 00:59:08,500
Doer of it.

1364
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:09,580
Yeah.

1365
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:10,420
Yeah.

1366
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,000
It looks like Doryo fit.

1367
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:15,260
Which would be a cooler way to read it.

1368
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,100
Yeah.

1369
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,180
Caleb, I love you.

1370
00:59:18,180 --> 00:59:19,180
Love you too, buddy.

1371
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,180
Yeah.
