1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
I

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:15,740
as a bad clap. There it is. Oh, my God, starting off the episode with a burp.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,880
Are you kidding me? Guests have been getting a little too comfortable,

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,960
lately they have all every single guest has been way too comfortable with

5
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,520
belches. Have we started yet? Yeah, we're started. You know how they always

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:32,640
I guess that when people go oh yeah, like Maren yeah yeah, yeah, because I have

7
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,800
something to say that I don't want on the record yeah. Oh yeah, what do you

8
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,840
want to say? Well, that's what you would say. Oh yeah. I mean I was kind of

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,280
going off before, but yeah, we're going off. What were you saying?

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,000
One million like that, okay, that's what you don't want anyone to hear.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,040
Well, everyone just heard that's that's what you don't want anyone to ever it

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:57,160
out. If we need to yeah, there's no post work that goes into this. There really

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,040
is not it's just a thing where it's not it's not quite the perfect. I know you're

14
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,840
I know you're looking around you, you're you're looking out the door right now,

15
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:09,040
you're laser focusing on people to say things about, but we're not cutting

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,720
anything out. This is crazy wait. Can you get to this camera?

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,400
You got to the Joe

18
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,840
this is the best.

19
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,000
This is the best idea we've ever had this camera right here. The joke, can't

20
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,380
Oh my God, stop drinking too much,

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,080
stop drinking too much Joe. You have a drinking problem. You have a drinking

22
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,400
problem that's yeah, seltzer, tell my grocery bill that

23
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,560
well you're going to drink all of them. You're going to drink the rest of this

24
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,620
box of white claws right now. It's like when it's like when a parent catches you

25
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,120
smoking a cigarette, makes you smoke the entire carton. You can't make it too

26
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,240
much seltzer. You make me drink a bunch of you've been playing too many video

27
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,700
games. I'm going to make you play all the games in the Assassin's Creed series

28
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,720
and we'll see how you like

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,420
little do parents know you're going to sit your ass down. You're going to play

30
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:02,820
a game on every console. Let's see if you start. You're still having fun.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,680
Yeah, you like that you like that Atari twenty six hundred game. Yeah, I like

32
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,760
that you fucking moron. You fucking idiot, you fucking little weird fucking

33
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,020
ugly kid grub, you grub of shit, you grub hub, you grub of shit, you grab.

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,460
I would call my kid. I'm going to eat you. I'd call my kid a grub of shit.

35
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:24,660
Oh, you like that cigarette. Let's see how you like it. When I eat your whole

36
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,200
body.

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,240
You want to smoke that cigarette? Let's see how you handle a punch.

38
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:32,000
That's the

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,220
pure discipline. Let's see how you handle a

40
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:41,320
let's see how you handle a knuckle sandwich. The nerd dad who's eating is

41
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,460
let's say I handle a knuckle sandwich kid yeah he played. He like lost a level

42
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,020
on his. Let's see how you like a swirly. There was there's a story from like a

43
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:56,240
long time ago where oh you're you think you can smoke my cigarettes. We'll see

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,380
how you handle a purple nerple giving your kid a swirl.

45
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:08,300
There's a story from like two thousand and six or something where

46
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,240
a combat veteran

47
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:18,740
beat the shit out of his girlfriend's kid within an inch of its life, because

48
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:21,140
the kid deleted his Vice City save.

49
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,180
Wow and I don't know if that's an urban legend actually now that I'm thinking

50
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,940
about it, but

51
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:32,620
that's kind of the opposite of the nerd dad. I was thinking you were going to

52
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:36,900
say TSD yeah, we're going freak mode. I was I was thinking you were going to

53
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,540
say like the

54
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,980
something funny. He I thought he was

55
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:47,060
the most depressing. I thought you were going to say that the military dad like

56
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:51,000
used to like craft my God or something on well, yeah, you just training yeah

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,440
you just training was like like spinning around and let's

58
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:02,060
oh the TV's not. I was about to say Julio. Can you look up? Why isn't that

59
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:07,060
on? I'll turn that on right now. You introduce our did somebody my cousin

60
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,900
that reminds me of my cousin. Your cousin did that to his nephew or no, no,

61
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,540
I have a big family and my cousin, he's like a computer-y kid and he has a

62
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,500
Minecraft world that he spends like, you know, hundreds of hours building and

63
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,760
everything. And then another cousin, different parents, deleted his entire

64
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:32,340
Minecraft world. I think you told us about this. And then he started crying.

65
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,020
He got in trouble because he was crying. That's so crazy. It's something that he's like

66
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:42,040
I've worked hard on like yeah for months and then his mom is just like a

67
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:48,180
computer game. You are you're yeah shut up. Don't be gay. Just shut the hell up

68
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:52,880
it's messed yeah yeah. Minecraft is probably I would beat the crap out of

69
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,260
my kid. If he played Minecraft, I think it's changed the I think it's probably

70
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:00,220
changed the way that kids interact with their parents for yeah, because they

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,360
think that they could just parent relations, I never mom until she

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,660
becomes a diamond. Yeah, if you keep going deeper into your mom,

73
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
when it comes a diamond. I never like my what I mean either. I did not fuck. It

74
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,620
was like there. I was obsessed with Minecraft for a little while, but I

75
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,360
don't I really think it was play Minecraft. No, I think it was. I think

76
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,900
it was like encouraged. I feel like it was like a mass psychosis thing where I

77
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:25,280
was like so obsessed with Minecraft in like middle school, like me and all my

78
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,580
friends played Minecraft like every day. Did you have like a zombie shirt with

79
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:32,180
the no? I was I was a cool type of guy who was making machines

80
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:41,240
very making circuits, circuitry and LCD screens in Minecraft. But then I feel

81
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,060
like I went, I tried to go back to it a few years ago and it's like the worst

82
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,520
game. I couldn't even play dog five minutes of I wanted to dog kill myself.

83
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,880
I like that. I don't understand how you can like something that much and not

84
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,460
even have a nostalgia factor. Like I don't understand how I could have liked

85
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,300
it so much and then now I can't even like think about it. We have a server

86
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,180
for up. We have an official that Ralph runs.

87
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:07,060
Why do we have that? I hate that game. Do people use that you know? I don't know

88
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:11,220
if you play in our Minecraft server. If you play in the the podcast about this

89
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,220
Minecraft server, guess what you're getting you're you're going to be

90
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,160

95
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,800

00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:09,720
people.

106
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:21,800
Yeah, we are going to be sending some powder in the mail to a lot of people.

107
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,520
Joe, what are you sipping on today? Today we've got a little spin drift

108
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:33,020
mojito, a spender, oh my God, should do drink of leaves yeah. It's pretty good.

109
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,360
I was I was I like you lime. Is this is this okay? I said you should do reviews

110
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,880
and for example of Rios, it's pretty good. I like the line it's lime and

111
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,140
mint. Do you is this one of the so is this a new because what you do and I

112
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,240
think that it's not crazy to do this

113
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,020
Joe will like a drink so much that he buys pallets of it pallets is a pallet or

114
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:02,760
you buy a couple boxes like you buy every two weeks. I get two boxes of liquid

115
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:08,420
death, Arnold Palmer, yes, that comes to my house before I've done coconut water.

116
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,000
Yeah, you when we live together, you would get like boxes of coconut water and

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,600
that what's that tea called

118
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:21,700
the green tea that comes in Ocha yeah fuck yeah. I get that like in you get so

119
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:25,540
so many boxes of that that the fridge, I mean that fridge was empty a lot of the

120
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:28,900
time. Yeah, there was not a lot of contribution. There was like like it was

121
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:34,780
like it would be like Neil's yogurt and then a bunch of my beers and then like

122
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,980
twenty four green teas. I mean, I think in an ideal world, did you ever see Mr

123
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:46,380
shy city? No, oh my God, Julio, can you pull up Mr. Shy city? Well, stock. I feel

124
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,860
like I know we're not going to we're not doing video. We have to know we got to

125
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,540
watch it. No, we're not watching a youtube video just because you like

126
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,340
the youtube. I think I think it's a perfect video. I feel like I have a

127
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:58,740
similar drink situation to you, where I really like water and I have a whole

128
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,300
infrastructure built in my house to just for water all the time. I have my

129
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,300
multiple rooms like you have like Brita filters.

130
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:13,700
I have like it's basically it looks like a metal tube and it's got two knobs, so

131
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:17,920
you can either get one cold type of water or a hot, which you're not supposed

132
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:22,460
I drink, but I do drink it in multiple rooms. Yeah, two rooms. Well, you have a

133
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:25,540
really really water in your house. Literally it's like if I want to drink

134
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:29,620
water when I'm cooking my meal yeah. I can do that if I want to drink water

135
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:34,340
when I'm shitting. I do that too. I have to yeah. There's actually two. I have

136
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:37,540
two vessels in one room of that where I can drink about and I guess if I'm

137
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,100
thinking about the bathroom, I guess I really can drink water out of three

138
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,980
places in the bathroom. Yeah, or if you have a shower shower, shower, shower,

139
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,720
tub. Memo is the third one. I was thinking toilet. You have two toilets

140
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,120
toilet since in the bathroom. I have three toilet sink shower tub. Remember

141
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:00,340
when you're saying a separate bath challenge yeah. He did the ice bucket

142
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,900
challenge with toilet water to raise awareness for no clean water in other

143
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,740
countries. Who did he was Matt Damon and he was like

144
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,900
I know this is an ALS ice bucket challenge, but I'm going to do

145
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:18,340
something a little different. I'm going to use water from my toilet and I'm going to

146
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:26,340
dunk it on my head. And he did that. He dunked toilet water all over himself just so he could

147
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:31,540
raise awareness for that. Buddy, there is already awareness being raised for that challenge.

148
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:41,140
You're going too hard. These people with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, you're trying to make

149
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,140
it Matt Damon's challenge.

150
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,320
I waited so long to get challenged for the ice bucket. I had an ice bucket

151
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,560
challenge filmed by

152
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:52,600
and I was just waiting for you. You filled it you're like. Thank you.

153
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:59,400
I will nominate me for the I just went no intro to it. Oh my God, but I had it

154
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,260
and I know you went crazy on it to big bucket. Lots of ice. No, I did mean

155
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,200
naked in my tub with just an ice tray because I was a funny one that it was

156
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,740
funny, but my friend got challenged. I was like dude, I'll film yours. I think

157
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,420
challenge. I think I did cup funny, funny little cup type of joke. My this is

158
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:21,540
probably pretty formative experience for all of us and in making yeah making

159
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,020
video. I didn't make one. I didn't make an ice bucket challenge bro. My you

160
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,780
know, people die from the ice bucket disease. My forty year old neighbor knew

161
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:38,180
me as the video kid and came over to my house and said hey, you like do video

162
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:43,740
stuff right. Can you help me do something really quick and he asked me to film his

163
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:48,480
ice bucket challenge and I told him no. I wasn't going to do that because I was

164
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,720
busy. I told him I was ending another video

165
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:59,560
and then I think my my older brother might have filmed it or maybe talk to him

166
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,320
about filming it. It's a pretty easy job yeah to film a nice, but I'm just

167
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,320
filming your forty year old something. No, you didn't. He said he wasn't going

168
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,560
chaos or anything you just said I need somebody to hold the camera for me. You

169
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,040
know back in the days, they would be like in the fifties. It would be if you

170
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,800
filmed your neighbor doing an ice bucket challenge, they'd bake you a pie or

171
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,680
something yeah. Nowadays, these adults have no respect to kids time. Now they

172
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,040
do not have respect. I say mo my they say can you mow my lawn? Okay, you're

173
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,920
done mom on now. Can you mow my lawn in the metaverse? Yeah, it's just chivalry

174
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:31,080
back then yeah, but that back in the like

175
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:35,680
you would think like oh yeah, like if I want to raise money, I'm just going to go

176
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,160
like like shovel old people's driveways right. These old people were giving you

177
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:47,120
like five dollars yeah. That's a back that was one billion dollars yeah back

178
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,400
then, but like that the old people, but they didn't change their amount. Oh

179
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,400
people did not they're like old people are like Costco hot dogs. They did not

180
00:12:55,400 --> 00:13:00,680
just for inflation, like here's a nickel go buy a new xbox exactly yeah. It's the

181
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,600
same thing with the two bitch to fucking old you crap to going in your house to

184
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,800
telling an old person immediately like when they're by the way after you show

185
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,560
by the way, if it's lower than twenty yeah, you're going to get this show in

186
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:26,000

187
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,520
the their doorbell rings and they come to the door like what is it and they

188
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,720
open the door and I'm standing there with the mower like red like right in

189
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,620
front of the door. How much you going to pay me? How much enough I start mowing

190
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:42,000
all their carpets, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ruining their on all their floors and

191
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,200
for

192
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,900
going in scraping up the hardwood with a fucking with a push mower from like

193
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,660
eighteen hundreds that they have you ever use a push mower. No, it sucks. I

194
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:54,780
know you have sucks man. Yeah, I don't know that I've ever mind a lawn. Yeah,

195
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:58,920
actually, I want to use a I want to use a push mower again in my life. I also

196
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:04,520
didn't have never mode. No, I did mow a lawn. I used to I lived with my sister

197
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:09,920
and she lived on this kind of like this house with a barn,

198
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,840
and they had a ride on mower,

199
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,640
and I would just drink. - Oh wow.

200
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,760
- It was like peak COVID, so I had nothing to do,

201
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,040
but drink and do the podcast,

202
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,160
and I would sit on the ride on mower,

203
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,040
and just had two white claws on it,

204
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,600
and I would just drunk drive the lawn mower around.

205
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,760
- Did he do a good job with the mower?

206
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,800
- No, no, no, no. - You fucked it up.

207
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,080
- You would look, and it would just be clear

208
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,480
that I was doing donuts for a couple minutes. It's just like a big chunk of

209
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,800
grass that's just like over mowed. Yeah, a ride on mower seems fun. Dude, it's so

210
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:47,200
awesome. A push mower is kind of fun in a, in like a Tinker Toys, Rube Goldberg

211
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,040
kind of way. Yeah. Where it's like, oh, it's

212
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,400
I like the idea of pulling a thing that makes a thing work. That's the opposite

213
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,240
of a push mower. You ever seen a push mower? You know what a push mower is?

214
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,640
It's the, it's like the toy that a kid has where it pops when they push it.

215
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,200
it's just it looks like a dolly like it's just a little way and a handle and the

216
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,660
wheel spin the blade. It's that circular blade thing right yeah, yeah and the

217
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,440
the fuck at least the one I had yeah that one the the the the on the top row

218
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,260
yeah yeah, yeah, well, he doesn't know electricity. Okay, old as fuck, but a

219
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:24,640
push mower is also one with a motor on it. Did you I guess I never know where I

220
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,600
mean I'm not to I'll be honest with you guys. I'm not too well versed in the

221
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,420
landscaping world. So I have no idea. I don't know what this thing was called.

222
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,580
I'm not well versed in the the landscaping world either, but there was

223
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:36,980
a thing. I think we can safely say none of us are well versed in the

224
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,720
landscape. Well, I did I worked for a landscaping company for one day when I

225
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,460
was fifteen. So you got some or fourteen rather. I

226
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:50,960
shoveled driveways for old people. We went out and we would shovel. I made

227
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,440
sixty bucks shoveling driveways

228
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,940
and

229
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,680
where it's like, oh, wait, wait, wait.

230
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,180
Okay, I remembered what I was originally gonna ask.

231
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,860
Have you ever, like, do you ever have like a friend

232
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:06,180
growing up that had like some old piece

233
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,940
of like landscaping equipment on their front lawn

234
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,980
as like decoration?

235
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:12,800
- No.

236
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,220
- Like one of these, I don't know if it was a ground,

237
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:17,860
if it was an excavator or something, like an old, like,

238
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,700
but this kid had like an antique, like,

239
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,040
it had like giant teeth in the front.

240
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,740
and if you like pulled some lever or something, it would have dug into the

241
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,060
ground and like lifted up earth or something. And I almost used it and it

242
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,800
was this kid that I'd only hung out with one time. I think I got a sugar rush and

243
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:44,340
tried to use it in his front lawn and his dad came out and just started freaking

244
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,360
the fuck out at me like, "No, no, no, no, no, no, don't touch it!" That makes

245
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,880
sense. Sugar rush. What were you eating?

246
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,480
Candy and sweets and soda. Yeah.

247
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,880
I'm sitting inside this kid's house and drinking a bunch of soda and then you're

248
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,120
like

249
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,520
I need a machine. I need a machine. I was a

250
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:05,700
available to you just be ocarina of time. So you're running out of we were

251
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:09,280
let's go running out of the house like a bird's eye view. You can see the

252
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,640
dotted line of your path and you're running out of the house. It's going to

253
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,520
like cross the street into a junkyard and yeah pulling a lever on a giant like

254
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,200
car crush

255
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,780
making cubes, making cubes out of cars, carrying them back to his house and

256
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,780
just throwing it through his windows. I really only was allowed after that. I

257
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,460
wasn't allowed to hang out at that kid's house. Damn you are you probably was

258
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:36,660
that your own arm off. I didn't rip my own arm off. I almost destroyed their

259
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,820
front lawn, but there was a there. They had a talk with that kid and we're like

260
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,160
you can't. This kid is not allowed. Yeah, it's a misbehavior. I oh yeah, I know I

261
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,740
know that other parents hated you. No, not as much I other other parents.

262
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:54,640
Usually I was like I know that when you were around they were like oh hey, they

263
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,280
were nice to see you and as soon as you left they were like oh my God, that kid

264
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:58,720
no

265
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,960
but yeah, I did

266
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,960
I did talk a lot. I did try to

267
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:09,440
because I used to watch like I love the s and stuff, so I tried to like talk to

268
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,120
parents about old movies, yeah, an old TV, old movies that you saw a two minute

272
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:35,220
of them to make that decision in the s yeah nowadays that would not fly. I

273
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,120
feel like you were probably a kid who was you were probably very polite to

274
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:43,380
parents yeah. I was put I was a like kid in general yeah. I was scared of parents,

275

allergic to stuff and they forgot their lunch snack. Okay, there's a kid.

293
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,960
There was one kid in my school

00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:05,060
and every whenever someone brought in cupcakes, he had like a stash of rice

295

299
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,380
kids at one table yeah, because they could all have different types of

300
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,840

you have to eat or there's something there's some like tree.

308
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,500
Yeah, the bathroom away from the special table where you have to sit. If

309
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:58,300
you had a peanut allergy, I used to sit there. I said there was a while kids,

310
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,300
barely any kids with the peanut allergies. So yeah, it's literally that's

311
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:05,140
what I mean it would be like yeah. Two kids max yeah, I'd be like forced to sit

312
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,220
at a table alone. Couldn't you just kind of go against the grain and not do it? I

313
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,700
mean, I guess it depends on if you want to die to either of your allergies,

314
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,100
you're allergic to like carrots and yeah,

315
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:19,180
but I I'm not allergic to any food. I'm actually I'm allergic to some medicines

316
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:23,260
penicillin yeah me too. I'm allergic to penicillin, moccasin,

317
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,680
I was like OTC raw cherries, raw carrots, raw apples, raw

318
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:34,060
you are so first hazelnuts. It does feel like it's a kind of thing that you just

319
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,200
didn't like them when you were a kid and now I loved fruits and stuff. When I

320
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:43,380
found out that I found out that I couldn't eat peaches, was like I ate a

321
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:48,280
peach and then my lip started to swell up and I got so mad because I love

322
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:52,900
peaches. You went insane on the lawn after that dude. You got a serious hole

323
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:57,220
excavate some fucking kids house. That is kind of I mean I've seen you eat guacamole

324
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:03,260
and it was a troublesome situation. Yeah, it was. Yeah, I'm allergic to. Then I got

325
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:08,380
the rest of the tacos. To pain killers. I can't take like Tylenol or Ibuprofen or anything

326
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:13,980
like that. You must be enduring everything. I endure everything every day. Oh my God.

327
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:17,420
To hold that on your shoulders. Yeah, pretty tough. Holy crap. It's actually completely

328
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:21,200
pretty fun. I think that people are babies if they have to take a

329
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,120
painkiller for a headache. Yeah, I just like it. I actually like the pain. I

330
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:29,680
know I just like taking pills. Yeah, no, I could that's what I mean. Like I

331
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:33,560
can't imagine it's so weird to me to be able to take a pill to have like when

332
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,220
you have a headache or something. I just don't understand. I think it's cool to

333
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,380
take a pill. I don't know. Maybe I love taking pills for everything else in my

334
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:48,640
head. It's like so scientific in my head. It's like like, oh, I'm feeling this so I

335
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,020
can take this. I can take this to make it go away. Yeah, I do think if I if I do

336
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:57,100
like an allergy to it because it's been a long time since I've had like it was

337
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,420
when I was a kid that I found I was allergic to it, so it could have gone

338
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:03,680
away by now, possibly, but I haven't like tested. I feel like if I test and it has

339
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,060
gone away, I think my entire life is going to completely change. Yeah, you're

340
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:12,380
going to just start come up. You did the allergy thing with like the big well, no,

341
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,980
So for that, I took it and I started to not be able to breathe.

342
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Ah, bummer.

343
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Anaphylaxis.

344
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,980
Anaphylaxis.

345
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
Anaphylaxis.

346
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:22,980
Planetary anaphylaxis.

347
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
Anaphylaxis right in the pterodactyl.

348
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:26,980
Oh my God, save this for the next five fingers, dude.

349
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,980
That would be insane if we did a rap about allergies.

350
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Anaphylaxis.

351
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,980
There's a rap about allergies I'll show you guys after.

352
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
Oh yeah?

353
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:33,980
Yeah, but I can't.

354
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
Oh, I'm sorry.

355
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,980
I'm sorry.

356
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
I'm sorry.

357
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,980
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
I'm sorry.

359
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:39,980
I'm sorry.

360
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,980
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,980
I'm sorry.

362
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:46,580
but I can't wait. I remember that. I remember the talk about it. We'll put a

363
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,420
we'll put a we will remember this. I can't say anything about it right now.

364
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:56,380
I should do that. I should do a cover of that rap. I think it's been taken off

365
00:23:56,380 --> 00:24:02,140
the internet. What like what's that song that fucking Johnny Cash song the I've

366
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,900
been everywhere just doing that, but just listing every single allergy that

367
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,100
you

368
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:10,120
man is still in my to sillin

369
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:17,200
man. I fucking hate allergies, though yeah it is the most hate my allergy.

370
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,720
This past allergy season was so bad. The pollen season, yeah, the worst ever of

371
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:25,460
my entire life. I really hated myself. I feel like in general the weather's kind

372
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:29,720
of been yeah. I feel like something's been happening with the weather lately,

373
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:34,120
but I can't think of what feels fucking a pocket. Here's a this is an actual hot

374
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,860
hot button. The flood stuff that's been happening recently yeah. Is that really

375
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,020
global warming? Yeah yeah, no way feels like it's not it rain happens all the

376
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:47,720
time yeah, but if dude bed, start reading like that is crazy. I think it's

377
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,920
like it. I mean I agree that I don't this is not to say that global. I think

378
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:54,880
the reason that it rains more is because there's more heat and so it's fucking

379
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,240
with the wind and the rain patterns. I think is a weather. The weather is

380
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,060
weather is actually about a system of hot and cold. Yeah, it just feels like

381
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:09,720
attacks bro. You just blew my fucking mind. Oh my God, but yeah, I think so. I

382
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,840
think that that make I mean it is it is the past few years have been not to get

383
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,100
to

384
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,220
to get real as fuck, but the past years have been very real crazy because I do it

385
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:22,500
is like I feel like I'm living in a different world than I was when I was a

386
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,860
kid. It genuinely feels completely different. Yeah, definitely summer does

387
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,620
not feel good anymore. The summer was pretty is different, too. I like this

388
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,960
new winter, though I like and maybe it's also because I moved to New York from

389
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,320
New England that the winter feels different yeah, but we've had we had

390
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:40,200
snow all the time. I feel like there's not going to be snow this year, but it's

391
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,880
still always a little colder. It's feeling like it's going to be a great

392
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
Christmas. The first year that we lived here to get the last time it snowed

393
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,960
two thousand and five. I was going out the super storm. Yeah, I was going out

394
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,160
in. I was like going out and skating in a T shirt and jeans in December. Yeah,

395
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,200
that's crazy man. Two years ago, three years ago, when I moved here, you know

396
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:03,000
what else is crazy that I was thinking about the other night when I was getting

397
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,440
ready to go to bed. So which is when I have most of my thoughts

398
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:11,400
about this kind of thing. Isn't it crazy that there's one continent that's all

399
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:15,880
completely, it's only ice, there's it's nothing but there's no land, there's no

400
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:19,720
trees, there's no- That's not a continent. I guess it is. It is a

401
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,120
continent. No, but you gotta have like a McDonald's or a Subarro or something.

402
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:27,720
dude it's a it's only ice there's it's there's not even any dirt. It's just

403
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:32,160
ice. It's only ice in the water and like a bunch of fucking animals all live.

404
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,960
I is just

405
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:39,040
it's pretty tough that they got like full continent. You know pass yeah that

406
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:43,680
crazy that I don't know you got to have at least you got it's cool. It's cool to

407
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,160
have what they got mountains. They got a will you pull up the have you heard of

408
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,720
ice mountain? No, it says all the different flags that own Antarctica. Oh

409
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,200
so yeah, it's also it's cool to have a continent that they were there like

410
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,600
okay guys. We can finally can at least agree that this is one continent that

411
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
will belong to nobody because nobody wants to

412
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:05,560
don't go here. Guys, how many flags are on there is that is am I oh wait that

413
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,360
little weird thing with the flags on it. Oh, that works, okay, is this even a

414
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,880
real thing like nobody?

415
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,800
Why the fuck does Argentina got it because they're mad close? Oh, they're

416
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,560
right now. Yeah, they're that I don't even think of Argentina is like cold and

417
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,160
I see at the bottom. I didn't even fucking think about the world is so

418
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,140
insane. Why would you need to think about it? I don't I don't know. I just

419
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,980
don't think about the planet at all. I think about I think about the United

420
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:37,040
States and Africa and Europe. Geography is probably the Africa to like Africa's

421
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,420
and Australia, Africa, okay, I guess I think about everything, but south of the

422
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:46,620
hemisphere south of the border. No, every once in a while I think about I

423
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:50,520
think about the different place in the world for a while. Yeah, I would say

424
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,680
you're watching this video of this couple who went to Chongqing in China

425
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,460
and it's they're like it's like a tick tock, like like travel video and

426
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:02,640
they're like guys. This is the most incredible city ever. There's so much to

427
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,840
do and it was like a fifteen minute video and all they do the entire time is

428
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,520
look at building. It's all like just like like cyberpunk twenty seventy seven

429
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,920
like sky, like skyscrapers with neon light and they just like they just look

430
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:16,420
at everything go and this is what we did next. We went and looked at this

431
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:21,020
building and it was incredible. It's like the blade runner like type city. I

432
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,260
don't know. Do you know the one I'm talking about? It looks like blade

433
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,620
runner. Yeah, the one in... I don't know which one you're talking about, but... I

434
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,660
think we're talking about the same one, but yeah, there was like a whole... Oh,

435
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,220
it takes one day to get there. That sucks. It takes one day to get there?

436
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,140
Yeah, it would take one day to get there from here. But can you... Isn't it

437
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,820
crazy that you could go to China, the most wonderful country on earth, and all

438
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:45,420
you do is look at buildings? Yeah, they didn't even take in the local cuisine.

439
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,380
no, though there was five straight minutes of the of the they also yeah. The

440
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,400
first half of the video is just them in their hotel being showing the different

441
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:53,800
windows.

442
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,580
Oh my God, I look at the

443
00:28:57,580 --> 00:29:03,660
reasonable yeah, but you're going you're traveling to China to look at buildings.

444
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:07,060
Yeah, I think there's also probably a factor of like being a vlogger. You need

445
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,700
to like do some shit yeah. If you're like one of these, but that's what I'm

446
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,380
saying. They didn't do anything. It looks at building of doing things. What is

447
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,980
buildings. Maybe they're like an architecture blog. It was it could be

448
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,300
they weren't they were just they were just they're just on vacation. Yeah, I

449
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,820
guess if you have if you're that that is I always have I always have one one day

450
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,060
of a of a vacation that's like that like yeah, let's just go look at buildings.

451
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:34,300
I don't want to do it sometimes vacation. I don't like like I don't like a hard

452
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,740
schedule. Yeah, no yeah, of course, I want a very I just want to of course not

453
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:43,340
dude. I don't want to I literally I if I go to like a city or something, I do

454
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,540
I'm just saying I'm on an NPC walk cycle. I'm going to the same thing.

455
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:51,780
There's I look up on the map. I immediately look up Walgreens near me or

456
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:55,620
like severe like department store or whatever yeah. If I'm going to do

457
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:00,060
pharmacy, I immediately I try to embed in the local country. I know I know I'm

458
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,860
going to work.

459
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,780
I know

460
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:08,020
I'm getting up. I'm getting it with five AM and I'm walking with with a bunch of

461
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:12,580
other salary men. Yeah, just getting an elevator and pressing the top floor.

462
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:17,920
rough day yesterday opening a street food. I'm opening my own street food

463
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,660
stall. I'm in a suit street food. Yeah, I'm still in a suit yeah. I'm like

464
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,000
yeah.

465
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,440
I wish I could do that. I like to if I'm in a different place. I like like even

466
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,100
Canada. You just get the different candy and soda that they have. Oh yeah, yeah,

467
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,680
so you got to look at everything. I love the different type of chips. They got

468
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,780
the different Doritos in Mexico. Yes, I had some of those in Mexico. The coolest

469
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:44,820
The thing that they do on their bags is they have a big warning label.

470
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
Sodeo Excessivo.

471
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,820
What's the word for sugar? Azucar?

472
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
Azucar.

473
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
Azucar Excessivo.

474
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
I feel like I've been transported to Esplanade.

475
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,820
And they have giant, they put giant stickers on all the food that say that. It's so awesome.

476
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
It looks like the food you're eating...

477
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,820
Both of your guys' pronunciation is so amazing.

478
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:08,820
It looks like the food you're eating has been banned and it looks like you're in a Fahrenheit 451 universe for cookies.

479
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,900
that's yeah and you're fighting against the government. You have a secret stash

480
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,420
of Doritos. You see those big warning labels and then you realize like oh

481
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,020
yeah, we're just eating that shit all the time dude. It's like how to think

482
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,260
about the cigarette warning labels go so fucking hard yeah like we're going to

483
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,460
put that on every piece of food. We're going to put that on to read yeah

484
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,140
picture, but just a

485
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:31,900
fat guy. He's crying.

486
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,540
That would work. I get a mirror just like

487
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:42,220
this is how we how we're going to come back. Obesity is just putting a picture

488
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,580
of a big guy and it's like well, it's just rude. Can you imagine like how

489
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:50,340
fucking hard it would go if they had like on every chips of hoy they put like

490
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,300
a picture of like a guy like cover in a morgue, like with his feet sticking out

491
00:31:54,300 --> 00:32:00,980
with a big by a seat, a big blanket with a giant like a rump on it. Yeah yeah,

492
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:05,440
just like an appendicitis scar yeah, just because no wait the panker like a

493
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:10,060
pancreas surgery scar yeah on his controls. The what I the thing that

494
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,900
would deter me the most is like a really puffy big fat hand with cheese dust on

495
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,860
it, like the like the Prince Andrew finger thing. They remember that she's

496
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,360
got a looned up like sausages. I do remember it's just a thing of imagine

497
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,880
that those with fucking

498
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,020
spicy sweet chili Dorito yeah, they should or that just on the outside of

499
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,460
the bag. Yes, so that when you pick it up at the store, you know the texture

500
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,080
that you're yeah, they use that hand trying to go into a pringles can and not

501
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,040
and it can't fit. Yes, and then and then I get Pringle and then you flip it over

502
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,600
and then they're crying because they can and it's they do like a tag on the

503
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,040
side of it. It comes on a string that you can flip over and see they do it.

504
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:51,220
They do like a like a to like a comic where it's like multiple panels of

505
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,260
different pictures and the first one is a is a fat guy and he's waking up and

506
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,440
he's eating Doritos and the second one is he's going outside and it's snowing.

507
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,020
The third one is he's going out and he's walking across a frozen pond and the

508
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,560
fourth wise hand is

509
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:07,700
and said this can this can happen to you. If you too many to read, it's like in

510
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:10,600
the Harry Potter world, it's like a little animated video that that's what

511
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,780
I have in the future yet

512
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:17,180
yeah, does it's not even related to like being overweight. It's just like a fat

513
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:18,360
guy falling into a man hole

514
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:25,240
with the Harry Potter. I just said that you can't like you, you know you watch

515
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,360
that and you're like oh in the future, we're going to have like moving

516
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:31,040
pictures, movies on foods, but now it's just like I don't want it, but they're

517
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:34,240
you're going to have it. It's screens instead of like magic actually doing it

518
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,380
honestly screens are magic yeah, but it's I just see that you know. I see

519
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,280
through the magic. I know it's just lights, but that's the thing about those

520
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,060
like labels like the excesses of if they were to do the cigarette type things,

521
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:51,460
the only warning that they could give on like Doritos and stuff is like you will

522
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:56,760
become fat yeah. There's no like no, no everyone would be so mad at no. You

523
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,880
know what they do is they just have to show a guy who's going like oh yeah,

524
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,280
so you will have a stomach

525
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,940
stomach

526
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,780
on a chocolate bar.

527
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:10,940
You eat excessive amounts of this. You will get a tummy ache.

528
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:15,840
There is no way in hell that that will not happen. Just pictures are like

529
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,320
babies throwing up because they ate too many like Doritos yeah that really

530
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,560
that's the only thing you could do that wouldn't piss everybody. Yeah, that

531
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,720
wouldn't be like a wrong thing to do. It would also need to be controlled. You

532
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,720
you need to have like an FDA guy who just eats Doritos and it's like

533
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,600
how many duries

534
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,880
picture put it on the bag. Then there's one guy picture. Yeah, one guy's just

535
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,280
got like Joey. He's like the Joey chestnut of Doritos and he doesn't even

536
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:45,120
know it yet. This one he's at the CDC or whatever the FDA and he's like like oh

537
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,120
my God, you guys

538
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,400
stymied a Dorito machine. Yeah, I guess I'm Doritos. You can also do

539
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:55,960
I guess the other so it's either it's either stomach a guy, yeah picture on

540
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,040
label or you could have guy who it's too spicy. He's crying is he's tearing

541
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,660
at his nose, dripping these labels would look amazing or or little piece of

542
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:09,200
little stuck piece of Dorito stuck on the roof of your mouth. Yeah, stuck in

543
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
the tooth, shard, shard, I guess yeah. I guess the only two warnings you can

544
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,800
have the only two or three is like that and then like dental warning yeah, I'm

545
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,520
like a bag of smart food yeah

546
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,920
to make sure we'll get stuck. It'll get stuck in your tooth and it'll be

547
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,380
you put that on lettuce to yeah, you got to put that on lettuce and kale and all

548
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:30,360
that you put warnings of everything that can happen with need on every they

549
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:33,940
need war. They should every food they should print it on each individual leaf

550
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:38,340
of lettuce. There should be a warning ink picture on popsicles that say once

551
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,860
you're done with this brain freeze, but once you're done with this buddy, you

552
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,200
going to laugh yeah laughing. You got a laugh

553
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,120
pointing at

554
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:51,920
his head, holding his head and his leg yeah, yeah, it's got having a heart

555
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,840
attack. We can't tell, but then at the bottom it says you're going to get a

556
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,100
brain freeze and you're going to laugh. It needs to cover every possible side

557
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,920
effect yeah brain freeze, maybe melt out stained hand stain, good sticky hand,

558
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:07,460
stained hand, laughing at the thing brain freeze and then also you bit into

559
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:10,940
it. So your teeth are called splinters splinter from the mistake

560
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:14,580
man go. You know,

561
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:20,620
we're actually returning to be a google right now wound man. We just reinvented

562
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:26,000
the wound. What is wound man? The wound man is a medieval art motif yeah. This

563
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,200
is what we've just created, but for food I just realized

564
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:37,160
can you expand one of these pictures, please one of the what was what was

565
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:41,880
wound man supposed to this is just shows all the different ones you can get. Oh

566
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,020
my God, this was a warning against like swords. Basically, in I don't remember

567
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:51,280
seems like the only this is a this is a dope as it's hard. It's very cool. I

568
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,220
sure there's a million dark souls fans out there who have this tattoo. It's

569
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:58,720
like the only wounds you can get or just something stabbing you yeah right.

570
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,440
It's

571
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,120
I think I might be on a stick of medical

572
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:08,340
do we need to create the modern wound man. We just did we did, but he's the

573
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,580
food man, but we need to create a modern wound man,

574
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,240
a food man, but then like you know, like things that could happen to you like I

575
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,080
guess a bullet tired, tired, yeah, bullet tire. You can eat this possible. It is

576
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,640
the most prominent man is just getting shot at different parts of his body.

577
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,400
Yeah, different guns. It's just a big cheese screen. It's a surgical diagram.

578
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,000
Oh okay, so it's like

579
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,240
a doctor. It's like how to operate on the different like injuries that you

580
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,740
what's happening to this guy? It's just a doctor's seeing that's be like Jesus

581
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:47,420
going to pro cam. See it's like a very hard. What did you do? What just

582
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:50,560
happened? You killed it now, okay, that's fixed. There we go.

583
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:56,360
What we were showing was too gruesome. Yeah, I guess it was. It's a surgical

584
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:00,820
diagram, I guess, so we literally did create the food man is completely, but

585
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,220
see if I'm in surgery and I see this. I don't think it's going to help me. I

586
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,060
he's going to show you're not looking. No, no, no, the surgeon is looking at

587
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,500
manual on the other surgeon is going to do to you. What do I do my I'm in

588
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,200
search? They're about to take up my appendix. I'm like buddy. The incision

589
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,160
is supposed to be vertical yeah. Hey,

590
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:23,140
I'm looking at the. Are you sure you're doing this right doing your own surgery?

591
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:29,220
Pretty pretty cool. My uncle was he's like an air force medic and I think he

592
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,200
was like study. He was like living at my house at the time before he like

593
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,660
joined the Air Force and he was like studying up on all that stuff and he had

594
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:40,580
just had like all these medical like journals and shit and one day I was

595
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:45,220
like I think it was like at after breakfast. I just saw him reading and he

596
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,860
went. I was like what is that? What's that book and he just turned the book to

597
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,060
me and it just showed me it was just a woman with a fork in her throat, like

598
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:56,160
stuck right there. He was like check that out and I was like

599
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:01,340
I think about that image all the time to this to this day. I think that's one of

600
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,960
the scariest and most traumatic things I ever saw as a child was a woman with a

601
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:12,880
like a trachea trachea to be yeah real life squidward yeah yeah. He was

602
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,320
showing me real life squidward

603
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:20,080
female squidward in squidward squidward squidwardina

604
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:28,400
so they ever give squidward a girlfriend in the show. No, he can

605
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,360
not only gay, he's canonically gay.

606
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,880
that's why my cousins weren't allowed. I thought one Bob was a gay. No, is all

607
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:40,280
the others, canonically a sexual Sponge Bob is gay. He's a sexual. I think

608
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,360
that's what he was in like the Nickelodeon pride. No sponge, but post

609
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,360
a squid Villa, whoa, I would use a crush on her. Wait a minute. Does squidward

610
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:53,920
first, but he has a can you imagine writing an article about whether or not

611
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:57,080
squidward has a wife that looks exactly like my girlfriend? You guys

612
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,840
I'm getting rock hard right now, imagining me as squidward and my

613
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:06,740
girlfriend is squidville. It's kind of fucked up how similar he looks to her

614
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,260
yeah. I mean it's just as well. It's because all squidwards look the same

615
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:10,940
whoa

616
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:18,340
by an episode is made evident that every single squidward looks alike.

617
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:23,040
That's when sponge Bob got too real for yeah, so yeah, I've got fucking racist

618
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,160
to see that's when I stopped my kids from watching sponge Bob. My dad didn't

619
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:29,560
let me watch sponge bob. My mom did he was it was it because he thought it was

620
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,720
they were gay. No, it's because when he was in the other room, he didn't want it.

621
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,600
He thought it was like an annoying sound. Oh yeah, that's why my friend wasn't

622
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:39,800
allowed to watch Sweet Life of Zack and Cody. I wish I didn't watch any like

623
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,600
Disney. I didn't I didn't in a bid. I have a hard time relating to a lot of

624
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,560
people my age. Yeah, I don't go like what's fun at what me. I didn't want to

625
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,160
have the

626
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:54,560
what that's what Raven used to say. Oh snap, I never watched raven. My dad also

627
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,000
said we couldn't say snap because it just meant that we were saying oh shit yeah

628
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,880
that's smart. It's custom or dead. I mean we had watch it like here and then, but

629
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,420
like

630
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:09,980
I got I found out about adult swim too young and once you like see like an

631
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,940
adult cartoon like that, it changes like it's like well that one looks funnier

632
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:17,900
for me. I didn't really watch many of those those shows when I was growing up.

633
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:21,940
I was more of a computer kid than a TV kid, but then my younger sibling was a TV

634
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,900
kid. So I feel like I saw all the like Disney shows that are like five years

635
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,580
younger than us. Yeah, I feel like I know a bunch of the ones that are like

636
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,400
people younger than us would know that no, you have a chance guy. They don't

637
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,480
watch that one, but I'm trying to think of an example of one and you guys ever

638
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,480
watch Ant Farm. No, the girl that was this girl from my high school dated one

639
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,580
of the guys on that show and that's that huge news in town. That's one of the

640
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,560
show like I feel like that shows that are that are younger than us that I feel

641
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:50,800
like I saw so much more of those than anything from our age short. That was

642
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:55,600
his name Jake short yeah. She dated Jake short and everyone was like. Did you

643
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,480
hear wait Jake? Jake short is completely the opposite of Jake long short,

644
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,640
who's Jake long the American dragon yeah. I remember that there's a kid.

645
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:09,240
We used to call Jake long on the bus current interesting. We like he was he

646
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:14,040
was not Asian American, but maybe he called him Jake like it is. No, you

647
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,880
called him this kid, Dan Seminek said that he looked like they would that was

648
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,320
his last name and he said he would call a kid S E M A N E K damn and he did an

649
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,000
amazing to

650
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:29,560
and he would call this kid American Dragon, and I think he might have been

651
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,720
he might have been like Native American or something or I don't know why he

652
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:38,160
would call that boy American Dragon yeah and it was a racial. That's a cool

653
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,040
nickname to have

654
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,120
well, maybe if you're American Dragon, if you're an adult out of the context of if

655
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,040
it's specifically in reference, call you get on the bus and everyone's like

656
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:53,420
what's up dragon that's beast that's so sick. It's really depends on the kind

657
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:57,340
like if it's not if it's not earned for doing like cool fire breathing stuff

658
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:01,520
yeah. No, that's a good point also yeah. I think it depends on who who of the

659
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,820
kid, the kid kid liked it okay. I can he laughed at it, but I don't know if he

660
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,120
liked it. There's a kid in my school who kept calling me uncle Joe yeah. This van

661
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,320
is trying to smash through our door. Oh my God, it's Amazon Amazon Prime just

662
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:20,320
the rave up on to us. Guess what basos these new trucks are kind of get us kind

663
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,120
of scary man as space ag yeah, yo yo

664
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:28,960
where you guys are all derailed there. What were you guys like bullied at all?

665
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,520
I was bullied heavily from the ages of one to five yeah, yeah, that's crazy. I

666
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,240
think I was

667
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,280
definitely was when I was in like first and second grade. I was a pretty

668
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:44,240
annoying kid yeah, well, you know, because yeah, they had to have a how to

669
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,780
they pulled aside because like these kids that were like friends with me

670
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:51,880
decided to like bully me sounds like they weren't and I didn't even know I

671
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,720
was getting bullied.

672
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,700
Sounds like they weren't friends yeah. They were not. What are they doing? I

673
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:03,100
don't know they would just like fuck with me a lot and then the teacher had

674
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,460
to pull them aside. This kid, Chris, Laskawa,

675
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,000
call him out yeah. Fuck you, that's right.

676
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,340
We became friends again after that, but yeah

677
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:19,280
that I think I was more of a me. Not really yeah. I think I was. I think I

678
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:23,300
was a door for a while, but I was I was. I think I was the archetypical

679
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:28,500
mean nerd mean nerd yeah, but getting and giving and receiving you what

680
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,260
Liz Lemon Liz Lemon. I was a Liz Lemon yeah pretty much. I think I think we

681
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:36,540
all were Liz Lemons. Huh we've all kind of been Liz Lemons and at some point

682
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,480
in our life, it's honestly one of the most resonating TV characters of all

683
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,440
time and we're all just looking for our Jack

684
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:51,180
have you guys ever had a mentor? Yeah, yeah, I have one of millions of mentors

685
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,940
in my life. Damn it, I had a I'd be a perfect mentor your school, like you

686
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,260
look at them as like you are my men. Oh, no, we just played. We played we played

687
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,460
hearthstone together

688
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:07,200
at school, made made me have a mentor because I was doing so badly and missing

689
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,060
everything yeah and then he was just very cool. We just talked about over

690
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:14,980
watching hearthstone every yeah, but you got your homework done with him. No, we

691
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,620
had to do. He didn't do shit some mentor. We had some fire like that, too, but it

692
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,940
was mostly me hanging out in the after school. I would have to stay after

693
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:27,660
school to do my homework, so I had something called like the periods went

694
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:32,700
from a through H. It was called I period and I had to me and like five other kids

695
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:37,100
had to stay after for I period. It was like two hours. It was also because my

696
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:40,600
my mom and dad like worked a bunch. It was like they didn't know what to do

697
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,020
with me after school, and I would have to go to an after school program just

698
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:47,520
to do my homework, and I hung out with this old man named Mr. Mac, who loved

699
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,960
the Beatles, and he had his assistant was named Mr. Colachi, and Mr. Colachi

700
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:55,660
knew what Team Fortress two was. Yes, so that was my homie. I was talking to

701
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,540
him about yes, yes, yes, I was showing him Gmod videos. This is an experience

702
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:03,600
that so many kids with ADHD have, finding the one, the one slightly younger

703
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,420
adult who knows the one thing that you also know, and he was telling me how

704
00:46:07,420 --> 00:46:12,080
good he is at Huntsman Sniper, and I was like yeah, I mostly play as demo man

705
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,180
right now, but I've been switching over to pyro.

706
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:19,740
It was like the like the only time I've ever felt like a connection to an adult

707
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,180
and an adult teacher, your language, yeah, the only time I've ever been like

708
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,980
this teacher somebody like that in my life again, somebody who's who's like

709
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:31,000
well, that's the thing we're like years older than me. We are not the Padawan

710
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,620
anymore. No, no, it's time to go find some kids man

711
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:43,040
pass it on on the way up here. There was a fire drill. It was like hard to walk

712
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,780
up here. There's like from a school yeah. There's no idea what you're saying

713
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:49,400
like two hundred. What do you mean you're in a school and there's a like

714
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,980
where were you that there's a but I understand now that's one yeah, so you

715
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,660
went and hung out with all the kids and you're trying to mentor them. Is that

716
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:57,960
where you're telling I was just shaking going up to the kids and be like

717
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,840
making all the kids. Don't be afraid guys. A fire drill doesn't mean there's a

718
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:04,840
fire. It's usually a test, but it's going to be also don't now don't start

719
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:09,100
don't start running around yeah, because you don't want to stay in line

720
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:13,080
stay in line. You don't want the muscle memory of fooling around during a fire

721
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:17,200
drill. You don't want to disrespect your teacher. You never want to

722
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,600
you wouldn't want to disrespect your teacher and run around. Would you the

723
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,520
teacher like catches you

724
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,720
hey

725
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,080
you run

726
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:26,580
you

727
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:34,400
the kid goes over the teachers like like Miss. There's like scary guy like

728
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,040
points at you and you're like I don't know what you're talking about. I'm

729
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:42,080
simply in your average adult. I'm one of the students of the

730
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:44,160
astute. I am the student and

731
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:48,060
you get to go stall trying to be

732
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:53,500
making it way worse, making it way, but all yourself, the student inspector,

733
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:57,620
like just got to you just behind bars like a fucking thought that one would

734
00:47:57,620 --> 00:48:01,500
work. I am the student inspector and I take a close look at the student body

735
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:08,560
to make sure nothing is abnormal or out of line hanging out outside the school

736
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,660
in case of a fire drill like twenty four seven yeah.

737
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:18,460
I'm here to be we are old studio back inside our old studio was right next to

738
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:22,640
a in elementary school. It's impossible to do anything here. That's not right

739
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,440
next to an elementary school. Yeah, there are a lot of fucking suck for

740
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,820
pedophiles to live in this area of New York, because there's a school every two

741
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:33,980
blocks. Yeah, I guess all the pedophiles have to live in like go on us next to

742
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:37,780
all the I feel like they are shipping kids in from Connecticut to go to school.

743
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:44,020
You're like charged up about it. I it's crazy. I don't know I just there just so

744
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:48,920
many schools. Yeah, one I've always lived next to a school. So it's a very it's a

745
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:54,400
very dense densely populated. Yeah, we live right our first apartment at twenty

746
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,700
two star. We lived right across the street from a school, across the street

747
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,600
from a school old office right next to a school. I live next to a school right

748
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:05,760
now. Yeah, I live a block away from a school. Yeah, I live a block away from a

749
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,980
school and then about like maybe four blocks from another school. You know

750
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:12,700
what I made it out of a school. I live two blocks away. I actually I'm thinking

751
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:17,220
right now and I there are three schools within four blocks of me. Yeah, you live

752
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:21,100
by hell of schools. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It's so many you live by like a

753
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,760
school on every block. How do you how do they need that many so many people?

754
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:28,580
There's too many people. It's a very easy. Some schools have better education

755
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:32,620
than others. Yeah, I mean there's also a thing of like, but that even with how

756
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,920
many people you don't need them that close to each other. You do know you

757
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:42,660
don't rivalry. Start a rivalry is bad. Rivalry is good. According to the my you

758
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,300
know what rival, you know what rivalry has created what and honestly this might

759
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:48,040
it too far to say I'm going to say it anyway.

760
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,500
Rivalry caused the Holocaust.

761
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,940
What was the rivalry, the rivalry, which were the teams and the Jews one on he

762
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,640
was jealous of what they could achieve. He can he's he's the only Jewish one

763
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:06,080
here. He can talk about it right. You're Jewish me yeah. I thought you were

764
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:10,220
Jewish. I'm a quarter Jewish, he's a quarter, but I don't count. I'm not

765
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:14,180
allowed to be was that not the mom side, but think about that when you're talking

766
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:17,160
we're putting schools a block away from each other. Well, think about what you

767
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,720
might about how, but but also rivalry created you know Microsoft and it

768
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:25,180
created apple. Two of the most evil fucking companies of all time, Bill

769
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,300
Gay, first of all, Bill Gates, who is

770
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,980
it created he's an evil wizard, who's dropping mosquitoes all across the city

771
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,720
to suck blood out of people on leave them to be as dry as potato chips and

772
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:41,740
Steve Mosquito Jobs is straight up a mother fucking zombie. He dead. He

773
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:45,440
drink the juice till he died. He he drank juice when he had cancer because he

774
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,600
wanted to get to hell faster to reform it

775
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,620
and rule over it. He wanted to streamline hell. He wanted to put kiosks

776
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:56,120
all over hell. Yeah, he wanted to put a genius bar down there so that he could

777
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:00,020
he could make the the deviling experience a lot more streamlined and when

778
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:03,860
he did you know what hell right now, completely white, completely white,

779
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,420
looks like an apple store. There's tables everywhere and guess what they

780
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,680
all wear shirts all where wait. Why do I feel like? Why do I feel like hell would

781
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:17,160
be completely but not white and banal and heaven would be like tie dye with

782
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,920
fires going on and like hell a partying and smoke going up in the heaven

783
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,940
probably looks like fucking burning man. I mean that that's the original

784
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,700
rivalry right heaven versus hell yeah

785
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:30,800
speaking of rivalries, I've spoken upon this a million times, but there was a

786
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:36,080
my high school very small compared to our rival high school, which had four

787
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,640
other cities that would they would bus kids into,

788
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:45,200
so it was like a student body of like probably like twenty thousand versus

789
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:49,100
like I think ten thousand or some shit. I don't know the numbers, but every

790
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,140
year there's a student body of twenty thousand kids, something like that

791
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:52,840
there's a

792
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:59,000
I think I'm exaggerating the numbers here. I'm exaggerating the numbers of

793
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,480
your school had ten thousand and there had twenty

794
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:07,400
if you tip the scales correctly, we went to a really small school, really small

795
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:12,440
school. No, I'm in the district, the district. I mean it's craziest building

796
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:17,520
ever yeah. It was huge no because that school Pinkerton Academy looked like a

797
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:21,900
fucking. It looked like a fucking college campus. That's the name of a

798
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:26,120
school in a book that Tim Burton adapt yeah and like twenty nine and that was

799
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,520
the right. That was my rival high school was called Pinkerton Academy. Will you

800
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:34,200
look up jacket academy. It was huge. It was it was like it had different. I just

801
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:38,040
build down my high school and rebuilt it into a gigantically large building.

802
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:42,900
Yeah, Pinkerton Academy, it'll say how oh wait yeah, just set it right there

803
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:49,140
number of students three thousand yeah, that's big. That is pretty big

804
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:53,900
twenty thousand. Well, then look up legendary. I see a picture of pink

805
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:58,200
legendary. I probably was Pinkerton good at sports. Now I'm thinking about it's

806
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,860
probably the same yeah. That's what that high school looked like versus my

807
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:02,880
fucking shitty. I

808
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,760
go there. So

809
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:10,680
you guys wanted to go to Pinkerton Academy. So bad, dude, I want my dad to

810
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:15,920
move in my home town is crazy. I wanted to move literally three blocks, three

811
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:20,000
city blocks away. Was it a boarding school? No, damn that's fucking. It was

812
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,840
just the it was just the high school for the town and I wanted to go there

813
00:53:23,880 --> 00:53:28,600
because they had a better video and TV program than our school and but you

814
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:32,120
just got like districted into the other yeah yeah, just I mean I probably could

815
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:36,860
have gone there yeah, but I had to go to fucking London, very high, where all the

816
00:53:36,860 --> 00:53:40,520
teachers hated my guts and they blocked me on Twitter. What is London? There's

817
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:45,440
no building that they built for my high school. It's gigantic. This is not even

818
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,040
the full thing. This is like half of it. I can see it in

819
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:53,200
in real life. Look, they had a sugar house. What's a sugar? I don't know if

820
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,240
they had a fucking sugar house. Look at that. I would guess that someone look at

821
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:01,140
name. Look at this fucking shit. Wow, it's like a museum dude. Everything got

822
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,400
better when we left it.

823
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,360
Isn't that fucked up the city? If we move out of New York, they're probably

824
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,920
going to make it. They're going to go down. They're going to make it bigger.

825
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,000
How would I add a new borough? If we leave, they add a new borough called

826
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:17,840
okay, wait, fuckers, native New Yorker, lifelong. If they added a new borough,

827
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:21,800
what's your dream borough? What would the name be for the sixth one? Probably

828
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:28,600
Motown. Okay, I would say they probably have like delis and maybe like like oh

829
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,580
like a Japanese grocery store. There's a dog park. That's actually nice.

830
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:39,660
How big is it? It's really, really big, but all fenced in know the the burrow

831
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:42,280
of the burrow. It's like a city block,

832
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:47,140
so it's like the whole and where would you put it?

833
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:51,700
I would put it like right around my where I currently live right now, yeah,

834
00:54:51,700 --> 00:54:52,380
which is

835
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:57,780
it's I'm not going to I'm not going to say that no, no, don't say it. Don't say

836
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:01,260
your address, although you can probably find me. Do you look hard enough? I'm

837
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:05,860
not hard to find you're a tall person yeah and I do not go very many places.

838
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:09,480
Yeah, you go to like that makes it harder to find you. You were an insane

839
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:10,420
creature of habit.

840
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:17,940
Why you like I mean you buy the same drink in twenty four packs. I live with

841
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:21,740
you. I know I know that you do the same shit every day. Yeah, sometimes you're

842
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:25,740
supposed to do yeah. I mean sometimes it's well you're you're you're like

843
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,140
Amelia Bedelia. You are you are very

844
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:37,340
ever really thought about that yeah. We do kind of live exact opposite. Yeah,

845
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,420
that's why we were such good roommates brain styles. Yeah, there should be a

846
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:45,380
to you do a lot of you guys yeah, yeah, just living in different like like not

847
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,600
hanging out sometimes

848
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:52,240
hey what's up man? I'm going out tonight. Oh we're running into a street. Oh

849
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,420
hey man, I got oh yeah, I gotta go to the store. I'm gonna play fall guys.

850
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:55,900
Yeah,

851
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:59,380
the TV show yeah, it just keeps cutting a joke.

852
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,820
Patrick going all over the city doing like crazy stuff, meeting new people

853
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,820
going to do like new stores and stuff and I play fall guys. I put the

854
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:10,900
controller down. I take the dog out. I go back and play more fog. Yeah,

855
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,800
everyone, you take out your phone and you go to the living room to watch a

856
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:15,600
movie new skin on fall guys.

857
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:20,080
There did well. I thought you guys would like it. They put in like Godzilla

858
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,920
stuff yeah. You had already told me about that before, though, so it's kind

859
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:26,660
of old news. I didn't see the one of the three headed dragon one, Gidora,

860
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:28,600
what was a king in the living room?

861
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:34,560
What you put like he Joe put like a hall of fame in the living room. Oh yeah

862
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:41,020
yeah actor or person hall of fame pictures of actors that Joe like

863
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:41,520
well

864
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:48,320
when it's treated with like the, you know, reverence, the reverence of the

865
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,020
hall of fame,

866
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:54,200
the guys right, it's more than the guy's name from blue collar, yeah, fat,

867
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:58,900
putting the fat coto and like putting the names of Rosa Parra, Rosa Park,

868
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:05,140
Elaine May, Tom Green, Tom Green, Tom Green Coolidge, Tom Green, Jennifer

869
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,440
Coolidge. We were kind of like looking to fill out the roster a little bit. I

870
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,380
like Jennifer Coolidge, Tom Green. I think with Tom Green was a patch right

871
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:14,720
that like jennifer coolidge, why even say that what you just said, what I'm

872
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,200
just saying like there was kind of fucked up. If she hears that she's not

873
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,080
going to be having, I'm just saying we had a oh no, she deserved it. She was

874
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,720
hey, she was still in the hall of fame. I wasn't

875
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,200
I

876
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,980
fucking pissed off kicking like I wasn't nominated. I wasn't elected getting

877
00:57:30,980 --> 00:57:33,880
every time you see your hall of fame. You set up getting so pissed off that

878
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,320
you're not on it. I was pretty pissed off. I just didn't like that house. I

879
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:40,640
I just remember here like you had the hall of fame up there and I just

880
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:45,200
remember like our other the Alex and Neil like having girls over and just

881
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,380
immediately having to be like oh yeah. Our roommate Joe did that still the

882
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:53,060
funniest things when Alex brought oh my God, we had like the prop gun that we

883
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:57,580
use for the gun that you've seen us pull out a million times and it looks real

884
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:57,940
very

885
00:57:57,940 --> 00:58:02,420
realistic. This is on like a first date and he came back to that apartment and

886
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,680
there's just a really real

887
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:05,300
on the

888
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:10,180
on the like coffee table and then she like they like hung out for a little bit

889
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:12,880
and she's like it was like going well before that she's like I'm going to go

890
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,840
yeah and then he was like oh fuck

891
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,100
a gun. It's not real look, look putting it on your head, putting in your head

892
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,880
at this point. Look, it's not real. It's fake. It's a fake. I the thing I

893
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,540
remember hearing about from that apartment that always made me laugh as a

894
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:26,460
and this is a funny Joe thing is

895
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:32,700
you're on trial, buddy. Yeah, the trial of Joe Gleason is movie points. Oh my

896
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:38,720
fucking God. Well, it never works. My fucking God, I forgot about movie

897
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,040
points. It never works.

898
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:49,520
Movie points was a was a it was pitched. It never really it never happened, but

899
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,600
it was a system where we each gained. I've never let me say also be points

900
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,160
for never. I've never ever heard how it's work, how it actually worked. I've

901
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:00,560
never heard Joe talk about it ever. I only heard it about from the heard about

902
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:03,940
from the three other members of the apartment separately being like others

903
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:04,760
movie points.

904
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,560
Well, what we wanted what we were trying to do we were I was trying to build like

905
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:14,240
household camaraderie and like have a fun thing. No, you know you were treating

906
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,440
the house like it was summer camp, which was honestly it was really, really nice.

907
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,560
It made I really loved it a lot. It also meant I don't like, but I mean a

908
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:27,720
bunch of shit like points that well movie points. It was where every Friday. I

909
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:31,880
think we're supposed to watch a movie all together. That was the idea that and

910
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:36,660
you got to choose the movie based off of you, the accumulation of movie points,

911
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:42,460
but that was terrible in that house because it was then a competition. Well,

912
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:45,660
I don't know. I don't really understand how you got movie points in my mind. It

913
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,300
was you got movie points at the beginning of the month. You what you

914
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,820
don't understand how it works. He did not understand.

915
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,500
It was still in like the conceptualization phase. Okay, it never

916
00:59:56,540 --> 01:00:00,420
it was really flew. It never took off and I think there's another problem with

917
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:02,520
that house was that people didn't do

918
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:09,100
people didn't do chores or like shit. You know, Patrick was big into cooking

919
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:12,500
something and then leaving it on the stove and then I would do it the next

920
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:16,980
day. Yeah, which is tough, but that's right gross. I know that's real was Neil

921
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:21,340
was now you know Neil, which honestly with a woman, honestly, what kind of was

922
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:26,140
worse was that Neil wasn't we had a dishwasher, but Neil was insistent on he

923
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:29,760
would is not going to take part in the dishwasher. He's going to hand wash his

924
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,560
own dishes, so then that also meant that sometimes they're just either dishes

925
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:37,960
there in the sink that he didn't wash yet or they would just be like poorly

926
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:43,860
washed dishes put away yeah and then Alex is just like you know you can't get him

927
01:00:43,860 --> 01:00:47,160
to do a single tour. Well, he'll do a chore, but you have to kind of be like

928
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:51,880
hey man. Can you do that chore? Yeah, yeah, I guess no, you can actually get

929
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,900
him to do a chore. If you say, can you do this for me, but

930
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,400
but

931
01:00:55,400 --> 01:01:01,000
but Alex definitely didn't, but he doesn't like Alex doesn't want to do the

932
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,000
yeah around the house. Who wants to do chores around the house? No, no, no, of

933
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,500
course, no, I would I want when we all in order to moved in and we were like

934
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:12,700
it's just going to be bro down time all the time and Joe came in and was the

935
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:17,700
only one who had a level head about it and was like okay, someone has to do

936
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:21,700
these dishes. Well, I've been the I've been the bad roommate before yeah and I

937
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:26,080
I wanted to be the room. It was that I was the yeah. You have to be the bad

938
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,760
roommate to become a good roommate yeah. When I

939
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:33,960
Joe well for for me and Joe,

940
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:39,800
but like when Joe moved out and then it was just me, Alex and Neil, what a

941
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,760
fucking house that was yeah. I was the I was the worst roommate in the world

942
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:48,280
that just I think that that was just the worst apartment. Yeah space. Oh yeah,

943
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:55,040
my land, my our old landlord Rupert, who is number 20 on the landlord watch list.

944
01:01:55,040 --> 01:02:00,240
Do not rent from list. Shout out Rupert. Shout out Rupert. I thought you're going

945
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,200
to play a sound effect. I was thinking about it. I didn't want to because then

946
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,360
I have to upload a whole separate file for the soundtrack and for one sound

947
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:10,520
right at the end. Who cares man? Yeah, but yeah, that we had black mold and a

948
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:13,800
hole in the ceiling. And if you left your dishes in the sink, the mice would

949
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:19,500
come out. I'm trying to what's like it was also just the like space yeah that

950
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:24,520
place sucked yeah. It was seven Stanhope Street apartment three are do not to buy

951
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:29,000
that place. Do not rent it. We did a bunch of videos there, but it was always

952
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,980
like it always felt crazy crazy. There was a hole in the in the ceiling for a

953
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:36,580
year. You can't make it look like a place that's like a nor it can't stand it for

954
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:40,060
like a normal apartment. No, no, no, I feel like if you pour that's a place

955
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:44,240
sure if you poured an an insane amount of money into it, you could get like a

956
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,860
movie style apartment. You could get it on a part a new york apartment. You would

957
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:52,540
see in a movie. It's like you'd have sod is falling apart. The stairs up or like

958
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:55,800
yeah, freaky and wow yeah, but yeah, that's only the actual into those

959
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,180
stairs were horrible. That whole building was horrible. That whole

960
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:02,340
building should be condemned yeah, unless there's people still living in

961
01:03:02,340 --> 01:03:05,540
it. That door to is crazy. I think there should be condemned and the people

962
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:09,220
should be locked inside. Oh my God yeah, there was no door knob on the door yeah

963
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:14,200
There was no doorknob on it to get in. You had to go like, like you had to

964
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:18,400
jiggle twice up. Here's how you break in there. Okay, so you get the key to

965
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,280
the... Actually, I still have the keys. If you want the keys to that building.

966
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:27,680
I've never had a really bad apartment. I feel like the one I had in Boston

967
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:30,940
was like, it was pretty good. The only problem with it was that there was

968
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:35,020
a guy who would always come on... We had like... He would always come on

969
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:40,900
it was me. It was me. The guy's always coming in loud. There was a window out into the alley

970
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:44,980
that was right behind our apartment. We were on the first floor and there was a guy who

971
01:03:44,980 --> 01:03:51,700
would always, yeah, right by the Com Ave. Let's say all of our old addresses. Green

972
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,900
Line. I'm trying to remember the address, man. I can say my old address right now. Right

973
01:03:55,900 --> 01:04:01,100
in front of the Green Line. 211 Harvard Ave, Apartment B. Harvard Ave stop, I think. I

974
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:04,820
honestly can't remember this place's address. I'm trying right now so hard. I know it was

975
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:09,940
on come have kind of nice yeah. It was a it was fine. I mean, but there there was

976
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:12,340
this guy who would come on his lunch break every single day

977
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:18,960
and just smoke a bong outside of right outside of our window and he and one

978
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:19,200
time

979
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,560
girlfriend was doing like like an exercise video and he was standing out

980
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:28,260
there and he started like mimet like doing the things he was doing. That's

981
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:31,560
the time he was there when I was pointing at him out the window and going

982
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,040
like this

983
01:04:33,940 --> 01:04:37,260
at him and going like and then he never came back.

984
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:42,240
Boston's ridiculous. That's how I handled yeah. He fucking got that guy

985
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,280
out of there. You don't know the address. I'm

986
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:49,040
blanking on it. I don't know thirty five. I can't remember it. Thirty five. I

987
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:52,440

991
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,240
is on the map. We talked about it on the show before, but I used to be on. So it's my old

992
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:14,240
apartment was right across the street from Great Scott in Boston, and I used to be on

993
01:05:14,240 --> 01:05:22,240
the Apple map Street View. I looked like you would look up like 200-206 Harvard Ave and

994
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:28,080
you would just see me and I posed exactly like Bigfoot, like walking back to my like

995
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:32,520
it was like a basement apartment. You remember that you ever go to that place or I was Cameron

996
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,460
did. You know how they had that like that little stairwell and like all the

997
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,900
homeless guys would like pee in it because it looked exactly like a

998
01:05:37,900 --> 01:05:43,080
bathroom. And yeah, there's like a photo of me with my head out the like

999

basement door like this. And then a photo of me in front of this dentist's

1000
01:05:49,220 --> 01:05:53,300
office that was right next door to it. And I'm like posed exactly like Bigfoot.

1001
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:57,540
I looked it up the other day because Great Scott is now becoming a Taco Bell

1002
01:05:57,540 --> 01:06:01,500
Cantina. Yeah, which is so funny. I wanted to see it. I was like, oh, I

01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,400
I wonder if I'm still on the street view you guys I'm completely gone. Well,

01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:25,960
leaking my old addresses, unless there's text things that could get me fucked up.

1009
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:29,660

1013
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:49,620
podcast at the end now has just been us reminiscing about different streets,

1014
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:54,700
which is a problem that I have. It is fun. I mean that's that's all you that's

1015
01:06:54,700 --> 01:06:56,260
all you got is the memories now

1016
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:04,760
that we lost at the end of I was in a class called listening to music with

1017
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:09,040
that lady, Frederica King yeah, one of the best racers I've ever had it. So it

1018
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:12,400
was the most ricos class ever, but at the very end it was all about classical

1019
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,640
music and like recognising different periods and stuff and at the end she

1020
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:21,200
played see when you get there by coolio, which starts off with pocket bells

1021
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,640
cannon. You know it's like plays classical music and then there's a

1022
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:27,480
record scratch and a beat drops in and there was supposed to be like a look

1023
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,760
like all this classical music is still like inspiring music today, yeah and

1024
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,160
ever it was a thing of the music scratch and everyone was sitting in silence and

1025
01:07:36,160 --> 01:07:37,400
when in the beat dropped, I was like

1026
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:43,000
and I was looking around here. The only one and nobody can no one else cared

1027
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,560
about it. I was like that's such a fun way to end the class man. That was the

1028
01:07:46,560 --> 01:07:49,840
best class I ever took. I love when teachers get I love when things get

1029
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:55,320
sent to me. I took like I took like four different class. The reason I dropped

1030
01:07:55,360 --> 01:08:01,480
out because I didn't realize that I was stuck at Emerson taking Gen Eds and I

1031
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:06,280
took like three different like listening to music, like all these music classes.

1032
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:10,780
I have a jazz yeah yeah, I did I did no no no I wasn't in history of jazz. I

1033
01:08:10,780 --> 01:08:14,700
was in history of American pop and then history of American music and

1034
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:20,300
you did not go to school for music at all. No, but I think halfway through I

1035
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:24,060
was like to three different maybe I'll be a music writer. Those are like the

1036
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:28,380
those are history classes yeah yeah. So I was taking them for history classes,

1037
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:31,980
but they also filled elective credits that I needed to get yeah. I remember I

1038
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:35,540
was you just reminded what I think in my senior year I took a I took a had to

1039
01:08:35,540 --> 01:08:39,800
take an econ class yeah and I was trying to remember the exact context of like

1040
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:44,060
and this is this is Emerson, where it's a bit of a woke school, but I remember

1041
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,580
the the econ professor was

1042
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:49,220
I don't remember the exact quote. I really wish I'd written this down

1043
01:08:49,220 --> 01:08:51,920
somewhere, but he was like to we were like he was going over stuff before a

1044
01:08:51,980 --> 01:08:55,040
test or something and he was like so doing so like something about supply,

1045
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:58,940
like some like econ thing and he's like and if you don't understand this,

1046
01:08:58,940 --> 01:09:00,220
you're a retard.

1047
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:06,900
Everybody in the class like looked at each other,

1048
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:15,660
I just remembered that, like the other day. I can't believe it is so fun, so

1049
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:20,740
literally no reason, like no reason to say it doesn't make any sense. It's

1050
01:09:20,780 --> 01:09:24,740
about something just like it. Yeah, nobody's on it. Nobody just kept going

1051
01:09:24,740 --> 01:09:29,020
yeah everybody's going to oh yeah. I had we had a moment like that in my

1052
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:32,580
history of American pop class, but it's because she was showing that footage of

1053
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:37,740
Russell Brand at the VMAs in two thousand and eight and she was like like

1054
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:42,420
talking about it was a whole section on like protests at award shows yeah and

1055
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:43,980
she was talking about Russell Brand

1056
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:50,040
and there's a speech. It's pretty like crazy. He just goes off and is like

1057
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:57,460
George Bush. George W Bush is a retard. Do not vote for him and every single

1058
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,920
person in that class went. Yeah,

1059
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:06,060
it is crazy crazy teachers at that school professors loved to say the N

1060
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:10,140
word in a quote and then send an email the next day. I'm so sorry, I'm so

1061
01:10:10,140 --> 01:10:13,600
sorry, yeah, I did and you know they do that every single semester. I think

1062
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:16,380
this is the semester where I can get away with saying a hard R N word,

1063
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,580
because I'm quoting somebody and

1064
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:22,480
all the tenured professors are just pushing the envelope at this point,

1065
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:25,120
where it's just every single one of them is just like all right.

1141
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:49,980
cancelled people's accounts.

1142
01:15:49,980 --> 01:15:51,980
You know, I don't fucking care.

1143
01:15:51,980 --> 01:15:53,980
You better pay me.

1144
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,980
You should have paid.

1145
01:15:55,980 --> 01:15:57,980
And then he looks into the camera.

1146
01:15:57,980 --> 01:15:59,980
He looks into the camera.

1147
01:15:59,980 --> 01:16:01,980
He says like, um...

1148
01:16:01,980 --> 01:16:03,980
This is what happens when you don't pay.

1149
01:16:03,980 --> 01:16:05,980
I want to hang out with him so bad.

1150
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:07,980
I get so fucked up on Aviation Jim.

1151
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,980

1152
01:16:09,980 --> 01:16:11,980
Oh yeah.

1153
01:16:11,980 --> 01:16:13,980
Yes, the binder with all the phone numbers.

1154
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,980
A binder.

1155
01:16:15,980 --> 01:16:21,080
Oh, a binder. Yeah. You send out the alerts to every single person's account.

1156
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,720
It says your phone will self disrupt in five minutes and then

1157
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,640
we have this is a Hawaii alert that said that there was a nuclear bomb

1158
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,840
dropping. Only the mobile people got that. Oh my God. He could do some epic

1159
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:36,020
pranks with mobile and he's just wasting it. If you have this phone,

1160
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:40,220
everyone's gay. Damn. Alert. That's not a good selling tactic. Amber alert.

1161
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:43,040
There is a guy holding this phone.

1162
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:47,500
What are your thoughts on X?

1163
01:16:47,500 --> 01:16:50,100
I'm all in on X. I've bought a bunch of stock.

1164
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:52,100
I've been X-ing all day.

1165
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:53,700
I just constantly X-ing.

1166
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,000
I X like it's 2009.

1167
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:57,500
Like, "Got a sandwich today!"

1168
01:16:57,500 --> 01:17:00,700
Like, "You might do a pedophile joke."

1169
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:03,500
Like, X, you know, 2009 pedophile jokes.

1170
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:05,800
Just trying to be epic on the computer, nonstop.

1171
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:09,300
What would give me an example of a 2009 pedophile joke you're doing?

1172
01:17:09,300 --> 01:17:10,800
It's like, "I'm a pedophile."

1173
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:14,300
"I'm a pedophile," said no one ever.

1174
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:18,180
that actually can you and then you reply to it and say, except for pedophiles,

1175
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:23,300
except for pedophiles, and then ten years later, you have to make some post

1176
01:17:23,300 --> 01:17:26,780
under that one. I don't understand what this means. I did not mean I don't even

1177
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:30,020
remember posting this at the time. I think I got hacked. I think I was

1178
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:34,060
honestly, I was probably off that scissor. Yeah, yeah,

1179
01:17:34,060 --> 01:17:39,140
all those posts of like comedians from two thousand and eight where they're

1180
01:17:39,140 --> 01:17:43,220
being racist and they just respond like the opioid epidemic has affected us all.
