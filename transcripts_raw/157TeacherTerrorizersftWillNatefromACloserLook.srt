1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
(music)

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
(music)

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Now the timer is running.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Oh my fucking god.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The clock is ticking.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Watch out. Uh oh.

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Tick, tick, go.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
One hour.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
You have one hour to write the song of the century.

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Write the song of the decade?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
And we're going to sit back and listen.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,840
- Song of the decade.

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,120
♪ You must have sung back in you long ago ♪

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,120
- This is my song I'm writing.

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,960
- Okay.

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,200
♪ A sentimental fool don't you know ♪

17
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,040
♪ You know, you know, you know ♪

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,860
- You know what song?

19
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,700
- No, you gotta work it.

20
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:39,520
- Was that part of it?

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,120
- You gotta have, you need lyrics that are intelligible.

22
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,440
- Yeah, I only know like half,

23
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,280
I only know half the lyrics to what--

24
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,000
- You only know half the song you wrote.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,680
- Yeah, I only know half the lyrics

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,520
to what a fool believes the song that I wrote.

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,360
- Well, you gotta start at the beginning.

28
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:55,040
What makes a good, what makes a popular song?

29
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,880
What are the greatest songs?

30
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:58,080
Melody, lyrics, rhythm, and theming.

31
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Okay, that's for sure true.

32
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,480
That's the number one thing.

33
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,480
Sensuality.

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,880
Sensuality is extremely important.

35
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,480
That's the theme though, is sensuality.

36
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,180
You can start with sensuality, and then you need to move into lyrics.

37
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,480
So maybe like, what's sensual?

38
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,680
Like licking and stuff?

39
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,680
Chocolate.

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,480
Licking a chocolate off a nipple.

41
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,480
Something dripping.

42
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,480
A Bananas Foster perhaps.

43
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,480
We could sing Bananas Foster all day.

44
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,480
We've got it on the brain.

45
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,480
Bananas Foster?

46
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Bananas Foster.

47
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,480
Do you know what Bananas Foster is?

48
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,320
Bananas, right?

49
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,320
The dessert?

50
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Yes, the dessert.

51
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,320
Bananas Foster.

52
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,320
Yeah, I mean, yeah, I guess I know that.

53
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,320
You'd be looking on a guy name.

54
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,320
We're talking about the famous guy.

55
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
I mean, I don't know if this is like, you know, some kind of drink.

56
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,760
Bananas Foster is the name of the R&B singer that's going to sing this song that we write.

57
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Yes, that's correct.

58
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
Yes.

59
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
Well, they write.

60
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,760
I don't want any part of it, but it is about sensuality.

61
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
We're just working as like a Barry Gordy type.

62
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:50,480
We're involved in the marketing, the production, not the actual music production, but the general,

63
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,640
we're going to make sure that you guys make like no money on it.

64
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

65
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:08,960
streets yeah you got like you guys blackmail right yeah okay I'm gonna I'm

66
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,560
gonna go I'm gonna give it to you I'm gonna make your last I'm serving you

67
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
dessert I'm gonna make it last that should be the next and give it a

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,260
You gotta make the dessert last.

69
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:23,260
The dessert gotta last two meals.

70
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,660
I feel like we have a kind of a divide here.

71
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,260
You're almost being sexual.

72
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,660
You're just saying you love food.

73
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:29,660
I know.

74
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,160
You're saying my banana's faucet.

75
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,160
Yeah, I'm trying to make it, trying to tie it back in.

76
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,660
Well, that's the thing, you don't understand.

77
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,160
Those are, that's called an innuendo.

78
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

79
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Also that you gotta make the dessert last two meals,

80
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,660
that would be kind of a hit sexual anthem

81
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,160
maybe in the Great Depression.

82
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

83
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,160
That could be really huge for families

84
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
that were torn apart by poverty.

85
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,660
Not too sexual in the Great Depression.

86
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,700
Yeah, I imagine it was hard. Yeah, they were very sexual. Yeah, they were nothing else to do

87
00:02:52,700 --> 00:03:01,180
Yeah before the code came in they had Mae West being like why you'd mind you'd suck my titties hard, you know

88
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,220
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah is the great I grew up in the Great Depression

89
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:12,260
Is that the one where they had to sell their kid like their yeah, it's meat. That's where that was the that was the Obama

90
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:17,200
Administration. Oh, I'm thinking of the recession 2009. That's right. Yeah, that's what's up

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Have you ever seen that picture where people are like selling horrible photos?

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,200
It's like some... I think it's in Europe.

93
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,200
They're like some famine or something is happening and the guy is like

94
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
his kids entire body like butchered up on a table. What?

95
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Pretty crazy photo. No. And I like that somebody was like

96
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,200
walking by and was like "huh, photo time, let's take a photo of that."

97
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
I did also see that picture on creepypasta.wikia.com.

98
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,200
I think it's real. I think it has to be real.

99
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,200
Why would you fake something like that?

100
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,200
It's too scary. It's way too scary.

101
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
The dab was Slenderman.

102
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,200
I guess, yeah. No, I'm not going to fake.

103
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,200
We have Nate and Will with us. What's up guys?

104
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,200
How are you? You're in New York for a little bit for the...

105
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Girl Guide. Open it up for April and Grace.

106
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm here for no reason.

107
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,040
- He's just here to hang the hell out.

108
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:13,880
- Here to chill.

109
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,960
- He's here to hang the hell out.

110
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,600
- Which is more honorable.

111
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,080
- I'm here to be laid back.

112
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,880
- And then we're doing that,

113
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
and then I guess we also have to write

114
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,680
the hit song in an hour.

115
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,520
- Yes.

116
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,340
- Or we're gonna--

117
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,760
- Well, the time ticket is 56 minutes.

118
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,760
- Well, the problem is we're now writing

119
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,680
two different songs.

120
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,280
- It's New York City, we're just gonna dump you out

121
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,240
on the streets of Bushwick,

122
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,520
one of these gangs will kill you.

123
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,360
- That's right.

124
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,180
- Oh, man.

125
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:37,320
- You'll get knockout gamed with a bullet.

126
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,160
Pretty fast around here.

127
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,000
- They're gonna have a famous dance about you.

128
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,840
- Yeah, exactly.

129
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,040
Harlem Shake. Yeah.

130
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,480
The way I die is going to be like a meme.

131
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,480
The white boy wiggles.

132
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,480
I'm going to be like, "Eee!"

133
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:50,520
It's going to be pretty famous.

134
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,160
I don't know if you guys have heard of Mr.

135
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,040
Freeze either, but he's been on the loose here.

136
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:54,280
Yeah.

137
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,000
Really?

138
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,800
Yeah, it's been huge.

139
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,400
Pretty bad.

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,600
I'm going to get my ice kicked.

141
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,040
Fuck, Slenderman's around, Mr.

142
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Freeze.

143
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,760
Slenderman is not, he's not allowed in New York City, I don't think.

144
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:03,880
No.

145
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,360
Yeah.

146
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,280
No, he's like in the out...

147
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,240
Because he's too white.

148
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,880
Yeah, that's true.

149
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,520
Which is a crime in New York City now.

150
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:14,200
Patrick keeps talking about. What's that? Is that a picture of Mr. Freeze?

151
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,200
That's Mr. Freeze in New York.

152
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,200
That's good, yeah.

153
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,520
So, I mean, seriously, Los Angeles, New York, these are two completely different places.

154
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,480
Oh, oh, dude. You know the way they act, like, over there is, like, really different?

155
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,800
They honestly, yeah, they're always, um...

156
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,520
You ever tried to buy a salad in Los Angeles?

157
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,040
No, it's impossible.

158
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,160
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

159
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,840
Here it's only $32.

160
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:43,740
I do I actually do I have a specific salad memory of Los Angeles was when I got to LA and Caleb was already there

161
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:49,720
We went to I think we went to a sweet green. Yeah, it was nearby and kills like I want a salad and

162
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,080
They wouldn't let him pay in cash

163
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:02,960
They make it they charge you double if you don't tell them your astrology

164
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,040
Astrology yeah, I was paying in pennies, but they're rolled at least

165
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:13,960
Bank with those they honor it yeah, they don't even accept goats over there. No. It's fucked up here

166
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:19,440
You could said that you could definitely trade a goat to our boy over there on the corner. Oh absolutely

167
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,200
Absolutely, bro. I think that uh you know places should start accepting dowries again

168
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,280
Mmm. I think yeah, I'll still accept like when if you get married you can still get a dowry

169
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,760
There should be like you know what a dowry is get married tomorrow

170
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,880
Okay, it should also be a dowry to like hang out and be roommates as well

171
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:44,520
Who traditionally gets the dowry

172
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,400
The guy gets the girls

173
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,480
Right. Yeah, you're a girl's husband. So yeah

174
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:58,240
Women used to be so ugly that they would have to pay the dads have to pay for women

00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,340
Yeah, I given you this parcel in Norfolk

181
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:40,200
Nano man, oh whatever they're calling it these days. It's an iPhone that still has flappy bird on it

182
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,740
Yeah, or a fucking wedding ring. Yeah

183
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,600
Registry

184
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,320
Fucking things that you get like a wedding ring

185
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,320
or a name in marriage or a hand in marriage.

186
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
Bro, I do not want to give away my last name.

187
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,320
That shit's funny.

188
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,320
I will take my wife's name if she's taller than me.

189
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
I want to take my wife's first name.

190
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
That's the rule?

191
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Mm-hmm.

192
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
If she's taller than you, you take her name?

193
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
That's the rule.

194
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
What if she has a badass name like Stuart?

195
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
Or like Godzilla?

196
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Last name Stuart.

197
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,320
If his name was Patrick Stewart, that'd be awesome.

198
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Yeah, that's true.

199
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Damn, Patrick Stewart.

200
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Oh my God.

201
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Oh my God, okay.

202
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
If the name--

203
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:18,820
If the name...

204
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:22,620
Yo, if you married Patrick Stewart, you'd both be named Patrick Stewart.

205
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,620
Whoa.

206
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,620
That's a mindfuck of a term.

207
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,620
That's a huge mindfuck.

208
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,620
That's wild.

209
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,620
My mind just got fucking hit.

210
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,220
I think if the name was funny enough, I might take it.

211
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,220
What's the...

212
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
If my future wife...

213
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,220
Give an example of a name you would take that's funny.

214
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,220
Poop.

215
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,220
Poop, yeah, okay.

216
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,220
Fair enough.

217
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,220
You wouldn't be Patrick Poop.

218
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,220
Cause then you're Patrick Poop and your initials are Pee-Pee.

219
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,220
That's the name Poop, initials Pee-Pee.

220
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,220
See, see, that's why I'd take it.

221
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,220
You can't do that.

222
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,020
Keeping your middle name being Patrick Edward Poop.

223
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,280
(laughter)

224
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,620
- And I've become Pep.

225
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,940
- Pep, Pep, Peepee.

226
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,820
- My name's Patrick Poop, and everyone calls me Pep.

227
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,140
- Yeah, my name, yeah, I'm Patrick.

228
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,980
- I don't know why.

229
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,100
- My full name's Patrick Poop.

230
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,300
Actually, it's Patrick Edward Poop,

231
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:03,820
but you can call me Pep or Peepee.

232
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,940
- You gotta have a kid, Peepee Junior.

233
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,900
- Or just Mr. Poop.

234
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,820
- I did, I had a guidance counselor in seventh grade

235
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,440
who would call me Peepee.

236
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,280
- That's awesome.

237
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,100
- She called me Peepee because--

238
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,940
- She called you Peepee?

239
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,380
- She called me Peepee because my brother

240
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,060
named Paul and she was she would call me Paul and she's like you both have P names

241
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:27,300
PP I'm gonna call you PP and she was my best friend

242
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,700
How often were you talking to the guidance counselor?

243
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,700
Well I mean come on

244
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,700
Pretty much every day

245
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,700
Yeah well you didn't log hours in the counselor room

246
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,700
I'd fucking was raised there dude

247
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,700
Yeah dude they let you uh

248
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,700
if you didn't have a belt she would give you suspenders

249
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,700
cause she didn't want kids sagging their pants

250
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:51,260
I wonder if that's still a problem, because they had like a t-shirt and a pair of pants

251
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,300
that they would make you wear if you sagged your pants.

252
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
Yeah.

253
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,460
And they were fucked up.

254
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:59,580
This just reminded me of an insane tangentially related thing that happened to me yesterday.

255
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,580
Okay.

256
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,580
I was sagging.

257
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,060
I was sagging my pants.

258
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:07,020
No, I was at my mom's house, and she's a teacher.

259
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:11,380
She teaches fifth grade, she teaches at a middle school, and she told me, she was like,

260
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:15,300
the seventh and eighth graders this year are out of control. I was like what do

261
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,260
you mean like what could that possibly mean and she said that at the seventh

262
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,920
and eighth grade dance this year, they they like they were booing the

263
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,720
principal. That's the first thing she said, which I was like, okay, sure,

264
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,040
and then she said they were

265
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,320
just wait. They were they were crowd surfing at the dance and they also they

266
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,340
were breaking windows and they're running around the school and trying to

267
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,240
go in all the locked

268
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,960
last. It's over. Booing is such an adult thing to do. It's like you're at a

269
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,260
Rams game. She even in a separate conversation, like hours later, she was

270
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,460
like, "Oh yeah, also I forgot to tell you, the police had to come to the

271
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:00,480
reservoir because there were... 'Cause some of the seventh and eighth graders

272
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,340
started a fight club." And I was like, "Oh, that's crazy." And she was like,

273
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:08,480
"Yeah, there were 70 to 80 of them at the reservoir." And I was like, "What

274
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,520
you talking about? That's bigger than the one in the movie. 70 to 80,

275
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,320
what are you... There's no plus one. She's like, "No, I'm telling you

276
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,660
the truth." She was insistent that it was 70 to 80 kids having a

277
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,900
fight club at the reservoir. The police had to go to the reservoir.

278
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:28,160
It just sounds like you grew up in the '50s. Yeah. It sounds like you

279
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,960
live in fucking Pleasantville.

280
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:36,900
70 to 80... Can you imagine 70 to 80 male schoolers doing anything together?

281
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Oh my god, 40 separate kid fights happening at the same time.

282
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,900
They'll get to the reservoir.

283
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,900
She said that they brought furniture to sit on to watch each other fight.

284
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,900
That's so fucking sick, dude.

285
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,900
That's crazy.

286
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:48,900
That's incredible.

287
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
How long was it going on for?

288
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,900
I don't know any more details than what I just told you.

289
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
God damn.

290
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,900
I really would love to see video of that.

291
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,900
That has to be on the news, I think.

292
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
I know.

293
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
I didn't want to look it up because I didn't want it to be spoiled in case it was like,

294
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,900
"Oh, it's actually five kids."

295
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
Because I'm sure that's actually what happened.

296
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
That definitely is the truth.

297
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:04,900
If that wasn't a fight club, it was a--

298
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
I could see 20 kids.

299
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,740
- 20 kids.

300
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,580
- That would be on national,

301
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,580
if there was a 70 to 80 kid fight club.

302
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,840
- 70 to 80 kids in a fucking reservoir.

303
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,020
- 80 kids.

304
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,220
- How big is your middle school?

305
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:19,820
'Cause that's a significant portion of the middle school.

306
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,800
- Well, it's even, she said, oh my God,

307
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
she said it was--

308
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,460
- Was it boys and girls?

309
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,480
- No, she said, it wasn't even just like random kids.

310
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,500
It was like a subsection of like the chorus class.

311
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,240
Like there's a giant chorus class

312
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,540
and like half of the chorus kids left the class

313
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,980
and went to go have a fight club.

314
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
Holy fuck.

315
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:36,980
That's awesome.

316
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,780
The theater kids have discovered something.

317
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,780
That is so fucking cool.

318
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:43,180
It's so crazy, dude.

319
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,180
These kids are...

320
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,180
I need it to be real so bad.

321
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,180
Dude, the computer is making children crazy.

322
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,660
They really messed up when they said teachers can't hit kids anymore.

323
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,340
It really did mess up.

324
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,340
Oh, absolutely.

325
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,340
They need...

326
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,260
Is it for self-defense purposes at this point?

327
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Yeah, exactly.

328
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Yeah.

329
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:04,220
There's every day some video of a kid shoving paper in a teacher's ear.

330
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:11,860
why they should arm teachers. They always every time like every couple months

331
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:16,900
there's a video of like a substitute teacher like breaking down like like she

332
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,140
was the like the lead in like Jacob's Ladder. Yeah. She's like freaking the fuck out.

333
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:27,740
She's actually in hell. She's in hell because like a child called her like poop butt too many times.

334
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:32,620
No they're way meaner. They're way meaner. Kids genuinely are actually evil now.

335
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:38,420
Oh, I've heard some insane stories from my mom. The kids like they just actually

336
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:42,020
have turned evil because of phones. It's nuts. Like it's just a real life thing

337
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:46,420
that they're all villains. Yeah, but dude, their podcasts are gonna fuck

338
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:46,620
you.

339
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,420
So many good stories. Oh my God. Man, I remember we used to follow around our

340
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:54,620
teacher and just openly call him a pedophile all the time. We recorded him.

341
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,420
Well, that's normal. Kids are doing that forever. That's true. I stabbed my math

342
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,820
teacher in the leg. Yeah.

343
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,920
Yeah, they're telling stories on their podcast of like things they did when they were 12,

344
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,440
but they're being like, remember how awesome that was? Like how good we were at fucking

345
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,920
yeah, how good we were at killing that mailman.

346
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Yeah, we mentally broke down Mrs. Peterson. It was awesome.

347
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Dude, we tied so many women to train tracks. It was nuts.

348
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:23,920
You really do have to be like, like, it all is going towards like, we'll just have robot

349
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
teachers pretty soon. Oh yeah.

350
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,920
And it should be like that because there's no reason why these people who, they should

351
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,680
should have been nurses. I'll say that every single one of these teachers

352
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,840
should have been in nursing school and flunked out at the very least.

353
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:39,640
McDonald's. They don't need that. These teachers should work at McDonald's.

354
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:44,360
They should have from the from the first second. Everyone there should be like

355
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,840
like like in Israel like two years required McDonald's service. I'm pretty

356
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,600
impressed. Speaking of mass shootings, I'm pretty impressed that there's not any

357
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,720
mass shootings where the teacher is like snapping. Right. You would think that would happen all the time.

358
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,080
Well, they just teachers snap and like a more adult ways. They don't they don't that's true. They just like the type of

359
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:15,020
Yeah, mass shooters the type of person who decides to become a teacher their idea of snapping is like I

360
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:19,040
Called a kid stupid. I called the kid stupid or like I don't know

361
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,800
I just ate like I ate a whole cake in the car. I drove home at 60 miles per hour

362
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,440
Wow a teacher in a car just like putting out cigarettes into her wrist

363
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,640
Yeah, I had a teacher like that. She was pregnant and she was smoking while pregnant

364
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,200
She would always every I think that she was like

365
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,440
I think I would have been a pretty good grooming candidate for her because anytime I went on

366
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,240
Went on field trips all the kids would go on a bus

367
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,720
But me and one other kid would always ride with her in her car and she would yes

368
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,840
She would just like immediately start just like chain smoking. That's blowing it out the window while pregnant

369
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,280
I had a drunk teacher.

370
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,280
Like my first grade teacher was hammered.

371
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
All the time?

372
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,280
Yeah, my mom told me that recently.

373
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,080
They're like, yeah, because you didn't know when you were a kid?

374
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,080
I had no idea.

375
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,080
No, I just thought she was like sleepy.

376
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,080
Oh, yeah.

377
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,960
But no, my mom's like, yeah, she left halfway through the year.

378
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,680
It was like a Steve Blues clue situation.

379
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,560
Like, oh, she's actually going, you know, to go take care of her mom.

380
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,000
And it's like, no, she went to fucking rehab, you know?

381
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,200
So you realize that you drove her to that?

382
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,200
Oh, yeah.

383
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,400
I just want to make sure it's completely making fun of her cankles.

384
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,400
entirely your fault.

385
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Oh my god.

386
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Do you want to go to a special amusement park that only teachers can go to?

387
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
Wait, you made fun of her?

388
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Isn't cankles like kind of a

389
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
side effect of being an alcoholic too?

390
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Is it? Yeah. Maybe.

391
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Like a big red nose too?

392
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,400
It's a pre-existing condition if you're an alcoholic.

393
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
That's why Rudolph's nose was so red.

394
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,400
You think he was hit with the sauce?

395
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Fetal alcohol syndrome.

396
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,400
His mom smoked while he was in the womb.

397
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

398
00:16:53,400 --> 00:17:00,440
really snops yeah I remember schnapps was one of the first things I ever drank and

399
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,040
I was the peppermint one oh yeah that's shit is this is dr. right that's dr.

400
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:10,640
regular Cody we had cut oh yeah last week on on on set we brought through doing

403
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Yeah, I'm from Rhode Island.

404
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
Oh, okay.

405
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
So you had the same kind of fucking disgusting...

406
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
The McGillicuddy's is what

407
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,880
like literally only the worst

408
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
alcoholics buy that comes in a 10 pack.

409
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,880
It's one of those medicines.

410
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
Dr. McGillicuddy's apple pie

411
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
is like the first time.

412
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
If somebody is buying that at the liquor store,

413
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
you know they have a problem.

414
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
Someone gave me one after a show in Boston, I think.

415
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Oh yeah, someone gave you a shot of the

416
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
peppermint one.

417
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,520
peppermint. It's pretty brutal. It's all like the it's the most dangerous liquor

418
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,040
because it doesn't taste like anything but candy. Yeah I don't think it tastes

419
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,640
like candy at all. Well that's the peppermint one but the apple pie

420
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,400
McGillicuddy's, it tastes like liquid candy. I don't believe you. I really don't believe you.

421
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:09,560
No that's what an alcoholic says about it. I don't think that's true at all.

422
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,240
Also a guy who can who can draw into mind different flavors of

423
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:21,400
Yeah, somebody after our show in Boston a couple years ago was like, "Hey, try this."

424
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,320
And it took me, I think it took me an hour to work up the courage to drink like a stranger's

425
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
liquor.

426
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,120
It's a very Boston thing to do is to just to be randomly, like a water bottle full of

427
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
vodka.

428
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
It's like a given a villainous potion.

429
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Yeah.

430
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,480
Like an evil elixir that gets passed, those get passed around a lot.

431
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,280
They acted like they were doing me a huge favor.

432
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Yeah.

433
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
It's like a fucking 50 cent shot.

434
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:42,040
That's literally what happened on the movie.

435
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:47,040
We had somebody who's like, I got we got like we got nice whiskey for like the crew and stuff.

436
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,800
And then fucking this guy Pat from the North Shore came in.

437
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,520
He's like, and I brought Cuddy.

438
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,080
Oh, yeah, dude. Yeah.

439
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,640
Can you buy it outside of New England?

440
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,680
Yeah. Yeah. I miss drinking disgusting shit.

441
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,280
Oh, dude. You ever do like the like I'll have a four loco every six months.

442
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,960
Vodka from like a gas station.

443
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,560
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

444
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,520
Did you have a Zanka vodka?

445
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Zanka? No, we had Ruby and we had Popov, obviously.

446
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
Mine was Popov, yeah.

447
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Yeah, Zanka was a... I thought that it was like a widely New England thing. I knew that it was like...

448
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
You're a widely New England thing, come on.

449
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:32,800
I knew it was produced in New England and then I found out that Zanka is a vodka brand that only exists in my hometown.

450
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,800
What? That's not even possible.

451
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
It's made by some...

452
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
Is it also like a plastic thing?

453
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
It's in a plastic bag.

454
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
It's in a plastic bag.

455
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
It's like a craft.

456
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,800
My town is known for artisanal craft

457
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
liquors.

458
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,800
Zanka.

459
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Right in a grocery bag. That sounds not that bad.

460
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
I mean it is.

461
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I've had, they had pink lemonade

462
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Zanka. There was two Zanka flavors.

463
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,800
It was that one and pink lemonade. And they

464
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,800
taste like gasoline.

465
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
I think they only sell it in

466
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,800
or like all New Hampshire liquor stores?

467
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Our regional thing was mostly fake LSD.

468
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,800
We didn't have a lot of regional liquor.

469
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
Really?

470
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Yeah, there was a lot of fake LSD that you could buy.

471
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,800
And it was like hometown pride kind of thing.

472
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,800
It's like, "Well, you gotta do it."

473
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
It's like McGillicuddy's. It's like, "Well, come on, you gotta do this."

474
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
Yeah, we had one.

475
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
2-5-I, that's gonna be good for you.

476
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,800
We had a lot of K2.

477
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Oh, yeah.

478
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
Floating around.

479
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Oh, yeah. I've accidentally done that before.

480
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Dude, I smoked, so the first time I ever smoked weed was K2.

481
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,800
And then for an entire summer, all me and my friends smoked was K2.

482
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,640
K2 thinking it was real weed. Yeah been there bud. Yeah and so at the end of the

483
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,280
summer finally one of us was like I'm in hell all the time yeah and then

484
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:46,680
everybody else is like okay yeah this does suck. Yeah yeah. Who even made why

485
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,600
would you make K2 man? It's an evil it's the most evil thing in the world.

486
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,760
It's an incense right? Is it? Or do they have to legally sell it as an

487
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,680
incense? Are they legally? Yeah because we were buying it on like a farmers market.

488
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,360
Yeah legally yeah they sell it as like potpourri. At a farmers market

489
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,360
I got kindly old lady yeah

00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
- Onion.

510
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,780
- He, so that's obviously a reverse engineered from the name.

511
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,800
- Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.

512
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,360
You have to have the name work backwards.

513
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,840
- You start with the onion, what could that be?

514
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
Honey and onion.

515
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,040
- Not even like an attempt to like caramelize it

516
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:42,880
or anything, just what--

517
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,640
- Not even an attempt to caramelize it.

518
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,440
(laughing)

519
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,000
- Also one of our last days living together,

520
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,640
he ate a tomato like it was an apple.

521
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,480
(laughing)

522
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,300
- That's okay. - I've seen that.

523
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,520
If you do that with a, old ladies like to do that.

524
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,720
My mom does that actually.

525
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:58,520
I've only seen that happen in Boondock Saints 2.

526
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,920
All Saints Day.

527
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,320
All Saints Day.

528
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,000
Their dad eats a--

529
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,480
he cuts like-- he scores it and then just puts salt in it

530
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,720
and just eats it straight up.

531
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,840
And I was like, I wonder what that's like.

532
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,480
Did you do it?

533
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,280
I ate it and I was just like, I'm not--

534
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,160
that's not for me.

535
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,040
It's not for me.

536
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,320
Also, the tomato wasn't ripe.

537
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,240
And my dad got really mad because he just put it--

538
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,760
Just wasted a tomato.

539
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,360
You put it back with a bite out of it?

540
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,800
Yeah.

541
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,320
- Oh my God. - That's like 12.

542
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,160
- What the hell's wrong with you?

543
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,000
- 12. - You gotta stop doing

544
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,880
the things that you saw in Boondock Saints 2 All Saints Day.

545
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,040
(laughing)

546
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,400
- I gotta, it's something I haven't grown out of.

547
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,240
(laughing)

548
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,000
- I got all the tattoos that they have.

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,800
(laughing)

550
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,800
- That movie makes being Catholic look so sick.

551
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,760
Is it really that cool?

552
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,600
- It's that cool. - It really is.

553
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,360
- Jesus Christ. - We're all like that.

554
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,520
- Yeah. - I need to do that, man.

555
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,600
- We all know the Shepherds We Shall Be speech.

556
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,360
We all have like a gay scene in prison.

557
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Y'all have some cool ass movies, man.

558
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,360
Spotlight's cool, though.

559
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
Spotlight's badass, dude.

560
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,360
Is it that awesome to be Catholic?

561
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
It's always solving mysteries.

562
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
That's cool, man.

563
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
Catholicism is like 20% solving mysteries.

564
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,360
That's awesome, dude.

565
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,360
We don't even have a lot of

566
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
cool Protestant guys.

567
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,360
They're all like founding fathers who

568
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
had syphilis and died. Catholics really

569
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,360
they've been a

570
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,360
finger on the pulse for a long time now.

571
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Yeah

572
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:32,560
We won the Crusades that's pretty fucking cool. That's it was there a winner declared. I think it was us right no

573
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:38,360
It's pretty bad what yeah, I think they got owned yeah

574
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:49,200
Make that clear the they got beat so bad in the Crusades that they said all right

575
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,000
We all of our adults didn't work. Let's send children

576
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,440
And they did it they didn't an army of like kids to go fight in the holy shit those fifth graders

577
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:08,600
Yeah, yeah kids are also taller now, yeah, yeah, yeah, but the Crusades they yeah, so the Christians lost

578
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:12,520
They of course yeah, cuz otherwise the they'd all all those countries would be like Catholic now, right?

579
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,840
I feel the first the first crusade

580
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:20,440
I believe what happened was because there's like six over the course of 200 years and the first crusade I think worked

581
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,840
because they didn't tell the Muslims they didn't tell the

582
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:32,120
Abbasid Empire or whatever that they were coming and then they just so imagine that you just are hanging out and then one day like

583
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:38,860
600 9/11 all at once in your in your country. You're like Jesus. What the hell are these guys?

584
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,260
I think we brought 4,000 boats and four of our kings

585
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:50,620
And they're like oh god so that one worked and then they got Saladin like a hundred years later to come and rally the troops in

586
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,620
He's the kingdom of heaven guy

587
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,620
He's the kingdom of heaven guy

588
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,620
How do you know all this stuff?

589
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,620
What point did Aragorn come into this?

590
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,620
I've got a beautiful mom

591
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
Are you a vlog brother?

592
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
Are you a vlog brother?

593
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
Like you're one of those guys who does a crash course for me?

594
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Yeah I do, I do

595
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
He does six hours about

596
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,620
You just crush it

597
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,820
a little bit about everything no I just watched Kingdom of Heaven yeah that's it

598
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:20,660
just the extended version. The salad Dean uh was that Paula Deen's nemesis?

599
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:26,140
Paula Deen's vegan nemesis. Her Wario yeah. Yeah it could be that. That works.

600
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:30,840
It's Paula Deen she's made out of salad yeah yeah yeah what would she say she

601
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:35,100
would say she wouldn't say hey y'all what would she say then she'd say don't eat

602
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:53,580
there'd be it yeah I have a heart and a brain I don't know why God created I

603
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:59,820
think she probably going oh she might be sad

604
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,820
I have my life and it's my birthday!

605
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,820
I was born today!

606
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,820
She'd be like, "Hey Morty, I'm Saladin."

607
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
No, she'd say, "I'm Saladin."

608
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,820
Not salad!

609
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,820
She might say that to Morty.

610
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,820
I guess if Morty was around, yeah.

611
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,820
You guy wouldn't...asshole.

612
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,820
She wouldn't just say that, but she would say it to Morty.

613
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Is it true that she had a slave-themed wedding?

614
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,820
I think so.

615
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,820
Was she the one who said that?

616
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,820
Yeah, she said the N-word too, right?

617
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Yeah, she did.

618
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:30,820
That's one thing, but having a slave-themed wedding is so...

619
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,820
I mean, that's definitely two things.

620
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,820
They're also, I think, kind of similar things.

621
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
What the hell?

622
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:36,820
Oh, man.

623
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,820
No, you just searched "slave-themed wedding" on Photoshoot.

624
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,820
We don't need... This is not... By the way, this is bad taste, I'll say.

625
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:43,820
This is crazy.

626
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
I'll be the first to say.

627
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:45,820
Yeah, this is not good.

628
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
This is definitely in bad taste.

629
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
I don't think this is glorious.

630
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,820
No, we want to see the Paula Deen slave thing.

631
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,820
Search "Paula Deen wedding."

632
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,820
Didn't Paula Deen, didn't like her... She did like a "I love Lucy" costume.

633
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,820
Oh, yeah, that's...

634
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,820
Oh, that was her wedding. Oh, my God.

635
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:01,780
Beautiful day there. I love Lucy costume and her like husband was in like brown face or so

636
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:08,420
Yeah, that's all Desi Arnaz wasn't even like yeah, that's like 10% breath. Yeah, he didn't have to do it

637
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:15,120
Paula Dean, okay, maybe I'm wrong. Yeah, that doesn't look very I mean, well, I got that can you be a butler?

638
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:21,260
That's a kind of slave. Yeah. Hey, hey, hey every every every wedding is a slave theme wedding, but it has a husband in it

639
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:25,940
Yes, sir. All right. Absolutely. I was thinking about at speed butlers and slaves

640
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:31,540
Alfred has to be a slave right?

641
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,540
No. Yes. He's gotta be a slave.

642
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,540
He just hangs out.

643
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,540
If you were a butler you would not be doing all that shit.

644
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,540
No he just hangs out in the house.

645
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
No he's in love with Bruce.

646
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,540
He's got an electric shock collar on or something.

647
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:45,540
He's just there to play his video games and stuff

648
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,540
and just hang out and eat his food.

649
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,540
They made a TV show about young Alfred.

650
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
Yeah. About him being hot and sexy

651
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,540
and a cool sunbite.

652
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,540
It's called Pennyworth.

653
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:02,340
It's called Pennyworth, the origin of Batman's Butler, and I keep getting ads for it.

654
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,700
And it's like, this is the funniest new show I've ever seen that they're making the show.

655
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
That makes no sense.

656
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
And it's on season four.

657
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,660
It was like the ad I saw was like season four premiere.

658
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:17,220
That'd be funny if every Michael Caine movie was a movie about Alfred.

659
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,860
Just had an awesome life, too.

660
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,300
That's got to be the number one Batman character to spin off.

661
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,580
Like, yeah, I want to learn more about Alfred.

662
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:29,820
right yeah no no cool no cool villains no cool like there are a million cooler gay

663
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:38,260

666
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,060
And you're in Batman. And I'm in Batman. And you work for free. And I work for free.

667
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:01,060
Yeah. And I'm gonna clean this place spotless after this.

668
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:05,060
You're gonna figure out that mess over there. No one can see it.

669
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:09,060
That's some good radio, Pat. Yeah. My bad. We even have video now and you still

670
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,060
fuck it up somehow. You found the one thing in the point 2 that's not on camera. Point out of frame to nothing

671
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:17,060
interesting at all. I can't even make out what those items are. Yep.

672
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:21,060
We're just continuing to talk about it. Well, it is an interesting thing

673
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:24,340
to look at. And if you get items at home, yeah, look up.

674
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,740
Yeah, it's this.

675
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,540
And basically that.

676
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,740
This is what it looks like.

677
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,740
Looks good.

678
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,300
These are all of Cameron's drawings.

679
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,220
These are maybe a little too organized for what's over.

680
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,260
That's more like it.

681
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:35,260
That's definitely what it looks like.

682
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
That tube for sure.

683
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,260
That tube is awesome.

684
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
There is a tube right there.

685
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,660
We do have a couple of tubes over there.

686
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:44,940
This does look like those fucking like, like AI generated, like, mess images.

687
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,460
No, it doesn't. I can tell what everything is.

688
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:46,860
Yeah.

689
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,220
Well, let's do it.

690
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,220
It does say mess by.

691
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:53,000
That's a tube, that's a can, that's a mug, that's a bucket, that's crazy frog, that's

692
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
a Best Buy bag.

693
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
Okay, you know what this looks more like is I Spy.

694
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Oh my god!

695
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
I love I Spy.

696
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Oh my god!

697
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,780
Yeah, I see a mug there, and you know what else I see?

698
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,780
What?

699
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,780
I see an ugly mug right there.

700
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,780
Oh, where?

701
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,780
Oh, the one on the table?

702
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,780
Where?

703
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,780
Oh, the one on the table.

704
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,780
It isn't pretty.

705
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,780
I don't think it's that ugly.

706
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,780
I mean, it's not that bad.

707
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,420
It has a bunch of coffee words on it.

708
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:17,860
It says, uh, shit, no, sure, it says cappuccino right there.

709
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:24,020
And it says mocha, okay coffee, it's a $2 mug we have a damn I take it back. That's a cool

710
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,960
so I

711
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,840
Mean how's the trip been so far? I guess it's been cool. Yeah. Yeah, I'm great. I made it made a Chinese connection

712
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,040
Yeah, that's good. Yeah

713
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:40,840
That's what I call having Chinese food for lunch. Oh calling him Chinese. Can did you go?

714
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:45,100
Yeah, mom I did when I went to we had to stop at an Old Navy so they could poop

715
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:48,780
I had a poop emergency. Yeah, the Old Navy's let you do do in there now?

716
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:53,900
Yeah, really did the lady is a really nice old they all log the bathroom for me. Yeah. Whoa, they let me then

717
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Let me just baller status. Yeah

718
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:58,780
Let me in the back room

719
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:05,500
You're like a social engineer went behind the velvet rope thing. Jesus. Yeah, I got to see where the employees poop

720
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,860
I got a bottle service

721
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:13,020
Let me into this thing called the fitting room. Yeah

722
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,020
The weirdest bathroom I've ever seen.

723
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:17,020
One of these new...

724
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,020
Frisbee Fringe.

725
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,020
The mirrors is a little bit weird.

726
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,020
I don't want to watch myself poop on the floor.

727
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
They gave me a tag

728
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
that said number 2 because I was going to change.

729
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

730
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
I don't know who the guy doing number 6 is, but he's having fun in there.

731
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
And the toilet paper

732
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,020
hook, there's a bunch of shirts.

733
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,020
Oh, well.

734
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,020
They say like a wipe with a shirt.

735
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:41,020
Well, yeah, it's an old name. They got so many shirts.

736
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:44,480
- I was on my ass with these guys, so many of them.

737
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,680
- And the window on the door wasn't working.

738
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,920
(laughing)

739
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,220
- So you shit there.

740
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,600
- I shit there and then I ate Chinese food

741
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,300
and then I went to three restaurants to try and get dinner

742
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,420
'cause I'm the most persecuted man in the world.

743
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,260
Bad things have ever happened to me.

744
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,220
- They just didn't have dinner?

745
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,500
- No, no, one of them was closed for--

746
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,600
- We're only doing breakfast right now.

747
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,440
- We're at a dinner, man.

748
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,000
- No, we only have clothes.

749
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:09,980
(laughing)

750
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:12,980
You want lunch maybe? Maybe I could get lunch for you, dude.

751
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:17,980
No, no, no. I have certain codes for each food item. A turkey can only be lunch.

752
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:21,980
You can't serve me turkey after 4pm. It can only be a lunch.

753
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
What do you do on Thanksgiving then?

754
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
Um, I don't eat.

755
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,980
That's an early dinner. Thanksgiving dinner is 2 or 3pm.

756
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,980
Late turkey, you're crazy.

757
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
We do 2.30 dinner.

758
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,980
You're courageous.

759
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,980
Are you calling the Senate family crazy?

760
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
I'm a 2.30 dinner fan.

761
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:35,980
I am.

762
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Those might be the last words you ever say.

763
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:44,260
Might as well be the loony bin lock them up. I don't know how you guys cook that turkey with the straightjackets on you fucking crazy nuts

764
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:49,500
You're a nutcase your mom's a nutcase your dad's a three years old, dude. Oh you have

765
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:57,980
That is scary yeah old man strength is the scariest thing in the world you the guy they're so strong everywhere, but their back

766
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:04,100
Uh-huh yeah back. Yeah, pleated kill. Yeah, it's like the you know shadow of Colossus when you fight your dad as a kid

767
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:11,120
You fought your dad, that's weird man. Yeah, it's really weird. Yeah, you guys have such a great

768
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:15,540
I feel like most people who they're like I fought my dad. It's because like they have a really bad relationship

769
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,780
No, I have such a good relationship

770
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:21,900
No, I just like I've tried to fight him one day

771
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:30,500
But like in my brain of fight every fight I've ever been in the end goal has been like either I kill this guy or

772
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:35,220
This guy kills me. So when you're going in with your dad, you're not thinking like it wasn't respect kill my dad

773
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:41,420
And you and he's like he definitely lost respect for you. Yeah, you're sparring like the pink panther and the little guy

774
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,540
Yeah, it's like doing like tricks on each other

775
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:46,900
Jumping off his back like matrix

776
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:52,580
I'm like trying to walk walk up his back and fucking a prodigy smack my bitch

777
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:57,340
I think that's my problem is that I don't think you fought him. I think you wrestled your dad

778
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,200
You are we were we were mad at each other. No, I was very young why not

779
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,860
Probably I was four

780
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:19,500
Okay, something like that no my dad always was offering he's like, oh you want to fight you wanna fight right now

781
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,060
You know really that's a dad like I think every father

782
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:28,620
I'm gonna shit relationship with my dad if you try to try to your ass never one if your dad hasn't tried to fight you

783
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,940
you have

784
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,940
You have a bad relationship

785
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:37,220
Means he sees you as vermin. You're beneath his shoes. Not even worth his knuckles.

786
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:41,980
Because one day he knows, he knows one day this dude's gonna terrorize me.

787
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,860
Yeah. He's gonna take me down. Yeah. You gotta run up to score before he... I was nothing to him.

788
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:52,660
He's like why would I, you don't try to fight a mosquito. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You don't swerve out of the way of a bug on the highway.

789
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:57,940
Yeah, no. You just hit the windshield. You just go. Not too worried about it. Just goo up the fucking windshield, man.

790
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,080
You ever try to fight your dad?

791
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,680
I threw a lamp at him once.

792
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,680
Yeah.

793
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,680
Yeah.

794
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,680
Wow.

795
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:04,680
Okay.

796
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,680
That was a dare.

797
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Yeah, it was.

798
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
It was.

799
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,680
Yeah.

800
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,680
And it didn't go far.

801
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
The lamp did not go far.

802
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
You had to unplug it first.

803
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,680
Yeah, exactly.

804
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

805
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,680
Quick to chase back.

806
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Yeah, and I went to school and the next day I was like, "Hey guys, guess what I did?"

807
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,920
And they were like, "What the hell?"

808
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
I was one of those evil kids.

809
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:21,920
Yeah.

810
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Yeah.

811
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,920
But not with the teachers?

812
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:24,920
Or just...

813
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,920
No, with the teachers.

814
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,940
I was getting like during during the period of my life when I was getting the most savagely bullied

815
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,700
I decided to get revenge on my school

816
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:44,740
I went to several classrooms that I had classes in

817
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:53,960
Took the computer mouses they have that little ball inside them you unhook the bottom and I just stole like nine of those

818
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,960
Sick.

819
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,960
Oh man.

820
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:59,000
And then they found it was me pretty quickly because they were like, "Who's the most insane

821
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
student that we have?"

822
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Yeah.

823
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Who's the guy whose pockets are filled with balls that'll clack in?

824
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
Who's the juggler?

825
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
Who's the one with the big puffy cheeks?

826
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Wait a minute.

827
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
Imagine that.

828
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
This guy with the big puffy cheeks.

829
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,160
Chipped cheeks walking around.

830
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,040
How autistic do you have to be to be like, "I'm going to do that instead of just kill

831
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,040
everybody."

832
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,040
Yeah.

833
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Thank God.

834
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm going to destroy them with their most vulnerable claims.

835
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,600
They'll never think of this one.

836
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
They'll never see it coming.

837
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Yeah.

838
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,600
The reason that now there are so many school shooters is they invented trackpads.

839
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,600
You can't do that anymore.

840
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,600
Every single one of them has been like, "I know what I'm gonna do."

841
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,600
"God damn it! This makes me want to shoot a mice!"

842
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Oh, fuck.

843
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,600
Well, you can do the tape thing with laser mice.

844
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
What?

845
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,600
You can just put a piece of scotch tape over the laser.

846
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Like a clear piece of tape.

847
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,600
It's not comparable, because you can just take the tape off.

848
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,600
Yeah, but you can take the tape off.

849
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
If you have the balls, you have them forever.

850
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,600
You have to order a replacement part.

851
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,780
- Mr. Piva from your cold dead aims.

852
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,480
- Mr. Piva called the IT guy.

853
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,520
I did that to him.

854
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,360
- Really?

855
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,180
- Yeah.

856
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,020
- He got fucking owned.

857
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:01,480
- We didn't have class for like 20 minutes

858
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,720
because he was like, don't know, my mouse is broken.

859
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,560
- Any way that you could like,

860
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,400
when somebody would like spill a drink in the middle,

861
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,080
like oh fuck, that was good dude.

862
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,520
Just huge delay.

863
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:14,840
Wait for somebody to come in, nobody's paying attention.

864
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,360
- We set a timer, he had like, it was the science room

865
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:19,680
and we set a timer on,

866
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,440
Like he had one of those timers. It's like, okay, the lab starts now.

867
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,840
And then like just sets the thing. That's a really loud buzzer.

868
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,000
And then we just set it to like 30 minutes and he didn't notice.

869
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,320
So in the middle of class, the buzzer went off and then he looked at all of us.

870
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,880
We all started laughing and he went, is that funny to you?

871
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,360
It's like, yeah, yeah, it obviously is. But like, that's not, I don't just,

872
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,640
it's just a buzzer. Just like go back to teaching.

873
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,760
It's always so shocking when a teacher for real yells.

874
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,280
My elementary school music teacher was the one who blew up the most.

875
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,300
Like he was like one of those guys that like from like the 1800s

876
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:00,940
who just didn't die like they just one of the last one of the last guy.

877
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,540
Yeah, he was one of those things was he was like one of those guys.

878
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,620
It was 200 year old.

879
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,220
He's never had like a teacher who's like a vampire. Yeah.

880
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:13,320
He's always doing those dastardly vampire things going like that.

881
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,260
Yeah, he can only have class at night.

882
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

883
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,440
But he would drop books, he would hold a really big textbook and drop it.

884
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
That is like a 200 year old.

885
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:30,400
And then he would scream and yell, and then get this, he was one of the last guys who

886
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,960
would make you stay after and write a sentence 150 times.

887
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,960
He did a Bart?

888
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,760
I had to do that in like 1999.

889
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:43,560
Oh fuck, you got Barted.

890
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,760
I will not disrupt the class.

891
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
Jock?

892
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,020
Or no I had to write it in pen like a hundred and fifty times

893
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,160
And like that you and he ran up a tab on people like like they would do it

894
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,360
He would there be like three of us like every class

895
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:04,120
Like three of us would do some kind of like infraction and get barred it like every fucking class for elementary school

896
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:10,240
Music Wow like this is a recorder that you don't know how to yeah, right they make a school shooter, right?

897
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,240
I will not shoot up

898
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,520
Yeah, that's what they do in Guantanamo Bay.

899
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,780
It is basically hypnosis that they're trying to put you under. I think it might work.

900
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:25,120
I think they're just trying to hurt your hand. Yeah, they just it hurts so bad your hand is like

901
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:32,480
Yeah, I think how Pablo Picasso felt doing all those paintings. Yeah, his hand was hurting pretty bad. Yeah, that's how Jackson

902
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,040
That's why Jackson Pollock. He just gave up. That's why his shit is so messed up.

903
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:42,160
Yeah, my brain hurts pretty bad looking at all this Pablo Picasso stuff. I'm like, that's right. Yeah, no thanks.

904
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Make it make sense to me.

905
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,160
Put the eyes in the right place.

906
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Make it a xenomorph.

907
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
Try a photo, fucking idiot.

908
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
How about a nice house with a flower

909
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
and a fence and a smiling dog with a

910
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
smile face. That's what I like.

911
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,160
What about an old man with a newspaper?

912
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Art is not for you, Mr.

913
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
Picasso, because this bullshit looks like

914
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
a whole lot of nothing.

915
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Back in my day, we didn't have these

916
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
fricking guys like Picasso.

917
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
We had Rothko doing

918
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:17,160
blue and purple. I love that one. And that was it. You didn't need any fancy expressions,

919
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:25,040
faces, or squares. I thought Rothko really went downhill when he did blue, purple, and

920
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,800
orange. Yeah, that was a little fruity to me. And white was just lazy. He didn't even

921
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:38,120
paint that shit. But his red, oh my god. That was fire. That was so swag. That was when he

922
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:50,400
is

923
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,920
home the entire time. It's just like a giant ramp.

924
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:59,220
I just feel like, I don't know what it is about a museum. Maybe I have to take an Adderall

925
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,220
before.

926
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,220
I don't think it's about a museum. I would say it's a view more than a museum.

927
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,160
Yeah, I think I have to take an Adderall to go to a museum.

928
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,400
Well, all that shit already happened, dude. You gotta be thinking about the future.

929
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,400
Exactly.

930
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,400
I'm not sucking the piss.

931
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,880
What about like a museum of stuff that's gonna happen?

932
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,880
They already have a museum of the future.

933
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,880
They have that.

934
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,880
Yeah.

935
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,880
Yeah?

936
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:14,880
Yeah.

937
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:15,880
Okay, well, I wanna go.

938
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:16,880
Apple Store.

939
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,880
That's the Apple Store.

940
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:18,880
That's the museum right there.

941
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,880
That's the museum of the future.

942
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,920
I remember when we were on tour, I skipped the CIA museum or whatever the fuck you guys

943
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,920
went to.

944
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:28,760
It was the natural history of Smithsonian.

945
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,760
Yeah, I skipped the CIA museum.

946
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,260
It's as tailored for a little kid, like a little boy as possible.

947
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,880
It literally is the little kid museum.

948
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,880
It's dinosaurs.

949
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:38,880
It's going to be so crazy boring.

950
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,880
You know that dinosaur?

951
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:41,920
Yeah, he was CIA the whole time.

952
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,280
Too academic for Pat.

953
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,240
So he went and he skated a fountain for about four hours.

954
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,700
We made friends with some cool eight year olds though.

955
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,300
I saw bones, so what'd you do, asshole?

956
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,300
I saw fucking bones.

957
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,300
I saw bones, bones wheels.

958
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,540
This guy was riding bones wheels.

959
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,540
Shut up, Joe.

960
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:58,540
Is that a skeleton?

961
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,860
No, it's a company.

962
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,700
But the National History Museum was sick.

963
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,700
Yeah.

964
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,700
Yeah, it was so tight.

965
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,700
It was so awesome.

966
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,780
Somebody told me that they were going to tear down Pulaski, so I went.

967
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:10,780
No.

968
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:11,780
How do you tear it?

969
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,780
It was flat.

970
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:13,780
You're going to build something on it?

971
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:14,780
Yes.

972
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:15,780
Good.

973
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,780
Well, they're tearing it down because of all that stuff he did in the '70s.

974
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:17,780
Yeah, I don't even think he skated.

975
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,780
I don't even think he skated. Why did they name it after him?

976
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Guys, I got a skate park.

977
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,780
That space would be much better served by a McDonald's that was open one hour per month.

978
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,780
That would be an upgrade.

979
00:43:29,780 --> 00:43:32,780
That's what Roman Polanski should do, because he wants to come back here.

980
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:36,780
No, he should just start like, every once in a while, you should be like sitting on a park bench

981
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,780
and be like, "Wow, this is so nice." Right on the plaque.

982
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,780
Yeah, yeah.

983
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,780
Paid for by Roman Polanski, right?

984
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,780
People start being like, "Whoa, that's a nice bench."

985
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,620
Or like you're in the office and it's like, hey, a bunch of free pizzas got delivered.

986
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,120
Yeah.

987
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:54,660
I'll never tell.

988
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:01,060
Everyone eating it and trying to put it must be like Robert Polanski or something.

989
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:01,940
Yeah, there's no way he was.

990
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,440
No way.

991
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,540
And it was a good pizza.

992
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:06,980
Yeah, just from Blaze.

993
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:14,300
He got his 20 just plain cheese pizzas from Blaze.

994
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:17,500
The most expensive way to do a pizza.

995
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:19,300
Made no sense at all.

996
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:23,220
TikTok, do you guys know who the new Blaze pizza spokesman is?

997
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,700
Well, he's got a bad past, OK?

998
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,220
Listen up.

999
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,260
The idea of going to Blaze and going through the whole line

1000
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:37,980
and looking at everything, be like, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1001
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:39,420
I think I'm allergic to that.

1002
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:46,320
going all the way back to the weight yet she's a red sauce please no no

1003
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:51,980
sauce no bread and see so they made my they had to make my pizza three times

1004
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,900
because I kept putting it in the oven and then it would just explode and I

1005
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,200
there for like 45 minutes were you getting TNT on it yes I was getting a

1006
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:07,460
big black bomb yeah I thought it was an olive yeah can I have that olive with a

1007
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:15,220
fuse. It was not good. That fizzing olive was delicious. That's so crazy. I've not been to

1008
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:19,140
Blaze Pizza in probably four years. I've never been to a Blaze Pizza. You got to check it out.

1009
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:24,820
Dude, LeBron is a stakeholder. Yeah. So you're supporting the go. Incredible. Yeah, I got to

1010
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,940
support. Guess what? Unlimited toppings. Yeah. Really? And get this too, the pizza, it's not a

1011
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:34,900
big pizza. No. It's a small one that only you can eat. It's a personal pizza. It's only for you.

1012
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:39,340
That's good. I hate sharing. It's like a diet sex. Just you. Just you and that pizza.

1013
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:43,180
That's good dining. It's a good dining alone experience. It is. There was a lot of

1014
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:47,460
people at that Blaze, like a lot of old men in Pasadena eating Blaze pizza by themselves.

1015
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:52,140
There's the Blaze in the in City Place in Boston. That was next to the Halal Guys.

1016
00:45:52,140 --> 00:46:00,100
And I, dude, I'm just, I want to go to Halal Guys. I had Halal Guys in Los Angeles when it opened.

1017
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:09,540
horrific yeah it's a food snub yeah yeah I only like escargot okay so when you're

1018
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:16,580
at the Chinese food place what are you ordering I got a cumin lamb spicy

1019
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,140
- Isn't a lamb a child animal?

1020
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:31,980
- Yeah. - Yes.

1021
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:32,820
- Okay. - Yes.

1022
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:33,820
- That's so fucked up. - Oh shit.

1023
00:46:33,820 --> 00:46:35,620
- Yeah, you wanna think about that one a little more?

1024
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,580
- He said, "Give me the youngest one you have."

1025
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,420
(laughing)

1026
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,980
- What is the youngest food?

1027
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:40,980
(laughing)

1028
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,580
- Do you have any like, uh--

1029
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:44,980
- Which food didn't wanna die the worst?

1030
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:47,020
- I would like to have the youngest food,

1031
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,740
the youngest meat that you have,

1032
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:49,780
the flesh of the youngest animal,

1033
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,100
and also the spice that sounds most like semen.

1034
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,540
(laughing)

1035
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,380
- What is the animal that had--

1036
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,220
- What other combination you could whip up for me here?

1037
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,060
- That had the most head up.

1038
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:57,900
You want to--

1039
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,860
Who's the most scared?

1040
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,660
We don't have spermie duckling anymore,

1041
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,740
so you're gonna have to settle for--

1042
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:02,660
That's how I feel about it.

1043
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:04,380
Veal is like a little freaky to me,

1044
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:05,940
just because it's like, dude,

1045
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:08,300
that cow would have made a great,

1046
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,420
I mean, it could have been a great man.

1047
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:10,260
That cow could have jumped over the moon.

1048
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:11,820
Could have cured cow cancer.

1049
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,220
Yeah, it could have gotten older,

1050
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:14,580
it could have done a lot of stuff.

1051
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,420
It is so--

1052
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:18,220
I mean, what happened if they killed the fucking,

1053
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,540
the cheese cow?

1054
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:22,220
You know, the one with the little circular one?

1055
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:23,140
Oh, the baby bell lady?

1056
00:47:23,140 --> 00:47:24,620
What if they killed her when she was a holly?

1057
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:25,740
Exactly.

1058
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,740
Everything would be different.

1059
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:28,980
But then, you know, could have been a cow

1060
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,220
sort of Hitler situation.

1061
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:33,020
Maybe you're stopping by doing a veal.

1062
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,660
Yeah, it's not that bad of an idea.

1063
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:35,340
It's crazy that the-

1064
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,820
I would cook and eat baby Hitler.

1065
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,020
Yeah.

1066
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,020
I mean, why not?

1067
00:47:39,020 --> 00:47:40,820
If you're going to kill him already, you

1068
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:41,820
might as well eat him.

1069
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,300
I would put white sauce on baby Hitler at the

1070
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:46,300
Chinese place.

1071
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,060
You might as well do whatever you want to the

1072
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:50,060
baby.

1073
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:51,460
You're turning him into poop.

1074
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,740
Yeah.

1075
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,740
That's mad disrespectful.

1076
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,380
That's mad disrespectful to the ultimate hater.

1077
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,220
Except his bones, he was kind of the ultimate hater.

1078
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,820
I would digest his bones easily.

1079
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,380
Yeah, he had very gelatinous bones.

1080
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,220
Yeah.

1081
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:05,040
He's germy.

1082
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,940
And I just have a good bone stomach.

1083
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,260
Okay, I didn't know that about you.

1084
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,780
What is it, the Babybel cow lady,

1085
00:48:11,780 --> 00:48:15,340
and then there's also that purple one for lactate, I think?

1086
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:17,020
Why are they making all these cows sexy?

1087
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:17,860
Yeah.

1088
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:18,820
They are, that's sexy.

1089
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:19,660
I bet there's gotta be a lot of--

1090
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,900
That's a good-ass point.

1091
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,480
Yeah, and the male cow from back in the barnyard,

1092
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:24,480
Why is he so sexy?

1093
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,480
He's got a big gutters out, dude.

1094
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,480
Does an Elmer's glue have a hot cow on it?

1095
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:29,480
True.

1096
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,480
An Elmer.

1097
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,480
Whoa.

1098
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,480
That was just a lady getting milked.

1099
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:35,080
Okay, are you going to pull it up or no?

1100
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,080
Oh, God.

1101
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,080
Whoa.

1102
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,760
See, is it Doja Cat's fault that all these women are dressing up like sexy cows?

1103
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,880
I think she opened the Pandora's box.

1104
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,880
Yeah.

1105
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,880
Yeah.

1106
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:45,880
I guess that makes sense.

1107
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:46,880
Whoa.

1108
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,880
That is just a...

1109
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,720
Don't show that, but that is a woman just getting completely milked by...

1110
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,720
Jesus Christ.

1111
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,720
Wait, wait.

1112
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,720
Whoa, there's a fucking...

1113
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,460
- There's a lady fucking a horse on there.

1114
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:55,420
- Wait, what?

1115
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:57,260
- Bing is on some other stream.

1116
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,260
- Yeah, Bing is on some other stream.

1117
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,500
- Wait, scroll back up.

1118
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,860
- Why are you, you know what it is.

1119
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,780
- No, I barely saw it, yeah.

1120
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:04,840
- Scroll up further.

1121
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:07,660
- That is a horse.

1122
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:08,500
- Oh my God.

1123
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:10,580
- Lesbians grab a horse's cock.

1124
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,620
No, that's not a horse's cock, that's a cow's udder.

1125
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:16,740
- There's a woman squirting, she's squirting fresh milk

1126
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,140
into her pussy.

1127
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:18,980
- Onto.

1128
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,540
- Look at the tag on this image, lesbian 3D cock sex.

1129
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:29,160
This is some like German stuff. Yeah, why are Germans so weird about why are they so sexual?

1130
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,580
I mean it all comes back to Hitler man. Yeah

1131
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:37,060
Yeah, it's really you can't like the barn doors are gone I think

1132
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,220
Before there were there was wearing all those helmets with the spikes on top

1133
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:47,080
Is it because there's girls were sitting on those? Oh, yeah, because what is it cuz Germans are so punctual and they

1134
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,700
They get there uptight they need to rely only the other star

1135
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:58,280
There's two stereotypes about Germans and it's like German dungeon porn and like I will show up to your house so early

1136
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:04,620
You have to you have to make your food so fast. I think they show there's one more stereotype about German

1137
00:50:04,620 --> 00:50:12,980
Talking about I do you know German in high school there so they the one thing that they taught us is that Germans are

1138
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,420
And they're punctual. That's it. I've never heard of

1139
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,300
sex dungeon German

1140
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:25,980
That was like the biggest there's a huge running joke on like South Park is that carpet?

1141
00:50:25,980 --> 00:50:30,420
Yeah, like the Germans are Germans. Yeah, okay, so that's not so much a stereotype as it is a South Park joke

1142
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:39,380
They look I think that makes sense because the Germans are uptight and there's I think the French are probably foolish shit

1143
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,340
Oh, yeah, but they are fucking boring. We're all prudes and

1144
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:48,680
Germans want to the Germans want to make French French people can't have sex with the second they take their clothes off they throw up

1145
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:56,260
French people disgusting

1146
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,400
When a when a French person farts it gives you heartburn you smell it

1147
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:08,180
That's nasty who said that

1148
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:14,260
Pat I don't think I've ever known a French person really I knew a French Canadian kid growing up and

1149
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:19,180
He was so annoying that like you know when your mom Canadian

1150
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:23,920
Yeah, but you know when your mom tries to like organize a playdate and then like it's so clear that

1151
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:28,420
You don't like the kid that she has to end up hanging out with him for the whole duration

1152
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:34,900
Yeah of the playdate yeah that happened to him and it kept happening because she kept having to watch wait

1153
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,340
So she likes hanging out with the kids.

1154
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:39,580
So your mom has to hang out with the kid.

1155
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,100
I don't know that ever that ever happened to me.

1156
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,500
Yeah, no, I actually I actually hung out with like the moms and dads like all the

1157
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:48,060
time. That was just because like they we were like boys.

1158
00:51:48,060 --> 00:51:49,580
Like I was like chill with them. They didn't do that.

1159
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,860
I was mature as a kid.

1160
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,740
I remember going over to kids houses and they would think I was so annoying, get

1161
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,300
pawned off on their parents and then I'd leave, be like, I'm so mature.

1162
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:58,380
Yeah, I know. I understand what you mean.

1163
00:51:58,380 --> 00:51:59,380
I have no time for it.

1164
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:02,460
I think I just took the scenic route explaining all of this.

1165
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:07,180
frivolous I got in an argument with my friend's dad about 9/11 I was like

1166
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:10,780
whoa I was like 11 or 12 years I was like it was an inside job and he was

1167
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:14,800
like no it wasn't George Bush is a beast and then I left and I was like you're

1168
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,720
right and then I ended up telling my mom I was like mom George Bush is fucking

1169
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,040
awesome yeah for sure I talked to Ed and George Bush is a

1170
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:32,400
is a beast now. His name is Ray. Ray? Ray. That was pretty close. Yeah. What's Ray? Ray Gunn.

1171
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:38,840
Yeah, Ray Gunn. Oh my god. Oh, whoa. What the fuck? Ronald Reagan? Ronald. Fuck. Ron. I

1172
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:44,040
think Ray is a, I think he does delivery for like DHL or something. He's a man. I love

1173
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:47,960
a man in logistics. That's why he crunched the numbers in his head. He was like, it just

1174
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:52,040
makes no sense for it to be an inside job. It's too much money involved and stuff. Logistically,

1175
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,320
- It's impossible.

1176
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:58,320
- Okay, I may not be an expert in aeronautics

1177
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,800
or architecture or any of the many fields

1178
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,380
that enter into this horrible disaster,

1179
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:06,600
but on the logistics side, I can tell you.

1180
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,200
- I know logistics, okay?

1181
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:09,040
- Logistically.

1182
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,520
- Logistically makes no fucking sense.

1183
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,080
- Where'd they come from, Iraq?

1184
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:15,120
It's gonna be like 50 bucks overnight.

1185
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:15,960
Come on.

1186
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,880
(laughing)

1187
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:19,280
- It'd be way too expensive.

1188
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:20,560
- Way too expensive.

1189
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,480
- Ship 19 guys overnight, come on.

1190
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,040
- He also showed me one of my favorite websites

1191
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,120
'cause he was like, he was like,

1192
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,160
look, let's look at the facts.

1193
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,000
And he, that's when--

1194
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,600
- It's albino black sheep.

1195
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,040
(laughing)

1196
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,320
- He pulled up a website called Conservopedia,

1197
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,760
which was like, I think just one crazy guy

1198
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,480
went and like redid Wikipedia basically,

1199
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,400
but with like a conservative slant on every single article.

1200
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,840
So you can just put anything in there.

1201
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:44,280
Here it is. - Pull it up.

1202
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:45,480
- You're on-- - Chocolate milk made

1203
00:53:45,480 --> 00:53:46,720
from a chocolate cow.

1204
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,680
- It's a conservative, family-friendly,

1205
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:50,120
wiki encyclopedia.

the evolution is an agnostic Richard Dawkins said in an interview what's to

1209
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,360
prevent us from saying Hitler wasn't right I mean that is a genuinely

1210
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:16,480
difficult question. That's so funny, the first random page. Well that's the only page on

1218
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,680

00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:08,680
you can do it from there. I bet it goes straight to Adolf Hitler here.

1220
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,680
(laughter)

1221
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:16,680
Okay, we're back to Yugoslavia. Anyway,

1222
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:20,680
it's a great website. I highly recommend you guys check it out. There's some good 9/11 info.

1223
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:24,680
We might have to do a deep dive. I think that, honestly, I don't...

1224
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,680
we haven't done that website before? No, we've never talked about it. We're going to have to check out

1225
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:32,680
Conservipedia. I guess I've never showed that before. Well, we already finished it.

1226
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,520
- Oh yeah.

1227
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:34,960
- Blew it all in one fucking thing.

1228
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,840
- We went stem to stern on that website.

1229
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,680
- It's sick dude, it was like one of those ground floor

1230
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,120
like 2000s culture war things where it was like

1231
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:45,280
the Bill O'Reilly had all the books that were like,

1232
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:47,000
my grandma gave me one, it was called

1233
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
like Little Culture Warrior or something.

1234
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:49,840
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1235
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:50,960
- It was just telling you like when you go to school

1236
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,000
just plug your ears for eight hours.

1237
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,720
- I used to have two books that was called

1238
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,000
How to Win an Argument Against a Democrat

1239
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,000
and How to Win an Argument Against a Republican.

1240
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:01,840
- Whoa, whoa.

1241
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:06,320
Bill Maher like both these guys are sword for hire. I'm cutting through the BS

1242
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:10,080
Yeah, you got to be like I'm your prime to be like a public figure

1243
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:13,960
I should I was or a samurai I would tell people when I was a kid

1244
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,960
It was like hey look I really wanted to right now

1245
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,520
I if I'd set my life on it I could be the governor of Rhode Island

1246
00:56:18,520 --> 00:56:23,400
No, but I would tell people yeah, yeah, I think I could I could probably sure you probably still could I said

1247
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:27,320
I think there's still can't be that hard. No. No. Yeah, you just have to get three people to vote for you

1248
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:31,200
Yeah, you guys have that a governor who's like a mob boss or yeah

1249
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:38,240
Buddy Cianci. Buddy Cianci. Buddy Cianci. Really? Tied. He was very mobbed up and he one time, he went to jail twice.

1250
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:44,560
One time he was, he went to jail for regular like racketeering stuff. The other time he went to jail

1251
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:49,600
because he got his wife's boyfriend that she was cheating on him with and

1252
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:55,100
him and his boy tied him to a chair in his house, and he put out a cigarette on his arm. Damn.

1253
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,680
I think he was mayor at the time. That's a people's champ.

1254
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:04,500
thing we have to like a Rob Ford and no no I was gonna say it's the closest thing

1255
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:12,060
we have to a Rob Ford I think America has like 50 we had Andrew Gillum yeah that

1256
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:16,800
was the one who was the Trump recently just called a crackhead the one from

1257
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:22,200
Florida that was found doing some DL behavior yeah he was like taking pictures

1258
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,120
of like guys naked on his floor with them yeah he was he was naked on the

1259
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:30,320
Oh right right right. He's a crime to be naked on your own fucking floor.

1260
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,400
Yeah that's a really good point. Yeah is it a crime to do meth?

1261
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:37,960
Yeah. I did meth and it was like film or

1262
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:42,080
smoking crack I guess there's a difference here but the dad from ALF

1263
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:46,600
Really? The dad from ALF on like the final season of ALF they had to like work

1264
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,840
around him like

1265
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:51,640
being addicted to doing crack and like

1266
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:54,960
What do you mean work around? Like they cut like he couldn't go like one

1267
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,960
Well he kept smoking crack with Alf.

1268
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,960
We're breaking for crack lunch.

1269
00:57:58,960 --> 00:58:00,960
By the way that is like a dream

1270
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,960
Pookie sesh is you and Alf.

1271
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:04,960
I mean if you

1272
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:06,960
are on a TV show with like a puppet

1273
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:08,960
for, it's like one of the biggest shows

1274
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,960
in the 80's, I think

1275
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,960
you get the,

1276
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:14,960
you are granted the right to

1277
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,960
hit the Pookie every once in a while. No question.

1278
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,960
I mean it's the same thing, I feel like anyone

1279
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,960
on Family Matters was allowed

1280
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,960
to do that too, once Stefan or Kel

1281
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,960
jumped in I mean how do you think got so damn cool man yeah uh-huh that and then

1282
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:32,520
the ones Joey Gladstone start put started pulling out that fucking woodchuck puppet

1283
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:37,120
I think anyone on that set was allowed to just do whatever they like yeah shoot up

1284
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:40,960
heroin in the middle of your scene pulled out though the woodchuck puppet you

1285
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,640
remember that fucking thing he went full Mel Gibson beaver the beaver was that

1286
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:50,880
part of me that was part of his act right he was like oh I don't know I lost star

1287
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:57,960
search and he loses star search to Steve Oedekerk, the guy who created all the

1288
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:05,520
thumb movies and like Kung Pao and I why do I remember this episode so well?

1289
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:10,600
Full House. Yeah he loses star search and then like incorporates a woodchuck

1290
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,560
puppet into his act. He's going into one of his little holes where he just starts

1291
00:59:14,560 --> 00:59:23,820
listing details and doing this. And he was on Dallas. He has every single date

1292
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:29,560
perfectly in his head, but then he gets confused when he goes into a museum.

1293
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:34,100
In his head, just a perfect like one of those like conspiracy pegboards. Yeah. It's

1294
00:59:34,100 --> 00:59:41,860
just Twizzlers connected. Yeah, they don't have that shit in museums. They don't have the shit that I know. That's a good idea.

1295
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:45,060
Yeah, be a cool kind of you should open the Steve Otter Kirk

1296
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:50,200
T-rex being like it doesn't clinger and radar

1297
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:56,900
T-rex doesn't is it made out of a thumb? Yeah, I can't pay attention to it. This isn't a

1298
00:59:56,900 --> 00:59:59,700
Parody you've never been to a museum that you liked

1299
00:59:59,700 --> 01:00:03,820
I went to the I went to the Jim Henson exhibit in

1300
01:00:03,820 --> 01:00:07,060
It in the contemporary Jewish Museum

1301
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:13,500
they didn't have a Skeksis anywhere. So you didn't like it? No, I liked it. I love

1302
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:18,900
that you got it right back to puppets when we talked about museums. It was like, first museum, puppet museum.

1303
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:22,400
No, it was the Jewish Museum and they had a puppet exhibit. You were disappointed by the Jewish Museum.

1304
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:27,500
I don't think the Jews should be messing around with puppet imagery.

1305
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:34,500
Caleb is asking, "Pat, are there any museums you liked?" and Pat was like, "Well, I really didn't like the Jewish Museum. Let me just bring that up right away."

1306
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:41,500
I like you with some Nazi dudes protesting the museum, not realizing it's just an office

1307
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:42,500
in Texas.

1308
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:43,500
I like the museum.

1309
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:44,500
I just wish that they had...

1310
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:45,500
They had a big...

1311
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,500
They had Agra there.

1312
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,500
It's pretty sick.

1313
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,500
Yeah, the original Agra.

1314
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,500
It sounded very sick.

1315
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,740
I think that exhibit sounds very cool.

1316
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:52,740
It was really cool.

1317
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,740
I did like it a lot.

1318
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:54,740
He liked it.

1319
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:55,740
Yeah.

1320
01:00:55,740 --> 01:01:00,300
You know what I didn't like as a kid was when my cousin refused to go up the escalator at

1321
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,900
the Museum of Science.

1322
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:02,900
Why?

1323
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:05,660
because he got afraid of it for no reason.

1324
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:06,340
My cousin was--

1325
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:07,580
That's a scary escalator.

1326
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,580
It's not.

1327
01:01:08,580 --> 01:01:10,540
He looked at it-- you know what the thing is?

1328
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,620
His dad is an elevator repairman.

1329
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:13,100
No.

1330
01:01:13,100 --> 01:01:15,660
So I assumed it was some kind of beef.

1331
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:17,780
It was a beef that he had with escalators.

1332
01:01:17,780 --> 01:01:20,660
He was like, my dad said they suck.

1333
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:23,300
They're definitely less efficient, I guess,

1334
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,260
in an elevator.

1335
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,860
I'm losing my shit at you.

1336
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:27,700
I keep saying that's a scary escalator.

1337
01:01:27,700 --> 01:01:28,900
It's not that scary.

1338
01:01:28,900 --> 01:01:31,660
And then cutting yourself off to die.

1339
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:35,140
Yeah, escalators did kind of Pepsi, elevators, Coca-Cola.

1340
01:01:35,140 --> 01:01:35,640
Yeah.

1341
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,760
Big elevators came in really...

1342
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:37,560
They had it figured out.

1343
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,260
They got it and nailed it.

1344
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:40,220
I like escalators better than elevators.

1345
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:40,860
You're crazy.

1346
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:42,700
I mean, obviously not for like a long...

1347
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,360
They're more prone to breakdowns.

1348
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:47,700
That would be cool for like a 40-floor escalator.

1349
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:49,620
You're not stuck in an elevator.

1350
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:50,960
You made it into Dmitri Martin.

1351
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,660
You got fucking...

1352
01:01:52,660 --> 01:01:53,960
Fuck it. All right, wrap it up.

1353
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:58,320
Well, guys, talk about a closer look.

1354

Historically black medical colleges expanding

01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,760
that's a genomic research.

1371
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:36,060
That's an exciting. But so it's called a closer look, right?

1372
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,560
Yeah, not just closer look. So maybe try that.

1373
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,520
It's right there. It's right there.

1374
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,360
There we go. There it is. Go check this out.

1375
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,820
It's called a closer look. Everything in it is real.

1376
01:02:45,820 --> 01:02:49,560
The first season is about a world series between a team from lower

1377
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,860
Manhattan run by the mob and a team from Nashville run by a Christian cult.

1378
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,820
The second season is about the making of the most expensive unfinished movie

1379
01:02:56,820 --> 01:03:02,020
ever made a Kevin Costner sci-fi blockbuster called Cyber Cowboys.

1380
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:07,820
We play almost every character all of these guys. These guys all did though, a wonderful.

1381
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:11,580
Very significant roles so you like hearing their voices they're in it a lot.

1382
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:16,980
Hugely significant. We over we got you guys too much that we that makes me

1383
01:03:16,980 --> 01:03:21,420
make you work too hard. I remember I recorded I was on vacation and I just

1384
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:24,820
was like I told my cousins I was like guys I have to go into the next room I

1385
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:30,220
have to scream for two hours. I have to do something that I cannot explain for the life of me what this is.

1386
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,980
And I came out and they were like, "What the fuck was that?" I was like, "Ah, we'll see in a couple months."

1387
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,420
We'll find out. You're gonna see that, you're gonna realize why I was in there throwing up.

1388
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:44,580
And you know what I like is how scary you guys look on this drawing. Yeah, that's crazy.

1389
01:03:44,580 --> 01:03:50,260
Really, really scary looking. We're the demons and dark iconography. It's a little too weird for me, but I hope the

1390
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:54,140
audience goes and checks it out. If you like nefarious stuff. I'm not really into weirdo

1391
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:58,220
comedy but if you guys are into that go check out a closer look and it can be

1392
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:04,780
found everywhere you get your podcast by that we mean specifically Apple and

1393
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:09,060

Can I listen to it on Listen Zone? Or Brain Fun?

1398
01:04:27,700 --> 01:04:32,500
Podcast Addict is the craziest name. I think that's what it was called.

01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:38,260
It's called Podcast... Hey man, I can't find your podcast on Podcast Addict.
