00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt!

7
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,460
(laughing)

8
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,040
(explosion)

9
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,640
- You spappy-are with the butterflies on it.

10
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,040
- Do you guys, are you guys into home remedies at all?

11
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,880
Do you have a home remedy for me?

12
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,360
- Yeah, I can definitely carry you.

13
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,560
- I think I have a pinched nerve.

14
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,920
- You can punch your shit out.

15
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:22,760
- That's not done fucking.

16
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,840
- Just un-pinch the nerve.

17
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,480
- That's not gonna work, I don't have a--

18
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,160
- Just slap you.

19
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,080
Slapping is actually one of classic home remedy.

20
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,360
You guys are doing an opposite cure where you hurt me even more.

21
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,360
What do you think of this?

22
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:41,560
Chiropractic is about killing somebody before they hurt their back anymore.

23
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:45,080
Chiropracting, that's the act of chiropractic.

24
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,200
It does feel like it.

25
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,800
Just try this, try taking a big bunch of needles and sticking them wherever.

26
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,560
And this is supposed to help us?

27
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,160
Medicine nowadays is so crazy.

28
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,560
Have you seen, there's a video somebody sent the other day.

29
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:03,540
a guy who has a robot that puts needles into his ball sack.

30
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,280
And that's supposed to be medicine nowadays?

31
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,280
What the hell is this healthcare shit?

32
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,280
Exactly.

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,280
Wait, what is the point of it?

34
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,280
I mean, I heard just the other day.

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,600
Because he just likes pain in his nuts.

36
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:15,780
I heard just the other day there's this doctor named Ken Jiang and he tells jokes.

37
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,780
What the hell?

38
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,160
Hey, doctor, you're not supposed to be funny.

39
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,560
Be serious for once.

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,480
Also, imagine this.

41
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,920
He's been your general, your GP for years, right, Ken Jiang?

42
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,400
You take a day, it's your only day off the entire month, right?

43
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,320
You're a trucker.

44
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,880
You're going to the movies.

45
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,640
It's 2007.

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,480
- Yeah.

47
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,120
- You walk into the movies, you're just enjoying

48
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,320
just a complete romp, and then you see your doctor's penis.

49
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,160
- Oh my God.

50
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,120
- I don't wanna see that, dude.

51
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,960
- I don't wanna see that at all.

52
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,800
- Yeah, you're supposed to see mine.

53
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,800
- Exactly. - Exactly.

54
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,560
- Well, I actually heard Dr. Ken Jeong,

55
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,800
he's like rich and famous now,

56
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,480
so he doesn't have to see that many patients,

57
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,160
but I heard they fly him in just to do the prostate exams.

58
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,000
- That's true.

59
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,080
- He's really, really good at it.

60
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,920
- Really good at them.

61
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,760
- Well, I mean, he says it's fulfilling.

62
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,420
- You want the best, you know.

63
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,660
I mean, I would trust that.

64
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,260
I think he's the best at prostates.

65
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:05,860
- If they flew in a doctor just to do my prostate exam,

66
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,140
I would be like-- - I would trust him.

67
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,140
- They're airlifting you with a helicopter

68
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,860
out of your town to New York City,

69
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,060
good to see your side-eye.

70
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:19,380
- Imagine finding out that they had to bring

71
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,180
a special doctor.

72
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,940
- Doctor, his prostate, it's too big!

73
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,780
- You walk in, it's that big.

74
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,320
It's that Indian guy with elephantiasis hands.

75
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,320
Have you seen that dude?

76
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:37,360
He has nothing else that is huge on him except he has like three feet across his hands.

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
Baseball gloves.

78
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,360
They're huge dude.

79
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,360
And all the videos, I don't know what they're saying.

80
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,360
You got to get that guy in the Mets.

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,360
You'd be the best catcher ever.

82
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:53,320
I don't know, if you would have elephantiasis and it would make you really good at a sport,

83
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,320
Would you cure it?

84
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,760
Are you allowed to play?

85
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,520
I'm sure that the antibiotics you have to take or whatever the fuck would be considered PEDs.

86
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,520
Maybe.

87
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,760
But this guy honestly would be a world class volleyball player.

88
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,760
You guys think...

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,000
Well you have to...

90
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,520
Here's a question.

91
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:17,200
You think that Percocet is a PED?

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
No.

93
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
In sports?

94
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Percocet?

95
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Yeah.

96
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,600
I don't think so.

97
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,620
killers? Probably not. You wouldn't consider them a PED? No. But what if you

98
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:32,080
are in the BME Pain Olympics? Then yes, probably. Yeah, that's a good point.

99
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,380
You know what I was thinking about? Yeah? Is it legal in tennis to just have a really big

100
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:42,640
racket? Yeah. I'm serious, like can you just have like a really... because there's different sizes.

101
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,980
Well that's what I was about to say, I was thinking about this

102
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,400
regulation, this elephantitis guy who has a giant catcher's mitt for a hand.

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,740
You know, maybe I feel like in the future we could see somebody with like a

104
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:59,520
Resident Evil style golf club arm and maybe they have greater control over

105
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:03,000
where they're sending the ball. They're getting holes in one back to back to back.

106
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,200
I think biotechnology and technotronics are gonna be change sports.

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,360
And techno-optics are gonna, sports is gonna be different in a couple years.

108
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,840
Definitely, yeah, like biological, mechanical, like just kind of like...

109
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
Mechanologically?

110
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,640
Yeah, mechanologically and probably like voodoo tronics as well and kind of magic.

111
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,760
Magico, techno, biologic.

112
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,160
Dude, imagine if they added magic to baseball.

113
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,400
Yeah.

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,440
Imagine too.

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,280
Syncopatronics are going to be like really weird.

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
I heard that they're putting crafting into soccer too.

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,480
Whoa.

118
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,280
Yeah, the players can craft better cleats on the field if they gather enough materials.

119
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,520
Now there's glowing materials too.

120
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,600
You have to have leather and metal, raw metal.

121
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, yeah.

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,800
And also you have to have an ore and then of course there's a smelting station at work.

123
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,520
Yeah.

124
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,560
Bad news for some of the teams.

125
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Apparently one of the crafting ingredients

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,020
is a British guy's pinky bone.

127
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,080
So you can only craft it when you're playing

128
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,760
against one of the UK teams.

129
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,520
Yeah, and you're not gonna wanna be a British guy.

130
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,120
No, biting off pinkies left and right.

131
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:04,960
Oh my God.

132
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,800
So far.

133
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,280
Yeah, they're gonna be saying, "You man," like, "Oh man."

134
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,000
Yeah, that's right.

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,840
Brazilian referees.

136
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,440
They'll say, "You man," as if they're saying, "Oh man."

137
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,840
There's a potion you use a Brazilian referee's head

138
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,800
to make it, yeah.

139
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
It's very intricate.

140
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,800
That's what they...

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,640
There was a referee who was beheaded?

142
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,640
Yes sir.

143
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,640
It's funny to me, like as an...

144
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,640
I've read that Wikipedia page more than...

145
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,640
That's funny to you?

146
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:29,360
No, as an American, just how serious like soccer is taken.

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,360
Well okay, get this though.

148
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,280
Because that's just a sport you play as a little kid here.

149
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,320
That story was like this whole thing where it's like, oh my god, they got so mad at the

150
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,040
referee that they cut his head off.

151
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,600
But what actually happened is that the referee stabbed one of the players and killed him.

152
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,240
And then the entire crowd was like, what the fuck?

153
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,640
take that guy's head off of him. Yeah, that's cool. And they actually

154
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,760
pulled all like his limbs off of him. Oh my god, that's so cool.

155
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,240
So what happened was the referee and the player got in a fight and then the ref

156
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,040
pulled out a knife and stabbed him. Yeah. And then the player left, the game

157
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,760
continued, everyone's booing the ref and then news hits the stadium that the guy died in the

158
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,000
hospital and just immediately that guy's head was just off. That's like, yeah,

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,560
imagine like yeah being in that crowd and being like okay like I guess we're doing

160
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,100
this. Yeah, you're looking side to side. Yeah. Well, is this? Yeah. Oh, we're

161
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,440
taking his head off right now. We're pulling his clothes off, right? That's

162
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,420
what we're doing. If he dies, we're taking your head. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's

163
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,400
like, he's never gonna die, right? We don't have to take the guy's head off.

164
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,500
It'll be fine. Yeah. The opposing team people are like, well, the guy died. I

165
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,440
would love to take this ref's head off. I would love to have that experience

166
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
under my belt, be a part of a crowd of 100 people tearing Amanda Shreds,

167
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,000
because they're never sending me to jail. At the referee at Chuck E. Cheese,

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,040
the guy who stops you from doing back flips off all the slides.

169
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah.

170
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,240
Let's say they decide to send us to jail, right?

171
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,240
Yeah.

172
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
Like what?

173
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Did you kill someone that's a life sentence?

174
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
Sure, we'll all do one year.

175
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
That's right.

176
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,240
That's a hundred of us.

177
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,240
True.

178
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,840
Yeah, there's no way that any of those people got prosecuted, right?

179
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
Yeah.

180
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Well, yeah.

181
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
It was like 2003.

182
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
No one's filming it.

183
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
There's no cops at a Brazilian soccer game.

184
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
Yeah.

185
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
And if they are, they're not being--

186
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
They're on the team.

187
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
They're trying to enjoy a chili dog, right?

188
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Yeah.

189
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
They're not doing a fucking watch the--

190
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
Yeah.

191
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
Or what are they--

192
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
I meant--

193
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
Is it Brazil?

194
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,840
Skinny pigs?

195
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,840
Skinny pigs, somewhere in South America.

196
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,840
Brazil eats tons of fucked up shit.

197
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,840
I think it's not fucked up.

198
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,840
They eat some fucked up shit.

199
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,840
I've looked at a guinea pig one time and been like, it's basically a pig.

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Exactly.

201
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,840
Brazilians eat like sponges.

202
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:34,840
They just inhale large pieces of air and then just keep all the dust and that fills them up.

203
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,840
Brazilian food is mad good though.

204
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
What's Brazilian food?

205
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,120
uh... what's that one p_p_ khana

206
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,200
p_i_ c_h_

208
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,440

00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,080
uh... mixed up with a in a very brasil in the amazon

210
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,160
you will be you know if you run a

211
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,600
uh... yeah

212
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,400
well based on what i would

213
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,940
i think it was a little bit of brazil and movies they usually

214
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:02,860
uh... birdseed

215
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,120
yet yet i've seen this movie rio

216
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

217
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,000
And sometimes they bounce off a woman's huge ass.

218
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Yeah.

219
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's not really food though.

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
And they go flying.

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,320
I saw this Brazilian movie where they eat a full English.

222
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,320
What?

223
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,480
I saw this Brazilian movie where they eat a full English breakfast.

224
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,640
What are you talking about?

225
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:30,120
And there's a menu and his mom gets her face pulled back.

226
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,520
I don't know what you're talking about.

227
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,520
I don't really either.

228
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,520
I'm talking about the movie Brazil.

229
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,520
Oh, okay.

230
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,720
That movie scared the shit out of me when I was a kid.

231
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,920
That's my dad's favorite movie.

232
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:38,920
He showed it to me.

233
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,920
It's the Nostalgia Critic's favorite movie.

234
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,920
Is that true?

235
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:43,520
That's how I found out about it in middle school.

236
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,360
That's a good movie.

237
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,920
You know, I just downloaded Letterboxd again.

238
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
Yeah.

239
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,160
I was like, I'm trying to watch more movies.

240
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,200
Dude, I hate how people talk about movies, bro.

241
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,200
It's the worst.

242
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
It's fucking disgusting.

243
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,200
It's so fucking stupid, dude.

253
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,600
I remember what he said, but he was just like, "This is so immature!" basically. It's CKY.

254
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,760
I'm done with movies again. I was into movies for a week. On Pluto TV, I found they have

255
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:53,440
a Johnny Carson channel. He just plays Johnny Carson all the time, and it's so fucking good,

256
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,440
dude.

257
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,440
Yeah.

258
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
Pluto TV has great stuff.

259
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,560
He is so fucking racist and hates women so much.

260
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,160
Carson. It is hilarious dude. Yeah. I watched one today where they had a lady who was

261
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,200
Amelia Earhart's friend on there and she was like, she's like, "Amelia Earhart is a

262
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,400
real, was a real woman you know, she wasn't, she wasn't like these, these

263
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:17,480
women's lib people today." This is in like the 80s. Yeah. And Johnny Carson says, "You

264
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,760
know what I say about the women's lib movement? If it barks like a dog and

265
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:29,760
looks like a dog by golly it's probably a dog. I was like dude fuck yes dude.

266
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,760
He's just calling women dogs on like the biggest show in the world.

267
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:39,860
Yeah. Just like women are all dogs. Women are crap and I love to put my

268
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:45,640
cigarettes out on them. And Amelia Earhart was a bitch. It was cool Susan

273
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,480
Then I don't have to kill him. I'd be sick if Jimmy Fallon just started doing that.

274
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,600
Oh shit. Yeah, well they're also, the best part about those old Carsons is no one

280
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,960
they're just not doing giving him anything well Ed McMahon gives him the

281
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,720
(guttural sounds)

282
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:44,300
- He was, Ed McMahon was reanimated.

283
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,040
- Really?

284
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,740
- Yeah, like that's how they got him to be the co-host.

285
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,580
- Wow.

286
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,240
- Yeah, he was one of the first Frankensteins.

287
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,920
- Oh, that's huge.

288
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,240
- Does he have the bolts?

289
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,060
- Yeah, well he had the bolts, but he had them--

290
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,900
- They're in a different place.

291
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,900
- Well he's a Carson's monster.

292
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,820
Is he Ed McMahon's monster, or is he Ed McMahon's?

293
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,840
- No, he's Ed McMahon.

294
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,020
That was the name of the gravestone.

295
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,620
he's Carson's monster though. Yeah he's Carson's monster but his name is Ed

296
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:11,860
McMahon. I'm sorry I looked oh you have steam open I forgot that your username

301
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,620
You already have. I think I've added a few people and then if they ever request me to

302
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,460
play with them I delete them.

303
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,600
What you think I want? You think I'm going to open a line where you can see what I'm

304
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:48,500
doing and ask me to play games with you? Are you psycho? No chance. Not happening. No way.

305
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
I love the fans.

306
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
You can come to my house.

307
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:55,980
Ed McMahon. Yeah, he's a Frankenstein. Let's get back to this.

308
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,380
Dude, it's awesome, dude. I mean, Johnny, I never have watched much Carson. He's the

309
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,380
fuck, he's a beast.

310
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,380
I liked-

311
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:10,300
Oh, he did this one joke where he's like, "The governor of-" Fuck, what is it? You

312
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:18,340
hold your nose, Carson, right? There we go. No, he's like, "The governor of California

313
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:24,100
came into Los Angeles today and met with community leaders from the black community, and he said

314
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:29,220
that they taught him more than he taught them like how to say police.

315
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:37,900
Jesus. This used to be every night on TV. Yeah yeah.

316
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:45,100
And now they got Spongebob on TV. That's right. Apparently they got this

317
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,900
comedian nowadays named Ken Jeong and he's a doctor. That's right. What the hell

318
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,100
is this? If you're a comedian you're supposed to be funny not a doctor. He probably goes up there and talks about being a doctor.

319
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:58,100
How about you do a transplant on your fucking little ass cock, you idiot.

320
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,100
That's right.

321
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,900
If you're such a doctor, do a colonoscopy on me and show me what's inside me.

322
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
Yeah.

323
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Come on.

324
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,900
X-ray me.

325
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,900
Feel me.

326
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Rub me.

327
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Come on, doctor, rub me.

328
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,900
Rub me.

329
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
Do you think he demanded his trailer?

330
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Paging doctor rubbing me.

331
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Oh, this again.

332
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Oh, God.

333
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,740
Do you think Ken Jeong has in his trailer like an X-ray machine and a CAT scan and stuff?

334
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
Yeah.

335
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,740
He sees patients while he's on the set?

336
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,740
Yeah.

337
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,540
He fixed Ed Helms tooth on the set of Hangover 2.

338
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Really?

339
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,540
Yeah, because he's a dentist too.

340
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,900
I forgot that's not what the name of doctors for teeth are.

341
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,060
They're still doctors.

342
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,060
Dentists are not doctors.

343
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,060
Yeah, they are.

344
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,060
What are you talking about?

345
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,060
Okay, is a nurse a doctor?

346
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,420
Fuck no, dentists go to medical school.

347
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,420
No, doesn't count.

348
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:43,420
Dentists go to clown school.

349
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,420
They don't go to clown school.

350
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,420
They go to a medical school that specializes in dentistry.

351
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,420
They go to dentist school.

352
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,420
Yeah, wrong.

353
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,420
Dentist school.

354
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,420
No, dentist school is for a dental assistant.

355
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,420
They're fucking nothing.

356
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,260
- Thank you. - They're not doctors.

357
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,100
- Dentists are lowest of the low.

358
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,420
- Dentists are not, like, straight up not doctors.

359
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,980
- Wait, wait, look, do this.

360
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,100
Okay, that makes sense.

361
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,620
- Yeah. - Yeah, you literally have,

362
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,620
like, your teeth look like a crossword.

363
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,700
(laughing)

364
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
- Yeah. - Yeah.

365
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,620
- Well, dentists can eat my butt.

366
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,500
- They can suck my dick, dude, they're nothing.

367
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,540
- Well, that's what they do. - What happens

368
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,340
when I go to sleep at the dentist's office?

369
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,300
- I've fallen asleep in the dentist's chair before.

370
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,340
- Yeah. - Me too, actually.

371
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:20,460
They make you wait a long ass time.

372
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,660
I fell asleep in the orthodontist chair.

373
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,660
I never had braces.

374
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,980
I like when they x-ray your face and make you wear that bulletproof vest.

375
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Yeah, it's awesome.

376
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,980
And they do.

377
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,140
You were not given the free heart x-ray.

378
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,500
They put in like the, you know, they ever put in the plastic.

379
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,780
Oh, dude, that thing sucks so bad.

380
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
I hate that thing.

381
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
I love it.

382
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,780
You take some funny ass photos of that though.

383
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,780
It's cool as hell.

384
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,780
Take some funny ass photos.

385
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:41,780
That's right.

386
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,780
It's crazy that I never.

387
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,780
That was the crush on Snapchat.

388
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,780
I need one of those.

389
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,780
When I was fucking 14.

390
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,780
Oh my God.

391
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,780
Yeah.

392
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,780
You're still crushing on Snapchat, right?

393
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
Yeah.

394
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:55,600
I wish I had one of those dentist chair buttons where you can fill a cup of water, like just

395
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:00,080
on my office chair, where you can, you know, it has the little faucet, you can just fill

396
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,080
up a little cup of water.

397
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,580
We've talked about getting a sucker before for...

398
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
Absolutely.

399
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,580
When we get an office, we have to get a sucker.

400
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,580
A sucker and a water shooter.

401
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,260
Yeah, a water shooter outer.

402
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,120
I do have a water pick.

403
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
That's different.

404
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Yeah.

405
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
I guess it's the same.

406
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
A spouter.

407
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
That's what we need.

408
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
We need a spouter.

409
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
And a pusher buttoner.

410
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
A sucker and a blower, though.

411
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Yeah.

412
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
We need a blower.

413
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,720
lucid or downers and a papers putter on her. Yeah, I want to get a watch. We might

414
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,720
need a looker at the timer. True. That's a good point. Yeah, probably. We'll probably need like a

415
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,760
food heater upper. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. A snacker holder. Yeah. What's that thing?

416
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,240
Some looker at her beautiful women. A colder snacker holder. Mm-hmm. Oh, and a water boiler.

417
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,560
But you mean a waterer boiler? Yeah. Yeah. Waterer boiler. And a fooder boiler.

418
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:54,720
Steak in a bag boiler. Yes. Yep. Definitely.

419
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,560
Steaker in a bagger boiler. Yep.

420
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,000
Patrick boiler. Potatoer masher.

421
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,800
Okay, so we need two chairs and then a torture machine for Patrick.

422
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,520
Yeah. Yeah.

423
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,880
A big cauldron?

424
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,840
No, a big spike that you sit on and just put a rock on your head and it just kind of slowly

425
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:13,440
kills you. I'm inventing a new torture device called the boiling chair.

426
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:17,280
yeah and it's a chair inside a pot of water i feel like i would be and you

427
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,240
have to wear a scuba outfit well i wouldn't know that the water was boiling

428
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,840
i wouldn't leap out exactly i would be so good at making torture

429
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,320
devices for the medieval ages yeah i would have fucking crushed it dude

430
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:35,280
how about this how about a uh just a just a loading screen yeah never yeah

431
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,600
you have to listen to justin bieber's music for

432
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,200
probably an hour on end a wi-fi network that has no pat like they

433
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,200
they won't tell you the password.

434
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Yeah, you can't get the password.

435
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh, Wi-Fi network from a plane.

436
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,200
Yep.

437
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Yeah.

438
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,200
Yeah.

439
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,200
But it's only a...

440
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Fly-Fi?

441
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Yeah.

442
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,200
Yeah.

443
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Oh, how about this?

444
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,200
It's one of the...

445
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
It's Harry Potter, best book ever, right?

446
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,200
All the pages are blank.

447
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,640
But it only turns one page every two hours.

448
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,040
And there's no last page, so you never know the ending.

449
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,760
You never know what happens to Voldemort.

450
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,760
Yeah.

451
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,760
Yeah.

452
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,760
How about this?

453
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,760
Voldemort shocks you with a magic dark spell.

454
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,840
Well, that's the other thing.

455
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,520
If you had witches and wizardry, like, why are you involving them in everything that you're

456
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:18,120
doing yeah like almost no there's no like okay like the Trojan horse right

457

00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400

in this horse i got insanely upset yeah

472
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
walking in walking into the movie like

473
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,000
like just at the scene where they're

474
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,400
like wheeling the horse into the city

475
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,120

00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,360
And that's a cool. Oh, it's a movie about this horse. Yeah,

478
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,480
horse is awesome. I think I'm interested to see where you go.

479
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,620
I think I came inside from playing some my parents watching it with my sister

480
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:22,920
and then saw the guys come out of the horse and kill like a bunch of

481
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,640
civilians.

482
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,280
Patrick saw Troy and he came inside. He said yeah, he did do I got so

483
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,200
that a horse dude once they saw his guys coming out of a horse after he

484
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:35,240
came inside.

485
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,880
Once they killed Achilles, I got so hyped.

486
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,880
Did you guys see that video I sent you yesterday?

487
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,880
Oh yeah.

488
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,880
Why is she like, it's funny that it's like half

489
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,880
like she's supposed to be hot

490
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,880
and she's baiting that for like views

491
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,880
on Instagram.

492
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,880
And then also she's fucking jerking off a giant horse.

493
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Yeah, she's playing like the music is so funny.

494
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,880
She's putting like that thermos that has like a

495
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,880
blanket on it.

496
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
It looks like a horse flashlight.

497
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
I mean it looks like a fucking picture of crystal light and she's just like making the horse fuck it.

498
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
Yeah.

499
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:10,960
loving it's like jerking around I'd probably do the same thing I would did

500
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,840
she was hot but it's funny that they're trying to like yeah it's just a very

501
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,960
interesting cross-section it's clearly that she wants people to think that it's

502
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,200
hot that she's jacking a horse well it's I yeah I'm there's some kind of scary

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,640
That's what's gonna take me like five minutes to get in a red bull

597
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,560
- I'm in sport mode if I really need to zoom.

598
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,760
- That's why I miss the summer.

599
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,340
I miss wearing my Tevas, dude.

600
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:52,520
My body's too cold all the time.

601
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,480
Anyone else have this?

602
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,600
- I get overheated really easily.

603
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,040
- I get too cold and then I'll go out

604
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:01,720
in a bunch of layers, then I'll go skate in the winter.

605
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,240
Right now, I went skating earlier and now I'm sweaty.

606
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,280
So now I just have a shit ton of layers on

607
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,680

608
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,500
It's fucked up. It's fucked up what global warming is doing to my life.

609
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:20,000
I think it's you-will warming when you are skating. I think it's skatal warming.

610
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,540
I don't think that's true.

611
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,580
Yeah, I think it is.

612
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,580
I think it's true.

613
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,580
Because I'm heating up.

614
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,100
You guys need to get some cool shoes.

615
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,340
I do need some Crocs.

616
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Some Crocs.

617
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,980
My Tevas are the same material as Crocs.

618
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:36,340
But these are great because like I said, they're embarrassing. People look at you different.

619
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:41,780
Dominican guys make the, you know when Dominican dudes walk around and they like, kinda like,

out of the diaper I put on my head like,

674
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,580

00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,880
Why your hair green, dog?

677
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,740
- Green?

678
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,580
- Yeah, green.

679
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,420
about dying my hair green like the Joker. What do you guys think about that? A friend of

680
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:09,900
mine, big ass Dominican dude just dyed his hair pink. Really? Yeah. And he's, I mean

681
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:14,780
he looks so stupid bro. Yeah? Yeah I just have been. I think I'd look good with green

682
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:21,780
hair. I think colored hair looks, if you're over 18 you can't have that. No. Well that's

683
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:27,500
what this guy's like. I'm including any color except brown. My friend is, he's like 30 dude.

684
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:33,980
Yeah. He's got pink hair bro. How are you gonna pass that off? Yeah. I think what I should do is

685
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,500
dye his whole body pink and then he can be the pink guy. I'm gonna grow a pink man. That would be cool.

686
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:44,380
Yeah. I'm gonna grow hair out, dye it green and then bleach my beard and then dye that purple.

691
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:16,780
immediately to peer pressure and he lost the chops and he has no...

692
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:24,060

they look goofy. You look stupid. You should grow some mutton chops. Yeah. That

694
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:32,300

794
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000

795
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,160
(humming)

796
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:12,960
Just doing that to myself for a while.

798
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,440
Peter Griffin Life is Good parody,

799
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,360

00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,400
- Really? - Yeah.

801
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,240
- He probably just likes the song.

802
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,040
- He wakes up like the Lego movie

803
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,480
and then gets ready to that song.

804
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,480

805
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,680

806
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,760

810
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:49,480
I got so drunk the other night I was just doing Peter Griffin voice while I was walking

813
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:02,720
I think the only family guy I've ever seen is that Herbert the Pervert compilation we

814
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,720
watched at your house.

815
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,560
Oh yeah, Joe put that on, dude.

Yeah.

818
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
It's very funny.

819
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,560
That guy, he's a goofball.

820
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
Herbert is such a pervert.

821
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,560
He's a total weirdo.

822
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
That old motherfucker.

823
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Herbert is such a pervert and Chris is such a child that he wants to touch him.

824
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,560
And he's always going after Chris.

825
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,560
He's always going after Chris.

826
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:20,480
Chris is also like kind of too old for a sexual predator, right?

827
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,120
That's the only way they'd let it put it on TV, I bet.

828
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,120
Yeah.

829
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,760

00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,800
I know a guy who everyone hates, Don Trump.

Donald Glover.

851
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,320
Tell you who I don't like that much, Don Imus.

852
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,160
Yeah.

853
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:21,980
Now this guy--

854
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,720
This guy called those women nappy.

855
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,760
That's right. It's like they're wide awake.

856
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:30,280
You know,

857
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:35,520
I learned about who Don Imus was through an episode of mind of men,

858
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,200
CEO, where he's defending him for saying nappy. Yeah, it's pretty cool. Yeah,

859
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:43,480
dude. I, my parents should have monitored what I did as a kid.

860
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:47,280
I should not have watched. I should not have been a mind of men.

861
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,960
When I was nine, I think that that's ruined me in a lot of ways. Yeah.

The police calling you the grabber. Yeah, that's tough too.

889
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,500
Batman's looking for you. The grabber's calling you. The police.

890
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:49,500
The grabber. I heard the grabber's on the loose.

891
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Wait, what was that? I heard the stroker

892
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:57,500
is running around. They call me the gipper because I'd be selling crack in black neighborhoods.

893
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:01,500
(laughter)

894
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,500
Do you now? Really?

895
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,500
That would be so fucking funny to

896
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:16,660
Patrick dressed up in fucking, wearing fucking Ruka or whatever in the corner of some neighborhood

897
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:17,660
in Bed-Stuy.

898
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:23,300
Pat, now that I think about it, Pat would make like, if you were like an undercover cop

899
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:26,940
or if you were like a narc or something, it would be way too obvious.

900
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
I know.

901
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:32,340
Nobody would believe that you, honestly they would be like, well there's no way he's a

902
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,860
cop because that would be too obvious.

903
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,860
Yeah, exactly.

904
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:37,460
You honestly might want to enlist in the police-atary.

905
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,460
Yeah.

906
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,780
yeah yeah I think I could I'd be the best oh man I would nab so many people for

907
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:47,820
drugs see ya anyone who says no one's ever gonna

908
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,140
drugs there's no way that guy could no one's ever gonna offer me drugs ever

909
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,140
again after this episode well you are a cop though yeah well I've been a cop but

911
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,060
just stop yeah actually that's so funny that's the whole point that's the whole

912
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:11,100
like like plot point of the departed yeah it's like he's walking or he went to

913
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,180
jail for like like 90 days or whatever and he's walking around trying to buy

914
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,500
drugs like yeah I was pretty much a cop for two seconds and then now I'm not

915
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:22,860
though yeah for no reason though I was too cool to yeah I left I left because I

916
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:26,900
wanted to do this yeah I see if your copy just look at your watch and like no

917
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:36,900
Yeah, I don't think so. No, it's past 5. Right now. No, no, no. Yeah, I'm clocked out.

918
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,900
You know what I really want? I do want to be a cop though just so I can get my badge and my gun taken away.

919
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,900
I want to be a cop just to be a cop. Well, I mean, that's for the thrill of it all.

920
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,900
Here's how I would fool my chief. I want to be a cop to serve and protect.

921
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,900
Here's what I would do if I was a cop. Here's how I fool my chief.

922
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:52,900
He says, "Pitts, turn in your gun and your badge."

923
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:58,420
badge I say oh yeah sure no problem sir walk outside guess it's in my pocket two

924
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:04,600

925
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:08,500
time oh and he had none but you didn't turn in either of them I turned in

926
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:13,900
neither of them well I turned in my gun and my my he's he really just respects

927
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:19,140
the object work so I just okay you go take my badge in my gun yeah no problem

928
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,120
Yeah, yeah, I turn in my badge in my gun to try some free even an even golder badge and an even bigger

929
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:29,180
That's right. Yeah, I would try to do if some if they try to take my badge my gun

930
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:35,480
I try to really confusingly kind of bend to the conversation and make it seem like it's a who's on first thing

931
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:40,980
Yeah, you know very directly asking me. Give me your badge your gun. I'm like who's badging gun

932
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:47,100
Well, yeah, I think gun. Yeah, I locked them up earlier badges and guns is yeah, I know that yeah

933
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:51,460
Yeah, I'll turn in my gun turn it into a gun that's attacking you yeah bang

934
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:55,620
And turn my badge into a ninja star

935
00:43:55,620 --> 00:44:01,660
Because I'll turn in my gun turn into a gun yeah

936
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:11,700
Yeah, and then you just turn into a gun just like two floating googly eyes yeah, and then it's just a smile

937
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:16,940
We've are definitely already talked about I think about that thing all it's an image in my you know Megatron

938
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:18,940
used to turn into a gun before they made him into a plane.

939
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,940
Yeah, wasn't it like a Walther P33?

940
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:22,940
I don't remember what kind of gun it was.

941
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,940
But it's sick because everything else turned into cars

942
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:26,940
and he turns into a little gun.

943
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,940
It's cool dude.

944
00:44:28,940 --> 00:44:30,940
Isn't he like the biggest gun of all time?

945
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,940
Probably, but I mean like toys wise.

946
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,940
Yeah. You know, it's just a gun.

947
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,940
True.

948
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,940
Didn't they used to make the

949
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:40,940
Transformers out of metal?

950
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,940
I don't know.

951
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:44,940
They are made out of metal.

952
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:57,420
to

953
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,060
Absolutely. Yeah. No, here's a question. I would be another man.

954
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,820
Where's the door to the transformer on the car?

955
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,540
Where's the door to him?

956
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,460
If he transforms while you're inside, do you get crushed into bits?

957
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:20,420
You see like a, like a pickup truck, like a transformer.

958
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:23,500
It's like pickup truck form and it has like truck nuts and you're like, Oh,

959
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,340
those are probably like his balls. That's pretty funny.

960
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:29,820
and he transforms back into a guy and there's like in the middle of his face

961
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:41,020
just like super unlucky because the like the tailpipe is like his nose so it's

962
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:47,340
cool dude yeah you're your balls at Ron no I'm not yeah no I'm not no I'm not

963
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:51,340
yeah I'm just clear no your balls are trying you got balls on your face

964
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:55,740
literally it's it's it's it's stamped on your body says your name is balls at

965
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:02,860
you know that's Decepticonian language destroyer yeah like a yeah transformer

966
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:07,060
was like a bumper sticker on his forehead that says like pussy wagon so

967
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:15,780
tight yeah my honor student went to yeah see University pussy oh my god oh my god

968
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,840
Hogwarts was kind of like pussy University for me what kind of we should

969
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:24,400
come up with some bumper stickers sometimes. I had a really good bumper sticker idea that

970
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,480
I don't want to say on the podcast because I think we should actually sell it. Okay.

971
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,600
I'll tell you guys after. Can you remind me? Yeah. Should I just pause it now and tell

972
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:41,400
them? Yeah. It's such a good idea. Oh my god. Yeah. Oh my god. I'm losing my mind. I'm so

973
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,160
glad we didn't say that on the air. Yeah. Here, I'll pause it again and we'll say it

974
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:48,400
again and will react to it again okay

975
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,560
haha

976
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,640
in time

977
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:52,160
man

978
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,320
really well you probably wish you heard this

979
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,800
yeah all you wish you heard this you will never hear this you'll never hear

980
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:58,960
the you never know

981
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,960
all that one day i hear this

982
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,480
yeah and one more reference here this year that's what's my part of or at that

983
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,200
is for one day he get the lady get this year that's a pretty funny one i mean

984
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,280
he's a poor at

985
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:14,880
he's a jokester. Probably my favorite comedian ever. You know when he says "Bajin hang like sleeve of wizard"

986
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,880
yeah that shit fucks me. That shit gets me every time. It really does.

987
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,960
Borat is so funny.

988
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:25,220
It's literally the funniest movie ever made. It's so funny.

989
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:28,720
There's never been a funnier movie. It's crazy it should be like not funny.

990
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,280
And it's crazy that Borat 2 was even funnier.

991
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,520
It shouldn't be funny anymore.

992
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:36,960
It should have been. It kills me every time.

993
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,960
It's so good.

994
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:38,960
It hits every time.

995
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:41,000
Because I forget certain shit.

996
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,120
Like the fucking, it's so stupid, but the scene where he sees the tortoise and he's like,

997
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,480
"Oh, what kind of dog is this?"

998
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,480
Yeah.

999
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,480
It still gets me every time.

1000
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,480
Genuine chocolate face.

1001
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:54,480
When he says "crumb," when he's talking about his wiener, oh my God.

1002
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,480
Oh, when he's in the...

1003
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,680
That's not what that is called, Borat, you foreigner.

1004
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,680
You freak.

1005
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:02,160
It's funny that he actually is a foreigner, Sacha Baron Cohen.

1006
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:03,160
Yeah.

1007
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,160
You know?

1008
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:05,160
He's from the UK.

1009
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,160
Which also kind of makes me like the movie less.

1010
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:11,440
say that about me I can only say that about me mm-hmm you can't say from and

1011
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:17,640
what is he's not about me you can't say not to me I can say not about myself and

1012
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:20,200
I can do all those jokes but that's because I'm actually from here you

1013
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:27,440
fucking idiot yeah my suit is not black but not what my suit is not black not

1014
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:32,000
see you did a good job when he says when he says smile a bit when he says smile

1015
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,760
- Open pussycat, smile a bit.

1016
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:34,600
- Yeah.

1017
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,440
- Yup, that's funny.

1018
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:36,800
What else is funny from Borat?

1019
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,680
(laughing)

1020
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,520
You know, I don't like--

1021
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:41,560
- I see just that thong that he wears.

1022
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:44,160
- When he sings that damn song in front of the rodeo,

1023
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:45,000
oh my god.

1024
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:45,820
- See, and then the second one,

1025
00:48:45,820 --> 00:48:50,820
they had to get some like fucking blonde haired lady

1026
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:55,120
to be the most beautiful girl in the world in it.

1027
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,960
I don't care about that.

1028
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:56,780
- Is that Borat's daughter?

1029
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:57,880
- Borat's 16 year old daughter.

1030
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,880
- Some girl who's like a normal age, I think.

1031
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,700
she's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen,

1032
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,440
all of a sudden I'm distracted trying to watch Borat say not,

1033
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:08,340
but instead I'm looking at her eyebrow.

1034
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:11,160
- That's Borat out there.

1035
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,080
- They're making noise.

1036
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:12,920
- They should make a movie.

1037
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,760
- They're making Borat 3 out there right now.

1038
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,880
- They should make Borat in New York 3.

1039
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:16,720
- Yeah.

1040
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,560
- The thing is about Borat is that

1041
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:20,920
they should have never made a second one

1042
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,560
'cause you can't walk around as Borat.

1043
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,400
People would--

1044
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,220
- Right, yeah.

1045
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:25,660
They must have had to do so many like,

1046
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:27,000
out to like, just like,

1047
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,400
so many takes must have gotten ruined.

1048
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:33,200
because if imagine you like like them walk in Borat walked up to you on the

1049
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,280
street right now and tried to interview you about fucking you know Trump or

1050
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:39,240
whatever you just say like hi bore. Oh you are bore at okay. They didn't have

1051
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,960
that part of the in the movie. Yeah, he's in the skies. Well they also had him be

1052
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,600
like oh he's famous because from the first but also like I but it's stupid.

1053
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,600
It's a bad movie. I could tell Borat from the I mean it did what the no any

1054
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:55,960
layer of makeup could not hide Borat for me. Yeah, you know I'm a real I'm a real

1055
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:02,680
Borat Bloodhound. I inspect for Borat every day. I mean it's not just Borat too.

1056
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:08,560
Caleb can sniff out any person from Kazakhstan just instantly. That's my job on the force.

1057
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:15,320
That's right. As an undercover cop. I'm sniffing out Borat. Yeah. Borat's a street name for

1058
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:21,000
Sacha Baron Cohen. I'm trying to find him so he doesn't confuse any of my fellow officers,

1059
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,760
trick them into saying something racist. He does do that. He does do that. Yeah.

1060
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:28,360
Yeah. Once I find him, I'm beating him with a stick. I would hate to be tricked into

1061
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:33,480
saying I fucking eat farts in a Borat 3. Yeah. Yeah. So like if a Borat 3

1062
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,600
comes out. A Borat 3, yeah he comes up to you and he's like, so you think like Donald Trump is awesome right?

1063
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,760
And you're like, yeah I love to eat farts. So there's a, so what I'm saying is if

1064
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,760
there's a Borat 3. Borat 3 is such a fool. We don't know if it's coming out. We don't know if it's coming out.

1065
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:51,800
but if there is and there's maybe a video of me saying that I fucking love to eat farts,

1066
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,240
then it's probably that he'd used movie magic and Final Cut Pro to make that look as a deceptive tool.

1067
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:59,880
He did some kind of YouTube poop sentence mixing.

1068
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:07,640
Basically, what I said was that I have a glove that I catch farts with and he edited it to say,

1069
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:13,240
"I love farts." And it's just wrong, dude. I think that what he does is wrong.

1070
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:14,200
True.

1071
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:14,920
Absolutely.

1072
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,920
and also John McCain was a hero. Let the boy get some pussy.

1075
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,920
They're going to dig up John McCain and give him the pussy he deserves. Rudy Giuliani. Why is

1076
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:34,920
Borat cock blocking Rudy Giuliani? He should not. Trying to get some snitch.

He's trying to get that golden snitch. He's trying to get that snitch.

00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,560
gooby splooging on me. Yeah. That's what you call him because that's what he's doing to you.

1105
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,660
Well that's what I was part of my job on the force. Yeah. I gotta suck him off.

1106
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,320
I gotta suck him down. He shoots tendrils on you. You call him rudely

1107
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:20,360
shooting longly because it takes so long. You're working overtime at the force.

1108
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:23,680
You call him gotta do my laundry because he's covering everything you own.

Everything in my room. And gooey ookie spider webs. Yeah. Oh my god.

1110
00:54:29,720 --> 00:54:32,920
He shoots big ropes from the front and back in my room.

1111
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,840
You call him shirtless feeling spongy because that's how much he saturates your shirt.

1112
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:37,240
True.

1113
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,600
It's like a cloud in the room.

1114
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,880
Yeah, I call him sock is very crunchy.

1115
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,440
Why is he shooting into your sock? You take your sock off and jerk off?

1116
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,880
It goes all the way into himself.

1117
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:51,720
Well, that's how it gets on the floor. I step on it.

1118
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:51,960
Yeah.

1119
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:56,600
It's like a tornado or a whirlpool.

1120
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,400
he's self-sucking I put him...

1121
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,400
What? No, you just said you suck him.

1122
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,400
Well I suck him but then he's like I can do it, alright?

1123
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,400
I'd rather you watch this.

1124
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,400
I'd rather you watch this and then he...

1125
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,400
I put him up onto the ceiling fan in my room

1126
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,400
and he's spinning around like a droideka

1127
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,400
and he's self-sucking on a ceiling fan.

1128
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,400
Like Rudy Lachezman, you devil.

1129
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,400
You ever seen like a microscopic view of the brain

1130
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,400
where you can see all the neurons?

1131
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,400
Like you know when it goes inside Jimmy Neutron's brain?

1132
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,400
That's what Pat's room looks like after...

1133
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:30,400
looks like after he's done.

1134
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,400
He's spinning around on that fan.

1135
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,400
Yeah.

1136
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,400
Spinning around on that fan.

1137
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,400
He's got ropes coming from the front and the back.

1138
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,400
He's got ropes coming from the front and the back.

1139
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
Looks like a street map of Boston.

1140
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,400
Just meandering roads that lead to nowhere.

1141
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:46,400
Just meandering roads that lead to nowhere.

1142
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,400
When I explode the room and come everywhere

1143
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,400
it's like a grid system.

1144
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,400
It's perfect.

1145
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
It's like a cube.

1146
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,400
When Rudy does it, it's like trying to get

1147
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,400
It's like a map of Wal-Mart.

1148
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:58,400
It's like a map of Harvard Square to Porter Square.

1149
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,400
Am I right?

1150
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:00,400
Yeah, that's right.

1151
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,400
What do you do?

1152
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,400
I'm going to hit my head with the microphone.

1153
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,400
That's cool.

1154
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,400
I don't think anybody likes that.

1155
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:11,120
We do need to find new ways to brain damage ourselves now that we don't have this gas

1156
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,120
leak clutch anymore.

1157
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,120
I'm set.

1158
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,120
Yeah, that's what I mean.

1159
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,120
You're hitting your head.

1160
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,120
Yeah, I'm hitting my head.

1161
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:17,120
That's good.

1162
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:20,280
I was thinking I might start holding my breath for like 20 minutes before we record.

1163
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,280
Ever tell you guys...

1164
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,400
You're just going to be breaking world records, man, you asshole.

1165
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,360
Okay, what should I do instead?

1166
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:29,240
That's something that isn't impressive and fucking coolest thing you could do.

1167
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,240
I mean it's not...

1168
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,240
Oh, I'm going to win an NBA championship.

1169
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,240
Okay, okay, hold on.

1170
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,240
You should...

1171
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:37,360
You should breathe out as much as you can.

1172
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,360
Not in, out.

1173
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:39,920
What do you mean?

1174
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:40,920
Like...

1175
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,240
I should just do that?

1176
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:49,160
You do that because then, what is it, CO2 leaving the body?

1177
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,160
You breathe...

1178
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,160
You breathe...

1179
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:54,920
Well, I just breathed out too much.

1180
00:56:54,920 --> 00:57:00,360
You breathe out so much CO2 that your room fills up with gas.

1181
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,160
You and me should just stand next to each other and breathe each other's CO2.

1182
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:07,100
Maybe we should all just, before we hit record every time, we should just spend five minutes

1183
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,100
hyperventilating together.

1184
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:09,760
It's a good idea.

1185
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,520
Honestly, we should try that sometime.

1186
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,480
Wouldn't that give us more oxygen?

1187
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,800
What's that thing where you lean over?

1188
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:18,800
I guess maybe Whippets.

1189
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,800
That's what people do.

1190
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,940
Oxygen bars and shit.

1191
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:22,940
People get like oxygen machines.

1192
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,240
Hyperventilating is not good for you though.

1193
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,720
I think it is. No it's not. You'll get it. It calms you down. You want to faint? That's

1194
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:32,600
a bad way to start an episode. I don't know. I'm trying to. I'm brainstorming here. You

1195
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,840
guys are tearing down every fucking thing I say. Just smell. Okay, come over to my house

1196
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:40,120
because I actually have a new fume. No you don't. Yeah I do. They're painting my roof

1197
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:44,480
with this paint that smells so fucked up. Oh fumes. That's actually a good idea. And

1198
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,240
all my windows have been like this my entire. I have a computer duster in my place. Yeah.

1199
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:50,080
A computer duster would be good. Yeah. We could do a computer duster episode. I have

1200
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,880
to tell you, before I forget, you were talking about holding your breath. When my little

1201
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:59,880
brother was like four he found out that he found out about suffocation mm-hmm

1202
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,280
and if he could if he lives my mom said like he couldn't play video games or

1203
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:08,920
something he gets so mad to be like I'm gonna hold my breath and then would like

1204
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:15,560
hold his breath until he got super rich just cuz he was like like you want to

1205
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:17,560
guess what he's so bad. He just sit there like...

1206
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,560
*makes weird noise*

1207
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,560
That's so funny.

1208
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:22,560
Sounds like a brat.

1209
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,560
Yeah, I think you have a monster family.

1210
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,560
If my kid did that shit I'd say, "Fuckin' do it, pussy."

1211
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,560
You won't, she won't.

1212
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:30,560
Smart.

1213
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,560
I dare you.

1214
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:36,560
How crazy your family is, you guys would probably drive the Adams family out of the neighborhood.

1215
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:37,560
Come on.

1216
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:40,560
That's true, my friend Adam did move in the third grade.

1217
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:46,560
Adam's family didn't move next door to me because he liked me more. Yeah,

1218
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:48,560
Adam's family, I could easily scare them.

1219
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:55,560
I'm so funny, finding out like your elementary school friend is moving and he's just moving to be like next door to his other friend.

1220
00:58:55,560 --> 00:58:57,560
Like he doesn't want to be next to you anymore.

1221
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:59,560
I could scare the Adam's family.

1222
00:58:59,560 --> 00:59:03,560
Yeah, it's easy. All you have to say is I'm normal. They don't understand it.

1223
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,560
I've been watching a bunch of old Adam's family on Pluto TV.

1224
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:10,560
I'd open their mailbox and put my big juicy ass in there, in their mailbox.

1225
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:14,480
and stuff it in like putting play-doh back in the box.

1226
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,820
You think the Adams family is afraid of sex?

1227
00:59:16,820 --> 00:59:19,640
Not sex, they're afraid of my ass in their mailbox, the way I've been farting.

1228
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,640
They want to see that.

1229
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:23,160
I haven't been eating meat so many times.

1230
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:24,760
They are crazy sexual.

1231
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,520
Even on the original show, they want to fuck so bad.

1232
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:28,520
What?

1233
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,520
That Gomez.

1234
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:33,880
There's like multiple jokes in the episode where Gomez will say a French word and then

1235
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,960
go like, "Wait a second, that's French."

1236
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:39,480
And then look at Morticia and they both go like, "Ahh, ahh, blah, blah, blah."

1237
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,880
and they fuck each other on screen.

1238
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:41,920
- Who's Gomez?

1239
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,640
- Gomez is the guy on Breaking Bad?

1240
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:44,480
- The little mustache. - Gomez Adams.

1241
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,480
- Gomey?

1242
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,320
- Yeah.

1243
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,800
- Wow.

1244
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:49,080
- Gomez, Morticia.

1245
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,600
- They got Fat Fuck, The Sun.

1246
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,160
- Pugsley, Wednesday.

1247
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:55,360
- Who's damn, they named their damn kid Wednesday.

1248
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:56,200
- What the hell's that?

1249
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:57,520
White people be wildin'.

1250
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,880
They got a cousin named It.

1251
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:04,240
- One of their friends, just a hand.

1252
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,520
- Yeah, every white people name's like Vester.

1253
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,840
- Lurch.

1254
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,120
Come on. White people, we have the stupidest names.

1255
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,120
[Laughter]

1256
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,120
Fester.

1257
01:00:14,120 --> 01:00:16,760
What kind of name is Fester?

1258
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:19,640
What the hell is that? Yeah. He laughs like this.

1259
01:00:19,640 --> 01:00:20,640
[Groans]

1260
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,280
Remember when he laughed like that in the movie?

1261
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:23,280
No.

1262
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:27,440
The comedian doesn't know about the Adams family. He just thinks it's just white people

1263
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,440
names.

1264
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:29,440
Yeah, I know.

1265
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:30,440
Yeah.

1266
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:31,440
Yeah.

1267
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:32,440
Yeah.

1268
01:00:32,440 --> 01:00:33,440
Chris Rock.

1269
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,440
What's the hand's name?

1270
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,440
The thing.

1271
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:36,440
Thing?

1272
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,440
Thing.
