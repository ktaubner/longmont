2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,800
Last time!

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,680
What the fuck?

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,180
What's up?

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:12,180
[Laughter]

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:13,180
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,180
No, no.

8
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,680
That's staying in there.

9
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,680
Yeah, I'm leaving it.

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,680
[Laughter]

11
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Last time on, uh, Gun City.

12
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
[Music]

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,680
The Temple of the Penguin of Doom.

14
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,680
Alright, now I have to find my fucking notes again.

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,680
I got so surprised.

16
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,180
There they are. Okay, cool.

17
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,680
The boys watched half of Employee of the Month before being whisked away from the hotel,

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,680
that's what she said, to the massive Gateway Gad Cow,

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,680
where beautiful Simon led them through a corridor of confused Ken Bones

20
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,680
and a Gattaca of sorts, where they took another elevator up into a lobby.

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,100
And then they saw Pennsylvania Jim

22
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:06,980
And Pennsylvania Jim was like very rude to them. It's just bullet points today

23
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:12,560
And they

24
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,440
Just Pennsylvania Jim was very rude to them and they went inside of the right they went inside to meet with the king of the

25
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,200
Gads Papa Gad who said to them that because they are

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:32,220
Gun city types and they lie tried to lie like seven times. They were not allowed to go into the

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,840
into the land caves

28
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,360
So then the baby dad told them

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,120
Well, I have another way that you could maybe do that if you go into this fighting ring

30
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:47,640
and the octagon which has but I think it had five sides instead of

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,240
What was it was six sides with six sides had six sides and so thank you. Yes. Yes, I didn't finish listening re listening

32
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,240
and then... Oh, am I looking at it now? Yeah, okay, I can see it now. It's right there.

33
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
Yeah, it has six sets.

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:09,240
They fought three enemies. They saw Snoochie Boochies, who was the mysterious masked fellow from the...

35
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:13,240
or mysterious hooded fellow from the auction.

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:20,240
Then they fought three guys. They saw Rex and Marie, who were there cheering them on.

37
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,840
They accidentally involved Sullivan in the fights, which almost led to his death again.

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:33,600
Ray William Johnson cleverly used his worm, no not that one, to trick another worm

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:40,880
into falling in love with it, and they killed that worm. Hmm, that's about it for the notes.

40
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,640
And I think that's literally what happened though. There was a hand too. Yes, there was a master hand

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,120
type of thing that shot bugs out of its palm which I liked. And it like pooped or something. I remember

42
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,200
it pooping. Did you make it poop? I don't remember. I didn't get to that part in editing yet. I just

43
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,920
remembered something about it pooping. Yeah. We could make it poop. You could add like a fart sound

44
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,040
in the edit. It could also not poop. There is one fart sound already. I posted this on Twitter but

45
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:15,200
I found a sound effect on Freesound called "relaxing fart" and it's just in the description was just a

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:30,200
a

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:37,200
is

48
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,200
dad

49
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,860
is you want to make sure he was stay true to his word

50
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,880
uh... but you didn't get a chance to your freedom found out

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,180
uh... but you guys basically as far as you know you wanted this tournament

52
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,240
you uh... are going to be a look at the passes tomorrow if you show back up to

53
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,660
the dads

54
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,660
uh... gateway cow

55
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,420
uh...

56
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:02,220
and tonight marie and uh... rex invited you guys out to get celebratory drinks

57
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,580
earlier on

58
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,980
so uh...

59
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,860
uh... we can come right to

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,500
uh... the bar in that case let's do that skill

61
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,200
or we can go

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,500
uh... no you're not

63
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,740
'cause it's only been

64
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:18,860
you can get like a short rest so we could do that where you can get a little

65
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:22,460
you know i don't know what not to do is going to drink will wait until we're

66
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,080
still working to get happen

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,100
yet nobody i'm not fights at a bar now

68
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,900
come on let's go to a bar and it's a good enough right now i'm i'm i'm going

69
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:35,120
to drinks maximum let's go to take a nap and you guys can go on ahead and then

70
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:53,600
and

71
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,040
level 5 in this one. So what that means is you have 5 hit dice you can spend per long

72
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:04,200
rest and you can spend those during short rest. What that means is that, see in the hit dice

73
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:10,840
area, Patrick in your character sheet, you gotta look at your character sheet.

74
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:14,360
We haven't done this in so long I forgot about the character sheets.

75
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,800
That's fine, just a critical part of the thing.

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,800
It's not.

77
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,200
It's fine. Definitely not for your experience.

78
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Stop freaking out at me.

79
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
[Laughter]

80
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,200
I'm sorry, you've had a lot of that this week. I should ease up.

81
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,200
[Laughter]

82
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:37,200
So, what that means is you can basically spend up to five of those hit dice.

83
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,200
And then you, whatever rolls you get from that, so it's like, you have D8, so you could spend like,

84
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:47,200
up to five during the short rest, and add that to your, to recovering your HP.

85
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:55,200
Um, so, you know, there's kind of like a, if you know you're not gonna have a long rest for a long time, there's kind of a strategy around that, right?

86
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,200
Where it's like, "Oh, I don't know if I want to spend too much, 'cause maybe I'll need it again."

87
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:06,200
Um, but, um, yeah, so you, I think you have D8, I'm pretty sure, uh, Blowtoss has D10.

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,200
So I just roll a D8 while we're walking?

89
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
Yeah, and then you'll subtract one on your hit dice part of your sheet, yeah.

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
You can roll up to, up to five if you want, so.

91
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,800
so but then we can't use the ones after for a long rest yeah well you just can't use them until you

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,760
get a long rest once you do a long rest it all replenishes yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna spend i'm

93
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,840
gonna spend three of them i don't even care me too i'm gonna do two i'm just gonna chill all right i

94
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,160
got a six i got six and seven okay cool so that's you can add 13 back so you're back at 30 that's

95
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,880
pretty good you might not want to spend another one just because you're max 34 you're gonna you're

96
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,080
You're gonna do blackjack?

97
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,580
No.

98
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,180
You already got locked in with Hit 'Em.

99
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,080
Oh, yeah.

100
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,980
Okay, 18 back.

101
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,280
Yes, you're at 27 now.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,180
Nice.

103
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,180
Yeah, cool.

104
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,680
That's just what I needed.

105
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
So yeah, the walk is particularly relaxing for you too.

106
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,080
Bray William Johnson though, you're just walking going,

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
"Ugh."

108
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,380
Just trailing behind.

109
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,380
Yeah.

110
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:11,480
Yeah, what, yeah, would you, do you, do you, that,

111
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,620
You guys are trailing behind breathing weirdly.

00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,720
Ray William Johnson, do you chat with Rex and Marie?

113
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,880
Do you chat with them on the walk?

114
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,320
No, I have a I have a paddle ball and I'm trying to beat my record

115
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,760
and I'm really focused on it.

116
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,960
Just keep me from sleeping.

117
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,060

It's really good.

122
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,820
Can you shut the fuck up?

123
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,460
I'm trying to hit 17.

124
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,760
Just like just like when we were dating.

125
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:37,420
Are you still vlogging?

126
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,560
Nope.

127
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,520
I'm just going to talk to Rex.

128

Go higher! Get higher on the back. Okay I'm trying to get higher. So you had to bet the bar.

143
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:56,600
Ow! It's too fucking hard! The bar is called, I think I gave him a good name with it, yeah

144
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Yeah, the gadfly. It's a very, yeah, it's a very popular bar in Gadsville.

145
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:11,600
You know, it's got a, you go in there, it's like a very classic looking bar, like a real New York style, like you're in a New York style bar.

146
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,600
And there's a guy trying to do his tight five in the back to an unenthused crowd of Ken Bones, like three or four.

147
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:48,600
and

148
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,720
but it's also 'cause it was

149
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,880
jet you know this is like a bar you go to after a big thing and there's just a

150
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,960
fight tournament you see people giving you like appreciative nods like hey good

151
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,080
job in there

152
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,840
things like that so it's nothing

153
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,920
nothing too rowdy

154
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
i wanna get on the lineup for the stand up

155
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,800
okay cool yeah you get on line there's like there's three ken bones in front of

156
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,720
you

157
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
you look you look over their shoulders

158
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,160
they're all going over their index cards and they're moving in the exact same way

159
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:30,160
a

160
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,360
Okay, all right. Well, I'll check that off the list. No darts for Patrick Yoda.

161
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,360
No darts. I think I'm going to see what the indoor hopscotch is all about.

162
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:48,560
Yeah, for sure. So there's like a little nook. So it's like the darts. Picture a bar where it's

163
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,680
like you got the bar, you walk in, bar on the right side. In the back you have like a little

164
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,600
tiny stage where people can do like their poetry or stand up or whatever and then you have like a dart

165
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,400

and she says uh...

409
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,760
and it looks like a she says that you would and it's like a blank cd-rom

410
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,000
like with a piece of string around it

411
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,600
uh... tied to it and she's like

412
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,100
this amulet uh...

413
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,200
leo said it's going to supposed to help you guys are you in the cave or in the

414
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,760
land caves and

415
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:21,880
to be honest i'd

416
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,640
does also something else i want to tell you fellas size giving this to you and

417
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,320
she slides the amulet over

418
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,480
and she says uh...

419
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,740
i wanted you to let you guys know to be

420
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,420
careful about jim

421
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,860
and you see rex nodding a bit more

422
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,740
pennsylvania jim specifically

423
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,940
okay

424
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,360
and yeah because before i i they could have been jim sturgis and i'm not jim

425
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,220
brewer

426
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,100
yeah uh... well-made

427
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,760
he's gonna be nice i do

428
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,980
i thought what would happen is that

429
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,180
jim brewer would be talking

430
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,260
and i would think it was a cdc guy

431
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:57,100
because he's so good at that impression i mean i'm on a roof

432
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,020
come on he sounds just like him

433
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,980
yeah i'm not familiar with this work but uh... you know i have you heard a look

434
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,420
at you have you heard jim brewer story about norma donald garner griska dandy

435
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,900
while all it's great

436
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,980
that's not like what he said it would lead to a story but i'd like to listen

437
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,500
to but

438
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,460
has a go

439
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,780
i don't know how the story and i don't know if you're going to talk about

440
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,180
something

441
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:26,340
and he spent ten minutes recalling this jim brewer bit incorrectly yet is

442
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:31,620
fucking it up. I think that Chris Kattan called Norm McDonald.

443
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,380
Or something like that. Yeah, but yeah, she says,

444
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,860
so when we, after everything went down back at Leo's Place,

445
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,620
we searched around. Rex and I were curious about everything going on, about

446
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,820
what happened, how the ninjas get in there, and we started to search around

447
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,260
the place and we found this. And she puts on the

448
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:57,260
the table a

449
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:01,920
uh... what looks to what looks like a uh... ninja star

450
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,500
trapped in jail

451
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,800
and

452
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,260
she's like

453
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:11,700
uh... he's the only person we know puts things in jail

454
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,100
thinking i've had something to do with the ninjas

455
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,100
and just as likely to which they did not sound

456
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,340
do you remember from

457
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,780
yeti you remember

458
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:27,580
is a miser and he was there about a day ago in the in the fiction

459
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,100
you remember

460
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,420
i thought it was just a lousy he'd myself

461
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:36,340
no wasn't snow mysore he'd miser was two ninjas who's a little is not what it

462
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,100

00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,880
it was a red and blue from halo

465
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,980

466
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,020

00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,180

that's exciting uh...

474
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,200
uh... you see rex starts to talk

475
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,460
i've worked with the group like that

476
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,680

00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,020

00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,280
uh... i mean i don't think so but it would have a lot say i guess

518
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,860
it doesn't this doesn't add up

519
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:27,080
now so there's a heat myseryn up

520
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,160
goldman

521
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,560
what will play out of the heat mysore touched it it's not just the story is

522
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,320
stupid dude

523
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,920
uh...

524
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:42,080
they're not they're not a heat mysore or snow snow mysore

525
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,380
that we thought that

526
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,820
they're literally

527
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,840
named on the island with us

528
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,880
note that was not those were two members of this creole a unit

529
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,480
that have since defected

530
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,740
and there are at least three others

531
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,940
so you're telling me that snow mysery and he'd mysery were in a crayola kids

532
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:03,000
unit

533
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,720
now i'm not telling you anything close to that

534
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,700
you are telling you that

535
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:10,560
is you know who is telling you something getting mad

536
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,920
and uh...

537
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,700
you see uh... you see now uh... somebody uh...

538
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,200
the summary sort of go like a

539
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,600
okay okay we're getting a little bit confused here the point is

540
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,840
is that there are at least of a group of people that we think are

541
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,700
coming after this we think jim

542
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,760
could be involved or he could be stopping it but the point is that he was

543
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,200
at least aware enough to start trapping

544
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,320
or at least putting ninja stars inside of jello

545
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,520
and we just think what about putting

546
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,120
no that's that's no jello not putting jello pudding

547
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,880
now patella putting

548
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,200
now and now i just don't i don't under can you repeat everything

549
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,860
that we were just talking about i don't remember

550
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,800
and she repeats it verbatim

551
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:56,980
and and even with the disagreements in the mid miss hearings

552
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,560
the way i said flying spaghetti monster

553
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,340
uh... it's all being repeated back to you

554
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,800
okay so putting

555
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,400
you can't

556
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,600
and sorry can you repeat that one more time

557
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:14,280

Uh, and then you can walk back in. You look like an arcade repair man. Yeah. Could you describe

635
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:45,060

636
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,940
a mechanic combined with Mario.

637
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,940
Okay, so it's just Mario?

639
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
Okay, but I have a toolbox though.

00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,940
Okay, so you're dressed up like Mario, you're carrying a toolbox.

641
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,940
Not fully like Mario, it's like a Mario hat, but with like, you know, a mechanic's...

642
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:05,940
Yeah, with like overalls and a red shirt.

643
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:09,940
It's like Mario, but not color-coded to be Mario, you know what I mean?

644
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:10,940
Oh, okay.

645
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:12,940

daughter said that there was a arcade repairman

664
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:08,540
Hello, I'm the Arcade Repairman and I'm here to fix your machines.

665
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,380
That wasn't the accent she said it was, but she could get that wrong.

666
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:17,820
Yeah, roll Deception.

667
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,980
I guess I said you should get it with advantage.

668
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:24,220
Because I'm obviously an Arcade Repairman.

669
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,220
At the very least...

670
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:29,820
I love Dungeons and Dragons so much.

671
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,500
Ten.

672
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Okay, I'm going to roll his inside against that.

673
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Can you roll a dice with zero numbers on it?

674
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Hmm.

675
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,500
Oh, homie got an 11.

676
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,500
Oh no!

677
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:46,500
So he's looking at you up and down and he's like,

678
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,500
"I don't remember calling an arcade repairman."

679
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Wait, can I turn the corner dressed up like an arcade repairman?

680
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:58,500
And I turn the corner dressed as a French maid.

681
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:05,740
Okay, here's what I'm gonna do because you absolutely do not have any of that fucking shit with you

682
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:10,360
I have a sharpie and I just sharpie black on myself in the

683
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:17,140
What I should let you do I should let you because you are like part computer

684
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,300
you should be able to like

685
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:27,080
3d maybe you could 3d print outfits for you guys very quickly 3d print everything and I want you to roll but I do want

686
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:28,260
you to roll a

687
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:33,580
Because I think your spellcasting is is governed by your charisma. So just roll a straight charisma check

688
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:38,060
So just hit and just see yeah, I got an 18 8 16

689
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,300
Yeah, so yeah, you print out a very nice-looking

690
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,940
French made outfit for yourself and a pretty convincing

691
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,820
arcade man

692
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:55,620
Arcade repair man outfit for Patrick Yoda. So yeah, I turn the corner and I look at Cameron and I go

693
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,840
Hey, this guy's impersonating me

694
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:07,260
The arcade repair man, oh no you found me

695
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:15,000
And I run I don't run out of the hotel I just run upstairs to the

696
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,100
You see the you see the worm who's like, all right, I gotta get that guy now

697
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,820
When he starts going slithering up to find you.

698
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:28,300
Okay, and I just kind of disappointedly look down at my French maid outfit,

699
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,140
realizing I never got to use it.

700
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:33,820
So I go behind the counter and I get the arcade key.

701
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,580
Nobody's manning the desk now, yeah.

702
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,220
Okay, I sit in front, behind the desk.

703
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,260
In my French maid outfit.

704
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:45,020
Okay, I get the arcade key and I go, I play Galaga.

705
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,140
Yeah, you play Galaga.

706
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:50,300
Meanwhile, Cameron, you are running away from the person who's-

707
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:57,340
I turn it staying at this hotel. I turn invisible. Perfect. Yeah, you turn invisible. So, um, uh,

708
00:37:57,340 --> 00:38:01,820
what I will have you do is roll a stealth check to see if like you turn invisible without him

709
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:06,780
noticing you turn invisible like when you turn a corner or if you do it like right in front of him.

710
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,940
Do you know what I mean? 14. Okay. Yeah. So you turn a corner, turn invisible. You hear like,

711
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:19,660
you know, worm slithering noises and like he looks or he's like, what the hell? Where did that guy go?

712
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,260
And I lock him in the bathroom.

713
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
You lock him in the bathroom.

714
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,260
We're in the bathroom.

715
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:26,260
Describe the process.

716
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:30,060
No, no, the bathroom is, I'll say the bathroom is.

717
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,780
Where are we right now?

718
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:34,220
You're on like the second floor of the hotel.

719
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,220
Like just in the hallway?

720
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,160
There's no public bathrooms really in the second floor of a hotel.

721
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:43,460
So there is probably like a supply closet, but it's probably locked.

722
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,300
And there might be, I'm thinking of rooms that there might be on the second floor of

723
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,180
a hotel.

724
00:38:48,180 --> 00:39:03,180
the

725
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:09,420
it. Okay, I'm really bad at performance. 15. Holy shit. That was my yep. I was gonna say

726
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,380
he's bad at it. But if he gets 15 or bubble, it happens.

727
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,300
So I make it sound like I'm going, you'll never find me in here.

728
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:24,860
Okay, I'm gonna have a roll. Now I guess you know what I really gave that performance. I have to

729
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:30,860
just let that happen. So he goes, he slithers over to the supply closet. He's jangling fiddling with

730
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:45,860
is

731
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,160
He opens up that supply closet door and he looks in there and he's looking in there you have like

732
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,440
You have a moment in there. Okay

733
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,500
Roll athletics, I would say okay 19. Yeah, you fucking deck him. I

734
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:05,760
Heard him. I just want to push it. He's fine, but he's like he's thoroughly in there. Okay, and I locked it

735
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,560
Yeah, I mean the door is locked like yeah you you

736
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:16,300
Yeah, you it's like one of those, you know, it locks all the way so he's just locked in there. Hey somebody let me out

737
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,540
of here

738
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,540
Somebody let me

739
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:26,780
Go downstairs to the arcade and I go guys we're gaming all night tonight, but I forget I'm still invisible and it scares the shit

740
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:34,860
The daughter comes out to the front desk like dad, can I help you?

741
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,820
Aren't you that guy who's staying in the second floor?

742
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,300
Um if you're not gonna rent a room, you're gonna need to leave the

743
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:46,060
building. I have to think about the safety of our guests before anything

744
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:49,740
else. And so the the the that's all folks kind of a

745
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:57,300
silhouette closes in on you and it opens back up immediately and she says,

746
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,580
what are you doing here?

747
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:04,060
I'm gonna go play video games. I don't need this bullshit.

748
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:09,420
So I storm off and I start playing Frogger and then I

749
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,820
kind of remember earlier ago

750
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,540
i'm so tough for all go well

751
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,660
it's all good

752
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,180
on such a damn fraud

753
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:19,100
meanwhile solvent like went to bed

754
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,380
but he was not a part of that at all

755
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:22,560
uh... yeah

756
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:26,020
so it's the uh... you guys stay there all night

757
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:30,980
in the arcade yeah i don't i'm not long resting i i do not sleep

758
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:35,740
i'm in a long rest i'm gonna i'm gonna play for as long as i possibly can

759
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:40,440
And still long rest so it depends when you want to go there. So a long rest

760
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:43,180
I usually say is like eight hours, right?

761
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:48,740
So you can if you want to get your full your full eight hours and you can do that

762
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,920
And then go to the god. I mean, there's no time limit on when you go to the

763
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:59,460
Cow place except the next day so it can be like the afternoon so you can play from like it's like four

764
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,480
Probably 415 now after all the hijinks so until

765
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,180
until whenever

766
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,300
Yeah, why not?

767
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:15,400
Yeah, I got so many coins dude you go to bed like to your room or do you sleep curled up in front of the arcade

768
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,980
machine I

769
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,780
little cat

770
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:20,780
There's the what's that game?

771
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:24,020
Yes

772
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:26,020
No, okay

773
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:31,580
The fast and furious car. Oh, yeah with the seat. I fall asleep. Yeah. Yeah

774
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:35,860
Yeah, I sleep in one of the like Jurassic Park ones that's like a whole Jeep and it has like a curtain

775
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:41,800
So you can like go inside and curl up in there. Yeah, and yeah, Ray William Johnson uses his

776
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,220
Being a demon and a computer probably just makes you

777
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:52,580
Just insane when you play video games you just yeah, you're in it cracked dude. Yeah. Yeah

778
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,500
So yeah, like six hours go by

779
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:59,320
Then eight hours go by it's the next day

780
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:06,880
Luckily you see like now that there's like there's like just children in the in the in the arcade room

781
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,880
You guys are sleeping in there

782
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,740
And they're just playing whatever games they can that and haven't been you see one of them is like poking you Ray Willing

783
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:16,740
Johnson's like it's my turn

784
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:25,000
No, I want to play. This is a game for frogs by frogs get the fuck out of here. Not a frog ribbit

785
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,980
Yeah, and

786
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,980
Is my health back up now?

787
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:35,980
Yeah, you two have full health, full hit dice again, full techno slime points too.

788
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:38,980
And I'm really good at Frogger now.

789
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,980
Yeah, you're not really good at Frogger.

790
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,980
That'll come in handy later. I made a smart decision.

791
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:50,980
So yeah, you guys can go if you want to the GAD cow.

792
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:52,980
So yeah, we should go to the GAD cow.

793
00:43:52,980 --> 00:44:05,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you go to the guide cow before as you're leaving you see the the worm woman

794
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:10,500
daughter sort of sitting at the desk and she says to you guys, you guys came in late last

795
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:11,500
night right?

796
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:16,580
It was all this commotion with the NF you heard all the commotion or whatever, but there was

797
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,900
this weird guy who came in here his name he was calling himself an arcade repairman and

798
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,900
I'm still wearing the French Bias.

799
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:24,900
Oh I've heard of those, that's a legitimate profession.

800
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,900
You're still wearing the French Bias.

801
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,900
I'm still wearing it and I go, "What are you talking about you dumb bitch?"

802
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,900
I literally saw you and also like we're so over that now.

803
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,900
Okay.

804
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:44,900
It's 22, or 2246, 7? So we're so done with that kind of misogynist kind of talk.

805
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:51,980
Anyway, so I was just wondering if you'd seen my dad anywhere so he just I just haven't seen him this morning at all

806
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,980
I'm getting a little worried

807
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,100
Oh

808
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,260
I would just say like

809
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,580
Keep your ear to the ground and you might find him. I have my fingers in my ears

810
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:11,400
All right, well one of you was cryptic but at least a little helpful so thank you

811
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,340
What he was mean the other ones Yoda, I guess

812
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:22,940
That's the classic the classic good cop bad cop Yoda

813
00:45:22,940 --> 00:45:28,440
And yeah, so the four of you with solvent, you know

814
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:31,860
Trailing behind head over to the Gateway cow

815
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:38,080
Takes you a little bit longer to get there because you're not riding in beautiful Simon's sweet Walmart

816
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,020
vehicle

817
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:44,700
uh... but you get there against what sort of the outskirts of gadsville where

818
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,340
there is some of the

819
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,040
you know more space for things like uh... uh... you know people who land planes

822
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,580
uh... the hoof

823
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,600
uh... opens up

824
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,100

825
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:03,920

826
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,980

I'm still holding him up.

829
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,980
He then holds you up. He like switches.

830
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,980
You guys have to switch.

831
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:21,980
Yeah, so you guys all are able to get in there.

832
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:25,980
You see beautiful Simon's face like pop up on the screen inside the elevator.

833
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:29,980
And they're like, "Welcome back, fellas!"

834
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:32,980
And the elevator starts to go up to that floor.

835
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:35,980
You walk down the long hallway with all the Ken Bone technicians.

836
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:42,980
and

837
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:46,980
to the lobby and this time there's no waiting for the king

838
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:52,980
You see a beautiful Simon in in person as much as a V fo can be in person say

839
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:58,980
You're all welcome to come in whenever the king is excited to see you

840
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:04,020

00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,480
ring

908
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,760

912
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,320

913
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,420
cfd's weird

914
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:11,520
all of us

915
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,140
yet just all of you will see

916
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:15,160
for how to can we add it up

917
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:17,720
absolutely not

918
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,280
but they like four liars at a time it all twenty one did

919
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:26,200
yeah okay uh... that's pretty good but the other two are pretty bad concerning

920
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:27,360
the five

921
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,320
so there is a sort of uses like he says like

922
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:37,680
i don't know if it's true but let's just put it this way to get his voice back

923
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:40,560
if i hear anything else about that

924
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,160
you're gonna be in for a serious world of trouble

925
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,080
we'll tolerate that kind of time for a catsville

926
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,560
okay you still we had still

927
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:50,200
and then you know you're gonna fly on your head

928
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,760
them among great

929
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:54,920
where he's like feeling around to get that fly off you

930
00:50:54,920 --> 00:51:00,920
I shoot my frog tongue at his head and I grab the fly.

931
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:02,920
You don't have a frog tongue.

932
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,920
I'm straight up a frog right now.

933
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:08,920
And then I hop away.

934
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,920
Roll to see if you're a frog.

935
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,920
What do I have to roll?

936
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,920
Just roll whatever you want, man.

937
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:17,920
Alright, okay. I'm gonna roll a D100 and if I get more than 5...

938
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,920
Yeah.

939
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,920
Dude, 54.

940
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:28,920
and

941
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,920
There's still more game left.

942
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,920
There's still time.

943
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:34,920
There's still time.

944
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,920
So you guys are sort of ushered out of the room.

945
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,920
He sort of gives you a little warning about the fighting ring.

946
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,920
And yeah, so you can go to the land caves now.

947
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:46,920
So they are sort of at the edge of town, where the wall is,

948
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:56,920
or the wall between the town itself of Gadsville and the soy wastes.

949
00:51:56,920 --> 00:51:59,520
So there's a vast sort of plateau.

950
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,120
There's a Yeti there.

951
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:03,820
There's a Yeti in the soy waste deep in the soy waste.

952
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,220
That's where Rex and Marie went.

953
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,020
Can I call out to the Yeti?

954
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,920
It's so far away.

955
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,720
Can I like

956
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:13,320

957
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,320

958
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,220
Can you make it loud?

959
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,820
Can I make the Yeti call loud?

960
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:21,720
You know what you could do?

961
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,420
You do have Marie and Rex's number.

962
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:28,040

can i please talk to the eddie

998
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:04,560
thanks uh... he's a good idea

999
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:09,620
uh... so i think christie

1000
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,780
so uh... yeah

1001
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:15,180
uh... you guys we're going to answer what i think iraq

1002
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:33,180
I'm

1003
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:39,180
an elevator there, you guys can flash your passes, it opens up, it lets you in the elevator,

1004
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:44,860
it brings you up pretty far up the mountain. The only other way to get there would have

1005
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:48,940
been to basically jump from the top of the cow, which would have meant you had to get

1006
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:53,740
on top of the cow. So as you go up, you start to see the cow come into view, you see the

1007
00:54:53,740 --> 00:54:57,860
head of the cow is pretty near you, and when you get out there's a little ledge, you can

1008
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:03,020
walk along and get to the entrance of the caves. And in the entrance of the caves, though, you

1009
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:08,740
You see there's like sort of a number of these like metal sort of like like perfectly like

1010
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:15,900
cube ish like prisms almost sort of similar to a drawing that the drawing that Joey did.

1011
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:19,420
If you look at the mountains in the background of it, that's basically what the land caves

1012
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,420
look like.

1013
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,420
He he got it.

1014
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:22,420
He got it.

1015
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,940
He got it in one.

1016
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:31,180
And so what is coming out of those land caves are these wires.

1017
00:55:31,180 --> 00:55:35,500
like wires that are a bunch of different colors and they slither around and they're like hissing

1018
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:40,460
and like a little bit like a little bit of sparks are coming out of it. So, these are like wires

1019
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:45,500
that like sort of act like snakes almost and attack anybody who walks by which is why people typically

1020
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:54,140
don't go into the land caves unless they're a little bit crazy. So yeah, you guys are about like

1021
00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:09,140
the

1022
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:15,140
What's the Eddie call sound like?

1023
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:20,140
So sort of like Chewbacca.

1024
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:25,140
Yeah. Yeah, man. It's weird. Everyone feels a little weird about it.

1025
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:30,140
It happens. It doesn't affect the like the wires don't like react to it.

1026
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:35,140
They seem to be sort of like their own kind of sentient sentient like non sentient thing.

1027
00:56:35,140 --> 00:56:39,140
their own kind of sentient, sentient, like non-sentient thing.

1028
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:43,140
Oh, fuck my ass. I fucking hate Roll20 sometimes.

1029
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:47,140
Uh, yeah. That's what happens, though.

1030
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,140
Nothing else, though. What do we got, you guys?

1031
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:55,140
Sorry, game. No, that's not... Come on, you don't have to do that.

1032
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,140
I'm gonna gracefully dance through the wires.

1033
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:03,140
Ooh, that's cool. Yeah.

1034
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:05,140
the

1035
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:07,140
the

1036
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,140
the

1037
00:57:09,140 --> 00:57:11,140
the

1038
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,140
the

1039
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:15,140
the

1040
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:17,140
the

1041
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:19,140
the

1042
00:57:19,140 --> 00:57:21,140
the

1043
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,140
the

1044
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:25,140
the

1045
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,140
the

1046
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,140
the

1047
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:31,140
the

1048
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:46,140
is

1049
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,440
is like, you know, he's a frog.

1050
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:51,440
Did I throw a frog 40 feet right?

1051
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,240
He's not a frog size though.

1052
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:54,940
He's like Patrick Yoda size.

1053
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:59,120
So you could probably get him like a good you could probably

1054
00:57:59,120 --> 00:58:00,440
throw him like 30 feet.

1055
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,140
Now I think about it because you are a big strong demon.

1056
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:03,740
Yeah.

1057
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,920
So if you want to you can definitely try to throw him

1058
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:07,840
into that.

1059
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:09,240
Okay.

1060
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,020
So I also just remembered we're supposed to get his his the

1061
00:58:12,020 --> 00:58:13,840
results for his DNA test.

1062
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:17,280
i guess i i pick them up and i say

1063
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,420
lesson

1064
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,220
who knows what's gonna happen in the next couple seconds

1065
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:24,100
well you know it was a little bit

1066
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,020
okay

1067
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,700
before whatever happens happens

1068
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,260
for a very long

1069
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:33,460
yet what or ethnicity are you

1070
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,860
what

1071
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:36,700
what's up i'm a frog

1072
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:38,740
what's your d_n_a_ what

1073
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:42,580
what at what it was the results of your d_n_a_ test

1074
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,000
this there is a member there is that you know this is to say he was going to give

1075
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:47,760
us the results only a

1076
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,920
uh... shit uh...

1077
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:56,080
farc do i have to do i have to give you the results right now

1078
00:58:56,080 --> 00:59:02,780
okay however can and here it comes iraq i'm i'm so excited

1079
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:04,260
it's

1080
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:06,440
became back

1081
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:10,180
And it said it just said I'm a quarter Cherokee nothing else

1082
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:18,160
Well as your people say hasta la vista

1083
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,320
three

1084
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:44,460
Throw him like 11 feet you just throw him like on the ground

1085
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:48,720
And he takes

1086
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,360
Some damage oh no, dude, he's gonna die

1087
00:59:53,360 --> 01:00:03,000
Takes three damage. She's okay. How much HP does he have? He is 10

1088
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
the

1089
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:17,000
the

1090
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:21,000
You could probably throw him about 30 if you get a successful throw.

1091
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,500
Because he is a little guy and you're a big demon.

1092
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,000
If your throw is successful.

1093
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:26,500
I think I'm going to pick him back up.

1094
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:29,500
Okay. He is absolutely at your mercy.

1095
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,000
He's like, "Oh, God, my head."

1096
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,000
He's like, trying to figure out where he is.

1097
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:39,000
It's a concussion. I'm going to throw you to a hospital. Just close your eyes.

1098
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,000
As you get closer to the land cape,

1099
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,000
you can hear the hissing sound coming from the wires a little bit more.

1100
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,900
more it sounds like it's a hissing but it's also like

1101
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:53,400
sparks. It's like a you can see the wires there. They're not

1102
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,900
small like they're pretty big like they're kind of like

1103
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:59,500
anaconda size and you sort of get a better sense of that as

1104
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:02,400
you move closer and you throw him to roll roll roll on the

1105
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,100
shrink check.

1106
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:08,000
13. Yeah, you got it. That's a success. So it's just above

1107
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:11,700
10 to just throw him successfully. Okay, you just launch

1108
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:17,900
solve in the frog and he's like and just like lands admits the wires.

1109
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,500
Let's see how he does here.

1110
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,300
He's going to be fun.

1111
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,900
There's no way he dies.

1112
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:26,400
So first he's going to have to take some damage.

1113
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:34,100
Which I guess and someone can tell me if I'm I know that in DND,

1114
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:38,000
it's like 1d 6 for 10 feet of falling damage, but I'm considering

1115
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:51,640
this

1116
01:01:51,640 --> 01:01:54,640
He only took 5 more damage, so he's at 2 HP.

1117
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,640
He is in trouble, and he's among the wires.

1118
01:01:57,640 --> 01:02:00,640
Let's see how he does dodging the snakes.

1119
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,640
Why is he at 2 HP? Wait...

1120
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,640
He's a civilian, basically.

1121
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,640
He might...

1122
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:12,640
Okay, let's see...

1123
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,640
They do... How much damage did they do again?

1124
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,640
Did you kill Sullivan?

1125
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,640
You might just not know

1126
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:35,020
So he did not make the dexterity saving throw

1127
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:41,480
The snakes just the snake wire things just went after him. He is knocked out cold

1128
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:47,520
He's knocked out cold, here's what I'll say we're playing real D&D

1129
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:54,140
You are 30 feet away. You have 30 feet of movement is in like in like a single round of yeah, right?

1130
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:59,520
The way death saving throws work the right wires aren't gonna keep going after him. He's dead, right?

1131
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,160
so the way that this works is

1132
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:08,240
You know for every you know round of combat that he's passed out. We do a death saving throw

1133
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:14,600
So we're gonna start like we're to consider like like initiative is started quote-unquote

1134
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,920
But your goal is to revive Sullivan in time

1135
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:23,720
So you're gonna have to get over there in the 30 feet of movement avoid the wires

1136
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,840
And you're 30 feet away. They're 40 feet away

1137
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,280
so

1138
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:31,280
so

1139
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,080
Everyone roll initiative. I'm gonna roll initiative for Sullivan as well. Okay

1140
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:38,480
15

1141
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,760
For I got six

1142
01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:46,960
It's only gonna bet 20 on initiative. Yo, let's go

1143
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:50,520
That's

1144
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:54,440
All the death roll fast. I'm gonna get you out of there Sullivan

1145
01:03:54,440 --> 01:04:00,760
All right. So first solve it's gonna roll his death saving throw. Oh my god, dude, you killed Sullivan. Okay, it's a success

1146
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:06,360
It's one success one success. So he needs three successes or he can get three failures and he'll die

1147
01:04:06,360 --> 01:04:11,720
Yeah, and so he's still he's so successful now Patrick Yoda. It's your turn

1148
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:18,720
and

1149
01:04:18,720 --> 01:04:25,720
sure

1150
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:35,260
uh... where can you draw the wires on here yes i will be drawn them

1151
01:04:35,260 --> 01:04:39,740
yeah i think that's what i'm gonna do for sure

1152
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,380
so they're sort of like this

1153
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,500
okay

1154
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:50,500
to

1155
01:04:50,500 --> 01:05:10,900
is

1156
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:25,900
is

1157
01:05:25,900 --> 01:05:48,260
in

1158
01:05:48,260 --> 01:06:02,220
he

1159
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:14,220
a

1160
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:17,220
and what happens and what stabilize them basically

1161
01:06:17,220 --> 01:06:20,760
so stabilizing them while you're waiting for these wires and instantly attack

1162
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,660
anything will probably lead to you

1163
01:06:22,660 --> 01:06:27,100
getting attacked instead of an ultimate attack and what what happens if solvent

1164
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:30,340
is hit now that he's already knocked out

1165
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:31,060
uh...

1166
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:32,780
so if he is uh...

1167
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:36,980
for the technical rule the actual d_n_d_ rule is but the rule i do

1168
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:38,980
is that if his h_p_

1169
01:06:38,980 --> 01:06:41,120
drops below

1170
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:43,580
uh... like negative

1171
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:46,180
his total, he's dead.

1172
01:06:46,180 --> 01:06:47,180
Oh, okay.

1173
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:48,180
Mmm.

1174
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:56,180
So, and these things, damage-wise, yeah, they do 2d8 damage.

1175
01:06:56,180 --> 01:06:57,860
Oh, okay.

1176
01:06:57,860 --> 01:07:00,580
So they could kill him if you force pull him out of there.

1177
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:01,580
Absolutely.

1178
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:02,580
Thanks, Caleb.

1179
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:12,380
Can I hoverboard attack all four of them?

1180
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,380
So yeah, here's what we...

1181
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,380
There's... so what you can do...

1182
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:22,380
I'm imagining like a cover for this episode that's like the Batman like death in the family arc.

1183
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:28,380
[Laughter]

1184
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,380
You can... here's what I'll say, there's a couple of things you have.

1185
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:35,380
So first of all, you obviously have used the force.

1186
01:07:35,380 --> 01:07:41,380
So that is a way where you can get like, you know, you're able to like fly at that point

1187
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:45,380
and your movement speed is increased as well.

1188
01:07:45,380 --> 01:07:49,380
Wait, can I shoot a foreskin?

1189
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:53,380
It's 30 feet, I can shoot foreskin. So can I shoot the foreskin at

1190
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:57,380
Sullivan? That's not a bad idea.

1191
01:07:57,380 --> 01:08:01,380
Oh yeah, because it shields you. And it heals for HP.

1192
01:08:01,380 --> 01:08:05,380
And so what it can also do, I will say that it can also force

1193
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,380
these wires to make, probably strength checks to move as effectively

1194
01:08:09,380 --> 01:08:11,580
because they will essentially be caught in the net as well.

1195
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,580
I think that's totally...

1196
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:14,580
You're a genius, Patrick.

1197
01:08:14,580 --> 01:08:16,080
I think that's a totally viable move.

1198
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,580
So yeah, cast Foreskin.

1199
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,580
Okay, cool.

1200
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:24,580
So that's gonna be 3 Technoslime points here down to 10.

1201
01:08:24,580 --> 01:08:25,580
Okay.

1202
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:28,580
But that's okay. Just wanna make sure we can track that.

1203
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:35,580
And yeah, roll 1d10 +4.

1204
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:50,060
the

1205
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,060
the D10 and it's 4 so...

1206
01:08:52,060 --> 01:08:54,060
Oh shit yeah you're right I'm sorry yeah he's at 8 HP

1207
01:08:54,060 --> 01:08:56,060
so you hear him underneath your weird

1208
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:58,060
four skin thing

1209
01:08:58,060 --> 01:09:00,060
you hear him like *gasp*

1210
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:02,060
and like um

1211
01:09:02,060 --> 01:09:04,060
he's like starting to like move around and scurry

1212
01:09:04,060 --> 01:09:06,060
and you see the wires underneath start to

1213
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:08,060
move around too to try and...

1214
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:10,060
Don't move Sullivan stay still

1215
01:09:10,060 --> 01:09:12,060
Wha-wha-what?

1216
01:09:12,060 --> 01:09:14,060
You don't have to say what I literally

1217
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,060
it was a very easy instruction

1218
01:09:16,060 --> 01:09:18,060
I pull up the flap and I just go

1219
01:09:18,060 --> 01:09:20,060
"DO SKELETOR!"

1220
01:09:20,060 --> 01:09:22,060
"YOU CAN'T DO THAT!"

1221
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,060
"I LOVE YOU GAY!"

1222
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:26,060
David Thoreau, Patrick Yoda.

1223
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:28,060
Four.

1224
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:37,060
Yeah, okay. So why you open it and you start yelling your weird thing and one of the wires like whoosh, like whips out, because you're underneath it now, so you're sort of in...

1225
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:39,060
Oh wait, I didn't know how it worked.

1226
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:40,060
Oh yeah.

1227
01:09:40,060 --> 01:09:41,060
What?

1228
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:42,060
You don't want to do that anymore?

1229
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:43,060
No.

1230
01:09:43,060 --> 01:09:44,060
Okay, yeah.

1231
01:09:44,060 --> 01:09:51,060
I thought it was, okay, I thought that the foreskin was my penis skin. I thought that I had a really long foreskin.

1232
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:58,060
and

1233
01:09:58,060 --> 01:10:05,060
of

1234
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:12,060
on

1235
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:19,060
is

1236
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:22,740
uh... from the game football right

1237
01:10:22,740 --> 01:10:25,660
all right so you have to do that you have to

1238
01:10:25,660 --> 01:10:28,140
poem at the foreskin though too

1239
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:30,380
so it is carried a foreskin with us

1240
01:10:30,380 --> 01:10:33,900
i mean just based on what i what i believe is true in the game okay

1241
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,940
it's tough to have to basically have a happy with the political

1242
01:10:37,940 --> 01:10:40,640
those cute so you'll have to sort of bunch it up

1243
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:45,060
business is like thirty feet of foreskin that is how it's not going to be

1244
01:10:45,060 --> 01:10:49,020
like thirty feet by thirty feet of force could you allow a lot of

1245
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:52,900
but just to cover the whole kate patrick just use that just use the disuse the

1246
01:10:52,900 --> 01:10:57,680
force to lift his little for skin pod and move it and i'll give

1247
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:00,100
people

1248
01:11:00,100 --> 01:11:02,840
dude with patrick has got this

1249
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:06,100
patrick in a safe so i wouldn't know what what do i roll for that

1250
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,540
that's uh... uh...

1251
01:11:07,540 --> 01:11:10,060
so use the force when i have uh...

1252
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:14,540
of your dinner you used a force urn just use the force area are used to force for

1253
01:11:14,540 --> 01:11:34,500
for

1254
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:47,500
the

1255
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,700
the wires try to start to reach at him.

1256
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:52,900
But where where is he in relation to the wires now on the map.

1257
01:11:52,900 --> 01:11:54,200
Sure. Let me do this for you.

1258
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,300
Okay, let me throw this.

1259
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:03,700
So he basically was more like over here actually saying we're Ray William Johnson.

1260
01:12:03,700 --> 01:12:05,100
Oh, you guys see I've had him there.

1261
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,000
So yeah, if Sullivan was here you threw a straight shot put Ray William Johnson in there.

1262
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:14,300
So he now moved a little bit further into the cave like imagine halfway between that

1263
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:18,200
but I can't and the wires are also a little bit further back,

1264
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,300
but it's like the same ratio basically,

1265
01:12:21,300 --> 01:12:23,400
but the wires are also kind of like just still there because

1266
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,200
they're just these super long wires.

1267
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,000
Okay. So yeah, there's not too much movement,

1268
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:30,900
but he's a little bit further into the cave now,

1269
01:12:30,900 --> 01:12:34,300
which is away from the active wires,

1270
01:12:34,300 --> 01:12:38,600
but what I'm going to have happen now because we started we did do initiative

1271
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:42,200
and I kind of want to go back to that.

1272
01:12:42,200 --> 01:12:46,200
I guess because now we're sort of back to this.

1273
01:12:46,200 --> 01:12:49,200
We're kind of back now to this. Let's do Caleb. What do you want to do?

1274
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:55,200
Ray William Johnson, sort of waiting to figure out how to help solve in here.

1275
01:12:55,200 --> 01:12:57,200
Or not help solve.

1276
01:12:57,200 --> 01:13:00,200
The wires are enemies that can be attacked, yeah?

1277
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:04,200
Yeah, you can stun them basically by depleting their HP.

1278
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:09,200
Okay, I think I'm going to use... they're all like in a line, right?

1279
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:10,200
Yeah.

1280
01:13:10,200 --> 01:13:17,960
I think I'm gonna use matrix beam and trying collateral all of them and destroy them so easily. Yeah 15 that hits roll for damage

1281
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:25,580
17 nice. Yeah, that's fucking gnarly. Yeah, so you shoot out this super impressive

1282
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:29,340
do you have matrix code that shoots out of your your hands and

1283
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:31,500
just

1284
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:34,640
Sort of like knocks it to these wires and it sort of starts to like

1285
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:41,520
Like jitter a little bit. I will say that they are stunned for like around and

1286
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:45,160
so you can run in there, but no more than that because

1287
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:49,480
Like they're gonna be able to come back so

1288
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:56,680
You can run in there if you all like choose to run now instead of doing anything else. I'm gonna run with that. I'm running

1289
01:13:56,680 --> 01:13:57,520
Yeah

1290
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:58,880
Yeah, okay

1291
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:04,660
Yes, you all run in there and then and then I'm gonna say you have to make an athletics check

1292
01:14:04,660 --> 01:14:08,660
to pick up Sullivan like a football, whoever's doing it,

1293
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:12,660
before the, uh, uh, the wires come back.

1294
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:16,660
Who has the highest... Okay. I got 16.

1295
01:14:16,660 --> 01:14:20,660
So you pick up... A football picks up a football and just like...

1296
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:24,660
you just like... you just like use the force to like open up the foreskin

1297
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:28,660
and, uh, just scoop him out and like are holding him up

1298
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:32,660
above your head, running as the wires are starting to like get unstunned

1299
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:34,900
and start to fling around and flail

1300
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:37,220
and you guys manage to get inside of the cave

1301
01:14:37,220 --> 01:14:38,980
and make sure Sullivan doesn't die.

1302
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:42,260
Good thinking with the foreskin

1303
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,180
because that might have killed Sullivan.

1304
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:48,260
You see Sullivan is just like, "What?"

1305
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:52,020
- Hey, Sullivan, I know you definitely don't remember

1306
01:14:52,020 --> 01:14:53,380
what happened because of the impact,

1307
01:14:53,380 --> 01:14:55,460
but remember that Yeti that we were talking about earlier?

1308
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:56,820
- I'm gonna see if he remembers what happened.

1309
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:59,220
- Yeah, so anyway, the Yeti, he came

1310
01:14:59,220 --> 01:15:01,700
and he threw you into those fucking wires like a football.

1311
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,980
pretty fucked up dude

1312
01:15:04,980 --> 01:15:08,820
anyway i saved you just then he got a

1313
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:12,180
i was rolling a d_-twenty i was like please solve a remembers higher than

1314
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,260
ten

1315
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,860
lower lower than ten

1316
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:18,140
uh... you know i have a ten year members already doesn't get a crit one

1317
01:15:18,140 --> 01:15:20,260
so he's just like

1318
01:15:20,260 --> 01:15:24,140
and i'm laughing in his face

1319
01:15:24,140 --> 01:15:27,140
that's seriously what happened on saturday

1320
01:15:27,140 --> 01:15:31,940
he's a girl made out of it on a yeti you're eating flies and living on a

1321
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:50,940
a

1322
01:15:50,940 --> 01:15:53,940
the colors like that blues are now green right now.

1323
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:57,240
He's like kind of like he's got like a headache like he's all

1324
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:58,040
fucked up.

1325
01:15:58,040 --> 01:16:00,840
He said corny is messed up.

1326
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,840
But you guys managed to make it into the the first room of the

1327
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,240
the the cave.

1328
01:16:06,240 --> 01:16:12,540
You walk into the mysterious land cave.

1329
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:18,940
I mean you remember from you know discussing this with Leo,

1330
01:16:20,140 --> 01:16:26,440
You know, it's it's this ancient cave is from but it's from sort of the tail end of the Tamagotchi civilization.

1331
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:34,840
This is one of the last places that they existed, but you would also start as you as you're sort of walking in it.

1332
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:44,740
You start to look around and notice that it seems like the cave is occupied by somebody or something.

1333
01:16:44,740 --> 01:16:48,240
So, all of you roll investigation.

1334
01:16:48,240 --> 01:16:50,840
See what you see.

1335
01:16:50,840 --> 01:16:51,740
Nice.

1336
01:16:51,740 --> 01:16:54,240
16, 13, 20.

1337
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,140
Let's go.

1338
01:16:55,140 --> 01:17:01,740
You guys sort of notice the weird gnarled, clawed tracks on the

1339
01:17:01,740 --> 01:17:07,840
ground and some of the scattered wave bird controllers.

1340
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:12,340
And you quickly assess that this cave has been colonized by

1341
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,040
gamers.

1342
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:19,440
Gamers essentially look like the Falmer from The Elder Scrolls.

1343
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:26,440
[laughter]

1344
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,440
Me and Gamer are looking this up.

1345
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:34,440
Yeah, yeah. I knew Pat would get real good.

1346
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:40,440
Yeah, they've gamed so much their muscles have basically atrophied.

1347
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:47,320
their diet subsists of something called gamer pellets, which has a snack that killed thousands

1348
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:55,720
of people a few years ago. And it makes them experience constant epileptic seizures,

1349
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:00,920
but they still game, they game on. They live in a-

1350
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:03,800
What's the Bosmer equivalent of a gamer?

1351
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:06,440
A Bosmer equivalent?

1352
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,920
Like there's the Falmer and the Bosmer, right?

1353
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:14,200
A bosmer like like what kind of I guess they play jonathan blow games maybe they play

1354
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:17,960
They play is that what is that what you're going for? Maybe i'm missing. I don't know

1355
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:20,520
I'm, just saying i'm just trying to like fill out the lore, you know

1356
01:18:20,520 --> 01:18:23,640
Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah, okay

1357
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:29,000
Bosmer or wood elves actually just remembered right? Yeah bosmer the wood elves. Okay. Yeah, so they

1358
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:33,080
They play uh, they play uh, uh the best indie games of the year

1359
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:34,660
uh...

1360
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:37,820
you know they play uh... they love the best in the use of the year they love

1361
01:18:37,820 --> 01:18:39,660
haiti's in love uh...

1362
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:43,100
uh... they loved everyone they play started valley still

1363
01:18:43,100 --> 01:18:47,020
yet they're still playing started alley uh... in the year two thousand two

1364
01:18:47,020 --> 01:18:48,720
hundred and four

1365
01:18:48,720 --> 01:18:50,460
yeah

1366
01:18:50,460 --> 01:18:54,660
here like almost done i guess marrying all the women's and i would like you to

1367
01:18:54,660 --> 01:18:58,060
hear you farm in you make a look make a deal with the almost figured out they

1368
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:01,600
almost caught a fish or something i don't know they love the sims the boss

1369
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:03,600
the

1370
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:13,600
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah, what are the other ones? I can't do this. So there's, yeah, the Falmer,

1371
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:18,600
yeah, and the Falmer do love fucking like competitive shooters, they love competitive

1372
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:25,600
fighters, they love those types of games. They live, exist in a lot of caves on planet E-Bomb,

1373
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:30,600
and people don't know, some of them are, from what you can tell, like some of what people

1374
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:37,560
people know it's like they've they've sort of evolved to not have eyes for some reason from

1375
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:44,280
living in the dark despite gaming and so some have been around for like as long as anybody would think

1376
01:19:44,280 --> 01:19:50,680
anything has but some of them seem to be like you know people who live on planet ebom who defected

1377
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:56,680
and sort of started lurking in the cave started gaming got addicted to it and just sort of slowly

1378
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,680
You know

1379
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:02,040
You know into saying hillary rodham clinton

1380
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:09,080
So, um, you notice there's like cheeto dust everywhere there's uh, freaking uh,

1381
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:11,880
There's freaking wave birds. I said that already

1382
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:16,840
Yeah, so they're here. They're here. You can kind of get a gist of that and also what you see in this room

1383
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:24,040
Is aside from all the like sort of gamer detritus that's everywhere. You see these like beautiful runes

1384
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:31,040
Inscribed on the walls and these are from the Tamagotchi civilization, you know, they have like feces and and and

1385
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,160
Hot fries sort of like smeared on them

1386
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:40,320
But you could see sort of like this like this was a place where the Tamagotchi civilization lived

1387
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:45,920
And what you also see in the middle of it sort of like jammed in there almost

1388
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,780
looks like a a like

1389
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:55,260
Computer like a like a old old sort of computer and a DDR pad

1390
01:20:55,260 --> 01:20:59,400
And NES controller attached to it and

1391
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:06,780
Yeah, and so that's what you see in this room you don't see any doors to go to the next part of a cave

1392
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:14,720
But you know people probably come in here so what do you guys want to do hmm I

1393
01:21:14,720 --> 01:21:18,880
Okay, what I when I see the get when I see the gamers

1394
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:33,880
is

1395
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:48,880
I

1396
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:55,880
here

1397
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:59,120
they seem scared of me because i'm a feminist

1398
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:01,640
yeah i thought they would like attack and i was trying to know i think i will

1399
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:03,840
hear it here here all of

1400
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,360
yeah i'm a totally a feminist

1401
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:08,680
i think i sort of depression quest

1402
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:10,300
yet

1403
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:14,800
that's my favorite games he is small turd roll out from under the rock

1404
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:17,600
uh...

1405
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:30,040
i

1406
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,040
What would you do if there were two?

1407
01:22:32,040 --> 01:22:37,040
Are they gonna try to attack us if the DDR machine...

1408
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:44,040
Okay, then I'm gonna save this in case it happens.

1409
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:46,040
Okay, you can do a quick save.

1410
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:47,040
Hit F5.

1411
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:48,040
Okay.

1412
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:50,040
There's no way you just let that happen.

1413
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,040
Alright, let's go to the DDR.

1414
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:55,040
Real quick, I give Sullivan the turn. And I say, "This is for you."

1415
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:04,620
Wait, yeah, I heal can I heal Sullivan anymore? Sullivan this is food on this planet. Don't waste your point

1416
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,620
Sullivan's almost full

1417
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:09,640
Yeah, I got it. That's right. I am

1418
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:20,360
I keep trying to step forward to go to the DDR pad and getting distracted by one of those

1419
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,700
Yeah, you go to the DDR pad

1420
01:23:25,700 --> 01:23:31,940
You see it's like hooked up to the computer which also has like a USB port where the NES controller is attached to it

1421
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:37,040
And yeah, when you step on the DDR pad the screen lights up on the computer

1422
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:43,980
And it says like like DDR and then a list of songs comes up

1423
01:23:43,980 --> 01:23:48,260
Caramel dancing

1424
01:23:49,180 --> 01:23:56,180

1425
01:23:56,180 --> 01:24:00,680

It's like really athletic and I'm working up a sweat.

1432
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:33,460
Just like a pear-shaped 15 year old at the arcade.

1433
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:34,460
You're killing it.

1434
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:42,460
You do it really good. You get like perfect, perfect, perfect, perfect on all the fucking shit.

1435
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,460
I'm singing along to whatever weird language that song is in.

1436
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:46,460
Go white boys.

1437
01:24:49,460 --> 01:25:01,820
the

1438
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:08,820
the

1439
01:25:08,820 --> 01:25:12,220
and uh...

1440
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:16,220
and

1441
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,060
group

1442
01:25:17,060 --> 01:25:22,180
here in the total you only get through three letters so it's just a lot

1443
01:25:22,180 --> 01:25:25,580
no it's too already it's like a lot of read what you finish writing it it just

1444
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:29,340
confirms that i wrote by the because that's i think it was spelled

1445
01:25:29,340 --> 01:25:29,840
Okay.

1446
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:31,340
Okay, good.

1447
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:35,040
Yeah, I turn around I go guys.

1448
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,240
You see the funny name.

1449
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:37,340
I put in.

1450
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:40,240
Oh, yeah, like you're a grandpa like pop.

1451
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:42,140
Yeah, because and I'm like, yeah.

1452
01:25:42,140 --> 01:25:44,740
Yeah, because I'm thinking I'm imagining a grandpa pooping and

1453
01:25:44,740 --> 01:25:46,040
I'm like, yeah, exactly.

1454
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:52,540
And so at this point when I should mention is you guys can

1455
01:25:52,540 --> 01:25:56,640
look at your passes that you all have and you see on it that

1456
01:25:56,640 --> 01:26:03,920
It says 54 minutes and 36 seconds 54 minutes and 32 seconds, you know, it goes down by four seconds

1457
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:07,520
You know, I was just figuring how long it took me to say that. All right, so

1458
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:14,640
uh, uh, I wanted to let you know not to be a rude dm but to remember to hold myself to the thing I set you to

1459
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:17,680
um, so yeah, uh, uh

1460
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:22,560
At that point your passes will expire that doesn't necessarily mean you get kicked out of the cave

1461
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:26,000
It just means you are would be officially trespassing. That's all. Yeah

1462
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:41,000
a

1463
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:56,000
a

1464
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,000
out what's supposed to happen when i win the game

1465
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:01,320
do we just play d_d_r_ for nothing

1466
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:04,800
metal was a very highly for nothing

1467
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:09,320
i look at the time ago all suite fifty four minutes of dance dance revolution

1468
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,520
uh...

1469
01:27:12,520 --> 01:27:14,880
uh... yeah

1470
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:17,680
so you also have that in the lead to by the way

1471
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:22,260
that we are eager to hear your god

1472
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:25,800
uh... and you know you can also do a little more investigating your stupor

1473
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:27,280
in the room

1474
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,500
to to figure out figure out what's uh... what's happening here i like your first

i've got an idea

1506
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:23,480
he turns to you and goes

1507
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,480
"I'm going to go to the zoo!"

1508
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,480
"I'm going to go to the zoo baby!"

"I'm going to go to the zoo!"

1510
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:31,480
"I'm going to go to the zoo!"

1511
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:38,480
Okay, here's all I have, YouTube.

1512
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:46,480
Let's have, you know what, you guys are archaeologists, so let's say this language is pretty hard to come by,

1513
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:51,480
and, you know, because it's pretty insular, it's among the gamers, not many people are able to interact with them.

1514
01:29:51,480 --> 01:29:54,320
so role a uh... role on

1515
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:55,800
uh...

1516
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,560
let's do history check

1517
01:29:57,560 --> 01:29:59,520
from your studies uh...

1518
01:29:59,520 --> 01:30:02,320
both rewilling johnson and patrick you know

1519
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:05,720
to see if you're certain i got a nineteen holy jacob you got a natural

1520
01:30:05,720 --> 01:30:08,280
twenty actually got a little and

1521
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:09,520
that's still not bad but

1522
01:30:09,520 --> 01:30:12,840
you got natural twenty so you can understand him

1523
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,300
really clearly

1524
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:18,320
uh... as far as you can do which is like you get like the gist which he you get

1525
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:20,320
the he's saying like

1526
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,620
well are you making fun of me

1527
01:30:22,620 --> 01:30:24,620
are you making fun of me

1528
01:30:24,620 --> 01:30:28,360
and uh... is you're making noise to you assume and then also when he was saying

1529
01:30:28,360 --> 01:30:31,840
to caleb was something along the lines of uh...

1530
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,260
of uh...

1531
01:30:33,260 --> 01:30:34,600
uh...

1532
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:37,940
only only we can get out of here

Good game buddy.

1560
01:32:29,660 --> 01:32:32,860

01:32:32,860 --> 01:32:39,860

1562
01:32:39,860 --> 01:32:44,460
uh... so here's what happened

1563
01:32:44,460 --> 01:32:48,300
i like the idea of me alone they'll never get the konami coat

1564
01:32:48,300 --> 01:32:49,220
no way

1565
01:32:49,220 --> 01:32:51,940

1566
01:32:51,940 --> 01:32:53,300
luke hangover

1567
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:58,100
they'll think of so many things before the konami coat

1568
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,820
so the uh... the rock there's like this like looks like a rock wall

1569
01:33:02,820 --> 01:33:08,380
walk rock wall but instead like a an outline sort of like appears like you

1570
01:33:08,380 --> 01:33:12,020
hear the like you know stone sliding against stone sound that you hear in

1571
01:33:12,020 --> 01:33:18,900
fucking mystery things when you're you find a hidden door and it slides open

1572
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:30,780
and you actually see you actually also see the ship from fucking what's it

1573
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,380
called from a Mass Effect.

1574
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:35,780
Except it's like a miniature version of it.

1575
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:38,980
Looks like a raft almost and you see this at beyond the door.

1576
01:33:38,980 --> 01:33:44,280
This long just dark like waterway of some sort and you see

1577
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:51,080
the little gamer like the little scary and scary up to the

1578
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:56,280
little way the raft and he's like and he's like sort of dancing

1579
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:58,680
on it a little bit like kind of excitedly and I can understand

1580
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:02,680
You can understand he's saying like, "You got it, you got it, damn, you got it!"

1581
01:34:02,680 --> 01:34:04,680
Um...

1582
01:34:04,680 --> 01:34:05,680
Yeah.

1583
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,680
I say back, I go...

1584
01:34:07,680 --> 01:34:10,680
[unintelligible]

1585
01:34:10,680 --> 01:34:11,680
What does that mean?

1586
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:12,680
That means...

1587
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,680
What?

1588
01:34:14,680 --> 01:34:16,680
[laughter]

1589
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:18,680
Uh, yeah, and uh...

1590
01:34:18,680 --> 01:34:21,680
Is there an NES controller in this room?

1591
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,680
In the next room?

1592
01:34:23,680 --> 01:34:24,680
Yeah.

1593
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:26,680
Well, you'll see the next room.

1594
01:34:26,680 --> 01:34:33,680
So you guys jump on the raft and you glide down this like dark cavernous river and

1595
01:34:33,680 --> 01:34:46,680
uh god so no I'll tell you guys about all the ideas I had and uh and um uh as you do it starts to open up a bit and you notice to your left um suddenly like it starts to get brighter and brighter and the the cave starts to open up a bit and uh you just see these like

1596
01:34:46,680 --> 01:34:54,680
And you notice to your left, suddenly it starts to get brighter and brighter and the cave starts to open up a bit.

1597
01:34:54,680 --> 01:35:02,680
And you just see these weird rooms on the left side. You wouldn't be seeing this as top down.

1598
01:35:02,680 --> 01:35:09,680
But you're all riding on top of the Mass Effect ship and you see these rooms and they have...

1599
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:18,440
And you see in the windows these gamers like in these rooms like like just playing games or sleeping or jerking off or just hanging out

1600
01:35:18,440 --> 01:35:20,440
One of them's in the bathtub

1601
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:22,840
You see them there

1602
01:35:22,840 --> 01:35:26,940
And you see the little gamer turn to you Patrick and he's like

1603
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:34,120
He's saying he's saying those are my brothers they're not so nice please be quiet and

1604
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:38,800
That's and

1605
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,320
That means what?

1606
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:47,040
Yeah, we could end it there oh

1607
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:52,900
My god, so there's like runes on the wall

1608
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:58,840
He read the world. There was a there was a I had a riddle if you walked into the computer

1609
01:35:58,840 --> 01:36:04,840
