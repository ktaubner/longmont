1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
We're at a dramatic scene after a vehicle slams into a building.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Maria Stephanos in the newsroom with some new surveillance of this crash, Maria.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Emily, what a mess.

4
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,600
Police are still investigating what led up to this crash,

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,900
but we can tell you that there are no survivors.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,000
Apparently, security footage caught three weird-looking adult men

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,200
playing with a laser pointer just before the crash.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,300
They seem to be giggling and tickling each other,

9
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,500
and enhancement of the video even reveals one suspect touching another's butt.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,800
Police have released sketches of the suspects responsible for this crash

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,800
along with the following audio clip.

12
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,120
[laughing]

13
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,600
Wait, wait, guys. Let's crash that car.

14
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:37,400
[crash]

15
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,600
[screaming]

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,200
Just kidding. I don't care.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,600
Let's touch his butt.

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,700
Many amateur sleuths have taken to the internet with theories on who the police sketch resembles,

19
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,900
but police chief Mike Horan had this to say.

20
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:52,900
With our current resources, we are unlikely to identify the culprits responsible for this tragedy.

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,500
The only way I could see us finding these criminals would be if there were some kind of

22
00:00:56,500 --> 00:01:01,460
massive digital repository of hours of video and audio footage of these men that we could

23
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,260
use to match their faces in the security footage.

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,520
Weird guys like this are hard to hunt down.

25
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,340
If they were semi-popular internet celebrities or somewhat famous comedians, that would be

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,340
another story.

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,900
But we're still waiting on details at this time.

28
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:18,740
In addition to dozens of fatalities and nearly 100 serious injuries, there was structural

29
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:23,660
damage to the building, as you can imagine, and that right now is being investigated.

30
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,780
As well as the psychological damages caused by the bald suspect's attempt to riz one of

31
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,640
the female crash victims.

32
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,100
One thing's for certain, these three pieces of shit have a life sentence ahead of them

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,660
once they're caught.

34
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,660
Back to you, FUD.

35
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:43,660
(music)

36
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,660
Okay.

37
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,660
One word.

38
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,660
Brad.

39
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,660
Yep.

40
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,660
Yeah, I mean that doesn't even begin to...

41
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:59,660
No, Brad does not encapsulate what we have seen and what we found ourselves on.

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:03,660
Dan, you're getting a little bit closer, I would say.

43
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,660
Okay, still not fully there. One word.

44
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,360
one word

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,700
Boeing sproing is okay. It's boring is colder, though you're you're almost on

46
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,900
it one word.

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,560
No, that's the sound. I mean that's definitely the closest one

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:25,100
guys. We have found ourselves in a bit of a sticky legal situation. It's

49
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,860
ongoing, but ongoing for a very long time, ongoing for essentially the rest

50
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,960
of our lives. They hundred years

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,860
We've been sentenced to 100 years in federal maximum security prison, cell block 1000,

52
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,860
that's where we are right now.

53
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,580
And yeah, I mean, there's no two ways about it.

54
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
We messed up.

55
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,220
Yeah, I think we're completely innocent.

56
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,220
I don't think we should have been.

57
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,500
But quote the immortal words of Kendrick Lamar, "When shit hits the fan, are you still a fan?

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
And the rest of the line doesn't matter."

59
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,900
I don't know what the rest of the line is.

60
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,900
Me neither.

61
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,900
It doesn't matter.

62
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:02,900
Can you say it?

63
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
What's the rest?

64
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,060
when shit hits the fan, are you still a fan or do you I'm looking around right

65
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:12,580
now? I like shit. I say it now. It's when shit hits the fan. Are you still

66
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:16,620
a fan? And then he says, he says, my name is Michael Jackson. He says he

67
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,220
says he gave us Billy Jean. They say he touched those kids. It's a bit of

68
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,740
it. It's kind of weird that he never got in trouble for that song. Yeah,

69
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,180
yeah, he's kind of being like Michael Jackson never got in trouble for Billy

70
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,420
Jean. Yeah, I don't think you should get in trouble for Billy Jean. Is that

71
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,140
You're dating a girl named Billie?

72
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,220
Kinda gay, Michael Jackson.

73
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,180
Come on now.

74
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,020
Kinda, ugh.

75
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,540
No, but Kendrick Lamar didn't get in any trouble

76
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,900
for making this song, where he was like--

77
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,380
He got in some trouble when his last album came out, right?

78
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,060
Didn't people, wasn't, didn't he have something about--

79
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,140
Well, people were mad about Humble.

80
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,060
People were mad that he said he's sick and tired

81
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,900
of the Photoshop, and show me something real.

82
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,780
What's wrong with that, he wants real girls.

83
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,180
I don't know what was wrong with it.

84
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,020
I wish that I could.

85
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,840
But there was people getting,

86
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,060
I remember my friend telling me that people,

87
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,340
like that people were mad about that.

88
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,780
when we were in an Uber and I was like what I do fucking hate when a girl

89
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,980
sends me a selfie with the Photoshop on the yo that is true. I'm not getting

90
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,580
those anymore, though. I know that's not when I came in here, not mine. I'm one

91
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,820
of those prisoners that makes tic tocs. Yeah, really? I do jumping jacks and

92
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,260
sing songs. How many cigarettes does that cost you? One hundred and twenty.

93
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,020
He has the most cigarettes. The thing about

94
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,620
one right now. Okay, so if you're wondering, if you're wondering where

95
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,860
we're at Cameron has become kind of the king of the jail so far. I mean he's

96
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,700
feared, revered,

97
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:40,640
reviled, reviled by many, respected. I mean I think you've gotten basically

98
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,800
everything that starts with re and then two syllables, that's me. So what we

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,320
have learned is that everybody, there's different cars in prison and Cameron is

100
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,240
all of the cars respect him. Yeah, every single one of the groups in prison

101
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,280
really respect him. You haven't noticed this? People are calling him Cars. People are calling

102
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,960
him Cars? Yeah, yeah. Like every group in prison is a car, they say. So every single

103
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:10,040
one, I mean we're just lucky that we didn't have to join any of these other guys. Yeah,

104
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:15,040
by the way, if you were wondering, we did not join any kind of white group. We formed

105
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,960
our own group, thank you very much. We formed our own group called the Prison Jitterbugs.

106
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,240
prison jitterbugs. We thought that it was a nice kind of low profile name.

107
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,660
We'd be able to stay out of trouble. And we didn't think that Cameron would

108
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,440
snap. Like the jitterbugs, the jitterbugs, like everything else in jail,

109
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,760
it's about respect.

110
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,480
And Cameron has just been, I mean, adding years to his sentence,

111
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,620
with stuff that he's been doing. I'm honestly not so worried about adding

112
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,620
years to my sentence, because as you guys know, the arrangement we have with

113
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,160
the warden right now, who we do...

114
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,140
here's a painting of these are my these are my watercolors to go through my

115
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,580
watercolors real up will know i'm still talking here about a range with the

116
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,940
warden which is that

117
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,440
uh... every podcast episode record while we're in here they're actually taking a

118
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,520
year offer sentence to the house of how much these episodes have been helping

119
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,740
the community both in and out of prison but simultaneously we are doing a lot of

120
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,020
stuff that is getting time added to our sent all yeah i mean these watercolors i

121
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,520
was not supposed to have paint

122
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,760
i don't even know you got to know who would bring you pain

123
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,760
buddy, it took me a long time to get all this paint in here. I can tell you that

124
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:27,520
for free. One drop at a time? Yeah. I just smuggled it in one drop at a time.

125
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,200
That's why it's watercolors because it's mixed in with my mouth. That makes sense.

126
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,760
See, we have up here on the right,

127
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:40,600
that is our former cell mate as a portrait of our former cell mate, Ryan.

128
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,120
And Cameron, why don't you tell them

129
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,800
why Ryan looks like right in that photo.

130
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,040
Oh

131
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,240
well, I was having a bad dream

132
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,440
where I got struck by lightning

133
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:02,040
and in the dream, I thought, oh my God, I'm going to die. I might as well lash

134
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:05,340
out at everybody around me and by the way, Ryan's nickname was white lightning.

135
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:05,940
Yeah,

136
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,840
you woke up, you saw lightning, I woke up, I saw his lightning bolt tattoos that

137
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,340
he has

138
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,960
That's what I was thinking about. Lightning, two lightning bolt tattoos.

139
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,520
I think it was like a family crest or so because he was white. Yeah. Oh,

140
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
well, yeah, true. That was the other part of the big man. The tattoos are

141
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,360
black. Yeah, they were not white. It doesn't make a lot of sense. No,

142
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,920
you already do white ink. He did have some,

143
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,440
we did have white stuff tattooed on him in other places. Yeah, that is true.

144
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,360
He tried to tattoo you. Oh yeah. I forgot about that. Yeah. I did actually

145
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,120
get end up getting a prison tattoo. Oh yeah. I don't know if I've shown you

146
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,320
guys this yet. Yeah. Yeah. I haven't seen it. Ryan, our cell mate was a,

147
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,060
That's okay. You can have that one. Oh, Ryan, our cell mate was giving me a

148
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,560
tattoo and

149
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:53,800
I didn't really look at what I was kind of closing my eyes. Yeah, I mean, I've

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,560
been pretty tired in here, been pretty bored. Yeah, so I was just kind of

151
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,300
taking a quick nap. I thought it was a pain thing. And no, pain doesn't bother

152
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,960
me at all. I'm actually invincible,

153
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,160
but he was tattooing me and I didn't look until about halfway through the

154
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,500
tattoo down at what he was tattooing. So I ended up finishing it myself when I

155
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,700
I saw what he was trying to put on my body. So here I'll just I'll just show

156
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,900
it right now. Let me stand up and show the

157
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,900
so

158
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:24,900
I don't know if you can read that for me because I'm off my says says it's a

159
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,700
white person, but it looks like maybe it's kind of a blend of two styles kind

160
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:34,200
of old English up until the P. Yeah, and then maybe is that just Sharpie?

161
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,300
No, it's a it's it's it's all tattooed. It's all tattooed. No, it's just very

162
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,260
alone out. That's why it looks like sharpie. Yeah, I mean you don't we don't

163
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,280
have machines in here for for tattoos, right? So maybe only machines we have

164
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,740
here is the industry prison. So he was trying to tattoo on you white prisoner.

165
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,900
Yeah, maybe I hope that's what he was tattooing. I'm not gonna be a prisoner

166
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,860
forever, but I am a white person. Yeah, that'll probably never change unless we

167
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:02,940
develop technology. Yeah, so it's good to get that on your belly too. Yeah, so

168
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,780
you can like, you know, when I go swimming, people don't get confused if I

169
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:09,780
get really tan. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you sit out in the sun, you bake.

170
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,280
Yeah. Let's get the... So then the one on the... Oh, we're back to your...

171
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,640
The one on the right here, this is a portrait of me and the warden.

172
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,240
Right. So that's... That's on the left. That's either the left or the middle.

173
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,040
That's the only... The camera left. Where are you chewing? Who's chewing on

174
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,380
something? He's got ice. You can't chew ice. Yeah. Don't chew ice into the

175
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:33,000
microphone. It's bad for your teeth. You're gonna get 10 years out of prison

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:39,040
for chewing ice. I didn't get ten years added for rudeness. I put my elbows on the table

177
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,040
pretty often.

178
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:44,160
In the middle here is the portrait of me and the warden and then underneath that is Pizza

179
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:52,520
Friday. We've been getting Pizza Fridays because of stuff that Cameron has been threatening

180
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:58,680
in the prison. And he said, what did you say? You said if we don't get Pizza Friday, you

181
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,080
kind of had like your own little like...

182
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,080
All of y'all getting splatted.

183
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,440
at it. Yeah, all you get is a little protest in here. Yeah, prison protest

184
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,720
and it got us, it got us pizza Friday. So put the play that applause sound for

185
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:16,960
you. So, so that's growing. I'm so blessed to be stuck in this hell hole

186
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,520
with one of my most violent friends. Yeah, me too. It really is. Yeah, it's

187
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,960
too bad that I got put in a cell with two kind of way fish little pussy cats.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,300
yeah. I mean I've been getting really into my art. I'm a complete bitch. I'm

189
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,400
a fucking bitch, right? The first day that I was here, I went up to the biggest,

190
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,020
baddest guy in the prison and I hopped on his back and he gave me a piggyback

191
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,300
ride. That's just how I roll in prison. I'm actually enjoying myself a lot.

192
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:50,100
The wine, guys, I've never been into wine before, but the tannins in this wine

193
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:56,920
truly is, it's unreal. I never understood what legs on wine meant until I

194
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,360
rank it in a styrofoam cup. Yeah, that's what I was just about to say. We take

195
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,760
the you know you'd you'd swirl it around on the table like that in the styrofoam

196
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,500
flute that they gave us and we got

197
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,520
by the way.

198
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:14,500
We have full sampling. We take the we take the wine guys. We're cutting up

199
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,120
black olives. We're getting slices of craft singles. We're cutting them into

200
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,600
quarters and we sit there and guys, we are enjoying. Don't feel bad for us in

201
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,440
prison. We're happy we are I'm living the best life I've ever had him.

202
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,880
Absolutely, absolutely, I get to use a rotary telephone. It's amazing. I get to

203
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,240
use a rotary telephone to call my cousins. My wife is out of the picture.

204
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,360
Don't care. I don't remember her phone number. It was in my contacts and I

205
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,960
don't have my phone guy. Actually, I do, but it's only on tick tock is the only

206
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,240
app I have. It's the only

207
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,740
one gigabyte phone and that's the only reason that I could sneak it in and it's

208
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,220
big enough to store my TikToks on.

209
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:56,440
Yeah, and my wife is watching. Listen, a phone number is at least 3 gigabytes.

210
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,260
Oh, yeah.

211
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:00,200
It doesn't fit on these tiny ass phones that we have in here.

212
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,160
These phones are so, they have no space in them at all.

213
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,440
But we've really made a home for ourselves here.

214
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,200
Oh, absolutely.

215
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,200
Honestly, we've have, we put up the watercolors we put over here. On my side we have a sexy

216
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,640
calendar, you know?

217
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:22,740
And these guys, it is so, I mean I have been just a pack mule. I've been smuggling all

218
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,940
this stuff in, rolling all this up, putting it in my butt and my mouth. I'm walking around

219
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:34,240
here like a, what's the? Like a reverse chipmunk. You've got your butt cheeks full of food.

220
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,900
I've got my butt cheeks full of food and my mouth full of posters. Walking around, you've

221
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,620
we've been popping out talkies for us and all sorts of that's why that's why they

222
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:48,540
call me the monk or I mean you guys do the monk, even though they also call me

223
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,580
the monk for a different reason. What's the reason they call you the well? I

224
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,740
look like a monk. Yeah, especially in this orange. You try to set yourself on

225
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,260
fire. Well, yeah, the first day didn't take it very well. The PlayStation

226
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,220
stopped working, so I tried to set myself on fire, but apparently orange

227
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,860
juice is not flammable. No, I just walked around sticky for a couple of days

228
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,740
because I was afraid of the showers. Yeah. Well, I mean you guys, you guys brought in

229
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,880
some nice stuff. Pat brought in these or he painted these wall watercolors and Caleb brought

230
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,780
in this this calendar in this nice map of Cyrodiil here. But we didn't have I actually

231
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:26,460
the world. So I've I've been this home. I've been I actually contributed to the cell, too.

232
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,940
And yeah, yeah, I got in here first. Maybe you guys didn't even notice this, but I actually

233
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:35,380
brought these bars for the window. I got here. This window is just open and I figured, well,

234
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
much of a jail. There's not bars here.

235
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,380
There wasn't really a jail feel to it.

236
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,380
So I threw some bars up there. I welded them in.

237
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,380
Yeah. They're pretty solid.

238
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,380
We're on the first floor too, which is like, you know,

239
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,380
somebody could come in. Exactly. I don't want anyone

240
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,380
coming in and interrupting us. I don't want somebody...

241
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,380
What if they stole my posters? What if they stole my watercolors?

242
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:53,380
Honestly, it's also a little

243
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,380
drafty in here and the bars stop

244
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,380
just enough air for it to be the

245
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,380
perfect temperature. Oh, absolutely. True.

246
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,380
I mean, I couldn't live without these watercolors.

247
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,380
These are my pride and joy here. I mean, look at

248
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,980
this one right here. We're not going to look closely at that one because why not

249
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,580
is going to get us in trouble. Get in trouble. I don't think we'll get in

250
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,580
trouble if we look closely at that one. That one I can't wait till this. That

251
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,140
one is a drawing of my free time. That's what it is. The title. That's my free

252
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:24,540
time. Cellmate Ryan, me and the warden and pizza Friday and these are all

253
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:29,500
available on Etsy. They let me open up my own Etsy store in here. That's very

254
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:36,060
The thing is also people talk all this bullshit about correctional officers. Guys, Linda is

255
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,380
a fucking nice lady. She's nice.

256
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,380
She's...

257
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,660
What do you mean? What are you laughing about?

258
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,660
She's pretty nice, all right.

259
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:47,420
What? Did she get you extra food?

260
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,020
I'll leave it at that.

261
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,500
Did you bring her something in your butt?

262
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Uh-huh.

263
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,500
What did you bring her?

264
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Chips. It was mostly chips.

265
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,220
So now you're... You're such a fucking teacher's pet, man.

266
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,220
You are.

267
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,820
really crazy. I've been

268
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:07,520
fucking smuggling in bags of the whole shebang or smuggling out bags of the

269
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:12,140
whole shebang. What's the Linda? Linda sells them on eBay. Oh, it's looking

270
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:16,220
like there's a that I need to go over to the other side of the prison cell. Oh,

271
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,120
yeah, I can and figure out. I think something was supposed to be plugged in

272
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,200
that I told one of us to plug in that ended up not being plugged in. No, it's

273
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,940
plugged in. Well, it's not.

274
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,340
I think the cable is broken.

275
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:32,440
Yeah, I mean luckily this cell is four complete walls.

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,440
Yeah.

277
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:42,200
But yeah, Linda takes whole shebang chips out of prison and sells them on eBay to people

278
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,200
who like chips.

279
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,320
Yeah, I mean, which is most of the population.

280
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,960
You know, how Linda and I have bonded is over chips.

281
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,800
But if you take them out of your ass, don't they get back and it's all crumbled?

282
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,160
It's just a bunch of pieces of chips.

283
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
It's like bread crumbs.

284
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,240
Well, I mean, I guess that's the when you're buying chips off of eBay. I feel

285
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,680
like that's kind of that's par for the course. Yeah, par for the quiz. You know,

286
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,360
you run the you run the risk, especially present chips. Like, yeah, but I love

287
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,800
prison chips. Oh my God, the whole shebangs are very good chips. Oh my God.

288
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,080
I've been asking him to get zaps in here, but I don't think they're going to.

289
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,120
No, I really would like to get just some. Is it too much to fucking ask for

290
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,960
plain original lays once in a while? Yeah, I mean everything here is some

291
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,960
some spicy flavor of this or that. Or some fucking pretzels!

292
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:34,960
Yeah, I do miss- Where are the pretzels, where are the wheat thins, and where is the whole wheat bread?

293
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:42,960
I miss the McDonald's on the outside, but the steak and lobsters we've been having in here have been just so incredible.

294
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:47,960
Dude, it's disgusting. It's fucking disgusting. You hate- Steak and lobster, bro?

295
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,960
You hate surf and turf days?

296
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,960
Dude, I'm walking around- We have pizza Friday and surf and turf.

297
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,960
My blood pressure is going through the fucking roof, right?

298
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:59,360
I can barely even muster up the courage to play tennis outside anymore.

299
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,560
No, it's pickleball now.

300
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,760
Well, they turned it into the pickleball courts two days ago.

301
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,360
Yeah, because again, Cameron's wrath.

302
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,160
I mean, you really have laid down the law here.

303
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,260
You've kind of made prison...

304
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,260
I've always told you guys, first day in prison, I'm changing it.

305
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:19,560
You saw what the warden was doing to me, and then you snapped at him,

306
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,760
and now the warden is a prisoner.

307
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,080
And I do what the warden did to you.

308
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,760
And you're the warden.

309
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,080
It's a very strange scenario.

310
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,680
Yeah, I mean, if you--

311
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:32,640
He made the warden his proverbial bitch.

312
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,280
People all the time-- you know what I've been realizing?

313
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I've been talking to family members and stuff,

314
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,400
and they're saying, is it like Shawshank Redemption?

315
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:40,960
Is it like--

316
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
No, it's like Delfino Plaza in Mario Sunshine.

317
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,520
Guys, it's like Ned's Declassified in this bitch, right?

318
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
It's like Suite Life on Deck.

319
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,760
Yeah, we have guys. I have a crush. Okay, I'm twenty something years old and I

320
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,960
haven't said this in years. I have a crush right. I'm not gonna tell you who

321
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,360
it is.

322
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,160
No,

323
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,060
it's better not. It's another prisoner who I can't tell you who it is because

324
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:16,560
he's gonna listen to this. Oh great, but we have a teacher we have. I mean

325
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,460
there's all sorts of characters that janitor this guy's off his fucking

326
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,860
a rocker right. He wears a basically I keep mistaking him for some kind of

327
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:27,260
bizarro world prisoner, because he's wears a blue jumpsuit instead of an

328
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,300
orange. Yeah, and honestly, I

329
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:34,900
like speaking of with stuff that's kind of you kind of don't expect based on TV

330
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,320
and movies before you go into prison. Like I've always seen prison in the

331
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,240
movies and I thought it's one way and then I get in here and I realize like

332
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:42,980
you know

333
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:48,520
most of the child molesters are actually pretty chill guy. Not too bad to hang

334
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,000
dealt with and people don't mind them in here. Yeah, they don't get beaten up.

335
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,940
Is that because is that is that because when you first the first day they

336
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,420
thought that that's where you were going and they put you at that lunch table?

337
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,440
No, I just walked over and I was like, Hey guys, no one seems to be talking to

338
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,160
you, but a lot of you seem cool.

339
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,460
Interesting. I don't I don't see you. I walked over to that table and you

340
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,140
dap them all up. Yeah, and I was like, don't feel badly. Yeah, I mean, that's

341
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,540
because I believe that what you've done, you're being punished and you'll come

342
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:22,180
That was the one thing when you first got here, you were so inspirational to everyone, walking

343
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,200
up to every single prisoner and saying, "Don't feel badly."

344
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,880
And I think that's maybe once you showed them your soft side, but then immediately...

345
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:30,880
Except Larry the Litterbug.

346
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,880
Oh, dude.

347
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,880
And we had to get rid of him because his name rhymed with jitterbug.

348
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,320
You're literally fucking destroying the earth, bro.

349
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,500
His name rhymed with jitterbug.

350
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,040
We can't have litterbugs versus jitterbugs.

351
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:42,040
No.

352
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:47,240
and if you're out on the yard right, it's fine to have a couple of beers right.

353
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,300
We're all out there, we're lifting weights, we're making beers, yeah, we

354
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,740
have a craft brewery, we're making beers, we're making wine, it's not that big of

355
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:59,080
a deal, it's fine to have that, but that can is gonna go in the proper receptacle,

356
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,740
right? This is our space, we're gonna respect it, we're gonna treat it right,

357
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,680
because we are going to be here for 200 years. Yeah, we are dying, we are in

358
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,760
this Swedish prison for 200 years and we're gonna be, and I'm gonna get bored

359
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,100
of PlayStation. I'm going to get bored of Xbox. I'm going to get bored of surf

360
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,380
and turf and all this stuff right, but one thing that I will never get bored of

361
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:23,540
rolling around on the ground. Yeah, I can't do that. If there's fucking trash

362
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,020
all over, I'm going to get a

363
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:30,700
star. I'm going to get a mental splinter stuck in my mental one, a mental and I

364
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,500
already have a mental mental and it's caused a lot of issues with how I'm

365
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,340
treating people in here. I think it's the root of my problems. I don't think

366
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,560
the way that you're treating people is wrong or you should be put in any kind

367
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:47,380
of solitary confined. By the way, solitary confinement is comfortable.

368
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,780
We're in it right now. Yeah. I don't even think it was a three person

369
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,480
solitary confinement.

370
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:57,400
Yeah, because we overcooked the hamburgers when we were on kitchen duty.

371
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,800
Also, yes, kitchen duty's fun. I, yeah, kitchen duty's fun. I like the dishes.

372
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:06,680
And I admit it, y'all. And to my girlfriend, yes, before I was sent off to

373
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:13,060
jail, I forgot to do the dishes. Oh, add it to my sentence. Yeah, when he gets

374
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:13,340
out,

375
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,680
when I get out,

376
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:18,660
just leave him there, be patient and guys, Jesus Christ, if you've been

377
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:23,820
wondering if we've been making funny license plates, you, you best believe

378
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,900
have we've been making very funny license plates. We've been making ones

379
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,940
that have an eight, an equal sign and a D. You are owned was one that I drew

380
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:36,240
the they do. They do crack down on a lot of the ones that are more obviously

381
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,240
twenty. So I have been making some silly ones that maybe appeal to a

382
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,980
different crowd. So I've been making ones that say, for example, one, two,

383
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:48,140
three, five. Yep, so as if it's made by someone who can't count, if you're

384
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,540
not a math nerd, you might have not noticed that's not in sequence, right?

385
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:57,220
Yeah, that's the wrong because the ones I make that say semen or vaginal yeah

386
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,320
these ones usually get

387
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,960
bad

388
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,160
off the

389
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,760
a g a n a l

390
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,480
for all the

391
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,720
trouble. These ones they get crumpled down and they get made into cubes that

392
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:15,760
then turn into and again on my Etsy store. I have been making these license

393
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,040
plates for hipsters. I've been doing ironic stuff yeah and never in my life

394
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,760
did I think I'd know how to build a car, but apparently that's really I've known

395
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,740
come along. It was kind of it was incredible how natural he was at

396
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,140
building a car. We've been coming, we're coming manly men.

397
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,760
We're hardened right when I get out of here, I'm going to be a

398
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,980
different guy because I'll be a hundred and eighty years old.

399
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:45,000
So they say that you're all your cells are different every seven years.

400
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,920
People say that people say twenty different guys before you get out of

401
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,640
here. People say that prison that it punishes people instead of reforming

402
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:55,440
them, but no, I'm going to be completely different when I got it. My brain is

403
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,140
getting completely rewired. When I get out of prison, I'm going to have a

404
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,920
completely different conception of race. Exactly, because in here we're all one

405
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:07,840
race. We're orange, we have orange, we all wear orange clothes out in the

406
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,780
in the out in the in the old world. That's what we call that, because we

407
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,340
kind of feel like we're pilgrims kind of

408
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:18,760
coming here. It is brave new world and we're changing it for the better. We're

409
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:23,700
of terraforming this place. And Pat brought in a few new diseases. Oh yeah.

410
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:29,300
People have defenses built up against. Nobody here was immune to ADHD.

411
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:33,500
I've been telling so. Something with the food that was in your butt has also caused it to.

412
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:38,900
Oh absolutely. To mutate and be easily spreadable. But it did make the steaks better.

413
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:43,900
Yeah. That is true. It kind of dry aged them. It's working. The one thing that I have been

414
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,620
doing while I have been in here is teaching a lot of the other prisoners about mental health

415
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,080
and mental health awareness. And I've diagnosed pretty much every single person on the cell

416
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:56,240
block with ADHD and autism.

417
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,680
Which is going to really help in their defenses, I think. I think that's a good chance of getting

418
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,680
paroled.

419
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:05,160
I've pretty much diagnosed every single person in here with some kind of TikTok mental health

420
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,160
thing.

421
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,080
And if you're scared that we're hanging out with serial killers and stuff.

422
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,080
Yeah, we are.

423
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,000
Yeah, we are. Yeah, sue me. Yeah, I mean, at this point, yeah, Cameron is probably approaching

424
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
serial killer numbers.

425
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,760
but also we were doing that before we got sent to jail to yeah. I mean and you

426
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,720
might be too and not even know it. Yeah, that's the scariest part about me to

427
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:27,800
say killer the Brooklyn all comedy scene. It's more fucked up than you think that

428
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:32,640
is some real shit. It's pretty much all serial. A huge percentage of serial

429
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,960
killers have been in refuge hiding. They've been put. They've been put into a

430
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,120
lot of people also get put into witness protection in the in the all comedy

431
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:44,360
scene is something I found out. Yeah, yeah, people like I know you see people

432
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,960
who you're like this person is are they doing a character that couldn't possibly

433
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,720
that be this weird guys like Nathan Fielder, Joe para no, they act like that,

434
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,440
because they're putting on a way to cover it up exactly to cover it up. They've

435
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,160
been horrible things. You think John Wilson, you think he did

436
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:02,480
you think any human being would talk like that and do you think he turns that

437
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,040
camera off before he walks by people's windows at night and then records them

438
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:11,680
putting the pin code on their on their door? No, did he steal that shit? He's

439
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,320
going in there, he's slitting throat. Pretty much every single comedian you've

440
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,700
ever, every single comedian you've ever seen, every single comedian you've ever

441
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:24,520
met has one or six bodies. And if you're wondering, buried underneath their house.

442
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:27,720
And if you're wondering if we've given up our dreams just 'cause we moved to

443
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,160
prison. Prison. Hello! No, we are still comedians, we are still actors. Guess

444
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,320
what these mics are for when we're not recording the podcast. That's why we are

445
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,240
still screenwriters, poets, authors, and amateur film colorists. Artists.

446
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,240
potential musicians if we ever learned how to play an instrument.

447
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,360
I made one of those. I took the washboards.

448
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,360
I've been working on a song in here really quick.

449
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,480
Do you guys want to hear it?

450
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:50,980
Yes.

451
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:51,480
Here's how it goes.

452
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,480
It's called "Beep."

453
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,920
I haven't learned how to do pitches yet.

454
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,420
Uh-huh.

455
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,920
But that's the rhythm behind it.

456
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,640
But once you figure out the notes, that'll sound amazing.

457
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,080
That's going to be the next "Feel Good, Inc."

458
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,960
And it will have vocals as well. It could even be touching.

459
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,460
Yeah.

460
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,200
Yeah, that does sound like "Feel Good, Inc."

461
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,160
Kind of. Wait. Do it again.

462
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
you

463
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:19,120
see that's a sample that song for my song. You can sample it might sample

464
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,680
thirty seconds to my better that's

465
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,680
do it

466
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:28,080
for a copy. Yeah, exactly that's the other thing you'll copyright anybody is

467
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,520
gone. You guys remember the episode of family guy where he gets diplomatic

468
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:36,400
immunity. Uh-huh pretty much we have that we have that dad. We have prison

469
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
his addict immunity. What are they going? They can't punish us any more than

470
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,400
we've already been punished. We're in jail for the rest of our lives. None of

471
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:48,680
this shit matters. I'll hit Patrick. I will hit you. What are they going to do?

472
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:53,200
Not going to. Execute us? The death penalty's been revoked by Communist

473
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,080
liberals in almost every single state. I never thought I would be thankful for a

474
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,640
liberal or a commie in my life, but here I am. But here I am. Guess where we

475
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,800
were going before these liberal bastards? Straight to the chair. We were going to

476
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,040
execution method called the pit that was based on a mortal combat stage.

477
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:14,240
They're going to throw us into a spike. They're going to do a brutality at us.

478
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,800
We were they don't even think we're important enough to get the camera

479
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,600
angles of a fatality. No, just a brutality. Just punch our heads right

480
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
off our fucking heads.

481
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,360
And that was it.

482
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,840
Sometimes I confuse

483
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:33,600
one of the same in here, the same. Honestly, in here, people are treating

484
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,200
feel like I'm one big foot, so it doesn't fucking matter what my body

485
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,240
they're all massaging you massage me smell me from your own massages.

486
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,520
And what is that? So many? I guess I look tight. The rub king. Yeah, I

487
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,560
guess I look like you get rubbed. I get rubbed. I call him the rub king.

488
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,920
I'm the monk and they call you the

489
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:56,800
they call you gang. I'm a Megatron. They call you Megatron. Recently,

490
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,040
people have been calling you Genghis Khan. Yeah, they call you the Slayer

491
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,080
Tron. Yeah, they call you the gang is convict. Gang is convict.

492
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,580
Genghis Tron. No, you can't make your own nickname. I mean, you can do

493
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,440
whatever you want because I'm scared of you. We're not gonna tell you what

494
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:17,780
you can and can't do. The Hound would be cool. The Hound of Cellblock 1000?

495
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:23,300
The Hell Hound of Cellblock 1000. Yeah, that would work. The Psycho Crazy of

496
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:27,000
Cellblock 10,000. They've mostly been calling you Cameron though because you

497
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,120
do this when you I don't like nicknames. Yeah, you don't like nicknames. You

498
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,760
don't like names at all. If my name were if I wanted my name to be shorter, I

499
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,980
would have got it legally changed. Yeah, what would you change your to cam? Do

500
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,780
you guys think that I could get people to stop calling me the rub king and

501
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:46,000
maybe start calling me? I think you'd have to rattle snake. You'd have to go.

502
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,240
Well, I think the award the one way that you can definitely change your name.

503
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,760
Why

504
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:55,440
you could join Nation of Islam. What about? Oh, I'm already trying to yeah.

505
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,120
They have a lengthy hazing process to get in though.

506
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
That makes sense.

507
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,360
I've been getting dunked into big buckets of glue and stuff.

508
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,160
Yeah, they put feathers on you?

509
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
Yeah, yeah.

510
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,360
I did see you on the commissary and you were...

511
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Commissary?

512
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,160
Is that the word?

513
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,080
I did see you, you were nude and you had your hand over your balls.

514
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
And I was like, "Oh my God."

515
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,360
Guys, I could see you being called "Q-Ball."

516
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,360
That could be cool.

517
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,360
Q-Ball is good.

518
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,360
Q-Ball.

519
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,120
I mean I kind of want something a little tougher because I do I mean you all

520
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,520
cool. I like getting tough man. It hits all the other balls after it gets hit in

521
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,360
the butt with the stick.

522
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:39,080
I mean, I guess I just want like I like being the rub King. I like okay. What

523
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:39,360
about

524
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:47,680
yeah? I mean I can. Oh, I got one Mr Clean, you know what about Mr Sean? Maybe

525
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,080
it wouldn't have anything. It could have nothing to do with what about shiny

526
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,920
superstar, shiny superstar, it doesn't have to be shiny, it's good, superstar,

527
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,420
superstar is a little close, but again, I want you to be like, what about like

528
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:03,840
popstar is good, popstar is good, wait, okay, the vanilla gorilla, oh my God,

529
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,100
no, no, no, no, no, we are rebranding you as popstar, popstar, okay, we are

530
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,960
gonna take these microphones, we are going to have a prison concert, you're

531
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,480
gonna be like Johnny Cash, but you're gonna go up there and you're gonna be

532
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,800
doing all these like little boy band songs, yeah, you're gonna be doing like,

533
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,720
yeah, big time rush rush style. Yeah, I just went to prison, getting after

534
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,280
children and I feel just like a pop star kidnap the children. It just rhymes.

535
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,880
Okay, I didn't do any kidnap. I don't even know. I don't even know. I don't

536
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,820
know what so much. I mean, we were we we are in here because we shined a laser

537
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:43,400
pointer at a motorist, allegedly, allegedly, so no, I did that shit. I did

538
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,480
that shit, bro. It was three different. I did that shit. Yeah, I did it too. I

539
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,280
did all the other stuff they said we were doing, but I didn't do that one.

540
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,680
Yeah, I shined a laser pointer at a motorist, a person behind the wheel of a

541
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:59,400
car, for those who don't know, and I stole movies from free movies.com.

542
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,200
That was why you got in here. That was one of the reasons. I also killed a

543
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:08,640
family. I left a bunch of fucking dog turds all over the city. Yeah, and the

544
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:12,360
parking tickets. It was the parking tickets, but guys, I'm going to be

545
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,240
honest, it was mostly the dog turds. Yeah, I drew and I was throwing them in

546
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:20,720
places. There was I just thought kind of you could put them wherever. So I was

547
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,240
putting them in, you know, those little kid race car things that

548
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,080
the little electric ones. I am not that smart and I don't wear my glasses. That

549
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:33,520
was a garbage can. So I was and I was accumulating and I wasn't bagging them

550
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,920
either. So I was just kind of just picking them up, throwing them in there.

551
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:39,480
I'd walk around with a dust pan and kind of just sweep turds into this thing.

552
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,400
Then all of a sudden, this kid sits down in it, squishes poop everywhere, and

553
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,620
basically he sued me because he got grounded for shitting his pants, but

554
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:51,560
yeah, it wasn't true. I was also I also another charge. They levied against me.

555
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:57,020
I was I drew crude nudes in my personal notebook. I left it on the train. Yeah,

556
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,360
yeah, I could see doing trace me back based on my based on what they had a

557
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,320
handwriting expert and also you got to stop signing those things. Yeah, well, I

558
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,380
sign it with my address, my phone number and my S. S. N. and then I put $5000

559
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:16,560
reward if returned, which if they ever do return, I'm saying no man that says

560
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,260
five point oh oh oh dollars. Oh, that's best for and I also don't have five

561
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:25,200
dollars. Yeah, I don't have any money. I mean, I think if I was if you think if I

562
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,720
was all my money is in cigarettes, I think if I was rich, I'd be drawing

563
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,060
these in my notebook. No, no, I'd be painting them on canvas. It'd be in the

564
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:36,920
Luma or the eye. The one both the one thing I did get sent in here for

565
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,920
the one thing that I was like, oh, the laser pointer thing, whatever, whatever

566
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:47,460
and they try, then these mother fuckers try to get me on skateboarding. I have

567
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,840
never once in my life touched a skateboard. You're not a boarder. I'm not

568
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:55,320
a skater. You're the farthest thing from a skateboard. I don't skate. I don't do

569
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:59,300
vandalizing of property. No, he's a toy, man. Yeah. I'm a total toy. I don't do

570
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,960
graffiti. Yeah, admit it. He's a toy poser. I don't do graffiti and I don't

571
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,900
skateboard. I'm a complete... And, and this, the alleged skateboarding, there is

572
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,880
no proof. Yeah. There is no proof that I have ever once in my life put wax on a

573
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,040
the ledge and all those videos of Patrick skateboarding guys. That was

574
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,660
not skateboarding. He doesn't land any of the tricks. They all look like

575
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,760
complete shit. He can't do a single fucking thing. I know every clip he's

576
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,680
ever posted. He's not skateboarding. No, you couldn't call that skateboarding.

577
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:33,560
I went on to be a if I got on the soccer pitch and I fell over and

578
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,400
started putting the soccer ball on my ass and punching my balls and put the

579
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,900
other hand in my mouth. Would you say? Oh, that guy's playing soccer?

580
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,160
basically what he does for the I don't know what soccer is. That's what I would

581
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,100
say a foot sorry foot foot foot foot foot foot foot foot foot foot foot foot

582
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,040
foot, but yeah, you wouldn't call that soccer and you wouldn't call what he

583
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:54,440
does skateboarding because really it's an embarrassment to skateboarding. We

584
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,400
don't have to go. I mean just well, you said it yourself. You don't scare

585
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:01,500
well. Just I don't skateboard. Allegedly, we don't have to go or allegedly don't,

586
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,080
but you don't what, but you don't this is the case. This is basically the case

587
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:11,280
that my lawyer is trying to do. Maybe he was trying to yeah, but he's not.

588
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:16,280
but he's never he's never successfully. That was what that's what it was.

589
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,480
There's no crime there. Maybe listen. They have attempted murder. They don't

590
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,120
have attempted skateboarding. Exactly, which is not a crime. Apparently, or it

591
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,440
is a crime skateboarding, skateboarding, that's always a complete crime. But

592
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,000
what you were doing with the skateboard, I would say, is arguably even bigger

593
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,440
crime. Yeah, because it was just so hard to art just worth. I mean, just to

594
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:38,640
call me worthless and I get that you were doing like a kind of Sasha Baron

595
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:43,140
Cohen satire thing right like wouldn't it be funny if a guy was this bad at

596
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,780
skateboarding, but

597
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:49,880
it just I get why they locked you up in here as well. Yeah, no, they locked me up

598
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:54,780
in here for the laser pointer and I'm currently fighting this case that I

599
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:58,280
ever touched a skateboard. I got it for that. They got our fingerprints on this

600
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:03,080
laser point. They used it to tie us to all these other cases. I mean this they

601
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:06,720
let us keep it, even though it's evidence. Yeah, you don't have to switch

602
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,680
it on and off. It's on

603
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,680
I don't know how you don't know how to use...

604
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:14,680
You don't know how to do anything basically and that's why you're in prison.

605
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,680
This is where stupid people go to die.

606
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,680
But another thing they got me on, I was expiring milk.

607
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Yeah, I would get it from the grocery store and I would just let it sit in my house until the expiration day passed and I'd bring it back.

608
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Bro, that is nasty as fuck.

609
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
Oh, you would return it?

610
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,680
Yeah.

611
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,680
You'd switch it out?

612
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
Yeah.

613
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,680
Switch out the jugs?

614
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
Yeah.

615
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
That's a good move.

616
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
Yeah.

617
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,880
I mean, you know you're basically just giving people sour cream, right a big

618
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,520
whoop. I got I got way show me literally one line of any US law where it says it

619
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,500
is illegal to expire milk. Exactly nobody even thought of this. You're not

620
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:52,780
not allowed to expire. I wouldn't have done it if there was a lot that said

621
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:56,200
that, unless they exactly as they recently put an amendment in the

622
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:59,080
Constitution, which it could have been because I don't read. I don't read every

623
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,300
update to the Constitution. I do I keep I keep up with it and there's nothing

624
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,500
I saw milk in there even a little bit. They are didn't have milk. They did

625
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,640
what was that amendment? They just are thinking of adding

626
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,840
probably something to to make woke is a mandatory

627
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:23,100
that literally it makes me want to make a shiv and go down to find the wokest

628
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:26,840
person in prison and stab them. That's the thing man. I used to think shiv was

629
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,740
a succession character, a woman who's as big as the guys on the show, but now

630
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:37,220
it's a tooth now. It's a it's a tooth brush that I've sharpened with a knife

631
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,880
that they let me bring in. Yeah,

632
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,180
you whittled it.

633
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:44,580
Yeah, they give you all these knives. They let me bring you not to whittle

634
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:48,720
stuff into weapons. Yeah, they let me bring in my knife collection. I have

635
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,360
butcher's knives. I have like little bear grills, pocket knives and shit,

636
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:58,780
and what is wrong with taking my toothbrush, filing it down to look like a

637
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,980
sharp object. I and as you get in a guy in the belly, your shivs man,

638
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,620
because I'm always trying to brush my teeth and I pick it up and I

639
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,020
fucking hurt my palm because the way I hold the toothbrushes, I cut the

640
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:13,340
end of it and I am putting a... I have my wet stones too. I know your

641
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,940
secret, Matt. I'm wetting them down. He's lying. I'm doing the whole thing.

642
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,660
I know your secret, man. What? Oh, you're doing a whole thing. I'm doing

643
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:22,060
a whole thing. 'Cause you're being... Yeah, I know where you're going with

644
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,080
this. You've gotten so much control of your ass by carrying all these

645
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,560
- Yes. - It's a pencil sharpener.

646
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,900
- It's a pencil sharpener down there now.

647
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,740
- Admit it. - Yes.

648
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,740
- I see the crank you attached to your head.

649
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:34,160
- Oh, it's not even a crank, it's electric.

650
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,980
It's using the electrons in my heart at night.

651
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,820
- You gotta stop 'cause you're keeping me up at night.

652
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,540
I'm trying to fall asleep, right?

653
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,660
- I'm bored.

654
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,740
- I'm looking at my calendar.

655
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:48,620
- This is the only thing I can do in my free time is this.

656
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,600
- And then you (imitates buzzing)

657
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,760
- And I'm sitting there and I'm sharpening

658
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,960
all the toothbrush

659
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:02,860
in the jail. I'm sharpening every single end of every single toothbrush and

660
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,260
there's going to be a full scale. Ryan,

661
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,160
listen, if this is how you're doing it, prove it. Why don't you do it right

662
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,960
now to the cigarette? Okay, well, you'd have to I mean, it's he's in a one

663
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,260
piece. I'll take it off.

664
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,760
I mean, you can't take it off. You're going to get banned off YouTube. Yeah,

665
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,660
but guys still have to care about YouTube and we still have to do the

666
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:23,360
podcast because as much as I would love to move this thing to live leak

667
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:28,160
doesn't exist anymore. Right. So we still have to do the podcast. If you're

668
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,400
wondering, is it going to end? No, no, no, no, it's not. It will never end.

669
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:34,560
If anything, we have more time to do it now. We have nothing fucking better to

670
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,480
do, man. We've already, I mean, we've already made the four paintings. I've

671
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:43,600
already looked at every single date on my calendar. Which, by the way, the 26th

672
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,320
of August is National Dog Day. So look forward to that. Yeah. I actually am

673
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,360
maybe have to step away, step back from the podcast for a little while because I

674
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,960
I do. I did get a job.

675
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,260
You got a job. Yeah, I'm doing a remote work. I'm doing marketing.

676
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,840
Oh, they're fucking who higher ed. I don't want to say this specific school

677
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,760
because I don't want to get fired, but state school.

678
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,140
I don't want to say anything about it really, but I've been building emails

679
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,340
and MailChimp and using Canva and InDesign and stuff. So that's been

680
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,360
taking me a lot of time out of my day.

681
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,960
Are you I mean,

682
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:19,140
that's interesting. You're going to have time to like I have is I have a

683
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,860
I have a filter on my video for Zoom calls where it makes me look like I'm

684
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,880
wearing a normal shirt

685
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,160
instead of a jumpsuit. You're always wearing that green shirt, Cameron.

686
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,160
Very interesting. It's my favorite shirt. It's my lucky, it's my lucky

687
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:34,980
business shirt.

688
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,160
Okay, but yeah, let's go ahead. I've prepared. They let me use the internet

689
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,900
a little bit in here. Oh, you have to. Well, I mean, by the way, we do have,

690
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,160
we have Google Fiber in here. Which the reason that I got the job,

691
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,060
besides money, which I do like money is also so to give an excuse to give

692
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,960
myself some internet access here, use some of that extra internet time put

693
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,520
together. So is that slide shows they just give you the internet access for

694
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,800
that? Yeah, they put a computer in my download Baldur's Gate three for me. I

695
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,120
know you know, I don't think they usually let you download nerd ass shit

696
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,320
in prison. They got naked guys in there. Yeah, that's why they're not allowed.

697
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,960
You're not allowed to do that. You're gonna rile everyone else in prison up.

698
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:20,060
that's why you're only a little jack up to paintings in here. Well in my

699
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:20,520
calendar

700
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:25,060
here's a here's what we're looking at today. Here's our list. Oh, so I thought

701
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:28,800
that this might be pretty helpful for us to have a good laugh. It's one hundred

702
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,440
plus best prison jokes to send to someone in jail for a good laugh. Do we

703
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:41,280
know this is by Rhoda Mugini? Do we know Rhoda? I think so. I don't know. I think

704
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,500
he might know Rodan. He's a big bird. Yeah, wait. He's a big bird that sits on

705
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,800
top of the prison thinking and I know a genie. Yeah, by the way, guys, I'm

706
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,440
getting really good at basketball. I just wanted to say that and don't say

707
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:53,980
that I

708
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,940
that's a good nickname. The best I don't. He is the basketball. They call him

709
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,340
the basketball because they are, they are picking him up and they're throwing

710
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:02,580
him.

711
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,080
Can I be pop? They're throwing him in the hoop. They are picking him up and

712
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:09,440
throwing him in the hoop. They don't treat me like a ball. They treat him

713
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:13,500
like a ball because they once they, they saw him on the court the first time

714
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:18,540
he showed up. They said, "Damn!" Yeah, they said, "Damn, let's throw this guy in the hoop."

715
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,360
"That basketball can dribble himself!" "Damn!" "Let's throw this guy in the hoop right now.

716
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:27,500
He's making a fool of himself out here." No. He had his hand behind his back and he was

717
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:31,340
dribbling like this. No, he's mad that I said his skateboarding was bad. I'm not mad. He

718
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,820
was taking it out on me. If you want to fight, we can fucking schedule the fight. I'm not

719
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:38,900
going to fight. We'll put it up on the calendar. Yeah, we'll put it up on the calendar. 3 p.m.,

720
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,300
meet in the yard. We'll form the circle. Everybody will scream "Fight!" And then one of us will

721
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,260
we'll go to fucking the principal's office. All right, if you want to do

722
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,340
that, I'm not going to fight.

723
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:51,740
I'm here, I'm here to work on my art prison can be a depressing and

724
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:55,660
difficult place and finding ways to bring a little bit of humor and laughter

725
00:41:55,660 --> 00:42:00,100
to someone's life who is behind bars can go a long way. If you know someone

726
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:03,620
currently serving time in jail and want to brighten their day, one option is to

727
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:08,580
send them a fun need joke. This article has compiled a list of the best prison

728
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:13,480
jokes sure to make your friends smile one hundred plus prison jokes to send to

729
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,720
someone. I personally I don't need what are you doing because I'm

730
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:20,880
I'm laughing it up all day every day. We're writing our own jokes for I think

731
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,500
like I think that you're going to like these jokes, though. I think we're going

732
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,600
to read these jokes together and I think we're going to get some good laughs.

733
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,400
Will these make people out of prison laugh? I think that these might be a

734
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,980
little inside baseball or inside jail.

735
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:36,360
I like that, but you did that, but I think that maybe we can bring did that. I

736
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,240
I think, hopefully, that maybe we can bring prison culture a little bit to

737
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,140
the outside and maybe we can help the rest of the world act more like

738
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:47,340
prisoners. Yeah, yeah, I do think that I didn't realize that it was such a

739
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:53,060
we got seen yes, men or yes, man. Yeah, I went on my first date in

740
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:57,460
middle school to see yes, man, and I ate all the popcorn that she bought.

741
00:42:57,460 --> 00:43:01,980
That's kind of how I see the world now is like the people who are in who are

742
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:05,180
prisoners. Those are the yes, men. Those are the doers. They said, yes, I

743
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,760
to be in prison yeah because yes, I will report to do legally have to ask the

744
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,920
doers hey. I wish the prison had some doors and they said yeah damn bars see

745
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,040
that's a lot of yes men do end up at being in prison because they ask them if

746
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:21,860
they did something. Did you murder that woman and yeah, yeah, I have to say yes,

747
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:23,340
I have to say yes, I guess

748
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:28,660
god damn it yes, yes, I am a yes man. I have to say yes,

749
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:34,880
it is difficult to find things to discuss with someone in prison, especially

750
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:38,480
if you have never been jailed, but sometimes a good joke can be a great

751
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:42,120
way to break the ice and connect with someone behind bars. So this is good if

752
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,920
you're trying to break the ice with someone who's in prison. Why don't my

753
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,400
job for breaking the ice last week, whether you are penning down a letter or

754
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,920
sending a message through a prison communication system, including a funny

755
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,520
joke and show that you are thinking of the person and trying to bring a little

756
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,680
bit of joy to their day. Now, what is this? Recommended for you. Yeah, Durban

757
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,280
men pay R123 for water at Platinum Belt Lounge after seeing expensive. Oh,

758
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:07,400
Okay, who are what is a Durban man that is in South Africa? I believe

759
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:11,060
funny prison jokes. What are some famous prison lines? Check out the

760
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:14,560
following jokes below that will make any prison smile. Okay, they include the

761
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,420
following. So now we're finally getting into it. I think maybe we can switch

762
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:21,000
off, switch off reading them, maybe. I mean yeah, but I'll start here.

763
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,560
What do you call a fake noodle in prison? A cell phony?

764
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:28,040
Okay,

765
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,880
maybe this is like chelphony like maybe there's like a

766
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,480
telephone

767
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,220
yeah, that's kind of funny, but kind of, but I think it's more prison, phony,

768
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:48,480
fake telephone, a noodle. This is more of a joke for the writers, though yeah

769
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,260
reader, that's definitely readers not going to get yeah. There are the

770
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,020
listeners not going to get it, maybe the reader. All right, well, let's go to

771
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,800
the next one, then okay, you do this one. Okay. Why did the prisoner take a

772
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,180
shower before he ate?

773
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,020
he wanted to enjoy his meal behind bars.

774
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:09,640
Why bars of soap? Oh

775
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:18,340
bars of soap, but he doesn't want to enjoy his meal behind bars, maybe

776
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:22,620
what meal like meal like you take you shower guys like you take a shower.

777
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,540
That makes sense yeah wait okay. He wanted to shout like you oh shout show

778
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,840
maybe it's show or like he wanted to show her everybody has big food. Yeah,

779
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,320
he wanted to show her everyone me likey, maybe the shower

780
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,620
we like to eat food. Oh, no, I get it. Why did the prisoner take a shower

781
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,500
before he ate as opposed to during

782
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,480
while he's eating because the shower doesn't have bars, but it's seldom, so

783
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,820
we wanted to enjoy his meal behind bars in the cell. So it's not so much a

784
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,660
joke as much as it is just like this guy. This is what he yeah,

785
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:59,440
try to figure out what this means. Is he so why is enjoy his meal? Why died

786
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:05,180
linked the prize price owner? Maybe it's price owner. Why died the price owner

787
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:10,940
take a shower shower by for he ate for he ate and ate as in the number yeah he

788
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:15,220
wanted to years in prison. Enjoy his me all

789
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:19,700
bad behind bars,

790
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:23,740
soap, be to watch, watch your behind,

791
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:29,740
but with a bar, so smart you wash your behind with a bar of soap yeah.

792
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:34,980
Finally figured it out. Let's go to the next joke. Caleb, this one's okay. I

793
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:41,460
got you. We had a technical difficulty because of a riot that broke out. I

794
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:45,540
thought it was a rat that broke. It was a it's confusing because they basically

795
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:50,820
the same fucking word, which was reverse kudos to whoever invented fucking English.

796
00:46:50,820 --> 00:46:57,300
What happened was the guys outside saw a rat scurry across the floor and it

797
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:59,460
caused a rat scurry on the floor.

798
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:01,980
And then somebody said, you want to start a riot?

799
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:04,220
And I said, you're going to start a rat.

800
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:08,400
And that's where the confusion, it was the whole confusion stemmed from, and it

801
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:13,220
started and then it led to, I think, 31 confirmed kills.

802
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:13,760
Yes.

803
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,100
All from Cameron.

804
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:19,140
Well, let's go ahead and move to Caleb's joke. All right, let's see. So my joke

805
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,500
now. Okay,

806
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:26,640
did you hear about the prisoner who invented a teleportation device? He was

807
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,660
sentenced to life.

808
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:30,220
Oh, life in prison.

809
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:34,080
Well, but okay, but kind of like us. All right, well, let's do the same thing

810
00:47:34,080 --> 00:47:38,660
we did with the other ones. So sentenced, this is a sentence. True.

811
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,700
It's actually two sentences. So

812
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,040
and also life. Maybe it's like he spent his entire life

813
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,660
teleporting. Yeah,

814
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:53,580
yeah, this one's hard to figure out. We can I've got a bunch of these. We can

815
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:56,420
just keep moving forward. Invented, he got in the vents, he tried to escape.

816
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,500
Oh yeah, there we go. That's it. Port.

817
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:05,900
Yeah, port. Port. Tele. He's on the tele. He's on the tele. On the porta.

818
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:09,860
Here's another one. That makes sense. Why did the prisoner break his own watch?

819
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,200
you wanted to serve time. Oh, I like that. That's like kind of how drag queens say

820
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,800
serve. Yeah, yeah. Like, oh, he's, he's serving, if somebody's wearing a watch,

821
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,600
they'd be like, oh, you're serving time. Right. It's giving time. It's, that's

822
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,200
giving, oh, that's giving time. A watch is giving time. Serving time. Which is

823
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:28,880
something I've said for a long time, even before giving came out as slang, I always

824
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:32,160
say, this watch is giving time. Yeah. Because it gives me time. Yeah. It gives

825
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,860
me the time. So, you kind of invented that. Yeah. Yeah. The whole giving and

826
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,340
serving thing. I was first when it comes to giving and serving, when it comes to

827
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:42,100
watches and time yeah would be my area on expertise and can honestly say that

828
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,640
watch is a cunt. I usually say it's stuff like she was giving me cunt. She

829
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:50,060
was and that kind of got corrupted and changed through the power of slang yeah,

830
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,560
yeah, then he turned it in all these branches yeah.

831
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:54,680
This next one here.

832
00:48:54,680 --> 00:48:59,680
Why did the prisoner bring a ladder to his cell?

833
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:04,760
He wanted to reach new heights that's straight forward. That's pretty much

834
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,880
Yeah, but I don't like the implication of this, which is that the I mean, I

835
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,040
don't even know that he was gonna cut the he was gonna kick the ladder out

836
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:16,800
from his foot and kill himself. He's gonna end his own life. Yeah, usually

837
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,120
they do that on a bucket. Yeah, a ladder if you're a tall, real tall guy.

838
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:24,360
That's true. Ladder if you are tall. Yeah. Well, usually what they really

839
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:29,120
do is they... So what you get a neck tie or any kind of noose thing,

840
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,800
you tie it around a doorknob and then

841
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,920
slam the door.

842
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:33,920
it's really

843
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,680
I think you're thinking of pulling teeth. No, no, no, no pulling souls from body

844
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,260
yeah yeah. You slam the door, not really hard. I've heard of that done

845
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,960
because it's tragic. I think that's the way that a lot of eight and nine year

846
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:54,220
olds kill themselves is by. I think you guys are really getting confused about

847
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,600
the two getting your teeth out. No, you are you saying so you put a piece of

848
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,520
dental floss around your neck yeah, no, no like a neck tie or like a neck floss

849
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,900
yeah, you put neck floss around your neck. You put neck floss or a neck and

850
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:11,500
then you tied on the door, and then you slam the door, you get your brother to

851
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:15,700
slam the door as hard as he can, because he's older and stronger yeah. I mean I

852
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:18,640
guess it would work if you yeah okay, that would work if it's neck floss and

853
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:20,520
yeah, obviously it's for your neck.

854
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:25,560
Okay, so here I'll just read these rapid fire. Okay, real quick. What do you call

855
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,760
a prisoner who's always ready to fight celluroid? What do you call a prisoner

856
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,800
who's good at math? Cellculator. What do you call a prisoner who's always on

857
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:37,980
time? Cellender. What do you call a prisoner who's good at painting?

858
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:38,800
Cellbert.

859
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:44,200
What do you call a prisoner who's good at telling jokes? Cellmate. I know

860
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:47,920
Cellbert. Me too. I know Cellmate too. He does the Cellbert report.

861
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,960
See, the thing about all these jokes,

862
00:50:52,720 --> 00:51:00,500
The things that's great about all five of these jokes here is if you said these in a real prison,

863
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,980
they would laugh. They wouldn't even try to beat you up.

864
00:51:02,980 --> 00:51:03,980
You'd get a huge amount of laughs, yeah.

865
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:05,700
They wouldn't even try to beat your ass for saying this stuff.

866
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:10,260
This is good. This will maybe the next time that somebody takes the massage over an hour,

867
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,860
which is my limit, by the way. Past that, it starts giving me bruises like I got cupping

868
00:51:14,860 --> 00:51:15,860
done.

869
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,860
Getting bruised.

870
00:51:16,860 --> 00:51:17,860
I get bruised.

871
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:18,860
Getting too massaged.

872
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:26,480
I mean over an hour is just way too much. I'm a very light bruiser, so by the

873
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,900
like a banana yeah, I mean

874
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:32,440
nobody calls me banana yet everyone calls you banana because they make you

875
00:51:32,440 --> 00:51:35,580
do the splits, but now when I say stop and they say I'm not going to stop now.

876
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:38,260
I can get them to stop by telling them one of these jokes and rolling on the

877
00:51:38,260 --> 00:51:43,060
ground. So okay, okay, sell you road yeah yeah exactly yeah, you look ready to

878
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:47,020
fight and you're in prison. You're going to sell your royal fold the phone. We

879
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,080
at the new class clown. I guess a little analysis on their hands off of my

880
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:54,880
glutes to slap their knees. I think sell bert sell mate. These things are

881
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,560
pretty straight forward, but I do want to analyze really quick, though. What do

882
00:51:57,560 --> 00:52:01,240
you call a prisoner is always ready to fight? Sell you roid. We're seeing two

883
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:07,320
hyphens here. We're seeing sell you roid, so the you and the roid are separate

884
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:11,500
things here. Oh yeah, true. We have cellculator, obviously cell calculator,

885
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,720
sell and der, sell calendar, sell bert, don't even need to go any deeper into

886
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:21,540
yeah, that one's obvious. So you roid so obviously the roid is what is the word

887
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:26,500
droid, which is created for war and the you could mean I'm fighting you. Oh, it

888
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:31,500
could mean I'm fighting you or maybe what it means, maybe a you haul right,

889
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:38,720
but what is the you utility utility? Oh, okay, you are in jail, yep, unfree

890
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,680
the opposite of free

891
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,400
here is some light hearted prison related gags that are not intended to harm or

892
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:47,360
offend anyone

893
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:52,160
share the jokes with any of your relatives or friends in jail. Why did

894
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:56,800
the prisoner refuse to eat his meal? He said it was a con artist

895
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:04,120
confectionary artist. Yep, the meal was the man. It's funny. I mentioned

896
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,920
confectionary because we're going to be seeing a lot of confectionaries in the

897
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,500
future of these jokes really so just kind of keep that in your mouth in your

898
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,060
brain, my mouth and your brine, your brine, your brine,

899
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:16,100
yeah

900
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:22,100
okay. Why did the burglar take a shower after breaking into the house? He wanted

901
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,940
to wash away his conviction. That's pretty. I it's pretty straight. I tried

902
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:30,500
that kind of dry or should I say wet and dry, wet and wet, then dry, soap and

903
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:35,080
wet, yeah, so some water, soaked and soaked and wet, wished myself with soap

904
00:53:35,080 --> 00:53:35,600
and wetter.

905
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:43,360
I wish myself clean. Oh yeah, sound like you're from Wisconsin. I wish myself

906
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,960
clean a little more Australian wished myself a small chief claim. Give me

907
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,200
another joke yeah. Let's see this one. Why didn't prisoners use social media

908
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:56,240
kind of slipped into Rodney for a second? Sure I couldn't hit it. Why

909
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:00,480
don't we? Why didn't prisoners use social media? They prefer

910
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,880
they prefer cellular communication.

911
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:10,080
we have that yeah. We do completely have that I should been doing this every

912
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:14,620
time doing the God, I'm slipping sorry guys jail is kind of put me in a bit of

913
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,840
a tizzy yeah, and it made me a lot more orange with my clothes. My fashion

914
00:54:18,840 --> 00:54:24,040
changed when I moved to jail. What's this next joke here? Why did the prisoner

915
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:30,120
keep sneezing? He was allergic to cell mate. That would really be a problem.

916
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,400
Would be that would be such a you're a could be dangerous. If it was a serious

917
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:36,400
it would be really dangerous. You wouldn't be able to keep you in jail.

918
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,480
No, they'd have to let you free legally. Is this supposed to be like a

919
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,440
solitary cellmates?

920
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,240
Cellmaties. Cellmaties? Cell...

921
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:52,640
Fuck, this one's tough, man. Cellmate, cellmate, cellophane, latex. Oh, you

922
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:56,240
could be allergic to... Yeah, some kind of plastic. Cellmates, cellmates,

923
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,240
cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates,

924
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,440
cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates, cellmatates,

925
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,880
a semen. You can't be allergic to semen sneezing. I know who I know guys allergic

926
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,120
to semen. How'd you find out

927
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,560
from a doctor?

928
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:16,720
A doctor, I was saying a doctor jizzed on me and yeah, I was saying, well,

929
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:21,440
you're allergic. I was saying it's a guy. I don't like that. You must be

930
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,240
allergic. Let me just put this in this. I was saying it was a guy. I know I was

931
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,800
saying it was a guy. I know because I didn't want to embarrass myself, but you

932
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:33,140
sent to the doctor. He just on your face and found out I'm allergic to my

933
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,180
semen. My my penis always swells up when semen is near. Yes, I've seen this

934
00:55:38,180 --> 00:55:39,780
happen red and bumpy. Yeah,

935
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,800
you should put that in the joke

936
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:47,460
bumpy yeah like an allergy because the palpables on the

937
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:52,980
yeah, it looks like a dog's tongue. Yeah, the palpables make it look like a

938
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:57,160
citrus fruit. They're like minuscule mushrooms with just as much psychedelic

939
00:55:57,200 --> 00:56:02,600
respect on me. People get penile penis cancer pretty much every day. Oh, some

940
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:08,600
of us do make your penis bigger. Now it makes it bigger in the way that a

941
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:12,440
branch of a tree would get bigger and get a separate part of it that's going

942
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:17,000
off in a different direction. You get to fractalized to mother fucking dongs

943
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:22,720
yeah swag. Think about a y shape. Think about why my wife and my other wife

944
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,700
my wife's but think about why did I not get penile cancer before? Why did that?

945
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:33,140
Why is it that a baby suck my prong? Why is it that there's a this always

946
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:37,640
bothered me in that foster home for imaginary friends porn that I've talked

947
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:43,480
about so many times? I know the one yeah, they draw blue with two dicks. I

948
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:47,360
think that makes sense. He's imaginary on top of each other. He's imaginary. He

949
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:52,080
can have anything you want. Why? When I was a kid, I thought that the second one

950
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,700
was his balls and he's putting his balls into Frankie,

951
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:59,640
but it wasn't it was his. I've been thinking about this. You've been

952
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,140
thinking about this a lot, but I know I think he actually doesn't have a

953
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:08,580
ball in that in that in that short film, so he really logically he is a

954
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:12,620
ball sack and he has to rise or he's a dick and those are his two balls.

955
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:16,980
Just something I've been thinking of in my so every day. I'll go ahead and

956
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,100
read the next one here. Okay,

957
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,620
why did the prison guard refuse to eat the prisoners cooking? He said it was a

958
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:28,920
confection. Oh okay, this one's actually make sense like you gave it like a

959
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,380
confession, right? I won't need a confession yeah, it doesn't make it.

960
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:37,100
Well, that's not actually that's just kind of a thing that yeah, what this

961
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:40,600
joke should have said is he said it was a confection and what he meant was

962
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,620
confession and he was confused and thought the food

963
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:49,700
he said confection because he had confusion and he meant and he meant

964
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,580
confection yeah. It should say this is the real version of the joke yeah.

965
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:56,220
Let's watch this. Why did the prison guard refuse to eat the prisoners

966
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:01,020
cooking? Well, he misspoke and he said it was a confection, a confection, but

967
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:04,260
he meant confession and the guard thought it was a confession

968
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:09,940
and he had confusion. He thought it was alphabet soup yeah. That's why I

969
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,540
thought it was because the guard because it was a confession and by the way

970
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:18,780
the guards hate confess. They won't eat them. They won't even go near them.

971
00:58:18,780 --> 00:58:21,640
They do not go near that you say confession. They turn around. They walk

972
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,860
the other way all right next one here.

973
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,660
If you have not found the best joke yet, you may want to check these funniest

974
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,980
jail jokes below that are hilarious. They include what a great they include

975
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:38,820
and then right into it. Why did the cookie go to jail because it was cut

976
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:40,420
stealing all the chocolate chips?

977
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:47,100
this is a really good joke to send to somebody in jail. This is yeah. This is

978
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:51,700
funny because I said this one so far. I said this to the warden and then that

979
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:56,300
happened in the photo. I beat you up. You beat the shit out of me. It does make

980
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,040
sense because what are chocolate chips to a cookie? Y'all, money, they're

981
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:03,300
jewelry, jewelry, and what do people steal all the time? I was going to say

982
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:06,460
they're body parts, but a body part that you could have a variable amount of

983
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:11,180
like a finger, but more if there are more people with six or four fingers

984
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:15,480
stand out their jewelry yeah. It's more of a they're adorned on top of a cookie.

985
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,720
They're not really a part of it. So it's like it's like

986
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,600
yeah, it's like so people still do real time right and that's why I went to jail.

987
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:23,960
So it's just the fact a

988
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,800
chip would or a cookie would definitely steal a chocolate. Yeah, all right,

989
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:32,360
what's this next one? Yeah, take this one. What do you call a potato in jail?

990
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,560
A French fry.

991
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:39,080
That's a bit of French fry, a French fry, a bit insensitive

992
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:44,120
electric chair joke. I don't know if I like that one yeah and also it's kind of

993
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,760
stereotyping the French as

994
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:52,660
French fries as for as food fries as food, yeah, which doesn't make any sense.

995
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,840
Doesn't sit well with me and French fries don't sit well with me either. When

996
00:59:55,840 --> 01:00:00,080
I eat them, they give me heartburn yeah, seed oil, the salt, the seed oils and so

997
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:02,240
glad they don't have any seed oil in prison. Oh, well, that's because

998
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,520
everything's put in a hundred percent beef tallow yeah, or maybe it would,

999
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:09,600
maybe it's some other animal, but it's some kind of a tallow. I somebody's

1000
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,240
tallow. I heard that it was it was questing beast from Arthurian legend.

1001
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,460
Oh wow, that's an animal that they keep on that only questing can. Oh, it's not

1002
01:00:18,460 --> 01:00:22,680
beef talent, beast talent. I don't care what kind of talent is as long as the

1003
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:26,640
taxpayers paid for it. Hey, don't forget to bring your towel because by the way

1004
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:30,120
you that's what I would say if I was high as fuck and I wanted to eat again.

1005
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:32,980
This is a word confusion that you're doing, though you're doing a word

1006
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:37,980
confusion, right? And by the way, guys, we are you if you're worried about yes,

1007
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:40,760
we are welfare queens. Essentially, oh yeah, everybody in prison is

1008
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,060
essentially a welfare queen. We're living off your dollar. All right, I got

1009
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:46,300
another lightning round coming up here for us.

1010
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:53,020
Why did the pencil go to jail? Because it was a little sketchy cool. Yeah, hit

1011
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:58,400
that. I will go to jail. It was too tired to tired. You go for being tired.

1012
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,860
That was one of my things. Why did the smell was one of the things I went to

1013
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,300
jail? Look at some of the other ones here on some of the other reasons. Why

1014
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,880
why did the smartphone go to jail? It couldn't control its appetite. Oh, it

1015
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:12,620
ate a woman. What do you call a bear in jail? A gummy bear because of the blow

1016
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:16,020
jobs. What did the scarecrow go to and why did the scarecrow go to jail?

1017
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:19,060
Because it was outstanding in its field, you can go to jail for being too good

1018
01:01:19,060 --> 01:01:23,080
here. Yeah. What do you call a fish in jail? A jail fish? That's a jelly fish,

1019
01:01:23,080 --> 01:01:27,120
a jelly fish. What did the coffee? Why did the coffee go to jail? It got mugged.

1020
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:31,560
You go to jail. It's illegal. It's illegal to be mugged. Yeah. Why did the

1021
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:36,080
Ryan go to jail because it roared too loudly. No, what do you call a snake in

1022
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:40,960
jail? A hysterical prisoner he's funny. Why did the tomato go to jail because it

1023
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,360
was charged with saucery? You can get sauce, sorry, like sorcery, yeah,

1024
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,100
sorcery is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very

1025
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:52,520
that's one okay, well, that's what we would never do. What do you call a dog

1026
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:53,960
in jail? A cell phone

1027
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,100
wait,

1028
01:01:57,100 --> 01:02:02,680
and why did the sun go to jail? It was too hot to handle. You can go to you.

1029
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:06,760
What do you call a dog in jail? A cell phone? What do we think about that? So

1030
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:09,120
let's go so like

1031
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:16,480
because okay wait, it's a dog trying to say bone. I sound

1032
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:22,160
yeah, I sell like a blue

1033
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:29,060
yourself. I sell bone would have made more sense yeah, but what do you call a

1034
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:29,520
dog's

1035
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,780
maybe dog? Do you call a dog stands for something like device of

1036
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:38,140
girl and geolocation? Why would

1037
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:43,180
because the phone has a GPS? Yeah, yeah, okay, that makes sense a device on board.

1038
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:48,260
It has GPS yeah all right, let's go forward here. Yeah jokes about inmates or

1039
01:02:48,260 --> 01:02:52,180
any group of people can be what happens if you click on people. I wonder if that

1040
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,300
hyperlink. There was mostly ads. I clicked on all these. Can be insensitive and

1041
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:59,900
inappropriate, even if not intended to be offensive. Okay, so now we're getting

1042
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:04,040
into dark humor. This is my territory. Therefore, we must be mindful of their

1043
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:08,340
potential impact, even as we share them. Number one, why did the prisoner - this is

1044
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:13,340
this is a dark joke - why did the prisoner break out his harmonica? He

1045
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:21,140
wanted to go get out on a good note. Does it mean go out? Go out on a good note?

1046
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:25,680
so like because if this is the dark, this is the dark humor. Oh, like maybe he

1047
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:30,080
passed away yeah yeah he was killed in a well. I just don't know and there's no

1048
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:35,020
way to tell yeah all right. Why did the inmate refuse to watch the prison

1049
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:38,720
documentary? He didn't want to be a connoisseur of crime

1050
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:44,620
kind of he didn't want to be a connoisseur of crime.

1051
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:49,000
Why did the prisoner get mad when he saw his reflection in the mirror? He was

1052
01:03:49,040 --> 01:03:53,740
having a hard time. Got a boner. Yeah, he was jacking off at the mirror. Here's

1053
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:57,720
another one. Why did the prisoner refuse to take a bath?

1054
01:03:57,720 --> 01:04:00,840
He was afraid of getting soap on a rope.

1055
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,240
He's afraid of... Does that mean... Being tied up

1056
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:08,720
in the soap. He was afraid of getting soap on a rope. Yeah, he didn't want to

1057
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,200
get soap on a rope in prison. He would rather not have soap on a rope. Do they

1058
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:18,240
have it in prison? They have it in prison so you don't drop it. Oh, but he

1059
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:22,540
he wanted to drop it. He also refusing to take a you know, refusing to take a

1060
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:26,580
not a shower. This is about a bath yeah, so it's also not as much of a problem

1061
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,920
when you drop a so we go to a koozie bats in prison that are shaped like

1062
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:34,120
hearts from the Sims. We have whirlpool jacuzzis. They're so powerful that

1063
01:04:34,120 --> 01:04:38,000
people have been getting neck and back injuries from getting a world or yeah,

1064
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,960
and then they come and they massage me yeah. They say let's make this better

1065
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,540
yeah. Yeah, well, I need a massage, but they're saying they need to give a

1066
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,060
massage yeah because it relaxes them yeah

1067
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:53,000
prison is the worst place you can ever dream of lie common misconception, but

1068
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,580
whatever. Therefore, you should always stay out of trouble. These jokes are the

1069
01:04:56,580 --> 01:05:01,560
best for someone. Unfortunately, in jail, why did the prisoner refuse to eat the

1070
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,640
steak in jail?

1071
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:08,600
He was afraid of being grilled by the warden. I was grilled by the warden a few

1072
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:11,500
times, so he's afraid that my food was grilled by the war. Okay, way,

1073
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:17,120
personally making it for me put me on a form. I have he put my he put my foot in

1074
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:21,160
a foreman and said you Michael Scott. Now where there is a there is a call me

1075
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:22,560
Dunder Mifflin for weeks.

1076
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:24,440
This this

1077
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:28,940
it is all makes sense. This joke makes sense. If you think about a simple,

1078
01:05:28,940 --> 01:05:35,160
I think it's from the Bible yeah, you are what you eat right exactly. I was

1079
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,840
going to this makes perfect sense. If he was a stake yeah, so he's saying you are

1080
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,240
that you eat, you eat a steak, you become a steak and then all of a sudden and by

1081
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:46,640
the way to a warden, these guys are hungry. You walk around and you're a you

1082
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:50,980
know five foot eleven steak walking through his halls. He's going to eat

1083
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:55,180
you yeah, he's going to grill you and eat you exactly it's dangerous.

1084
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:59,080
What do you call a bear in jail?

1085
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,480
A prisoner of bear,

1086
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:08,840
because if you're a bear in jail, you're probably in a prison made for and run by

1087
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:13,200
by bears. Oh, this is making some sense to me. This is not recently poses a

1088
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:17,900
world where bears run and are in prisons. Yeah, because why would a human put a

1089
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:23,080
bear in prison? That's just a zoo. Yeah, doesn't make much sense now. Oh, oh,

1090
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:25,280
what do you call a bear in a zoo?

1091
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,320
A zoo bear?

1092
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,160
Wait, no, that wasn't

1093
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:34,960
just guessing. I mean, I guess I maybe wrote a joke. I don't know. That's a

1094
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:37,480
good joke. Thank you, man. All right, what's this? All right, just a couple

1095
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:42,860
left here. Okay. Why do prisoners wear stripes in jail? Fact check. We don't

1096
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:46,580
always. We don't always wear actually against the dress code. Let's try to

1097
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:49,960
check in the middle of jokes. I don't know you guys want fucking sorry about

1098
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:53,920
that. Okay. Why do prisoners wear stripes in jail so they can earn

1099
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,040
their fashion stripes? Well, you already have them according to this. These

1100
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,320
aren't fashion, but again, you can't wait. Maybe we haven't earned our

1101
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:06,240
stripes yet, but there's a lot. The dress code is pretty strict. You can't

1102
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:10,260
have a skirt that's above your finger tip. You can only have a baseball hat if

1103
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:14,300
it's backwards. Yeah, yeah, you can't no big white t shirts, only sunglasses you

1104
01:07:14,300 --> 01:07:18,040
can have if they're cool. You can't sag because apparently that means something

1105
01:07:18,040 --> 01:07:22,220
else. Secretly, we are gay. Yeah, well, that's you can't swag.

1106
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:28,180
You can't swag your pants. You can't sag your pants. Secretly am really. That's

1107
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:33,700
secretly am gay is what sag stands guy in honestly speaking of jail.

1108
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:37,560
these guys are on speaking about a strike. That's what I'm going to say

1109
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:43,100
speaking of guys who are belong in prison, the writers or the the sectors

1110
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:48,460
with a sag to her sectors screen and her's gill really are gay. Oh

1111
01:07:48,460 --> 01:07:54,500
huh all right this next one.

1112
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:59,880
Why do inmates love playing soccer in jail? It's the only way they can score

1113
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:02,640
now that's not true. Yeah, that's not true. I get

1114
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:05,040
yeah next joke, though

1115
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:08,640
yeah next one. So that was actually the last joke, but I

1116
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:10,840
have here a few other things. This is at the bottom of this

1117
01:08:10,840 --> 01:08:13,640
of this list. Okay, so maybe you can read this out. This is

1118
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:15,540
actually pretty interesting. It's more of a fact,

1119
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:17,840
so I'll play a different sound effect after it.

1120
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:22,240
What are some slang words for prison? What is the slang for a

1121
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,040
jail cell? Here are some of the popular ones. So there's three

1122
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:27,140
here number one the big house,

1123
01:08:27,140 --> 01:08:29,540
the joint

1124
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:33,340
and the slammer.

1125
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:39,840
Wow, that's I mean I just call it. I just call it home me too. Yeah, and

1126
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:42,340
then I have one last thing I before I found these jokes. I was looking for

1127
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:45,740
other prison stuff and I was looking for more Q. I was looking at Q and A

1128
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:49,740
like we did for that evil one and here there was only one good Q and A

1129
01:08:49,740 --> 01:08:52,540
question, but I wanted to throw it in just as a bonus at the end because I

1130
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:56,540
did really like it, but there wasn't enough other stuff to for it to make

1131
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:59,500
make sense to do a Q and a one, but here's a question answer someone has

1132
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:00,060
about prison.

1133
01:09:00,060 --> 01:09:06,580
Will my flatulence bother my cell mate and here's the answer yes. If your fart

1134
01:09:06,580 --> 01:09:11,300
stinks, you'll likely get what they call rolled out and that's a bad thing. Go

1135
01:09:11,300 --> 01:09:15,280
sit on the toilet, fart and flush the suction from the water flow should help

1136
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:18,780
with the smell. They want you to flush the fart yeah. I should get rolled out

1137
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:19,300
the fart.

1138
01:09:19,300 --> 01:09:24,940
If it's between flushing my fart and getting rolled the fuck out yeah, I'm

1139
01:09:25,100 --> 01:09:28,340
I just didn't realize that that was prison etiquette, but I guess I will

1140
01:09:28,340 --> 01:09:31,180
start. Yeah, I thought you just had to light a match. We get matches by the

1141
01:09:31,180 --> 01:09:34,660
way. We get matches. We also get those lighters that you use to light candles,

1142
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:39,000
the long neck ones. Yeah, we get those. We get those for our cigarettes. We get

1143
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,440
Zippos too and the good ones. We get the ones that we get the ones, yeah,

1144
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,940
the ones you get in a glass case in the Midwest at a gas station. And guess

1145
01:09:46,940 --> 01:09:50,840
who's paying for them? Joe Biden. Joe Biden, Mitt Romney.

1146
01:09:51,860 --> 01:09:56,740
all through your pockets. So guys, go out and vote. Vote for whoever's going to

1147
01:09:56,740 --> 01:10:01,380
vote for me. Vote for as he's going to be prom king likely to be most

1148
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:04,660
attractive of the prison. Yes, in a couple of years, once I get my act

1149
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:09,220
and they're letting us do our stand up dates, they're letting us, we're going

1150
01:10:09,220 --> 01:10:14,000
to be wheeled out like Hannibal Lecter on all the shows. It's technically a

1151
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,940
conjugal visit. Yeah, but yeah,

1152
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:22,020
tomorrow and through the weekend, I'm going to be in Washington D. C.

1153
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,260
appearing as a hologram

1154
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:29,860
with Mr Adam Friedland and was actually in here to he's actually in here for

1155
01:10:29,860 --> 01:10:31,660
being a gay bug.

1156
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:38,940
And

1157
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:43,380
yeah, so that's the life

1158
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:50,760
And I am going to be also I'm not going to be a hologram. I'm just sending a

1159
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:55,900
guy that looks like me. MF doom style to do that. Yeah, but nobody looks like

1160
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:58,900
me. Yeah, that's the problem. There's a lot of guys look like me.

1161
01:10:58,900 --> 01:11:08,020
I'm going to be in Pittsburgh and in Baltimore opening for girl God on their

1162
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:13,260
tickets are on their website at girl God dot co. I think I don't know. I

1163
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,700
my lord God girl God the website.

1164
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:17,260
Just Google.

1165
01:11:17,260 --> 01:11:18,940
Just Google you fucking idiot.

1166
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:19,740
Just Google you dummy.

1167
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:24,140
And I mean speaking of guy holograms and guys who look like each of us,

1168
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:27,940
my wife does not know that I am in prison, so don't tell her.

1169
01:11:27,940 --> 01:11:28,620
Do not tell her.

1170
01:11:28,620 --> 01:11:33,500
And if you want to help us buy more cigarettes and hopefully some bubble

1171
01:11:33,500 --> 01:11:35,300
tape, go check out the Patreon.

1172
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:37,060
I love bubble tape.

1173
01:11:37,060 --> 01:11:41,020
Well, with the bubble tape, I'm hoping to make a saw out of bubble tape and

1174
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:42,940
saw my way out of this world.

1175
01:11:43,060 --> 01:11:47,020
I have been again bubble tape is something I was addicted to on the

1176
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:50,820
outside and it's been pretty it's been pretty hard on the inside. My guy is

1177
01:11:50,820 --> 01:11:54,860
itching because he keeps trying to put it in the wrong way. He's trying to put

1178
01:11:54,860 --> 01:11:58,500
it in. I can't a bubble bubble tape because I get too excited. He starts

1179
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,020
chewing it with his but he's yeah and then you don't even get to enjoy it.

1180
01:12:02,020 --> 01:12:05,220
Now it's just your butt getting on yeah, my butts getting so much fun in

1181
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,660
prison, my butt over who can get more fun, my butter, my mouth.

1182
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:16,940
Why? Well, why do you care you're not your mouth? I am my mouth you. Oh, if

1183
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:21,700
my face, if my butt gets more fun than my face in a week, I literally try to

1184
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:25,120
kill myself. Yeah, that makes sense or at least chop the bottom off. Yeah, you

1185
01:12:25,120 --> 01:12:28,680
ever see those guys with no. I try to turn into to a Diablo three enemy where

1186
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:32,280
I call that my intestines coming out of the video recently. That was the guy

1187
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:36,280
with no bottom half and he's doing boxing. No, no video of this guy doing

1188
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:39,520
boxing and I was sitting there and I was like this guy is living the dream. No,

1189
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:46,580
No, but never have to worry about walking around with a shoe on.

1190
01:12:46,580 --> 01:12:49,580
He's never had swamp ass. He has swamp bottom.

1191
01:12:49,580 --> 01:12:53,580
That's the only thing I think that is horrible about him.

1192
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:57,580
I bet Daredevil style his body makes up for it and his belly button smells really bad.

1193
01:12:57,580 --> 01:13:02,580
He also doesn't have to worry about pants. It's hard to buy men's pants.

1194
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:04,580
He's just a shirt guy.

1195
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,580
I hate buying pants.

1196
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,580
Me too, but I wonder if he wears lady tighties.

1197
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:12,460
We'll see you guys on Saturday for National Dog Day.

1198
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:18,260
And then next week and then next week and then next week for about 150 years.

1199
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,260
Bye.

1200
01:13:19,260 --> 01:13:20,260
I believe.

1201
01:13:20,260 --> 01:13:26,060
I think somebody's selling drugs outside of my apartment.

1202
01:13:26,060 --> 01:13:27,060
Yeah.

1203
01:13:27,060 --> 01:13:32,580
I saw an old, old man and a young, young man sitting on the bench right outside my apartment.

1204
01:13:32,580 --> 01:13:33,580
There's a bench right up front.

1205
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,580
It could be father and son.

1206
01:13:34,580 --> 01:13:39,580
But a third man of an age in between the two men

1207
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,900
came by and sat down and the young man

1208
01:13:41,900 --> 01:13:44,860
reached into a plastic grocery bag,

1209
01:13:44,860 --> 01:13:47,300
brought something out and slid it very slyly,

1210
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,140
breaking bad into me.

1211
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:49,620
- Was it drugs?

1212
01:13:49,620 --> 01:13:52,460
- I have to assume it was drugs or a rare baseball card.

1213
01:13:52,460 --> 01:13:54,140
- It could be a rare baseball card.

1214
01:13:54,140 --> 01:13:57,260
- And they looked at me and I broke eye contact

1215
01:13:57,260 --> 01:13:58,620
and then I've been scared for two days

1216
01:13:58,620 --> 01:13:59,900
that they're gonna try to kill me.

1217
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:01,700
- No. - Because I know.

1218
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:03,420
- They don't know that you know.

1219
01:14:03,420 --> 01:14:06,620
I mean I was walking around weird, I was acting really weird.

1220
01:14:06,620 --> 01:14:09,420
Yeah you had your, like you had a huge paper and a camera.

1221
01:14:09,420 --> 01:14:12,220
Let me rewind time for you, here's how you should have handled that.

1222
01:14:12,220 --> 01:14:12,720
Okay.

1223
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:17,520
You see him slipping the thing into his bag, you in your brain, you know you've just seen a drug deal.

1224
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:18,020
Yeah.

1225
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,420
Maybe you're gonna get killed for knowing what's going on here.

1226
01:14:20,420 --> 01:14:21,220
Here's what you say.

1227
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:22,120
They're evil.

1228
01:14:22,120 --> 01:14:24,620
You look at these guys on the bench, here's what you say.

1229
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:27,020
"Geez, you guys are always sitting here doing completely nothing.

1230
01:14:27,020 --> 01:14:29,720
Why don't you find a hobby? You're not even doing anything, you're just sitting there."

1231
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,520
Get a job you lazy bones!

1232
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:34,920
You haven't even moved in the past 10 minutes.

1233
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:36,720
You've been sitting completely still there doing nothing.

1234
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,320
You've been sitting here for hours talking to your friends, giving them gifts.

1235
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,720
Stop loitering. No, not giving--

1236
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:41,520
No, no, no, no.

1237
01:14:41,520 --> 01:14:42,720
Sir, doing nothing.

1238
01:14:42,720 --> 01:14:43,620
That's what I'm saying.

1239
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,220
Doing completely nothing.

1240
01:14:45,220 --> 01:14:49,520
Yeah, you should say, "Why don't you take up a hobby like drug dealing or something?"

1241
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:53,320
I wish you guys would sell fucking drugs, because at least I could buy some.

1242
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:55,820
Yeah, they know that you don't know that they're doing anything.

1243
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:01,320
That's how you repair the thing, is like, "If you're selling drugs, I would like some."

1244
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:05,000
Right. I think you're not dealing drugs, so you shouldn't kill me.

1245
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:08,120
But if you were, it would be okay with me.

1246
01:15:08,120 --> 01:15:09,240
That's what I was wondering.

1247
01:15:09,240 --> 01:15:11,960
Is it better if they think that I'm a police officer

1248
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:15,240
because I kind of have a police officer's head and build?

1249
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:18,520
Or is it better if they think that I'm just a just a-

1250
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,560
A wasteoid?

1251
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:21,000
Yeah, because who are they least-

1252
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:22,360
Who are they less likely to kill?

1253
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:23,720
Probably a cop.

1254
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:27,080
