1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
Batman voice

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,640
Gotham

3
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:16,820
keep in when he says Batman voice to

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:24,520
that's incredible. That is great. It is a sick city,

5
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:35,120
Gotham, at least those cities faced justice. I pick at the scab and make the

6
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:42,500
think bleed more and more. This place, the people here, they need something to

7
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:48,720
believe in. I frighten them, the weak and the strong, the innocent and the guilty.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,720
Excuse me.

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:53,720
That was a train passing by, just saying that.

10
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,720
The trains in Gotham belch by me while I talk.

11
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,720
(laughter)

12
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,720
I can't believe how loud that was. I didn't think that would get picked up.

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
I don't know if it's...

14
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
Maybe there's no hope for Gotham.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,720
Last night I threw three of the most dangerous criminals behind bars.

16
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Mr. Wonderful, a powerful technologist, I assume.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:25,720
He uses invisible tech, I think, to cast spells against the innocent.

18
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:28,720
He's tough, but I was tougher.

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,720
All this tech uses voice commands, so I silenced him, bound and gagged, and sent him to the slammer.

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,720
Then there's the cook, a chef.

21
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,720
As dangerous as his meals are delicious.

22
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:49,480
I give him a taste of his own medicine or his own dinner

23
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:59,380
okay

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,840
bound him gagged him and threw him directly into the prison.

25
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,320
Finally the rambler a

26
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:15,460
Man who can torture the most mentally disciplined to a psychotic state of rage through ceaseless rambling

27
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:20,820
The only way to stop him bound him gagged him through him into the prison

28
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:24,240
What prison do you ask?

29
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,120
Arkham

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,520
Hold on

31
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,480
Arkham Asylum, I know it's really insane

32
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,280
fine, but for the weird and freaky prisons are asylums.

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:42,840
He's very reactionary that way.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,160
Archimedes and change.

35
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,880
What if you took Gotham's most vile hearts and minds and force

36
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,960
them to spend every waking moment together?

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:53,160
Now, what if you cover them in whipped cream and candy?

38
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,080
And what if you put that in a bowl of vanilla ice cream and

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,520
a scoop of pistachio and coffee and then a fried banana?

40
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:01,800
Now you add some sprinkles, rainbow color and a bit of caramel.

41
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,840
now, then you have an ice cream sundae. Arkham, though, is a tough place, not

42
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,320
like an ice cream sunday.

43
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,760
You're starting to sound like the cook right now.

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,360
Sunway

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:21,960
criminals constantly try to break out, but Arkham it's not easy to break out

46
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,920
of not since the recent updates. It's old Victorian architecture now flanked

47
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,880
by modern additions to turn it into a fortress of doom that keeps prisoners in

48
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,220
and rather than soldiers out with the fuck

49
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:37,520
man damn okay,

50
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,520
it's gotten be the

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,020
size of a small neighborhood

52
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:45,920
with the amount of psychos. I throw in there

53
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,400
and the size of the psychos. They get bigger and bigger because of advances in

54
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,120
nutrition.

55
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,220
Truly some of your best

56
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,720
just

57
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
just right. I saw the toilet. Because of advancements in nutrition,

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:10,560
that was your big line. That's an implication about the cook or no,

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,240
it's just nothing. It's just I was finding words. Okay, let me just I'm

60
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:20,360
almost I'm proud of some of us done. Okay, three one hundred foot high stone

61
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:25,760
walls surround the place. Titanium doors on each wall require facial and genital

62
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,320
scanning to enter and exit deadly dogs patrol the ground snapping at anything

63
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,260
it smells of super villain

64
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:39,660
yeah and patches asked me to add a sound effect to the soundboard called angry

65
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:42,800
dog. That is twenty two seconds long, so we're going to sit here while it plays

66
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,180
out

67
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:48,600
hold on

68
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,300
wait

69
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:58,840
it's done now. Okay, just finish okay with robot snipers that line the wall. So

70
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,080
We don't have a I don't think we have a sound. Okay, I'll take that and wait and

71
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,400
and yeah, what else?

72
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,600
I am a robot sniper.

73
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,900
That's one of the robots snipers. Oh shit. Oh God, I feel naked. Oh

74
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:22,300
say that say that the robots snipers name is Darren. His name is Darren the

75
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,000
robot sniper

76
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,420
And the recent removal of spoons means no digging holes to get out.

77
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:33,540
Guys like Drill Face, whose face has a drill on it, he's gagged.

78
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:36,900
And guys like Drill Hands, who has drills on his hands, he's bound.

79
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,380
So he can't get out either.

80
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:46,860
The only way someone could get out would be, well, I don't want to say it or

81
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,660
think of it, if I do, someone might figure it out, because that's how it

82
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,340
works.

83
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,980
People can hear my thoughts.

84
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,580
hmm. I doubt anyone could pull it off. Interesting, there's definitely no way

85
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,500
someone could break out of Arkham Asylum.

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,100
Yeah, I'm done being Batman. All right, cool. How naked do you feel with that?

87
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:12,140
Who man you're a real voice? You wish you sound like your real voice on right

88
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,660
now. It's

89
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,380
yeah. I mean usually usually I just yeah, your real voice

90
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:25,740
Yeah, no, usually I'm like I'm always mistaken for like a kid, but like when I

91
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,180
when I was Batman, that was I felt fucking incredible. Yeah, yeah, you guys

92
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,140
ever okay, good.

93
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:39,240
So yeah, you guys are the these three of Batman's most violent villains, his

94
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,900
greatest foes, his ever faced. Most famous ones too that he would have

95
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,460
yes, so many times. The rogues gallery, yeah. So I imagine, you know, you know,

96
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,320
all three of you are in Arkham Asylum, you're probably imprisoned in different

97
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,280
ways to be quote unquote rehabilitated. We all know Hugo strange isn't really

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,160
about that kind of life, though, right? He is not no he's not and he is about

99
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,720
revenge. So so why don't we get get a sense of where you are in the prison,

100
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,120
who you are? Let's start with Mr. Wonderful. We'll start with the chef,

101
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,960
because Mr. Wonderful point at the cook, the cook, the cook, sorry, who is a

102
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,840
chef, the cook, who is a

103
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,280
so basically title that's what is a chef. Basically, I started out as

104
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:27,200
a cook and then I became a chef. Right. And shortly thereafter a super villain who

105
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,320
was bent on destroying Gotham. Okay. How did I do that? I was doing, I was

106
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,480
poisoning meals that were going to the mayor's office because I had a lot of

107
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:42,200
catering jobs. Wow. I would, I had my, my knives were extremely sharp and I would

108
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,520
use those to kill people and murder. I was a serial killer. Okay, I was a, okay,

109
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,000
I got it. I was a serial killer. He's got it. And then I would make my victims in

110
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,300
into food. That's right. That hasn't happened. So that's cool. Well, I may I

111
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,180
may use to do that. I used to make them it, but I did, but it wasn't ever like I

112
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,900
made them into food that somebody would want to eat. And I did like I tried to

113
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:07,100
trick people into it. It was always like I just had an arm, a barbecue or maybe a

114
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,940
foot. I was picked the least appetizing parts of the body. As far as where I am

115
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,700
in the prison, I think I'm in the kitchen. You're in the kitchen working in

116
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,060
the kitchen. I think I have kitchen duty today. Yes, I think so. And boy, am I

117
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:22,020
happy about it. You're chopping it up with the other prisoners. Chopping it up. Yeah.

118
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:25,420
So, hopefully not chopping them up. Yeah, like a fricking onion. Well, hopefully I am

119
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:30,540
for me. For you, but for them, you don't want that. No. No, and your abilities, so we have

120
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:34,620
your, we're our friend character sheets here, and your abilities, you have chef knife, so

121
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:39,580
that is a range attack. Your cleaver is your melee attack. Right now you don't have this

122
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:43,620
because you're in prison right now. They've de-knifed you. But I used to have these. You

123
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,140
did used to have these and so you might have them again. And then finally you have gumbo.

124
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,060
Gumbo is your ability to, we're going to roll a d20 whenever you want to use gumbo and you'll

125
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:59,360
take a point off your ingredients list and you'll have to gather ingredients to cook

126
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,060
up more gumbo. Gumbo has a random effect.

127
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,060
I thought you said gunbo.

128
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,260
I have a table of 20 effects for you.

129
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,260
Gunbo would be good.

130
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Gunbo.

131
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,260
Yeah.

132
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:08,260
Well, but I don't use it.

133
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,000
Can we add a gunbo thing where he makes a meal out of bullets?

134
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't want that.

135
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
Yeah, he doesn't want that, so I can't do that. That's how it works.

136
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:20,100
Yeah, and so yeah, you're in prison. Batman found you chopping up some

137
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,600
local teens. Yeah, a bunch of kids. A bunch of stupid kids. Chopping them up.

138
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,700
And he was like, "Stop that." And you were like, "No." And then he bound

139
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,800
you, he gagged you, and he threw you right into prison or Arkham Asylum.

140
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,800
And now, who else do we have here? And you guys are all... You guys know

141
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,200
each other, by the way, right? From previously trying to fight. No. From

142
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,600
high school. No, we've never met each other. From high school. These two know

143
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,960
each other from high school. No, no. Oh, okay. You're going to this. My girl.

144
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:50,400
Okay. Okay. You heard of our go ahead. Our secret identities are no each other

145
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:55,360
from the neighborhood. And we also went to high school together. Okay. My guy

146
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,840
did not go to high school. We all live in the Arkham projects. Okay, that's

147
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:03,320
right. We're poor. Yeah. Now, now who feels bad? Probably Batman. Yeah. No,

148
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:08,200
probably Mr. Wonderful. Okay. Talk to me. I don't know what voice to do.

149
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,180
My name is Mr. Wonderful. How's that? You knew exactly what voice.

150
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,200
No, I was thinking maybe doing a high pitch one. You knew exactly what voice to do.

151
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,040
No, because I was thinking of also my original idea was like, Mr. Wonderful.

152
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,760
I don't know. Either one of those is going to work. My name is Mr. Wonderful.

153
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,620
I think I'm going to go for it. You sound like a brownie. I grew up in a

154
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,040
small hamlet in...

155
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:35,460
A brownie. I grew up in a small... A brownie. I grew up in a small hamlet

156
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,320
just outside the castle walls when my village was ransacked by orcs and my

157
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,900
my parents were slain. My brothers and sisters were sold into slavery in a

158
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:49,240
faraway land. I became a questing adventurer. I posted up at the local

159
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,500
tavern to search for quests. I that's right. I slay I slew goblins. I slew

160
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,800
dragons. I slew zombies until I gathered enough gold pieces to finally take an

161
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,660
airplane to Gotham City, where I became a villain and I'm a wizard wizard and

162
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:07,500
my brother is the other Mr. Wonderful.

163
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,880
With Kevin O'Leary? Yeah. My name is Mr. Wonderful, one relation. My name's

164
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,140
Devin O'Leary. Oh, my God. So, he's also Irish. We took on different life

165
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,080
paths. That's true. I think Kevin O'Leary is Jewish. Is he really? With

166
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,700
everything else about him? Was it because of money? I think he's Canadian.

167
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,580
Actually. He's Canadian. Yeah, he's Canadian. Oh, he's Canadian. I'm also,

168
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,700
I'm from the Kingdom of Canadia. Yeah, right.

169
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,900
And yeah, so you have like, you're sort of this like,

170
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,580
I mean, Batman thinks you're a technologist of some kind.

171
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,420
- Yeah, he's stupid.

172
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,240
- He's really dumb.

173
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
- I'm a wizard.

174
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,700
- Well, Batman's one weakness is magic.

175
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,820
So I think Cameron was actually the smartest one.

176
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:45,660
- Is that true?

177
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,480
- Yeah.

178
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,320
- His one weakness.

179
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,160
- Holy fuck.

180
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,660
- The one thing that Batman is not good against is magic.

181
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,940
- If you do this, he just like, pan.

182
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,020
- Whoa, what are you doing?

183
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,220
(laughing)

184
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,900
- That's why he's not good against Ra's al Ghul.

185
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,580
- Oh yeah, I forgot about that.

186
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,980
- 'Cause Ra's al Ghul has magic.

187
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,460
- Yeah, he can bring himself back to life.

188
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,280
- Yeah.

189
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,280
found a youth.

190
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,280
Found a poop.

191
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:08,280
I hate Rachel Gould.

192
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,280
All of us,

193
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,280
the three of us, even though we don't know each other,

194
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,280
we kind of gravitort

195
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,280
towards each other because

196
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
we're the type of villains where we're like, "Fuck all these

197
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
other villains. These other villains are real."

198
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
We're the three guys who know what's up.

199
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Two-Face, the Riddler,

200
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,280
and Penguin, they all like,

201
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,280
they're boys and then we're like,

202
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
We're like, "We'll show them."

203
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,000
They've been fumbling the bag over and over and over again.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,280
You guys don't know what you're doing.

205
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,320
You guys took a crack at it.

206
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,040
You did pretty well for the first go.

207
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,240
You're in the asylum.

208
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:49,000
They have a good grasp on the underbelly of the city, but we got the overbelly.

209
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,880
The overbelly is all ours.

210
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,440
We've got the overbelly.

211
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,520
And the mid-belly as well.

212
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,680
Really, it's total white space for you guys.

213
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,200
It's totally untapped.

214
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,840
People haven't tried with the overbelly.

215
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,240
They got the criminal underbelly.

216
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,440
that we have the criminal. Nobody's tried with the overbelly. Nobody's tried.

217
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,240
Nobody's even tried. Nobody's tried Walgreens. No. That's what we do.

218
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,040
That's what, that we go into Rite Aid and we are doing basically kind of...

219
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
It's all Rite Aid, Walgreens, Duane Reade, CBS. We're doing, we're basically,

220
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,000
we call ourselves the Boonk Gang and we're doing... We're Wizers in Adderall

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,640
short. We, exactly. We're stealing the show out of Adderall. Exactly. Yeah.

222
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,440
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And your, your abilities, what, what powers or, or, or

223
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,520
rather, what are your super villain powers? It looks like my super villain

224
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,620
powers include agonizers, scorcher,

225
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:35,320
protection from evil and good fairy fire and

226
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:39,620
mage hand. Okay, among others,

227
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,120
he's got a lot of powers. So right now, yeah, you are, you are in your, you're

228
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,020
in the kitchen, you're, you're, you're having a good time. I'm in the study,

229
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,120
you're in the study, you're in the

230
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:55,220
reading scrolls. I'm in the hot tub. You're your scrolls, Mr. Wonderful.

231
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:57,220
- Yeah. - You ordered a Scrolls Special.

232
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,860
- Yeah. - Thank you.

233
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:03,340
- And you, that was a good scene, who are you?

234
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,860
- Man, I don't even know where to start and where to begin.

235
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,180
Man, I fuckin', just got fuckin' bangin' in here, man.

236
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,100
I don't even wanna get bangin' in here.

237
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,020
Look, look, all right,

238
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,860
so you get me into "Arkham Asylum," right?

239
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,700
- Right, yeah.

240
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,700
- Before this, I was just hangin' out.

241
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,660
I was hangin' out with Michael, I was hangin' out with Phil,

242
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:28,300
hanging out with Tony, you know, we were just fucking just going around, going around town,

243
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:36,260
going around Gotham. And what do we see on the side of the road? What? Little guy selling

244
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:42,660
oranges. And we're like, what the hell? What the hell kind of guy? What the fuck? This

245
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,740
wasn't the first time you saw a little guy selling oranges, right? I saw a little guy

246
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,460
on the side of the highway selling oranges. I said, what the hell are you doing on the

247
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:56,780
side of the highway zone. And I'm like, all right, he needs to get in my car. He

248
00:14:56,780 --> 00:15:00,500
needs to get the hell in my car right now. So I pick him up, I get out of the car,

249
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,780
pick him up, put him in the bed of the truck. I fucking take the car, we drive

250
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:10,180
back down to the overbelly of Gotham. We're going around. What's going on here?

251
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,280
Just keep talking. This doesn't concern you at all. Well, no, because I get

252
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,860
distra- there's stuff that in my life, if I see it, then I got to make note of it

253
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:21,020
and I gotta look at it and I gotta start talking about it

254
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,020
because you know what that reminds me of right there?

255
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,660
The guy next to you in another cell next to you, "Oh my god, shut the fuck up!"

256
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:30,860
That reminds me of right there is what the guy was doing with the oranges earlier.

257
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,740
No!

258
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,980
He was selling, he was giving the oranges, no, wait, no.

259
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,580
Was he selling them or was he not?

260
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,020
The rambler rambles on and on and on ad nauseum,

261
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,580
causing pain and misery to anyone who can hear him.

262
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,460
You have a few powers.

263
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,100
You have to decipher what the hell, like the Riddler,

264
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,300
you have to decipher what the hell his original point was. Yeah,

265
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,500
he has babble blast where he unleashes a rapid fire stream of words at a target

266
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,000
target has to make a DC wisdom save real take psychic damage. It's got verbal

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,300
distraction where the rambler engages anyone in an extended conversation

268
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,000
distracting them from other matters and they will be incapacitated if they keep

269
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
talking with him that they fail the wisdom DC. I mean he has endless

270
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,660
rambling where he can make any creature within 30 feet of him

271
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,660
but get confused and distracted and have been disadvantaged on

272
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,500
attack roles. So he's sort of this kind of like just torture

273
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,060
par excellence, but he doesn't ideas. Does the Rambler know

274
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,860
that I was going to call him the Punisher, but there's already a

275
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,160
hero pretty good name. The Punisher right? Is he a hero?

276
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,160
It seems like it switches. Well, it's a second. He's an officer

277
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,460
of the law. He is a hero. The Rambler was put in a cell as far

278
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:46,280
far away from everyone else as possible, but I have, but here's the thing they

279
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,800
forgot. There is a phone in my

280
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,420
why would they do that? Why would they give you a phone? It was an accident. It

281
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,540
was an accident. It was a complete over. Where does the phone go to the phone

282
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,140
connects to the loudspeaker?

283
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:04,180
You did the morning and out. Yeah, my job is morning announcements. Nobody

284
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:04,380
knows

285
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:10,940
basically what you get. Arkham should operate exactly like a middle school.

286
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,420
Yeah, that's declassified.

287
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:12,920
Yeah.

288
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,420
Yeah.

289
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,420
And what happened this morning?

290
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
The bell rings, actually.

291
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Now that you say the bell rings.

292
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,420
Uh-huh.

293
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,780
And you guys all go out for prison yard hangout time.

294
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,780
Okay.

295
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,780
So yeah.

296
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,780
So you guys go out.

297
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:25,740
Man, last time I was out in here, I fucking saw a guy like eat a scorpion off the floor.

298
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,300
It's like a guy eat scorpion off the floor.

299
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,300
I'm going to forage for ingredients.

300
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
Okay, cool.

301
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Go for it.

302
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,300
So just roll.

303
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I wasn't even trying to like a chocolate scorpion or any of these kind of.

304
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,460
Just roll brain for that.

305
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Roll brain for that?

306
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
Yeah.

307
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,460
And then just add your brain bonus.

308
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Eighteen.

309
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,460
Nice.

310
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:57,460

No, I just got I eat scorpions all the

317
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,960
sound effect right now is me walking in circles.

318
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,580
What the hell you don't yell at me like that, because you know I got I got

319
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,600
I'm going to shut the fuck up or I'm going to make you shut the fuck up.

320
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,600
You can't yell at me right now because you know I've got bad ears.

321
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,600
I've got bad ears because I was going at a bunch of concerts.

322
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
I was at a lot of concerts in my...

323
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,600
You versus Thug.

324
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Roll for initiative.

325
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,600
By the way, you asked what I was doing and I'm levitating.

326
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
How tall are the walls? 100 feet?

327
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm levitating but I can only levitate 99 feet so I can't escape

328
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,600
and they don't get me in trouble for it.

329
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
God damn it again.

330
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
What did you get?

331
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
I got a 19.

332
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,960
Yeah, you get to attack first.

333
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Don't forget we have a beautiful dice camera.

334
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,960
I forgot about the dice camera.

335
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,960
Oh yeah.

336
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,320
You have a regular attack too.

337
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,320
You'll see them.

338
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,400
You have a range attack and a regular attack.

339
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,760
Right now you just have the regular attack.

340
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Okay.

341
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
So what do you want that to be?

342
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:09,920
What does the Rambler use when he attacks somebody just regularly without his talk?

343
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,320
He's just speaking but like...

344
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Karate chopping.

345
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Yeah, it's karate chopping.

346
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
He just uses karate.

347
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah.

348
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
What the hell are you doing coming at me like that?

349
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Maybe you get the fuck out of here.

350
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
I'm fucking...

351
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
You don't know what the fuck I know.

352
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,320
You don't know what the fuck I've learned.

353
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Oh, I'm sorry.

354
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,320
I'm sorry.

356
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,460
I know you don't know the fuck I've learned. Oh my God.

357
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,860
All right, roll attack roll.

358
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:29,120
You look stunning in the shysty.

359
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,960
13.

360
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,540
13? Okay, that does hit this guy.

361
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,440
Oh wait, 13.

362
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,280
Plus two.

363
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,120
Plus two, right?

364
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,200
Yeah, that hits. That hits.

365
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,040
Either way.

366
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,860
Yeah.

367
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,120
Yeah, so now roll for damage.

368
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:38,960
What did it say?

369
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,800
It's the--

370
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,960
One D6 plus two.

371
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,800
Yeah, do it.

372
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,880
That was a four.

373
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,880
Nice, yeah, okay.

374
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,560
So you just like karate chopped this guy up

375
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,120
and everyone is so upset.

376
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,760
They really want the Rambler

377
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,880
to get the shit kicked out of him,

378
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,200
but it just has not happened yet.

379
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,160
- Yeah, Vulcan nerf pinch.

380
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,000
That's what the fuck I'm doing right now.

381
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,080
That's the fuck I'm trying.

382
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,080
You remember that movie, "Graphic Con"?

383
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,560
- All right, and this guy's-- - Ricardo Montalban.

384
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,880
- This guy's gonna try to attack you back.

385
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,480
He does not clear your AC.

386
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,760
He's just swinging at you, and you're just like--

387
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,600
- What the hell, what the hell?

388
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,360
You get any kind of punches or things?

389
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,480
He's the worst kind of punch in the world.

390
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,160
- Yeah, do you guys, you guys should just roll initiative

391
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,440
just 'cause you're in the turn order.

392
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,760
- All right, I'm gonna use the dice game.

393
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,600
- You don't have to do anything, though.

394
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
- Yeah, I ain't doing nothing.

395
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,060
you got a twelve and then you rolled it into an eight. That didn't work either.

396
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,360
Okay, mine was a four plus one, which is five. Cool. All right. Yeah. I mean,

397
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,200
so either way, yeah, let's just, we'll just like,

398
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,760
and then we'll just reincorporate you into the main turn order.

399
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,520
Is there anything you want to do? He doesn't want to do anything. You know,

400
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:40,960
I don't want to help him at all. I don't want to even work with him. Cool.

401
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,320
All right. You're going to die as soon as possible in this campaign.

402
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:47,120
You're up. I have the second worst character and mine is the chef.

403
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,640
You're up for it. I feel good. I'm the best. You're the best. Yeah.

404
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:57,720
you

405
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:01,880
about it. We were making all the moves and stuff. We talked about this for a while. We

406
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,880
did text about this actually, yes. We texted about it. I did think it was a good character

407
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:11,280
idea. I just, I wasn't thinking though guys, I'm sorry. I mean it is a good idea. It's

408
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,480
just that like, how he, no, the execution is really wrong. What do you mean about the

409
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:22,360
execution? The execution is what's going to happen to this guy once I'm done with it.

410
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:29,360
roll a DC Constitution saving throw. Sorry, everyone roll a DC heart. Roll a heart. Roll

411
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:36,680
20 die and add heart. I got a 12. I'm going to try to do a successful dice cam roll. Somehow

412
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,800
you're first time listening to this. We have fun character sheets where we call things

413
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:48,800
different things. I'm sorry. I got a 7. Wow. What did you get, Rambler? I got a 12. Did

414
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,860
did you add any heart? Yes, I did that is adding the ten plus to nine nine,

415
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,580
four, seven, seven, nine, seven, twelve, okay,

416
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,420
so suddenly

417
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:05,120
actually this is pretty funny you're hovering like by the wall and I just

418
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,600
like the wall just

419
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,100
open in front of you and you go spiraling downward, you're going to

420
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,560

421
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:20,160

00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,840
All right,

437
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:33,560
this is your fault patches yeah, just wait till we get to some of the other

438
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,120
effects

439
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:41,080
pretty long. Yeah, it is long. It is long

440
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,040
okay

441
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,800
continue. So you guys get all get scooped up by this giant robot, okay,

442
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,400
and

443
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:57,120
and it puts you like inside. It's like sternum whoa and you enter into these

444
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,880
like into like these kind of little pods

445
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:06,320
inside of it. Well, on we're in a little pod right now. That's right, but cast no

446
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,680
doubt, no is out

447
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,180
cool

448
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,800
and you reappear in these pods. They're gently kind of jostling you around as

449
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:23,600
you hear the mayhem outside mayhem, the mayhem outside mayhem, the mayhem. Oh

450
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,780
yeah, okay, sorry I was I was watching Julio watched Rex play a video game.

451
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:31,640
I'm going to go ahead and play the mayhem sound effect

452
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,580
and can you may really love you about it. I'm going to lower the volume a

453
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,360
little bit, but let's just listen to the whole duration of this okay.

454
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,360
it.

455
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:47,560
Another one for patches. Yeah, I think they're all for patches. Yeah, I think we're almost

456
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:53,880
ten percent. No, not quite. So hold on. No, no, wait, play it out. Wait till it plays

457
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:57,360
out. You know, I wrote a lot for this campaign. We don't have we're about an eighth of the

458
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,320
way through the sound effect. I killed time with this. I wanted this to be background

459
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,680
background noise. This one is over two minutes long.

460
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:09,320
I thought background noise to create a background noise, background noise

461
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:16,760
go go okay, okay, as it turns into a muffled din the bay him outside of that

462
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,120
yeah

463
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:20,760
and that now it's over though. So now it's so

464
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:25,840
it's over. Oh, it's done so yeah to hit that one

465
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:32,480
dog park again. The crowd gets the dog,

466
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,480
the dogs, the dogs, scare the crowd

467
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,680
sort of the vision to have for this.

468
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,060
So

469
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:48,580
yeah and a half hour or so passes and then you and you hear robotic shifts and

470
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:52,480
feel your stomach drop as you've been sort of jostled around inside this giant

471
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,340
robot and a spiraling metallic door that sat outside of each of your pods

472
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:03,100
opens like a camera lens and spills you out into a dark room. There's a long

473
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,500
wooden table and a monitor about the size of a small theater screen sitting

474
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,100
at the end of it. The room is otherwise seemingly featureless. You'd swear it

475
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,660
was the bat cave at first glance, but before you get to take it in

476
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,260
the screen turns on

477
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:22,540
no and you see it can't be so it can't be. I say that before the screen turns

478
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:24,900
on. You see a silhouetted face

479
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,300
Hey man how you doing?

480
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,300
Oh no.

481
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,300
Yeah what's up how you doing?

482
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Please don't.

483
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Please don't.

484
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,300
Just hold on one second.

485
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,300
Who are you talking to me or them?

486
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,300
Yes.

487
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Yes?

488
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Yes you.

489
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,300
Yes me?

490
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,780
Alright shit fuck I thought that we were just making conversation man I didn't think you

491
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,780
were going to get all weird about this fucking shit.

492
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,780
Yeah.

493
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:46,780
What?

494
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,780
Um.

495
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,780
It's good to see all of you.

496
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:49,780
I broke you out of Arkham.

497
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,780
My name.

498
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,780
Hold on.

499
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,780
I broke you out of Arkham.

500
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:53,780
I broke you out of Arkham.

501
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:54,780
I broke you out of Arkham.

502
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:55,780
I broke you out of Arkham.

503
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,780
I broke you out of Arkham.

504
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
I broke you out of Arkham.

505
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,780
I'm not a fly, let go.

506
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,780
But it's a good name.

507
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,780
I'm not.

508
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,780
No.

509
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,780

Different.

511
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,780
Different.

512
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Different from Batman.

513
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,780
No.

514
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,780
You can't laugh at my name, okay?

515
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,780
Can't laugh at my name, okay?

516
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,780
You promise not to laugh.

517
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,780
Seriously, you promise not to laugh.

518
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,780

You have a plan.

I have a plan for you.

541
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,820
The fucking credit score has gone down.

542
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,260
Well, just shut the fuck up.

00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:54,920

You're just a robot?

548
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,540
You're the only one who hasn't said yes.

549
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,940
Do you want to kill Batman

550
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,100
or do you want to put a down payment on your house?

551
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,100
Man, I don't know.

552
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,640
It's every single which way about this fucking stuff.

553
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,500
It's all kind of new kind of things and thoughts and ideas

554
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,740
that I got to have about this.

555
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,880
I've got one thought.

556
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,880
I have one idea for you, shut the fuck up.

557
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,880
Shut the fuck up.

558
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,880
Can you just lower him? You have to, you have to.

559
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Okay.

560
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,880
So here's how you're gonna kill the bat.

561
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,880
First, you three will infiltrate the mayor's mansion.

562
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,880
He's having a dinner this evening.

563
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,880
Mayor Peach, the mayor of Gotham.

564
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,880
Mr. Wonderful, you will use your magic powers to make the security detail disappear.

565
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,880
Sure, that's a good start.

566
00:29:50,880 --> 00:30:00,880
The cook, you will infiltrate the kitchen and cook up a deadly meal as you have in the past.

567
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,880
Oh my god, that sounds amazing.

568
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:03,880
Yeah.

569
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:04,880
Okay, fuck.

570
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:11,880
And you will kill everyone except the mayor, that's important.

571
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,880
Why?

572
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,880
I'm sorry

573
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,880
It's a little bit

574
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,880
Yeah

575
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,880
Yeah

576
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,880
(deep breath)

577
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
(deep breath)

578
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,880
(deep breath)

579
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,880
(deep breath)

580
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,880
(deep breath)

581
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,880
(deep breath)

582
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,880
(deep breath)

583
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
(deep breath)

584
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,880
(deep breath)

585
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:46,880
dead except for you and the mayor. You will use your rambling powers to torture the mayor

586
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:53,880
until he reveals the code and the location to the emergency bat signal in the manor.

587
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,880
Once you've obtained it, you will press it on my mark. Understood?

588
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,880
I remember Mark. Mark was like a 5'2" little guy.

589
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,360
guy. Why don't we just build our own bat signal? My brother, big salsa type of

590
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,920
stuff he baked stuff makes and bakes he makes things that makes things he bakes

591
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:19,280
stuff. He makes baking things. This is done the cook and Mr. Wonderful head to

592
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:23,960
the zoo via goth. Wait, do you mean me or my brother? You okay, the guy in the

593
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,000
room who can hear me

594
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
And which cook?

595
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,400
There's a lot of cooks.

596
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
The cook.

597
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Oh.

598
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,000
Hey man, the size of this robot, you can be a short order cook.

599
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I'll tell you that for free.

600
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That doesn't make sense.

601
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
What?

602
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
Come on now.

603
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Come on now, we're just having fun.

604
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
Okay, so the cook and Mr. Wonderful will leave.

605
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Leave the manor and you'll head to the zoo via Gotham City Rails where you shall meet

606
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
with my associate disguised as one of the zoo animals, currently captive and performing

607
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,000
reconnaissance.

608
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
He will give you the location of the animal.

609
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,000
You will be given a brief description of the animal and a brief description of the location

610
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
of the animal.

611
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You will be given a brief description of the animal and a brief description of the animal.

612
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
You will be given a brief description of the animal.

613
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,040
where you shall meet with my associate disguised as one of the zoo animals

614
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,440
currently captive in the form of reconnaissance.

615
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,280
He will give you the location of the all animal release button

616
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,280
and the cook will remain at the zoo and press it on.

617
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,880
And I'll cook all the animals.

618
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,540
You can also do that if you want.

619
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:14,340
Oh, well, it's your oyster or in this case, the oyster is your world.

620
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:17,740
It's a zoo with oysters in it.

621
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
is

622
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:21,080
is not

623
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,320
but there is

624
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,960
that's the biggest

625
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:34,440
okay, that's that's the bad part about the Gotham Zoo is that it's right next

626
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:34,940
to Arkham,

627
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:40,620
can't get funding all the all the lions in the zoo died. So they just put

628
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,480
oysters in there. They're like we don't know what to do. I was in closure. You

629
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,680
you can go in and shuck of yourself, but there's one lion that's still alive.

630
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,420
Once the zoo has been secured, Mr. Wonderful, wait, you mean me? You

631
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,540
yes,

632
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,440
you shall head

633
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,240
to the parents day parade.

634
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,320
As you all know,

635
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,200
every time this time of the

636
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:11,440
around this time of year, every year in Gotham, which is what month we've been

637
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:15,040
prison. I don't take keep tallies on the on the wall. Not a freak. You don't

638
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,960
listen to my morning announcements man. I fucking tell them every single day.

639
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,480
It's May.

640
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:21,680
It's gonna be May.

641
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:28,440
Oh hell no man. Get your ass over here man. I gotta give you a dollar for

642
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:28,960
that.

643
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:35,120
Oh yeah.

644
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,080
Who's Bruce Wayne? He's Batman.

645
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,080
I figured that out long ago.

646
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,080
I don't know, you don't know that.

647
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:45,080
I figured that out.

648
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:47,080
That's a crazy accusation.

649
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,080
That can't be true.

650
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,080
Nah, I just kept talking to him one night.

651
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,080
You know, you had one of those conversations

652
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,080
that you have when you're sitting on those two plastic chairs on your back.

653
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,080
Okay, don't worry. It's different.

654
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
It's way different.

655
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,080
Mr. Wonderful, once the scene has been secured

656
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,080
you shall head to the parade.

657
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,080
There you will stand upon the highest float

658
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,080
and cast the most glorious spell

659
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:14,080
the jungle of Seshwana. Only you will have the skills to cast it. When you do, it shall

660
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:21,080
turn the parade into your own personal army. You shall march to the Mayor's Mare, where

661
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:28,080
by now the Bat shall be, because Rambler, you will have to set off the signal, set up

662
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,080
a final trap to capture the Bat, hold him long enough for when the parade arrives, and the

663
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:51,080
the

664
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:56,120
you go to like Pepsi world like big bradels, you're already here

665
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:05,640
and also to go to my voice and as he says that

666
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:11,760
yeah, oh shit now. I know yeah the dark sort of dome around you opens up.

667
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,280
The robot is somehow gone from what you can see must have somehow slipped out

668
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,560
while you guys were chatting. The robot is the hundred foot robot slipped out.

669
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,200
Okay.

670
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,720
And you're on top of a roof in the outskirts of Gotham,

671
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,520
overlooking this garish Art Deco manor where the manor is. Wow!

672
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,920
It's beautiful! No, it's not beautiful, it's bloody garish.

673
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,720
Man, I used to live over by here, man, back in the day. It's just too garish.

674
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,080
It's... You see guests beginning to arrive. Gosh! It's his gosh. Gosh, you're

675
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,080
about ghost. I used to know ghost. I used to know a guy named ghost. An orc named ghost.

676
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:57,080
That was my parents. That's the guy that I used to know. Prison uniform. Do you have

677
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:03,080
socks? Yeah. I put two in his mouth. Yeah, thank you. Unfortunately, the only thing we

678
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:11,080
have to do from him is you, Rambler. So you have a dossier of the party handed for you.

679
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:15,120
I can drink this. He can't. Oh, this one's actually the guests who are going to be

680
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:19,840
at the party are Cassandra Blackthorn, a wealthy socialite. Oh, the two people

681
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,120
that socialist. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

682
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,440
a quick from the criminal underworld or rumored because my character was going

683
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,360
to have to smash.

684
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,920
Then there's Dr.

685
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:37,080
Dr. Dick Eisenhart, Victor Eisenhart, Victor Eisenhart, a scientist and

686
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,760
inventor is working on some secretive projects. My brother is an inventor or I

687
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,760
mean, no, he's on a TV show where he talks to inventors.

688
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:49,200
I got some invention ideas that I gotta start passing by your brother. Lady

689
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,760
Isabella Davenport, an aristocrat,

690
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,000
Senator Jonathan Monroe, a charismatic politician.

691
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,280
These are sort of the... These are all the people that... Are gonna be at the

692
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,040
party. That, oh, okay. General Victor Thornwood, he's a

693
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,360
my ranking military officer.

694
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:08,500
I thought these are the people that I have to pretend to I'll tell you the two

695
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,160
and a second Doctor Malcolm Stroud, Mark Cuban, respected psychiatrist. Can Mark

696
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,020
Cuban be there? I try to make it pretty all about pretty please pretty please

697
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,460
dragons, then just give me one

698
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,700
Mark Cuban and underworld kingpin is, I guess what he is now who commands a

699
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:28,040
private. No, he just is Mark Cuban. Mark Cuban is there Alistair crumb, a

700
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:32,320
mysterious fortune, no a mysterious and underworld kingpin. He's a for secretly

701
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,260
a fortune. No, that's mad. It's a fortune. It's Madame Celeste and then

702
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,980
there's Dylan, who wears a blue shirt.

703
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:41,260
I like

704
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:47,660
we like Dylan say Dylan's think what Dylan wears a shirt. He has a felt

705
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:52,120
gold, so he's the type of guy where during the week he wears maybe graphic

706
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:55,940
tea, cargo shorts and on Friday he's like I'm stepping out. I'm right on my

707
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,160
home.

708
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,040
start loading t shirt and friday here we go friday. It's my

709
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,500
golden star hitting the club, maybe blue shirt. He's at the

710
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:12,000
forty forty club, vip red rope around on stripper. He's looking

711
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,140
up the hottest stripper. No, no bottle service. Yes, water to

712
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:19,900
other people's vip sections. He's getting their bottles. He's

713
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,940
saying check my shirt and then he's not drinking. That's the

714
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,060
coolest shirt. I've ever seen drinking. He does not drink. He

715
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:27,460
said he just pours it on the ground. He pours on the women's

716
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:33,100
glasses. Yeah, he rubs it in sex like suns. Yeah, yeah, he says my shirt girl.

717
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:36,660
He hates drugs. I made the star myself when I bought the shirt from Amazon and

718
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,140
he loves his shirt from Amazon. It's a medium.

719
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:46,020
But it's kind of big, right? It's a medium, but it's a medium, but it's

720
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:51,140
me. It should be a large, but it's tight as shit. It shows up. Yeah, there

721
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:56,140
are two people you can you can choose to in person. I am obsessed with Dylan

722
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:59,020
right now. I can't even think Dylan will be there at the party, so you can talk

723
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,780
to Dylan. I choose to can I choose to impersonate someone you can, but you

724
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,400
will be taking out security guards of the roof. I will be impersonating

725
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,280
Gordon Ramsey.

726
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,640
I would like to impersonate Mark Cuban. He could impersonate Mark Cuban, so

727
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:17,720
Mark Cuban actually isn't there all along. He's not there he's so take that

728
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:20,680
strike that I didn't realize we're even going to have the opportunity to

729
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,680
impersonate people. There's Lila Renard, a renowned art collect written art

730
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:32,020
I did what I did and then there's Raphael de la Croix. Okay, what are

731
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:36,420
their descriptions? Lila Renard is a renowned art collector. Okay, sounds

732
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:40,340
about right. She's been a she uses her extensive network of contacts and a vast

733
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:45,420
knowledge of the art world, art world, to help funnel money for the mayor's

734
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,140
schemes, allegedly, because the mayor is corrupt, of course, Mayor Peach,

735
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:56,840
Mayor, Peach Boucher Jag. No, his name is damn. You know, this was 2018. Holy shit. That would

736
00:39:56,840 --> 00:40:02,080
have been fucking fire. But Raphael Delacroix is a foreign diplomat known for his silver

737
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:07,280
tongue and shrewd negotiation skills. Does he have a silver tongue for real? Yeah, it's

738
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,640
silver. Okay, shit. So I just paint my tongue silver. So the reason why he chose to dispose

739
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,880
of these two though is because Lila and Raphael are new to the Mayor. Lila is a friend of

740
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,640
a friend who he's been trying to get to be a part of his sort of art collection circle.

741
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:28,680
And Raphael Delacroix is a foreign diplomat who is new to the US and is new to the, to

742
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,960
being an ambassador from the Isle of Monaco.

743
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,960
Okay.

744
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,960
So.

745
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:42,560
So I think I'll probably pick Raphael because of the silver tongue and I pull a little jar

746
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,560
of Warhammer paint out of my pocket and I started painting my tongue very silver.

747
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:51,060
Okay, so they will ask you probably if that's a condition.

748
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:53,060
Well, he's supposed to have a silver tongue.

749
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,560
Yeah, you said he has a silver tongue.

750
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,060
There's only one guy that they know who has a silver tongue, so they're going to assume it's him.

751
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,060
And I'll tell them it's like a Monikin.

752
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:02,060
Moniko? He's from Monaco?

753
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,560
Monokin?

754
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,560
Monokin?

755
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,560
I have no idea.

756
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:07,060
It is a Monikoin.

757
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,560
Monikoean?

758
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,560
Monokoean.

759
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,560
It feels like there's something that's like...

760
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:15,740
Google it. It's probably Monacan. Like Monation? There's like something weird. Monotian. Can

761
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:22,740
you look it up? Somebody from Monaco. Yeah. Our producer's Monacan. Word for Monaco adjective.

762
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Monacoan? It's probably Monacan. There's no word? What is it? Is it Monacan? Manican?

763
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:39,460
Mono? Monoan. Monoan. Monoan. Monoan. Maybe it's just Samoan. Monagask. Monagask. Okay,

764
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,820
It's way harder.

765
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,820
What?

766
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,820
So...

767
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,820
What?

768
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,820
That can't be right.

769
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,820
Yeah, that can't be right.

770
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
I think your phone is glitching.

771
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,820
Yeah.

772
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,820
It seems like it's...

773
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,820
That's a bug.

774
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,100
So it's a Monagasque ritual that all boys go through when they're 14.

775
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,100
Because overtime.

776
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,100
Yeah.

777
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Yeah.

778
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,060
And I'll tell people that, but they won't even know that I'm saying it because they'll

779
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,540
stop listening after halfway through my conversation.

780
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:06,580
So you guys can make your way to the front area of the manor.

781
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:10,880
you want to blend in kind of with the crew that's a good fucking news,

782
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,680
because I'm already wearing my chef's outfit. Perfect

783
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,360
awesome and then how many spells do I get to cast

784
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:22,640
so that see that? Oh, hi. So you have oh, these are my spells. Those are your

785
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,840
spells. I mean, you have four potions that just replenish spell. So, okay,

786
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,680
cool. Yeah. All right. I know how I'm going to take out the guards, but we

787
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,460
can get to that when we get to it. Cool. Oh my goodness. I'm dressed. I'm

788
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:39,480
a

789
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
He was at the Dallas...

790
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,480
He wears a suit on the show though.

791
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,480
He's known as a t-shirt guy.

792
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
But not at a high party where he's meeting the mayor.

793
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Maybe the...

794
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,480
How about the NBA finals?

795
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
Okay, why don't you wear a t-shirt?

796
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,480
That's a game.

797
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480
That's a game.

798
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:59,480
He owns the Dallas Mavericks.

799
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,480
You don't know shit about Cuban.

800
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,480
You don't know shit about Cuban other than his shirt.

801
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,480
It is more than a game to him.

802
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:07,480
More than a game.

803
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,280
So you guys, so there's like, so how do you want to, how do you want to

804
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:15,280
approach the, here, are you all, you're all, well, I have to do, I walk up to

805
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:18,840
the, before they go in. Yeah, I walk up to the valet guy. No, don't let them

806
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,400
do anything. He can still go in. He can still, yeah. I can go in 'cause I

807
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:24,080
have a silver tongue. I'll explain, the reason why. Then why am I even taking

808
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,200
out the guards if we can just go in? Let's just go in. 'Cause, well, hold on.

809
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,960
Let's all go in together. Hold on. Yeah, let's just go in. I'll say that

810
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:33,840
they're my guests. The reason why you take out the guards on the roof is

811
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,920
because... Oh, they're on the roof, they're not out front. Yeah, sorry.

812
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:41,620
Okay, we go in and so when he he goes in the front, there's no guards to stop us.

813
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:44,040
Yeah, they're on the roof. I guess it's a party. The problem with the guard,

814
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,220
he's gonna kill everyone. Well, I can just say that they're my guests. Yeah,

815
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:50,520
I'm gonna go, okay, I'll make a beeline for the... I'm in. Or you can say that,

816
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,220
you can try to do that too. I'm in as well.

817
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:55,100
So we're in. Okay, we've gone in. Okay, so there's this... Okay, and then...

818
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,740
Well, no, what do you guys wanna do? What do you guys wanna do? So you guys

819
00:43:56,740 --> 00:44:00,000
are my guests? Okay, I'd like to walk up to the DJ booth. Cut to us being

820
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,240

821
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:05,400
Okay, you're in. I'm walking up to the DJ booth. All right. Yeah, I mean,

822
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,360
there's a DJ booth at this dinner part. Hey

00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,600

824
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:18,840

825
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,080
my house and I'm in too loud. Yeah man sure just

826

He's Homer's neighbor.

852
00:45:25,620 --> 00:45:26,740
That's what it is.

853
00:45:26,740 --> 00:45:27,740
What's a philanderer?

854
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,740

Homer, a scumbag.

862
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:49,180
I have to rub shoulders with him from time to time, and I always feel like

863
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,780
taking a shower afterwards. 'Cause your secret identity is Bruce Wayne.

864
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,280
This is imagine this is being said while the mayor walks down to greet all

865
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,500
the guests. Are you on the fucking roof or what? I don't know. We're in.

866
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,480
you're doing a narration, but I just wanted to know where you're going to be.

867
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:05,320
I didn't do okay.

868
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,660
I will say I walked to the I walked to the

869
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:15,400
kitchen after I just wanted to hear okay, then I'm on the roof. I suppose

870
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,120
you can so you you're not on the roof. You'd be like outside scouting to try to

871
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,080
get on the you can't just like get on the room, but he can levitate. He can

00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:24,520

we can come back to you. I just don't know finish your narration. He got to we

874
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,940
locked in and then we didn't even get a chance to say anything about what we

875
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:35,600
were doing, but I got a request. I know that's what I'm saying. That's why I'm

876
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,040
confidant.

877
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:42,100
I think that somebody here is playing for five seconds. Did you convince you

878
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:45,320
press the transition button? So I was like I guess this is kind of happening

879
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:49,240
now, but are you are you going to be are you going to tell because you guys are

880
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,840
not guests who are in like your chef, so you would have to

881
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,080
work back out.

882
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,560
We left

883
00:46:56,240 --> 00:47:00,400
which is one. I feel like I'm I feel like I'm fucking up right now. Are you

00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:52,040
So

898
00:47:57,340 --> 00:48:01,320
and I'm here to cook the food for the whole role persuasion

899
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,660

let you in now Batman voice. We're inside now. Okay, Gotham's Mayor Lionel

903
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,580
Peach was a noted philanderer scumbag. I have to rub shoulders with him from

904
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:31,460
time to time and I always feel like taking a shower afterwards. The man is in

905
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:35,520
the pockets of every will freak in the city and he barely hides it the way

906
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:39,380
flaunts his corruption works in two ways. He shows he's powerful and he shows

907
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:45,820
that he doesn't care. So neither should you I guess damn peach himself as a

908
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:50,760
a man of about 60 with a dollop of blonde sitting unconvincingly atop his mushy

909
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,120
head.

910
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:56,360
His beady eyes somewhat crossed with a stylish goatee failing to draw the eye

911
00:48:56,360 --> 00:49:00,800
away from his blotched cheeks. His third wife, Nuna, a drunken former beauty

912
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:01,080
queen.

913
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,360
Nuna?

914
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,360
Nuna Peach.

915
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,800
And his daughter, Sandy Peach.

916
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,920
A law school student paints the perfect family picture.

917
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,080
Two women sick of a man they depend on

918
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,360
in one way or another.

919
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:28,280
Peach's manner is garish.

920
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,080
- Oh God.

921
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:34,040
- Bygone nouveau riche art deco with rounded arches

922
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:37,440
and loud marble slates and ceramics.

923
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:40,600
His own Baroque flourishes involve winding lattice gold

924
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,440
across transoms and some East Asian pieces.

925
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,520
- Not Baroque flourishes.

926
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,840
it's broke. Oh, it's and he's got lettuce all over the place. He just says it's

927
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:51,420
not me and my crew. When we see Baroque flourishes

928
00:49:51,420 --> 00:50:00,140
anything, you know, like he's got like a little like sort of my dog. When he

929
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:01,460
sees Baroque flourishes

930
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:08,920
look man, I took creative writing. It's not my fault. I'm going to shoot this

931
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:13,760
shit out of this. You should shoot me yeah. Oh the party, I'm Batman hold on

932
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,960
He said I'm Batman.

933
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,960
I'm Batman.

934
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,000
Oh yeah, and some East Asian pieces he collects on his frequent trips to mainland China.

935
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:28,080
I've scouted the place a few times myself and there's always been something up with

936
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:30,560
it, something lurking in the corners.

937
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:34,960
The rooftops filled with guards, men in suits with concealed carries walk the halls, not

938
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,000
too typical for a mayor.

939
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,320
From the ceiling hangs supernova chandeliers and fractured glance mirrors, more funhouse

940
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,600
than dining room high arch chairs with alabaster backs and rounded marble bases

941
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,680
along with a rug of spiraling cow print and the occasional white Buddha. Each

942
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,120
depiction more alienating than the last someone raised gold plates hanging

943
00:50:56,120 --> 00:51:01,520
askew or full marble statues in a Greco Roman style. So very chaotic hodge

944
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:07,480
podge. And let me guess he also has a fucking Jeff Koons. Yes. Oh, fucking

945
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:13,480
Oh, fuck no! And it's the dogs. It's all the dogs. It's just the dogs, all in pink.

946
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:29,280
Oh, bloody God! And I'm not Batman no more. And as he sort of, he prances down

947
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,880
to greet everyone, he says, "Oh, it's so good to see all my lovely guests!"

948
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,920
Hey yo, Peach.

949
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:40,560
Ah, you must be Ambassador de la Croix.

950
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:42,560
It's a pleasure to meet you.

951
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,560
(growling)

952
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:47,560
Yes, I've heard about the Monag-- Monag-- Monag--

953
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,060
Monagweeze.

954
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,060
Monagweeze tongues.

955
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:53,060
Look at my shit.

956
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:55,060
And who are your two guests? Mr. Ramsey, I presume?

957
00:51:55,060 --> 00:51:57,060
Gordon Ramsey and Mark Cuban.

958
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:59,060
And Mr. Cuban.

959
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,060
I'm Mark Cuban. I speak to inventors

960
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,060
on TV with my brother.

961
00:52:03,060 --> 00:52:05,060
We're gonna invent a new kind of tongue.

962
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:10,200

964
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,720

965
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:23,740
added Shark Tank back into the whole thing we do. It was pretty fast, right?

966
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:28,420
Do you think? It's been maybe- It's been a long time. It's been two years since

967
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:30,560
Shark Tank was in here. Has it been two years since that? It's been maybe a

968
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:33,380
year since we- No, it's two years. I think it's been two years. I think he's

969
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,620
Yeah, 2021 we did Shark Tank.

970
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,880
Anyway, so let's all sit down for some dinner, right?

971
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,080
Oh, yeah, I got to go cook it now.

972
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:47,960
He's going to go cook it and then he's going to go distract.

973
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,360
No, he's going to not going to.

00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,320
I have to. I'm searching for talent.

975
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:55,020
He's going to go look for my TV show.

976
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:56,580
You got to go to the top floor.

977
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,320
He's going to look for young, talented women.

978
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:00,780
The C suite.

00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:04,260
Okay, I'll go check it out. Young, talented women is what he's looking for.

980
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:07,980
And I like I'm Mark Cuban. I like when the women pitch inventions on my show.

mad when when when one of the women shark tanks who I can't remember her

990
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:49,380
name stole the I like old shock. Yeah,

991
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:57,020
stole the remote control vibrator from me. Yeah, I wanted to invest in that so

992
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:57,580
bad.

993
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:58,080
yet,

994
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,780
but I couldn't

995
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:05,560
okay. I'm in the kitchen, so he's going to look for young girls. He's going to

996
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:07,880
look for younger. I can say you're in the kitchen. Wait say you're in the

997
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,500
kitchen again. I'm going to the kitchen.

998
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,640
Oh my God, I'm here all right. He's in the kitchen and your dinner is started

999
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,720
I'm at the table. Are you going to the roof? Are you going to I'm going to the

1000
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,240
roof?

1001
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:28,180
Okay, cool, so yeah, we're at the let's start with being at the dinner table.

1002
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,340
So all right, I'm sitting next to Bruce Wayne

1003
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:40,180
Bruce Wayne is not there. Why not? I don't know. He doesn't like Bruce Wayne

1004
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:44,180
very much. The mayor, the mayor, Bruce Wayne doesn't like Bruce Wayne very much

1005
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:48,860
in the new movie. Something in the way I don't like myself.

1006
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:56,460
if you want to do who does who do you sit next to the second? Who's the second

1007
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:59,700
closest to Bruce Wayne? Alfred Wayne is not

1008
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:04,740
who at this dinner?

1009
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:15,020
I can't believe you're going to this

1010
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,020
- Master Wayne, it's gonna be finger sandwiches.

1011
00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:22,580
- It's gonna be too fun, Master Wayne.

1012
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:25,420
- It's gonna be finger sandwiches and a water slide.

1013
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:26,260
I have to go.

1014
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,080
- Master Wayne.

1015
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,460
(laughing)

1016
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,940
- Master Wayne, I have to read some arrows.

1017
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:31,620
- It's an open bar, Master Wayne.

1018
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,460
I have to go.

1019
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,060
(laughing)

1020
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,100
- We'll talk about this when you get back.

1021
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:44,100
- I'll only go for about an hour, Master Wayne.

1022
00:55:44,100 --> 00:55:44,940
- Master Wayne, Master Wayne.

1023
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,540
- I'll probably be back by 11 p.m.

1024
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,380
- Master Wayne.

1025
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,660
- I want to check it out, that's all.

1026
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:51,380
I want to see how lame it's going to be.

1027
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,460
- There's a bowl of Chex Mix, Master Wine.

1028
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,140
- I think I'm going to be a little longer.

1029
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,300
(laughing)

1030
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,500
- They have Chex Mix at the party.

1031
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:59,340
- You're not having too much fun, are you?

1032
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,140
- No, it's, Master Wine, it's horrible here.

1033
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:01,980
It's not fun at all.

1034
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,800
- Alfred, get back in the pool!

1035
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:03,640
- Alfred, come here!

1036
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:04,480
- Get back in the pool!

1037
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:05,700
- Get back in the pool!

1038
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,540
- Master Wine.

1039
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:08,700
- That's just my friends being funny, Master Wine.

1040
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,660
(laughing)

1041
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:13,300
- This is one of these prank phones they gave me.

1042
00:56:13,300 --> 00:56:14,700
- Who are your friends, Alfred?

1043
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:15,540
Who are your friends, say?

1044
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,940
- I'm here with Derek.

1045
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,060
what up yeah,

1046
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:19,700
this way,

1047
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,600
yeah,

1048
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,460
well, I'm gonna oh man, we could do that forever, but here are the people

1049
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:31,660
I'm going

1050
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:35,320
to go low.

1051
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:41,140
I am without you master way, you're going to create my style master. The

1052
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,180
party is sponsored by Casamigos.

1053
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:52,140
I have to go the closest to there's Alfred and you can sit directly between

1054
00:56:52,140 --> 00:56:57,020
Alfred and Dylan. Okay, if you oh I'm sitting in between Dylan and Alfred for

1055
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:02,280
sure yeah cool. So yeah, I'm turning to Dylan. I'm like hey man where the hell

1056
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:05,980
do you get that blue fucking blue shirt? You got that on Amazon Prime. I made it

1057
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:09,440
myself. You made it you okay, so yeah, I bought this shirt on Amazon Prime and

1058
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:13,060
then I made the felt star myself. Holy shit, man, you're like one of the most

1059
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:14,500
creative people in Gotham.

1060
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,300
That's what I like to think.

1061
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:18,500
One of the things that I love about you is your bulk.

1062
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:19,700
That's Gotham's art scene.

1063
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:21,400
They don't have anything else.

1064
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,100
They have custom shirts.

1065
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:27,500
One of the best things about you Dylan is you're doing it like nobody else, man.

1066
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:30,800
You're putting felt in t-shirts, you're putting your hair in a bowl,

1067
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,100
you're cutting around the bowl.

1068
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:34,700
Yep, that's just the quickest way to do it.

1069
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:38,300
Man, Dylan, you're like basically like Gotham's Picasso.

1070
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,500
Thank you.

1071
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,500
He's got a circle go to.

1072
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:44,860
but he's not known as an artist. He's only just people just like him. Yeah,

1073
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:49,260
he's a socialite. He will be an artist and he does thumbs up like that. Yeah,

1074
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:49,860
that's how we just

1075
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:55,180
he says pound it and then he gets confused and he tries to shake your hand

1076
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,420
after he says pound it

1077
00:57:56,420 --> 00:58:01,660
he was like what's up man. Yeah, yeah, he goes. I didn't know what we were

1078
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:02,140
going for

1079
00:58:02,140 --> 00:58:06,420
hugs people first time he meets them. Yeah, also every time you meet him for

1080
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,980
the first time, I don't think it's anything wrong with that. Yeah, hiccups

1081
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,420
unexpectedly. He's like sorry. I just have a

1082
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:14,700
check my shirt, though

1083
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:15,740
yeah

1084
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:21,820
sure he does that every like once in a while to his I turn to I turn to I turn

1085
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:26,080
to out like a nerd, but like yeah yeah yeah I turned out for the he also does

1086
00:58:26,080 --> 00:58:28,020
the big blink yeah yeah yeah

1087
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:34,340
turn Alfredness didn't get a lot of sleep. You so you know that guy's Batman

1088
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:35,260
right, you know, fucking

1089
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:40,080
I don't know what you're talking about come on me. You can tell me Dylan is

1090
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:40,620
Batman

1091
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:47,000
you mean to I used to think it was Bruce Wayne, but now I've been thinking maybe

1092
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:50,140
is who think about it Batman. I'm not here, but I'm just

1093
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:57,160
I'm said talking to myself think about it. Batman must have had to make his own

1094
00:58:57,160 --> 00:59:01,960
costume. Who in this city is better at making clothing than Dylan and I turned

1095
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:07,220
I turn to turn to Alfred, it's like a split screen and we're saying the same

1096
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:12,360
exact thing. I used to think it was Bruce, but think about it. There's only

1097
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:17,860
one person in this city who's good enough at making their own clothes and

1098
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,880
what better secret identity than a socialite.

1099
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,720
Nobody would ever suspect you're all you're saying that, like to the

1100
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:27,960
it cuts in and to me. I think Dylan might be Mario.

1101
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:37,020
My God, you to say that at the same time as Alfred and the and a guard, just

1102
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:40,380
like ran it was like like that's a good point. That's a good point. Like

1103
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:41,800
staring like looking around

1104
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:48,060
I mean go hey wait a minute and he turns around roll for roll for me. Cut to

1105
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:48,380
you

1106
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:52,240
all right. He heard you just chatting to yourself, so you better start rolling

1107
00:59:52,280 --> 01:00:04,280
your

1108
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:07,480
cardboard. No, that's always how I got to trouble before the cardboard.

1109
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,320
There's a gap in the

1110
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:14,080
I'm holding it now. Okay, that's even worse for camera wise, but it's a twelve

1111
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:17,560
plus my balance ball, which is one, which is thirteen total. Okay, we'll

1112
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:21,080
figure out the dice cam another time. Yeah, we'll make a box for it. So the

1113
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:25,440
guard sort of is moving around. There's like kind of these like little, this was

1114
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:27,600
a last minute addition, like these kind of like

1115
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,240
some old style buttresses that

1116
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:39,340
peeling around and a girl's but a buttress is a waitress that that gives

1117
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,560
you the food out of her, but

1118
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:44,900
the whole table laughs.

1119
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:54,820
The Homer Simpson dinner party scene.

1120
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,040
Yes, that's a brilliant idea.

1121
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:03,200
I do immediately. I try to light my own fart

1122
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:09,900
okay. Can I can't? Yeah, you can cast a spell at them, so press the

1123
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,720
digitation. This is still going to cost me a slot,

1124
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,400
even though it's a level zero. Yeah, thank God I'm going to cast it. How

1125
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:21,960
many guards are there? There's four on the roof, four times and I'm going to

1126
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:25,620
read you one sentence from this and maybe you can guess where I'm going with

1127
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:26,440
this. Okay,

1128
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:33,020
you instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than one cubic foot.

1129
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:37,440
Oh, you're going to do their wieners. Oh, and he's pretending to be mark cubic,

1130
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:42,040
so he's gonna exactly yeah. So this makes total sense. He gets advantage

1131
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:44,940
and check this one out this one. I'm not going to use, but listen to this.

1132
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:50,740
You chill warm or flavor up to one cubic foot of non living material for one hour.

1133
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:51,740
I think you should play

1134
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,460
I think you should flavor a for so I can flavor something that is not a

1135
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,940
life. What are you going to know? Okay, okay, so you're going to make them

1136
01:01:59,940 --> 01:02:03,280
shit. I can flavor anything. It doesn't have to be food. You're going to make

1137
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,120
them shit themselves, right? I'm going to make their pants dirty. Yeah, you're

1138
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:06,540
going to make me

1139
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,700
but but use the

1140
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,260
flavor their

1141
01:02:10,260 --> 01:02:15,420
say you're going to make you know, I'm really shit spicy so that their butts

1142
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:19,420
hurt. Okay, all right. Oh my God, yours. Okay, so here's what I'm going to do.

1143
01:02:20,020 --> 01:02:23,220
so since I can cast this unlimited times, I'm going to cast this basically a

1144
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:23,940
hundred times.

1145
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:24,780
Okay, so

1146
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:32,820
they will. It does require first. I saw in right, so okay, I say do so you have

1147
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:33,220
to roll

1148
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:40,220
your flavoring. There do I would start out by soiling. Okay, so you have

1149
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:43,140
advantage on rolling for stealthier because you got away from this guy, but

1150
01:02:43,140 --> 01:02:47,060
if you're let me just say what I want to do, let him cook and then you tell me

1151
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:51,200
I need to roll, but let me cook for a second here and the chef told I soil

1152
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,940
each of their pants, their unders

1153
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:58,200
unders to the outside soiled through that's less than a cubic foot. So I can

1154
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,100
see it. You have to be able to see it doesn't say so. All right, I guess

1155
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:07,700
what they just says within range. Okay, and then I flavor I okay. I chill. I

1156
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:08,320
chill it

1157
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:14,740
okay, really cold. They do. Yeah, okay, but I also I chill it, but I flavor it

1158
01:03:14,780 --> 01:03:19,980
spicy yeah, so it's like an icy hot kind of sensation that they've never

1159
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:23,460
experienced before when it comes to do that's perfect. Then I also create a

1160
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:26,920
non magical trinket or an illusory image that can fit in my hand

1161
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:30,180
and I make a toy to play

1162
01:03:30,180 --> 01:03:37,160
a toy race car race car race car. Yes, no, I do all in cup and I flavor it

1163
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:37,560
sweet

1164
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:43,980
and then I create stop stop stop and then I snuff out a candle.

1165
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:51,400
there's a candelabra. There's a candelabra. There's a candelabra at the

1166
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:56,640
dinner table and I'm trying to light my fart right, but then I him snuffing at

1167
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:59,480
the candle makes it look like my fart blew out all the

1168
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:04,440
on the candelabra in front of me. Oh wait, I can have up to three

1169
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:09,880
effects active at a time, so I was how is giving you stuff to read, make it so

1170
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:13,200
that things get derailed. You're the only one here who it's going to get

1171
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,040
derailed because you're reading. What am I derailing? Hold on let's start with

1172
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:17,400
the real he's doing I'm doing a

1173
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:23,320
one thing at a time. I sing there, okay, then I buy a new do I flavor it? I

1174
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:27,400
chill it okay, so first to make them do

1175
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,760
let's

1176
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:33,000
I don't need to roll anything. I end up here

1177
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:37,560
for stealth is what I mean, because you do have to talk

1178
01:04:37,560 --> 01:04:41,080
okay. Tell me that a guard is going to react to this

1179
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,080
do

1180
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:48,720
we say it twice and I cover my mouth. When I say it, say do you just make them

1181
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:49,360
do

1182
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,600
you convince me, make them to okay. I'll roll though.

1183
01:04:52,600 --> 01:04:56,760
You have advantage. I've been already snuck around. Can you say it like

1184
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:57,400
Rammstein

1185
01:04:57,400 --> 01:05:05,760
okay? That's a nineteen. Okay, whatever you do, I mean you're but let's see if I

1186
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:10,240
create them to do yeah. Okay, I didn't crit cool. All right, so yeah, you they

1187
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:14,080
they all are there. All their pants are soiled like our pants. They all know

1188
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:18,880
maybe I think they'd all if you let me step into your your shoes for a second.

1189
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,720
Yeah, I think maybe they'd all since their guards and they're tough, they

1190
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:25,120
would be too shy to tell each other, but as they walk around, but they're all

1191
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:27,920
kind of shattering because it's also frozen. It's not frozen. It's just

1192
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:31,920
chilled. It's not chilled. Yeah, she'll do chilled. Yeah, but they all they're

1193
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:34,520
all kind of like I have to go. Maybe they're all they all like to go, but

1194
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:36,920
they don't think it all smell it. Maybe they all go like

1195
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,320
they all they all sort of like slowly like one of them goes like you got this

1196
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:44,960
by the way, yeah, yeah, I got yeah, yeah and they like shoots a grappling gun

1197
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:45,720
barrels down

1198
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,360
another one goes the other one goes like hey

1199
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,960
you got this I'll be right I'll be right back with you yeah and they all do

1200
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:55,920
them and there's one up there and he's just sort of standing there yeah and

1201
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:59,440
he's like trying to find a way down right now, but he's not sure if he can

1202
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,880
leave he's got do he's got do he doesn't feel good okay, probably get him pretty

1203
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:04,240
bad.

1204
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:06,720
I flavor his tongue

1205
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:13,020
what's spicy. He's freaking out now. He's freaking out. Can we before we go any

1206
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:15,040
further? Can I create an odd odor?

1207
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,880
Can we

1208
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:24,120
can we list all the flavors he's able to do? I mean, it's anything right? Okay,

1209
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:29,000
do flavor. Okay, exactly. Can I create a flavor so bad that he has to vomit?

1210
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:33,880
Yeah, yeah, of course. Okay, I do that. I do that. You make it do

1211
01:06:35,080 --> 01:06:38,080
he did not succeed in his constitution saving through he vomits

1212
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:42,400
on to I should have had that to the sound of a board onto the roof.

1213
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:43,400
That's a pretty easy one.

1214
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:44,280
Yeah,

1215
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,080
sounds like a

1216
01:06:47,080 --> 01:06:48,680
crazy.

1217
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:50,280
They smell the

1218
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:53,240
and he just he goes down.

1219
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:57,280
So the guards are clear. They're off the roof right now. So

1220
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,800
you in the kitchen. Yeah,

1221
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:03,680
it's your turn to try to poison the stuff. So to do that, you're gonna

1222
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,960
have to do some gum. Do I have poison? You have poison. Can I make a

1223
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,640
suggestion?

1224
01:07:07,640 --> 01:07:13,320
Maybe try to get some of the guards chill to do

1225
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:18,000
and add it to the... I can just make more chilled dew. I can do it

1226
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,680
infinitely. I already have poison, he says. I don't think I need dew. I

1227
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:22,820
mean, if you have the poison... The concern will be that the guards will

1228
01:07:22,820 --> 01:07:27,400
come back from... He's like a douyaan. Yeah, yeah. Use chilled dew as a

1229
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,400
douyaan. But it lasts for an hour, so they're gonna have to go and

1230
01:07:30,400 --> 01:07:33,760
get change for an hour. They change and it's going to stay

1231
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:40,440
clean it

1232
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:44,880
put on their pants. They shit themselves

1233
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,160
it's a spell of endless

1234
01:07:49,160 --> 01:07:56,700
the one hour goes by and it's all gone. Okay, so you said something about my

1235
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:58,920
gumbo yeah. You should use

1236
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:02,480
You should use your gumbo to cook up the poison.

1237
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:06,160
So, roll a d20 and we'll see what gumbo you get.

1238
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,460
You might have to keep gathering ingredients.

1239
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,560
- 16.

1240
01:08:09,560 --> 01:08:12,360
- Okay, I'm gonna look at your gumbo list.

1241
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:14,180
- That's my modifier, right?

1242
01:08:14,180 --> 01:08:15,340
- No, that's just the gumbo.

1243
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:16,420
- Oh, okay.

1244
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,800
- That's just for the gumbo.

1245
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:18,760
- 16, what do I get?

1246
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:19,920
- You see what you get.

1247
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:22,520
Okay, nice.

1248
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:24,440
Fortifying broth.

1249
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:26,520
- That's the opposite of fucking poison.

1250
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,360
- Roll again.

1251
01:08:27,360 --> 01:08:28,180
- Okay.

1252
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,020
- You can't control the gumbo.

1253
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,020
seventeen

1254
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:38,300
confusion concoction. Okay, I'll take that. Okay, cool cook crafts a liquid

1255
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,580
that induces confusion. The cook makes a range of take away two ingredients from

1256
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:44,900
your from your ingredients list. Which ones are you taking away? Well, it's

1257
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:48,540
just it's like a bar, but like say what you're using yeah. What are you using

1258
01:08:48,540 --> 01:08:50,180
though for confusion? Yeah,

1259
01:08:50,180 --> 01:08:51,820
salt and pepper

1260
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:58,320
together. Yeah, yeah, right for what did you do for four and not supposed to mix

1261
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:03,340
Fortifying broth was a, it was bone broth.

1262
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,340
That makes total sense.

1263
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,340
Nice expensive bone broth.

1264
01:09:05,340 --> 01:09:07,340
Cool, and I'll tell you what the effect of that is too.

1265
01:09:07,340 --> 01:09:12,340
So, a cook or a chosen creature within 30 feet gains resistance to all damage

1266
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,340
except psychic damage for the next minute.

1267
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:17,340
So, if you want to strengthen yourself up, if you get into a fight,

1268
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,340
you can always drink fortifying broth.

1269
01:09:19,340 --> 01:09:20,340
So you have that.

1270
01:09:20,340 --> 01:09:25,340
And I'll put a little asterisk next to that so that I remember for next time.

1271
01:09:25,340 --> 01:09:29,700
And then for confusion concoction,

1272
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,460
the cook crafts a liquid that induces confusion.

1273
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:33,820
The cook makes a range attack against a target within 30 feet.

1274
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,500
But in this case, you're just going to pour it into the food.

1275
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,900
The target must succeed on DC wisdom, 14 saving throw,

1276
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:39,980
or be affected by confusion.

1277
01:09:39,980 --> 01:09:42,360
- So is the food going to roll?

1278
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:44,420
- What'll happen is, no, no, no.

1279
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,380
What'll happen is you'll put in the food.

1280
01:09:46,380 --> 01:09:48,860
Everyone will eat it. - What is the food, by the way?

1281
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:50,740
What's on the menu for tonight?

1282
01:09:50,740 --> 01:09:52,320
- You're Chef Ramsay.

1283
01:09:52,320 --> 01:09:53,740
- Well, I'm not, the foods aren't,

1284
01:09:53,740 --> 01:09:54,580
you said dinners are you gonna-

1285
01:09:54,580 --> 01:10:02,740
I have an idea. Quail eggs? Quail eggs? Those are this big. It's a confusion concoction,

1286
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:11,140
right? And it's a gumbo. What if it's a soup that lifts above the bowl, but it retains

1287
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:15,740
the shape of the bowl? What? Are you describing like a magic trick kind of thing? What are

1288
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:23,380
you talking about, man? So when you try to go in? Yeah. When you try to open -- yeah.

1289
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:27,920
so I don't know. No, no, I mean, I'm no, I think that will stick with eggs and so

1290
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:33,400
I'm going to, I guess, inject my confusion into the yolk of the egg. Yes,

1291
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,120
you do that

1292
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,640
and yeah, they have to roll a DC wisdom saving throw. So

1293
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:42,280
that's perfect. So the guards are gone. You guys drank at the same time you're

1294
01:10:42,280 --> 01:10:42,800
married.

1295
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,160
If you, if you want to before you do that, you can still use two more and see

1296
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,640
if you get another kind of thing you want to use. I like, are we good with

1297
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,440
confusion is confusion. Okay, I think confusion. Yeah, roll one more confusion

1298
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,680
is also easy. If you confuse them, I feel like and they don't die. We can

1299
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:02,200
easily mow them down. You know what? I'll just try again. I have four

1300
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:05,920
ingredients. Okay, but don't you want to save them for maybe another task?

1301
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:10,040
Don't didn't have another other tap. We could probably do like a long rest at

1302
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:15,040
some point. That's a whole four that will get you healing delight. Okay,

1303
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:18,040
don't want that one. And last one seven

1304
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:23,320
Speedy preparation. Okay, I'm doing the fuck is speedy preparation. These are

1305
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:28,220
fucking poison speedy preparation means that he can can he can he just means he

1306
01:11:28,220 --> 01:11:32,480
make it made it fast. Can he? No, I don't know. It's called healing. You

1307
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:36,640

1308
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,020

1309
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:44,240

1312
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:54,660

1313
01:11:54,660 --> 01:11:57,700
Well, you're going to take a train, I mean, we're on your way to the zoo. The

1320
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:47,140
Dylan how to do it and you know what? Honestly, what I think happened is that

1321
01:12:47,140 --> 01:12:50,780
you went to do that. Your hand started moving together and he instantly got to

1322
01:12:50,780 --> 01:12:54,660
it before you. Yeah, he's and then he did and then he did blood and then I

1323
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:57,900
went, Damn, Dylan, everybody. Look at what Dylan's doing.

1324
01:12:57,900 --> 01:13:00,740
Everybody look at Dylan.

Thank you all of you for coming here today to my lovely dinner

1326
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:11,460
and let you know that this is the beginning of something spectacular.

1327
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:14,460
We're going to change Gotham forever.

1328
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:20,460
It's going to be a place where I shall rule with an iron fist

1329
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:25,460
and the criminal underworld shall work for me, courtesy of Alistair here,

1330
01:13:25,460 --> 01:13:28,460
and it will all start at the parade.

1331
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:33,260
And, well, before I go on, let's eat. Let's eat some quail eggs.

1332
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:34,760
And so the quail eggs are brought out.

1333
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
[Tapping]

1334
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,760
[Ding ding ding]

1335
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,760
Yes, Mr. De La Croix.

1336
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,760
I just want to say one thing before we go any further with this dinner.

1337
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,760
You can eat during my speech.

1338
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,760
I just want to say one thing before we go any further with this dinner.

1339
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,760
And that's...

1340
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:57,760
Check this out, y'all.

1341
01:13:57,760 --> 01:13:59,600
you have to make a noise.

1342
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:03,600
I like it so much better when you

1343
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:09,860
a natural noise. Yeah, look at my tongue. Y'all. I just turned sixteen.

1344
01:14:09,860 --> 01:14:19,060
I just turned sixteen. Look at my silver tongue. I will sing this song.

1345
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,860
Here's my sail for

1346
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:24,060
everyone is everyone's rolling because everyone's eating

1347
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:26,860
Some of these people are getting actually good.

1348
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:28,740
Wait, you have to stop the mayor from eating.

1349
01:14:28,740 --> 01:14:29,740
He's not supposed to die.

1350
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:30,740
The mayor's not supposed to die?

1351
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:31,740
Well, he's going to be confused.

1352
01:14:31,740 --> 01:14:32,740
Oh, right.

1353
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:35,340
God, I feel like an idiot.

1354
01:14:35,340 --> 01:14:36,900
You should.

1355
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:37,900
And also check this out.

1356
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:41,100
I'm going to make this dog really angry.

1357
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:46,660
Everyone's mad at you for trying to make the dog angry.

1358
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:47,660
It didn't work.

1359
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:48,660
I forgot I had Alfred.

1360
01:14:48,660 --> 01:14:49,660
I forgot.

1361
01:14:49,660 --> 01:14:53,420
I forgot Alfred's there now.

1362
01:14:53,420 --> 01:14:54,420
Everybody rolled pretty good, guys.

1363
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:55,420
I'm not going to lie.

1364
01:14:55,420 --> 01:14:58,820
most of them failed, not looking good. Most of them failed to some people

1365
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:02,940
weren't confused. The only people who succeeded, by the way, all of your for

1366
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:03,460
the mayor.

1367
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:07,740
Oh, that's not a good rule. He failed. The only people who succeeded

1368
01:15:07,740 --> 01:15:09,980
were Dylan

1369
01:15:09,980 --> 01:15:11,860
no joke,

1370
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:13,900
Dillon and

1371
01:15:13,900 --> 01:15:19,400
General Victor Thornwood. Okay, that's easy. I can take out Thornwood pretty

1372
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:22,820
well. Cool. Yeah, so everyone's like and Dylan's probably on our side over

1373
01:15:22,860 --> 01:15:27,460
falling over, but we think he's Batman Dylan is the leader of the over belly

1374
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:30,720
yeah Dylan sort of looking around confused. He's got his hands on his

1375
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:33,260
hips, but too high. Yeah, he's like sort of like yeah

1376
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:38,600
he's like he's doing like this kind of thing this yeah yeah yeah

1377
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,920
yeah and he's doing this with his shirt

1378
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,960
because he's a little over heated because of the felt before dealing

1379
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:49,520
address, moving the quail eggs around his plate with his fork and he's like

1380
01:15:49,520 --> 01:16:03,960
Okay, so yeah, everyone is now most of our confused like oh, no, what do I do

1381
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:08,120
now? What do I do? They're just hanging in different voices and the mayor. What

1382
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:12,160
do I do? That's okay. Here you go. Go, go, go, go, say, Oh, what do I do? Oh,

1383
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:19,080
I know I'm a girl. What do I do? I'm so confused. Oh God

1384
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:25,180
and those are all the different voices. Yeah, I did it wrong. I

1385
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,180
didn't know what was happening. It's my fault. Yeah, you didn't

1386
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:31,880
know so and when you rambler you approach the mayor, the mayor

1387
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:34,380
who's like sitting he's sitting. He looks like like when you're

1388
01:16:34,380 --> 01:16:36,480
knocked out of a mini game in Mario party and they're just

1389
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,780
sitting there like like and he's just sitting there. I pick him

1390
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:46,780
I pick him up by the lapels and I go, "Man, listen right here, man. I'm gonna tell it to you right now, right fucking straight.

1391
01:16:46,780 --> 01:16:53,780
I'm gonna say it one way, I'm not gonna say it the other way. I'm gonna look at you, I'm gonna just say, 'Hey, man, let's get the F out of this fucking...'"

1392
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:57,780
And next time, we'll see what you do to the mayor's mind.

1393
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:58,780
Cool.

1394
01:16:58,780 --> 01:17:01,280
(dog barking)
