10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
everybody knows Eater

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
yep

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I don't know what it is

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,640
see there. Chris Angel is opening a fast casual restaurant called CABLIP, which is spelled

15
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,160
C-A-B-L-P, and it's short for Chris Angel's Breakfast, Lunch, and Pizza.

16
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,320
He named it after me, dude? Whoa!

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,000
Dude, I'm CABLIP. What the fuck?

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
That's crazy. This was reported on 10 minutes ago, so we're

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,960
on the cutting edge of the story. Oh my god.

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,120
Dude, I mean, this is huge. Which will come out in, I think, five or six

21
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,320
days I mean yes people I don't think anybody's picking up the newest copy of

22
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:08,840
eater I think we might be I am breaking this news you are yeah why either yeah

23
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,080
y'all don't read either I don't read here where to go either where to eat and

24
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,920
why it matters in the world's best food cities do you think you're like that's a

25
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,520
killer slogan eat eater like the offices you like walk in and everybody it looks

26
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,920
like the clumps. And they're just like rolling around the office.

27
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:36,320
Yeah. When I hear Eater, my brain immediately goes to like a dark like fantasy like wizard

28
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,800
like an Eater. Well did you hear about their editor in chief of Eater?

29
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,080
No what did he do? Purple People.

30
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:51,520
Oh no dude. Don't tell me he got in trouble. He's on the shitty media men list.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,520
She's hitting the media monsters list.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,520
He got in trouble.

33
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,520
Yeah.

34
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Yeah, I mean, I'm surprised that people didn't see.

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,520
She's not going to come out.

36
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Yeah.

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,520
I mean, this new CEO, Hannibal the Cannibal, I mean, is a huge...

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,520
He's a big step up.

39
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
I mean, that's horrible.

40
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,520
But, I mean, what more, what would you expect from a publication founded by Peter the Eater?

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
True.

42
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,520
Yep.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:18,520
Yeah.

44
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I mean...

45
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,520
That's a good point.

46
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:28,960
his one horn you know yeah I don't want to go in too much about that but you know

47
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,560
now that you say that people I think there might be an entire song about him

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,840
and how he eats people yeah I'm surprised nobody fucking yeah the info was out

49
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,040
there I hope one day to have some kind of evil nickname like Vlad the Impaler

50
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,120
mm-hmm yeah but I don't have a good name first name for that

51
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:56,400
Caleb the molester. Don't say that no no not molester or pedophile or any of that crap.

52
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,140
No, you know like molesta like in like Spanish. What does that mean? Is that a sauce?

53
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:05,440
Doesn't that mean embarrassed? Caleb the embarrassed? That's even worse than being

54
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,760
a molester. I don't want to be a shy pussy. Does that mean...

55
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,760
Oh, upset.

56
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,760
Caleb the upset.

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,760
Caleb the upset.

58
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,760
I get upset like Drake.

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,760
Oh my god.

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,760
I'm reading about K-Blip, about Chris Angel's breakfast, lunch, and pizza.

61
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,360
I mean, like, the best name for a restaurant I think I've ever read.

62
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,000
It's inspired.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,080
He bought a restaurant called Sugar's Home Plate, and he's converting it to K-Blip.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:54,480
He discovered the restaurant while dirt biking with his family.

65
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,580
Aside from fast casual food, the restaurant will periodically convert into the magic room

66
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:01,120
with entertainment from Angel and his friends.

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,080
Down the road, Angel plans to build Chris Angel's Escape Camp Adventures on 14 acres at the start

68
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,880
of the Logandale trails.

69
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,400
I think it might be on a trail.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
On a dirt bike trail.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Oh, okay.

72
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
See, I like this.

73
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
The restaurant.

74
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,800
I like him moving into...

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,440
This is a long time coming.

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,920
Him moving into new industries.

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
You know what?

78
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,120
If he follows the Cableb naming convention, then his Criss Angel's Escape Camp Adventures

79
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,120
is gonna be named Caca.

80
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:38,800
I mean, it sucks that you gotta get like, like Magic certified and OSHA certified to

81
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,760
work at cave lip yeah like magic inspector comes yeah we have to make

82
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,720
sure you guys aren't using any dark are you are you measuring the wands and shit

83
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,640
excuse me I'm sorry I know you're new here but did you just make did you just

84
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,720
make those loaded nachos disappear yeah I'm sorry you you cannot be doing that

85
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,600
in your first day just store the vegetables on top of the disappearing

86
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,360
rabbits it's actually very unsanitary you realize that right a bunch of guys

87
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,520
carrots there in wizard caps come in and they're walking around with scrolls on

88
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,340
clipboards and they're like we just want to make sure that you know it's all

89
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:16,800
illusions there's no real magic and they like this scoot the mummies tomb out of

90
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,320
the way and there's a pentagram underneath it and they're like oh no no

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,240
this one we're gonna have to write you up for this one yeah this is uh this is

92
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,320
not an illusion and then they write your name down on the scroll and you're

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,800
sealed away for eternity it's magic with a K dude I don't fuck with that

94
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,080
Magic, you see?

95
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,080
Blood sugar sex magic.

96
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,680
Ooh, blood sugar sex magic.

97
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,480
Is that like a diabetes type magic?

98
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:41,400
Yeah, that's what the diabetic menu is called that came with it.

99
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,600
Blood sugar sex magic?

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
Yeah, it's named after that Red Hot Chili Peppers album.

101
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,160
Yeah, I think maybe we should start making songs like the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

102
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,160
I was saying before this episode that we should do a doo-wop album.

103
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,840
I was going to say we have to drop that as a surprise, but...

104
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,960
Yeah, too late now.

105
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,640
Imagine a world where we do a full 17 track doo-wop album.

106
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm thinking it's pretty easy right?

107
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,600
At most...

108
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
It's got to be the easiest kind of music to make.

109
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
At most we could do six.

110
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
At most?

111
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,040
You mean at least?

112
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,360
Genuine, no genuine answer here.

113
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,960
We could make six doo-wop songs.

114
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,600
I could really...

115
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
Unless it's covers.

116
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,640
Doo-wop songs are really easy to write.

117
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,120
Covers...

118
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,280
It's all in the same key.

119
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
Six originals, seven covers.

120
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,160
Alright, well let's write some lyrics. We gotta get to town here.

121
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,660
Okay.

122
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:36,240
I think I'm the baritone. I think I'm the bass.

123
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,640
I got some really good low notes.

124
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,140
Yeah.

125
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,140
Can I be, uh...

126
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,520
I can do the pig squeals.

127
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,440
*Badly imitating pig squeals*

128
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,440
Did you just go *Badly imitating pig squeals*

129
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
*Badly imitating pig squeals*

130
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,440
That's not Doo-Wop.

131
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,840
No, it's Blue Moon by the Marcells.

132
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,880
That's Roo-Wok.

133
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,000
And Roll.

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,200

141
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,800
You're not familiar with doo-wop? No, I'm more of a pooh-wop fan. The music created by Italians

142
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:47,080
for Italians. You like to listen to your pooh-wop. I like to get pooh-wop-y instead with my peonus.

143
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:52,640

- That's why also you could have, if you were famous,

156
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,600
you could have the shittiest body in the world.

157
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,440

00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,800

you were just eating like whatever,

160
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,720
every food back then was just like Funyuns and Jell-O,

161
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,320
and they would just eat that constantly.

162
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,120
- Yeah, Jell-O was like a status symbol,

163
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,720
it was just to show off how good your fridge was.

164
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,840
- How good your fridge was?

165
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,680
- Yeah. - Yeah.

166
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,680
- I don't think my fridge is good enough to do anything.

167
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,720
- Ambrosia salad and like--

168
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,280
- Ambrosia, what's that?

169
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:24,280
water

170
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,280
It's called like aspic.

171
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,280
A-S-P-I-C.

172
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
Aspic is disgusting.

173
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah, that's like when you put hot dogs in it.

174
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
Grossest looking foods in the world.

175
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
Jello, gelatin

176
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,280
is fucking like horse bones.

177
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,280
Yeah, but it doesn't look as

178
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,280
disgusting. Like they were working really

179
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:44,280
hard to make it look bad.

180
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Like normal jello, the ingredients

181
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
are pretty disgusting, but it

182
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,280
looks fine. I'll eat jello

183
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,280
any day of the week. That's a refreshing snack

184
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,520
- Yeah, I miss Jell-O at the buffet.

185
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,360
- That's a keto night's delight.

186
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,960
- Yeah, but just literally just go to Google images

187
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,280
right now and search ASPIC.

188
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,780
- A-S-P-I-C-S.

189
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,240
Look up ASPICS.

190
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,200
- And just look at any of these pictures.

191
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,560
Imagine looking at this and wanting to eat this.

192
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,000
This is like the most horrible thing I've ever seen.

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
- I guess in Russia it's like a grandma food.

194
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,640
Like a food your grandma used to make.

195
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,820
- Maybe a grandma food.

196
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:26,220
You know, like a grandma food, like fudge, jello, aspic.

197
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,860
- Bro, my grandma eats like--

198
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,700
- Beans.

199
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,140
- That bitch eats beans all day, dude.

200
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,580
Now she eats like, my grandma is like obsessed

201
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,660
with staying alive forever.

202
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,320
- Yeah, so is my grandpa.

203
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,740
- She only eats like spirulina and shit.

204
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,860
They should fuck, honestly.

205
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,700
- Yeah.

206
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,540
- We could get a--

207
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,360
- Oh my God, could you imagine?

208
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,500
- A new uncle, dude.

209
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,340
A shared uncle?

210
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,060
- Could you imagine, you and I get a new uncle.

211
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:50,900
- Oh, fuck.

212
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,700
and you become my cousin yeah you guys get to be related oh my god I found out

213
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,380
in middle school I found out that like one of my closest friends was like my

214
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:08,100
third cousin you fucking southerner. It was sick dude. You fucking southerners are all cousins.

215
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,260
And the thing is he wasn't even from my hometown he's from Florida and he was like talking

216
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,780
about his aunt in Florida and I was like oh I have a like some relatives in

217
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,300
Florida and then they had the same last name then I asked my grandma and

218
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,040
and she's like, "Oh yeah, that's my fucking great,

219
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,940
"that's my great cousin."

220
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,140
- There were two kids at my middle school

221
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,620
who had the same last name,

222
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,660
and they lied and told everybody

223
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,480
that they were cousins when they weren't.

224
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,500
But they weren't even like friends.

225
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,340
- You should go to jail for that.

226
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,820
- Like how do, like I don't,

227
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
how do you get to the point

228
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,340
where you decide to make that pact,

229
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,320
where you together lie to everyone that you're related,

230
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,340
and you don't even like hang out with each other?

231
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,340
Like that's something's going on.

232
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,180
- You know what's worse?

233
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,420
- That's not right. - You know what's worse is

234
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,260
when you are cousins with somebody,

235
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,540
and nobody believes you 'cause your cousin's taller than you.

236
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,580
Dude, my fuckin'-- I never had that experience.

237
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,300
My fuckin' dad told me--

238
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,540
High school experiences, no one believed,

239
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,540
no one believes my cousins were my cousins

240
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,580
at my high school and my middle school

241
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,620
because they were all taller than me

242
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,120
and they all played like football

243
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,500
and like basketball and shit.

244
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,500
Yeah, no way those two came from similar holes.

245
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,140
I'm the only-- It's just impossible.

246
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,260
Boy cousin in my family.

247
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,020
Dude, that's hot as fuck.

248
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,100
(laughing)

249
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
That's fucking sick dude.

250
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:19,600
No.

251
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,720
Yeah dude, 13th birthday party, all the cousins invited bro.

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,560
Oh shoot.

253
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,060
What?

254
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,560
What?

255
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,060
No.

256
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,060
That's not right.

257
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
What? You didn't read all their diaries?

258
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,060
What?

259
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:34,060
They bring the diaries to the birthday party?

260
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,560
Dude, I just want to read.

261
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,560
You need to cool off dude. You need to go dunk your head in ice or something.

262
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Yeah maybe.

263
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
Before you come back to recording. That's too much.

264
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,560
No.

265
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,560
It was cool. It was really cool.

266
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,560
I don't want that. No that's coffee.

267
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,000
coffee stop dude you're gonna get too caffeinated you're gonna be bouncing off the walls.

268
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,160
You don't need that. You're fine. I'm gonna start hurting your head dude. Stop. I've been just getting full-on panic attacks.

269
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,680
Drink, what's, what's the, what's that, what's that to the side of you?

270
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:06,000
That is computer duster. Drink that instead. You've already done this. Don't do it again.

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:13,040
Don't. Do it. Don't. Do it. Okay. Alright. I think he's dead.

272
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,160
I had to explain, I talked about last episode how I fucking killed mice and dumped a bunch

273
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,400
of oil out of my third floor window and then got a note on my door this morning that says

274
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,880
"Hey this is Arthur downstairs, give me a call" and he gave me his number and I called

275
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:39,880
him and he was like "Hey man, did you fucking throw a bunch of cooking oil out of the window?"

276
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,580
(laughing)

277
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,520
And I was like, oh yeah, but it was because of the mice.

278
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,220
And he was like, what are you fucking talking about?

279
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,520
And apparently he was like out of town

280
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:53,080
and he just came home and there was oil

281
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,420
all over his kitchen.

282
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,860
(laughing)

283
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,140
On his cat.

284
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,580
- Did he leave his window open?

285
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,460
- Yeah, his cat was like covered in oil.

286
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:05,500
And he was like, did you fucking throw oil?

287
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,740
- You know what that sounds like to me

288
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,260
is that the cat went after the mice

289
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:10,100
and tracked oil around everywhere.

290
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,160
- He couldn't have, dude.

291
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,320
There's a fucking, I think it went through the screen

292
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,820
in the window.

293
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,700
- Was it like really windy?

294
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,900
- I get, I don't know how it happened, but he--

295
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,820
- Maybe they had their fan in the wrong way.

296
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,740
- He was like, I don't know.

297
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,340
He told me, he's like, I thought that maybe you like

298
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,940
made french fries or something

299
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:31,620
and threw them out the window.

300
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,820
I was like, nah, dude, I had to actually kill

301
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,100
a bunch of mice and drown them to death.

302
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,240
- That's like, at least he didn't get

303
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,080
dead mice in there too right? That would have been kind of funny. Well if that

304
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,560
happened I would have just said I did it on purpose. I'd have been like yeah man fuck you

305
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,800
call the cops I don't give a fuck. Yeah. Whatever dude fucking pussy ass Arthur

306
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,160
come get it bro. Yeah it was not fun dude. I hate having I want to live on a giant

307
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,960
farm with nobody around me. Right no no no there are no mice on a farm no animals will come into your house.

308
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:04,920
Yeah, except for the mice. The mice is not my problem. I'm fine with the mice I just hate having neighbors.

309
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
You were crying about having to kill two mice.

310
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,920
Right now I'm talking about neighbors.

311
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,920
If you lived on a farm you would sob every time you had to milk a cow.

312
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,920
I've lived on a farm.

313
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,920
You could never farm. You could never be a farmer now.

314
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,920
I've lived on a farm. I'm the only one of us who has ever lived on a farm.

315
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,920
I lived on a farm in Louisiana.

316
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
What?

317
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
For a summer.

318
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,920
For a summer doesn't count.

319
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:27,920
You've never talked about that.

320
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,920
It was fine. I worked at a soybean farm.

321
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Okay, there you go. It was a soybean farm. It's not a fucking farm with animals.

322
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
That's not a farm.

323
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
That's not a farm.

324
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
That is not a farm.

325
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,760
I have more farm experience than both of you combined, probably times a thousand.

326
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,320
No, I've stayed at farms.

327
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,320
My parents' house-

328
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
You've stayed at farms?

329
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
My- Fuck you!

330
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Animal farms?

331
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
Farms with animals, dude.

332
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,320
My parents' house had a barn and we had chickens.

333
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
Not fucking soybeans.

334
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
And that is way more farm experience.

335
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
I don't give a fuck.

336
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,320
Chicken is fake shit, dude.

337
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
Way more farm experience than you have.

338
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,240
I've taken care of goats, I've taken care of horses.

339
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,240
You guys don't know me.

340
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
You have!

341
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
I have!

342
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,240
My cousins have goats and horses!

343
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
That's not true.

344
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
It is true!

345
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
They live in Bakersfield, California!

346
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:06,780
California you see how red I'm getting this is what I'm how serious I am about farming

347
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:11,480
It's in my blood you could never we went to your family's houses in Bakersfield

348
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,300
I did not see a single animal you went to my grandparents house. No we also went to

349
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:24,280
Oh, you're all about my cousin my uncle Tim though. I don't know about his farm house. No you didn't no you went to my uncle Mike's house

350
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,440
My uncle Tim has a whole fucking farm

351
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:34,160
But now that you ask about that shit or give a fuck about my farm experience or care

352
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:41,040
I've fucking seen different kinds of animals give birth and I've seen their milk and shit. I'm gonna clean all that out

353
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,720
So you never ask about that?

354
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,120
You just care about it. If I'm

355
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
*Gibberish*

356
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,120
*Laughter*

357
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,120
*Laughter*

358
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,120
*Laughter*

359
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,120
*Laughter*

360
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,120
*Laughter*

361
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,120
I've seen every damn animal

362
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,120
on the carousel, in real life.

363
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
No you haven't!

364
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,120
You've never seen a

365
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,120
griffin.

366
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,120
I saw a griffin on a carousel once.

367
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
Yeah, I wrote a hippogriff.

368
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,120
I've taken care of giant sea turtles.

369
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,120
No you haven't!

370
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
Yeah I did!

371
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
No you have not!

372
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,480
They thought you were one of their eggs because of your head.

373
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,280
I got lost in the aquarium for two years.

374
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,000
I had to take care of all sorts of shit.

375
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I used to feed the sharks.

376
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This is a straight up lie.

377
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're lying.

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I used to feed the sharks with my mouth.

379
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You fed no sharks.

380
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,400
I used to shotgun weed into the sharks' mouths.

381
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,880
I was at the zoo recently and the animals were talking to me.

382
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,280
They didn't talk to you through the glass?

383
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,280
Like Harry Potter?

384
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,400
First of all, it wasn't glass that they talked to me through.

385
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,960
They came out and they talked to me.

386
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,240
You are in a very dangerous zoo.

387
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,240
I let them out.

388
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,540
I did the Harry Potter thing where I made the glass disappear for a minute.

389
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,540
So there was glass.

390
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Mmm.

391
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,540
But then there wasn't.

392
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,000
I didn't talk to them through it.

393
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay.

394
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I've been defeated.

395
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Whatever.

396
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Man.

397
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,240
I haven't been to the zoo in so long, dude.

398
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,240
I went to the zoo like two weeks ago.

399
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
I know you went to the zoo.

400
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,000
Did you go to the Bronx one?

401
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Yeah.

402
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah.

403
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,880
I went on a Saturday by myself like a fucking moron.

404
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:13,840
Yeah, I think I think when I when I get older and I like stop I stop having anything interesting in my life

405
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,100
I think I'll probably just get a zoo membership and like go weekly. Yeah, just like I think it'd be

406
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:22,240
I think it'd be cool to be like an old guy who like knows what all the animals are up to and like, you know

407
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,580
You can go like week by week and be like, oh like you can recognize them be like, oh he's play this time

408
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:29,700
He's playing with the ball. He didn't do that last week. You can tell the

409
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,400
Zoo employees and they'll they'll ask you to leave

410
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:39,960
I can't go to the zoo without my mom fucking saying that Rocky quote at me.

411
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:46,680
The one taken to the zoo, our words love the zoo.

412
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:50,200
I've never seen Rocky.

413
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
I've seen it. I sent the picture.

414
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,800
I thought your mom was just saying that to you. I didn't know that was a quote.

415
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Yeah, it's a quote from Rocky.

416
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,800
My dad made me watch four Rocky movies in a row one day when I was a kid.

417
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,800
He was like, he was like this is what we're doing today. It's nice to come today.

418
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Whatever he was trying to do to you, it did not work.

419
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Yeah.

420
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
You ended up a comedian.

421
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:16,800
It was one of those things where like, when you're a parent who has like your kids for like two days every couple weeks,

422
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:23,800
you just are like, we gotta make it something, you know, we can't just like fucking do nothing.

423
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,800
I don't know that experience.

424
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Yeah, yeah, oh, my parents love each other.

425
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,040
My parents hate each other.

426
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,540
Why do you think I ended up in Louisiana, you fucking idiot?

427
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,200
(laughing)

428
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,120
Anyway, my dad was like, every couple weekends,

429
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:40,360
he'd be like, we are watching every single movie

430
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,120
of the worst movies of all time.

431
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,200
So it was like Revenge of the Nerds and fucking Rocky.

432
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,280
- Oh, you watched all the Revenge of the Nerds?

433
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,120
- Yeah, dude, the fucking-- - That's brutal.

434
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,400
That is fucking brutal.

435
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,240
- It was really brutal.

436
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,760
And my dad was like, these are some funny ass bullshit.

437
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,040
- The original, the original's not very good.

438
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
those sequels do not hold up at all.

439
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:05,040
And then one weekend my dad was like, kind of ran out of 80s movies, let's watch extras.

440
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,040
And then we just watched extras.

441
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,040
Police Academy is great. Police Academy 4 featuring Bones Brigade, David Spade.

442
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,040
I pretty much just imagined jacking off during every movie that I ever saw as a kid.

443
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I don't really remember anything about it.

444
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
You imagined jacking off with your dad?

445
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,680
pretending my dad was in there and I was pretending I was in the bathroom and

446
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,260
maybe I had some hand soap.

447
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,800
The things I would be imagining in the bathroom right now.

448
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Oh dude.

449
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
I would be imagining.

450
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,240
I wish I was imagining stuff right now.

451
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,040
I was imagining myself in the bathroom and then that guy had a thought bubble

452
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:43,840
where he was imagining something you know.

453
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,400
One actress who was in the background of one scene of Rocky.

454
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Yeah yeah exactly.

455
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,520
From 20 minutes ago.

456
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:58,080
dude that was a I remember my dad the big thing was that like we never had

457
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,320
anything but like basic cable and my parents got divorced my dad was like I'm

458
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,200
fucking yeah dude I got a spring for all the all this all the Cinemax and the HBO

459
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,360
and shit and then after like five o'clock every night that it would be

460
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,120
caught there be a movie called fuck vampire and Zane sex chronicles yeah

461
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:18,960
- Yeah, shit like that.

462
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,800
- That would be on Cinemax.

463
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,760
- Or like, do you ever see Real Sex?

464
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
- Yeah, my cousins at like 1 a.m.,

465
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,560
1 or 2 a.m. they would play on channel, on HBO,

466
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,880
I forget which one, but it was 206,

467
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,440
where we were from, we used to call it,

468
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,840
me and my friends used to call it channel 206,

469
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,440
'cause it would be a funny game to see,

470
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,960
like to put it on, and then see how long we could watch it.

471
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,240
- Without checking off.

472
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,080
- Yeah.

473
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,880
- Four or five hours, it turns out.

474
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,200
- Yeah.

475
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,700
But then there was another one, like my cousin's,

476
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:52,160
we would like, like when my cousin was like 10,

477
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,840
he would like click to it for like a second.

478
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,240
It was on Zane's Sex Chronicles on Cinemax.

479
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,920
We would click to it for a second,

480
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,160
then change the channel and just go,

481
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,000
(laughing)

482
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,080
like laugh like super hard 'cause he did that.

483
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,760
- Real Sex was fucked up because it's,

484
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,840
you know, you would think that that's a good show

485
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,400
to watch when you are-- - It's not.

486
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,000
- No, 'cause every episode is like,

487
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,560
here's a it's like a journalistic show so it'll be like here's a deep dive into

488
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,720
the fattest people that ever have sex and you'd be like I guess they're naked but

489
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,600
like mm-hmm I don't want to see these butt cracks I watched one of those once

490
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:33,960
when I was like 12 I think I saw a real sex and it was it was an episode about

491
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,240
like like because all those were shot in like 94 or something like that yeah and

492
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:47,720
And there was an episode about like an FMV porn game and they were talking to the developer of the game

493
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:52,680
and like the woman on the screen was like, "Do you want to come to like my fucking fantasy world or

494
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,480
some shit?" And I just remember the guy on the computer like looking at it just like, "Yes, I do."

495
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:04,840
Dude, they always get the worst guys. You know why? Because no self-respecting like hot guy

496
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:10,040
would ever agree to be in like a like real sex unless they're a fucking porn star

497
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,920
you know what I mean the only people they could get for that shit who were like so

498
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:17,000
shameless the most disgusting people of all time just horrible

499
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:23,160
nerds with tiny fucking balls and wieners and they just thought I mean it was bad

500
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,400
dude yeah it was really bad and then they also did you ever see that show bunny ranch

501
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,360
I did yeah so that was like they would just show prostitutes having sex with like

502
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,360
clients and then and they were just the weirdest fucking freaks in the world and

503
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:40,940

bunny ranch. That's rule number one. Yeah that's rule no crap smelling.

506
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,000
No toilets in any of the rooms. They took all that off of like the Cinemax

509
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:11,000
yeah there was like who is like I have to get an HBO login to watch porn now right

510
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,400
you know I mean that is to be the thing that used to be like what you had to do

511
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,300
yeah well that's cuz you could get you could get evil viruses from the computer

512
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,160
right yeah I wonder what the I wonder I wonder if kids nowadays there's still

513
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,420
still there's shows like that for because I feel like there's that type of show is

514
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:34,640
not doesn't really exist anymore it's kind of like made for like 15 year old

515
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:39,280
boys yeah it got it got either those like it got split off into like half half of

516
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:43,560
it is just on the internet now and the other half is like like just Game of

517
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,520
Thrones yeah sure is that type of thing yeah that's a good point I guess they

518
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,840
did when they phase those shows out now yeah now they still make those shows but

519
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,040
They're based on books now.

520
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,800
That's the real difference.

521
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,960
- You started making really sexy shows like Girls

522
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,040
with tons of hot nudity.

523
00:24:59,040 --> 00:24:59,880
- Yeah.

524
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,200
- My roommates made me watch Girls with them.

525
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,760
They've made me watch Girls with them twice.

526
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,640
- I've made myself watch Girls twice.

527
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,920
- Yeah, you're like a huge fan.

528
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,480
I've watched two episodes of Girls

529
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,980
and each time I've been like,

530
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,120
- Black.

531
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,240
- Like I fucking hate this so much.

532
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,280
- It's funny that you're such a Sex and the City fan

533
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,480
and you turn your nose up at Girls.

534
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:21,980
Yeah?

535
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,480
Yeah.

536
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
Why is that?

537
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,480
Cause they're the same show.

538
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,480
It's different.

539
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
Why?

540
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,480
Because Carrie and the girls are in Manhattan.

541
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,480
And they're in Brooklyn, you're right.

542
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
I'm such an idiot dude.

543
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Shoshanna and the girls are in Greenpoint.

544
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,480
Shoshanna? You wouldn't say Shoshanna and the girls.

545
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,480
I don't fucking care to learn Lena Dunham's character's name.

546
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,480
I actually can't remember right now.

547
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
Yeah.

548
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,480
Dude, I've been having such an awful time.

549
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,480
Critter? I don't wanna know Critter's real name.

550
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,480
Critter?

551
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,600
(laughing)

552
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,560
- You've never seen that?

553
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,400
That like--

554
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,300
- Call her Critter?

555
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:56,560
- Somebody on Twitter like compared Lena Dunham

556
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,680
to Critter from those books.

557
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,520
- What books?

558
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,360
- What books?

559
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,180
- What the fuck are you talking about?

560
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,600
- Look up Critter from books on Google.

561
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,440
- Okay.

562
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,600
Crit, Critter from books.

563
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,240
Oh, this guy.

564
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,080
- Lena Dunham looks like Little Critter.

565
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:12,920
- Yeah.

566
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,760
- I forgot about Little Critter.

567
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,600
- Oh, that's kind of funny.

568
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,760
- I didn't forget about him,

569
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,600
but I forgot that was his name.

570
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,560
That was like one of the funniest comparisons of all time.

571
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,040
Yeah, that's a pretty funny comparison.

572
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,160
It definitely rakes up there.

573
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,960
Yeah, top 10 funniest comparisons.

574
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,040
Yeah, that's definitely one of them.

575
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,460
Apples and oranges.

576
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,040
I mean, look at these two things.

577
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,560
Do they have any similarities other than fruit?

578
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,920
Yeah, I think they're sweet.

579
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,760
They're round.

580
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,520
There's plenty of reddish.

581
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,340
That's true.

582
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,820
There is plenty of things you can compare

583
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:46,660
with apples and oranges.

584
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,320
Yeah, they're on the same side of the color wheel.

585
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,900
- Except for a green apple and a green orange.

586
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,280
- Don't even get me started on a green apple.

587
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,960
What a fucking sorry excuse for an apple.

588
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,720
- Granny Smith? - A Granny Smith apple.

589
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,400
- Granny Smith apples are pretty good

590
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,520
depending on the time of year.

591
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:05,600
- It's funny that pretty much every apple is good.

592
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,440
Pretty much every apple is good,

593
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,020
and the one that just sucks ass is called Red Delicious.

594
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,760
- Red Delicious is horrible.

595
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:14,120
- It's a terrible apple,

596
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:17,320
and just the fact that they had the audacity to,

597
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,120
like all the other ones are just like names like the Macintosh. It's also great

598
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,560
that apples are at the forefront of just turning fruit into candy where just like

599
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,880
they have bred these apples like honey crisp apples. A honey crisp apple is like

600
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:36,520
has like as many calories as like Oreo cheesecake. Really? It's just like a

601
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:41,640
fucking like it's like an actual dessert. That's not true. But it's like has way

602
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,040
it's like so like disgustingly sweet and it's so fucking fake and it's the best

603
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
I mean I will eat them at any opportunity.

604
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
I grew up...

605
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,280
Like a Honeycrisp or a Red Delicious Apple, they like, to another apple, they look like

606
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,320
the family from the Hills of Ice.

607
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,320
100%!

608
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Like that's what they are.

609
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,680
You know it's also, it's such a bad sign, like the state of fruit.

610
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,680
When you like walk into the...

611
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:08,680
Listen, you guys hear about this, it's fucking...

612
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,120
Listen, listen, the state of fruit, it's getting out of control.

613
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,320
You walk into the grocery store and like any fruit or fruit should be the same forever.

614
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,940
Vegetables and fruit should be the same forever.

615
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,400
You walk into the grocery store and there's a brand new kind of fruit.

616
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
Yeah.

617
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,400
That is fucking crazy.

618
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,760
Yeah, that's nuts.

619
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Yeah.

620
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,760
And then you get home and it's and it tastes like cotton candy.

621
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:30,760
They have cotton candy.

622
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,440
Yeah, the cotton candy grapes.

623
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,240
What the fuck are these scientists doing?

624
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:40,800
In my hometown, like I grew up like the high school was right next to an apple orchard.

625
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Yeah.

626
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,360
just like go though I think the worst type of the my least favorite type of

627
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:51,160
apple it might be Macintosh just because those are the ones that like we would

628
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:56,840
have the Apple fights with you like you just go to this like fuck you go through

629
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,960
the woods you go through the orchard and you just take whatever apples off of

630
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,880
this guy's like fucking you like a whole fucking farm in the town like the whole

631
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:07,960
town was basically built around apple orchards and we would just fucking steal

632
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,000
them from this guy just pelt them at each other.

633
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,480
It's funny, yeah,

634
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,420
like apple picking

635
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,980
is an activity that you can only do if you're very young or you're very old and

636
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:23,080
any other age it's the worst thing in the world. Yeah, at fucking sixteen, seventeen

637
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,940
you gotta throw them at your friends. Yeah, you throw them at your friends.

638
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:29,680
You try and get the wasps that are flying around the rotten apples to

639
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,540
get your friends too.

640
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:35,820
Yeah. You walk around, you twist your foot in a gopher hole.

641
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,660
That's why I like--

642
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,620
And they have those bars of soap on the tree

643
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,700
that you're not supposed to touch,

644
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:41,180
but you wanna touch 'em.

645
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,740
Like, I don't think you can pick

646
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,780
like Honeycrisp apples, really.

647
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,040
Like, I think you only pick the shitty apples, right?

648
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:47,880
Yeah, I think so.

649
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,700
Honeycrisp, they're probably--

650
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:49,540
Cooking apples.

651
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,500
They're probably like, grown on like a server farm.

652
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,340
Is it Macintosh apples?

653
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,500
Like some indoor thing.

654
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,660
Like a Bitcoin mine.

655
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,140
Yeah, yeah, they're like--

656
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:56,980
A monolith.

657
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,820
Beep, beep, beep, boom, boom,

658
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,500
Apple done, apple picked.

659
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Is it Macintosh?

660
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,780
You can probably pick them online.

661
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:05,300
Is it Macintosh that's like the kinda small one

662
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,620
and you bite into it and it kind of has like a,

663
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,460
it kind of--

664
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:10,820
- A disgusting mealy actual apple taste.

665
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,660
- I don't know.

666
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:12,860
- Yeah, it's like, it definitely mealy.

667
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,020
It's got kind of like a paper skin.

668
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,380
- That's like what an apple is.

669
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,300
It's not like a--

670
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,180
- Like all these fucking cross bread, like--

671
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,100
- Yeah, I feel like I'm eating like an ice cube

672
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:24,940
when I take a bite.

673
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,660
Why is it always cold?

674
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,340
You can leave a fucking Honeycrisp apple

675
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,340
in the blistering heat for hours and take a bite

676
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,540
and it would be so cold.

677
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:37,980
yeah it's like it's like a it's like a uh... uh... burger king milkshake

678
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,100
but it's not a a son of a jackley

679
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,980
yeah it's just not they did the uh...

680
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,620
and cuties to what the fuck they don't have to use our talked about you this

00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,500

682
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,420
i don't want to get back i don't know i don't i don't want to get so mad at you

683
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:53,060
and i don't have this fucking conversation i i don't know if they're

684
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:56,500
the wikipedia page for red delicious and this is how you can tell that you should

685
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,500
not be eating these listen this is the first of that not even the first

686
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,440
sentence

687
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,620
the first is up to the first comma

688
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:05,340
the red delicious is a clone of apple cultogen.

689
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
What?

690
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:12,500
Dude, this is why they don't, this is why no country on earth will give scientists like,

691
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,460
like, will make it legal to like clone humans.

692
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,460
Yeah.

693
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,500
Because they saw what they fucking did to apples.

694
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,820
That's, they're gonna start, yeah, cloning humans and just be like, we're gonna make

695
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,100
a thousand Neil Patrick Harris's right now.

696
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,780
That'll look, that's what it's gonna turn into.

697
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,700
Yeah, and they're gonna taste like cotton candy.

698
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:29,700
Yeah, yeah.

699
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,940
They taste exactly like Froot Loops.

700
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:32,940
Yeah.

701
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,660
It says here that the apple became a victim of its own popularity.

702
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,660
I'm reading the Wikipedia page.

703
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:43,940
There's also a sports section, which is so funny to think about.

704
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:50,700
I never really considered this, but apple orchards, the fucking farmers are probably

705
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,380
cross-pollinating and making their own apples all the fucking time.

706
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:58,580
Yeah, but they're not evil.

707
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
True.

708
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:05,540
I don't know, maybe the orchard I grew up on, or grew up around was like an evil orchard.

709
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:11,540
Like the old farmer's man's, his face falls off and he has a robot body behind it?

710
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,460
I don't want to talk shit about Max Apples.

711
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,460
I hate Max.

712
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,380
I'm on the Golden Delicious, I'm on the Wikipedia page for Golden Delicious now, and they have

713
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:25,380
a picture on this page that's just a picture of a seed, and the caption is just "seed".

714
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,220
(laughing)

715
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,620
- Yeah, but they have this sports thing

716
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,660
and it's like, they have all these inventors.

717
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,660
Shotwell invented the Red Delicious.

718
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,500
- Which even--

719
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,020
- You can get a plant patent.

720
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,860
- Yeah.

721
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:40,680
- That's so fucked.

722
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,660
- See, any fruit Wikipedia page

723
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:46,860
that reads like a viruses Wikipedia page

724
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:50,340
is gonna be a diabolical kind of fruit.

725
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,780
I just think that those,

726
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,140
they must have fucking fluoride in them or something.

727
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:54,980
- Yeah.

728
00:32:54,980 --> 00:33:00,300
There must be some kind of mind control aspect to these very sweet apples and oranges.

729
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Dude, I'm waiting for the fucking barbecue banana right now.

730
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,700
That might be a game changer, dude.

731
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,580
See, 'cause yeah, all these fucking vegan like, like uh, like-

732
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,580
All these fucking vegan.

733
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,660
I didn't mean to say it like that, but like all these fucking like vegan like fruit meats

734
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,420
and like wheat meats and shit, like all these like meat substitutes that they're making,

735
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,340
they're gonna breed like a fucking like, like some type of plant that tastes exactly like

736
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,340
ribs.

737
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,900
You guys eat the 3D printed meat they're doing now?

738
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:27,900
No.

739
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,900
That's where I draw, that is honestly...

740
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,900
I probably would.

741
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,900
Why not?

742
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
That's where I draw my line.

743
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
It looks like fucking yarn, dude.

744
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,900
Have you seen it?

745
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Yeah, but why would you...

746
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,100
I'll eat anything you put in front of me as long as it's natural.

747
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,580
Okay, but you...

748
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,580
I mean...

749
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,580
Or candy.

750
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,940
Both of you guys drink so many energy drinks and you're gonna turn up your nose at that?

751
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,940
Like come on.

752
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,460
Well it's different because that's...

753
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
It's not different.

754
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,780
An energy drink is like actively destroying your insides probably.

755
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,900
No

756
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,020
Yes

757
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:02,700
You you saying Patrick specifically you saying you'll put eat anything put in front of you as long as it's natural is like I can't let

758
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,540
That slide yeah

759
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,020
That's not acceptable every day you drink an energy drink. That's called like

760
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,700
the KKK

761
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:26,500
It's a knockoff of red called white hood. I've been switching. I've been switching from energy drinks to energy sparkling waters. Oh

762
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:34,360
In my head that's healthier. Yeah, it's probably not I don't know what Taurine is

763
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,360
I don't know I should have that much

764
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,660
Honest anything that's like also artificial but they're like this is the healthier version of it

765
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:47,860
I like it's absolutely more like less healthy. I just haven't discovered it yet. Yeah, it's like diet soda. Yeah

766
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,440
It's like yeah exactly. Evil dude. All that shit is just fucking... dude I remember

767
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,080
when I was in LA and I was drinking like Coke Zero all the time like I

768
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:02,720
would drink like four of them a day my leg would just hurt every time I had one

769
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,740
like my left leg would just hurt so bad. I do remember you talking about that. And I was just like well

770
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:14,040
fucking what comes with the territory I guess of being the greatest Coke Zero

771
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:20,560
It's so fucking funny that I drink all these like energy drinks now because

772
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,200
literally like in high school I learned about aspartame and like like

773
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,600
aspartame giving you cancer and shit and I was like fuck that shit I will never

774
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:37,540
like I didn't drink energy drinks until I was like 20. Yeah the thing is... I didn't do

775
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:42,420
any of that shit till I turned 20 when it's like not like like not even

776
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,340
fucking like when you're a kid and you're drinking energy drinks it's like kind of

777
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:49,740
cool but then when you're like 20 it's like what the fuck is that like your

778
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:55,860
favorite thing is fake mango flavored battery acid yeah the only thing is

779
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,820
here's the thing cuz I didn't like the taste of coffee too which in hindsight

780
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,700
it's fucking the reason why I drink diet sodas is because the dying of cancer is

781
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,540
to me the third worst thing that can happen in my life the other two are

782
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,820
are number one, get insanely fat,

783
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,940
and number two, not be able to drink any soda.

784
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,780
(laughing)

785
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:22,460
So, that is like, I would rather fucking die of cancer

786
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,300
than have either of those happen to me.

787
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,900
So I gotta go diet, I really have no other option.

788
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,620
I've been forced to do this.

789
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,860
- What do you mean you've been, no one's forcing you.

790
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,940
- I've been forced to be in love with diet soda.

791
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:40,000
- Diet soda, you could just drink fucking sparkling water.

792
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
You could just drink like a polar.

793
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Hmm, sparkling water.

794
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
What is it missing?

795
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,920
Oh yeah, fucking sugar and soda and flavor and Sprite and lemon lime.

796
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,560
Sprite is sparkling water.

797
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,800
What?

798
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,800
Sprite's sody.

799
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,280
That's a sody pop.

800
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:59,440
It's clear like water.

801
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,740
But it doesn't...

802
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,040
But it's not...

803
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,460
You're right.

804
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,800
That is a sparkling water.

805
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
I'm sorry.

806
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,760
Once they figure out how to make ginger ale clear...

807
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,880
Mm-hmm. It's yeah change me clearness is the thing I'm doing this clear is good

808
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:21,960
anything's clear is good imagine imagine a clear Pepsi that's why yeah didn't

809
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,120
they bring that back or do people say did I the ones on eBay that make you

810
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,000
vomit they brought back crystal Pepsi in like 2018 2019 and I drank that like a

811
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:35,240
bunch just tastes like Pepsi right yeah but I liked it cuz it was like oh it's

812
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:40,520
Crystal Pepsi. Because you can fool somebody. Yeah. Yeah, your roommate walks in, "Hey man,

813
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:50,080
what's up?" I'm not drinking Pepsi. I'm drinking a different, like Sprite or something. You

814
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,280
believed me. You definitely believed me. You look at your fucking face, you stupid you look.

815
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,960
I saw it in your eyes. Look at your fucking stupid face. I can tell, the last thing you

816
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:01,360
thought this was, was fucking Pepsi. You're surprised. You're fucking, you're pissing

817
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,400
your pants. I see piss in your pants. Yep, it's your squirt, the Crystal Pepsi. You just

818
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,720
squirt a little on it. Yep, see? You peed! Yep. You pee-peed! And you didn't see that

819
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:13,000
because you blinked while I did that to you. And don't smell it because it won't smell

820
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:21,720
like Pepsi. Just trust me. Oh man. Yeah, they should be making other clear foods so I think

821
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,400
that is maybe a trick to, that might be the next step in tricking people into eating unhealthy

822
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,760
things. That's just aspects, huh? Oh yeah, I guess you're right. Aspects, putting stuff

823
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,880
and clear stuff. You guys see the aspic I sent to the chat here?

824
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,080
Yeah. Picture of the shrimp. The aspic. Yeah. It literally just looks like the thing.

825
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:45,640
Yeah. It has like legs and arms sticking out of it. Dude, I don't fuck with crab at all.

826
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:51,480
Really? I don't fuck with that crap. I like crab. I think crab is the seafood

827
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,920
I've eaten the least. I found too many. Unless you count crab ring boots. I found and smelled too many dead

828
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:02,360
crabs on the beach on Cape Cod like as a kid to like ever like that did not really

829
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:07,640
enjoy crab. Did I ever tell you about that when I went clamming? It's like a dead crab is just

830
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:11,880
disgusting like it smells horrible and the way that it like decays it's just

831
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:16,520
like they're nasty. They're nasty as hell dude. I used to catch crabs with my shirt when I was a

832
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,320
kid. Yeah? Yeah and I was vegetarian but I just thought it was fun and I think that's

833
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,800
probably why I don't like crabs is because I remember my mom like put after

834
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,880
I caught a bunch I would she would like put them in a pot to boil them and

835
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,760
They just make like a like a very loud whistling noise

836
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:39,760
Screaming it's fucking horrible dude. Yeah, dude. I fucking I like caught like a bucket full of clams

837
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,280
Once when I was 11, I just went up the beach that my uncle taught me how to catch clams

838
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,280
So I was like, all right, I'm just gonna do this all day

839
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,240
It's pretty easy to catch clams cuz you don't have a lot of choices

840
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:54,480
All you gotta do, you just dig super fast and you just gotta like scoop up like a-

841
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,720
you'll- eventually you'll pick up like a handful of sand that has a clam in it

842
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,840
and then uh you just throw them in a bucket, bring them home, steam them.

843
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,760
Yeah, maybe I'm a little braver than you but catching a crab is like a battle.

844
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,800
My mom was making lobsters recently and she brought the lobsters home

845
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,120
and she put them on the ground to let my dog play with them before she killed them.

846
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:17,280
I was like that is the most like fucked up like-

847
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,320
That's fucking evil dude.

848
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:23,840
Nicest person I know in the world, but that's the most fucked up horrible thing I've ever seen somebody do

849
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:27,440
Can you have a lobster like a pet? Can you like walk it around and shit?

850
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,340
I mean, yeah, they'll run around if you put them on the ground. One of my friends in high school at a pep rally

851
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:40,840
He bought a lobster and was like pretending it was like the basketball team's mascot and then he tried to bring it out

852
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,640
In the pep rally on a leash and killed it

853
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:51,320
The thing about killing lobsters too is like you either like boil them to kill them

854
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,920
Which is like you know fucked up in one way

855
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,240
Yeah, or if you want to kill them fast you do the fucking you like take a knife you go like

856
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,040
It's not good dude

857
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,920
They do not have a good life

858
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:13,240
Live forever - like yeah, like like it's not kind of there in the matter their misery. Maybe yeah

859
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,200
I mean, you know something is it's not like you can like take a lobster

860
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,200
That's like about to die like they have to be like they gotta be happy

861
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,180
Have you and have you seen like in the fuck every like couple of weeks?

862
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:30,360
Every year there's like a new rare lobster. That's some yeah, some like weird color size

863
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,280
Yeah, like that like a couple weeks ago

864
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:37,400
It was like red lobster had like this spotted yellow lobster that they named freckles

865
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,120
yeah, and there was like a like a like a purple lobster or like

866
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:45,780
Someone called it like a lesbian lobster. That's like the store. That's what the

867
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:53,880
Kill it it's it's Funko pop for 70 year old guys for me. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah

868
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:59,760
That's really like a man like a guy from like fucking Bangor yeah

869
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:08,080
Guy who gets pissed off whenever Stephen King is mentioned because he's like we're not really clowns a lobster I

870
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:15,560
Finally collected the rare lobster. Yeah, I got this one's got spots on it

871
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:22,520
Scream yeah, I fucking I found I'm putting it in my no. No, I don't have too many fucking yeah

872
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:26,500
I grew yeah, I actually grew up with Stephen King. I used to throw rocks at him at school

873
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,480
Dude, wait

874
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:38,120
True fucked up dude. He probably Cindy Lou who he wrote Christine after me cuz I hit him with my car

875
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:45,380
Stephen King young his son his son looks fucked up - oh, he just look he just looks like a nerd Joe Hill

876
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:51,500
Yeah, Joe Joe Hill. That's his pseudonym so that nobody realizes who he really is right and then you fucking look

877
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,260
This could be

878
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,600
Yeah, just like being Jay Leno's daughter, right?

879
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,900
Walking around Hollywood high with that big-ass chin. It's gonna be unlucky, dude, man

880
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,100
I mean, yes, Stephen King young just looks like yeah, just a nerd but like then you see him in a

881
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:14,980
in creep show when I first saw him in creep show I had no idea that was him so

882
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,660
I guess I searched Stephen King as a kid one of the one of the images that came

883
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,540
up as a thumbnail from the Dick Cavett show and the video title is Stephen King

884
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:34,300
I was warped as a child they put him through a wormhole and that's yeah they

885
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,940
give him the idea for the shining dude whatever I was crazy he's the best I

886
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,940
I love him.

887
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,420
Does he have some dark past?

888
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,100
Were his parents evil or something?

889
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,100
He's from New England.

890
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:45,100
True, I guess you're right.

891
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,100
Yeah, that's something he didn't know.

892
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,340
I guess he was like the first one who got out of New England.

893
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,340
Yeah.

894
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,340
Yeah, so nobody really, everybody's like, "Oh, what the fuck?"

895
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:55,580
"Who the fuck is, what the fuck is that?"

896
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:59,420
That's the thing is, if you grow up in, yeah, like a town like Bangor, you're gonna come

897
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:03,860
out, if you're not like, you're either gonna be a townie or you're gonna be obsessed with

898
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,860
monsters.

899
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,220
Like those are the two options.

900
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,220
Right, true.

901
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:11,260
you is like like you just live in you live know what the fuck's going on in Maine

902
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:16,700
yeah you live in creepy creepy world yeah like Maine and like northern New

903
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:20,540
Hampshire northern parts of like New Hampshire and Vermont and then like none

904
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:23,780
of good like Connecticut and Massachusetts and Rhode Island are all

905
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:29,500
like a little bit like cosmopolitan I guess yeah you only have you only have

906
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:37,780
two neighbors and one of them is just a giant dog. Right. Like half of the year I

907
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:41,800
guess I guess it's kind of the same in like the Cape like half of your year is

908
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:47,440
just like you're in some fucking shack. Yeah all the like all the four corners

909
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:53,720
like states of the US are fucking just they're weird. You know what I mean?

910
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:59,000
Like any I think yeah there's something about being like Washington yeah and

911
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:04,160
like like those like it's crazy just how many fucking like gun nuts there are in

912
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:09,480
like Portland yeah and so many senators and presidents in Washington yeah

913
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:15,260
Congress - that's true that shit's actually true that is very fucking

914
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:19,120
stupid that we have two Washington's yeah Washington should be named

915
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,760
something else why should I call they should have called Washington DC at

916
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:27,920
least like Washington plus mm-hmm well I guess that's what the DC is for they

917
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,840
should have called it the capital the capital exactly Washington the capital

918
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:36,000
yeah that would have been a way better name or just I mean just make up a name

919
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,640
dude we also don't need it just leave it just have it be in in fucking Virginia

920
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,240
yeah it's just Virginia that's whatever I don't care let Virginia have it they

921
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,040
don't have anything else doesn't matter well cuz I feel like I talk too much

922
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,080
shit about New England just now yeah let it be known let it be known we love

923
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,080
Best part of the country.

924
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,080
Best part of the world.

925
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,080
Uh-huh.

926
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:56,080
Better than the South.

927
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Better than the Pacific Northwest.

928
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,080
Better than the West Coast.

929
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,080
So you think the South sucks just you wait?

930
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:02,080
No.

931
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,080
For what?

932
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,080
Just you...

933
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,080
I don't know.

934
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,480
We can talk shit about New England because we're from New England.

935
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,480
I'm from the South.

936
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,080
But if any of you fucks try to...

937
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:15,600
If I find out you're not from New England and you try to say some shit about it...

938
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,600
That's right.

939
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,600
New England sucks cock.

940
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:18,600
It's terrible.

941
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:21,080
People love to talk to us and try to make Boston jokes.

942
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:26,560
It's like you better you better shut up. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, there's gonna be trouble your parent

943
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:33,200
You got you better at least have a fucking cousin from like Springfield or something. What unpronounceable block you from?

944
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,560
Yeah, completely people

945
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,760
impossible

946
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,320
doubts

947
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:44,560
To talk shit on Boston, then you find out that they're they're from a town named the hooded Huntsman's Haven

948
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:48,720
White power, Texas

949
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:51,720
There's no white power Texas.

950
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,720
Listen, I don't really fuck with Texas because that's the West. I don't consider that the South.

951
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,720
The South is like...

952
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,720
Texas is the South.

953
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,720
I have love for all parts of the world.

954
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,720
Personally.

955
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:07,720
Yeah, actually, I'm talking about the global South when I talk about the South.

956
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,720
So you guys probably feel really shitty for saying it sucks now.

957
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:13,720
I didn't say it sucks. I just said I have love for all parts of the world.

958
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:17,720
I mean, if you talk shit about Rhode Island to me, I won't care.

959
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,720

964
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Half of your state does not even-

965
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,300
Half of your state does not support the fucking socks, kid!

966
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:52,300
I love being here in New York City, the best single city in all of New England.

967
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:53,800
Makes me very happy.

968
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,800
You fucking take that back.

969
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,800
I love just staying in New England, you know, moving from Boston to New York is a great-

970
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:00,800
If you're a Yankees fan from Connecticut, fuck you.

971
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,300
Are you gonna cry?

972
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:04,800
No, I'm not gonna cry.

973
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,800
Kinda seems like you're crying right now.

974
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,300
I'm not crying, I'm just standing my ground.

975
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:10,300
You have never watched a sport in your life.

976
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:11,800
What are you talking about?

977
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:17,920
The only reason that you should ever go to Connecticut is if you have to pee on the way

978
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,640
from Boston to New York.

979
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:20,640
That's it.

980
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,640
True.

981
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,640
That's a good point.

982
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:23,640
Connecticut does suck cock.

983
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:24,640
Connecticut is a terrible, terrible...

984
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,640
Is that the...

985
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:26,640
Wait, no, that's not...

986
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,240
That's where Rob Zombie lives and he tried to get that skate park shut down.

987
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:31,480
That's where they invented that fucked up clam pizza and shit, right?

988
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:32,480
Yeah.

989
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,480
What are you doing, bro?

990
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,480
What is that, Frank Pepe's?

991
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,480
Yeah.

992
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:38,120
What the fuck is that?

993
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:43,240
Frank Pepe's opened up at the Arsenal Mall and my dad, every time I see him, tells me

994
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,960
that he wants to try it.

995
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,360
And he tells me that they have really good clams there.

996
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:52,400
Frankly, I'd rather be fucking putting my pee-pee on this damn pizza than putting my

997
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,320
tongue on it, because this shit tastes like crap.

998
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,320
Yes, sir.

999
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,320
What are you doing?

1000
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:58,520
Do you want to put your pee-pee on stuff that tastes like crap?

1001
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,760
Honestly, it might be good.

1002
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:00,760
I would...

1003
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:01,760
Does it taste like crap?

1004
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:02,760
Yeah.

1005
00:49:02,760 --> 00:49:03,760
It might be good.

1006
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:04,760
I don't know.

1007
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:06,200
I don't want to talk shit about Frank Pepe's.

1008
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,200
I've had it.

1009
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,200
Yeah? Well I haven't had it.

1010
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,200
I might like it.

1011
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,200
I don't think you would, dude.

1012
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
You don't know me.

1013
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,200
Yeah I do.

1014
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,200
Talk to you every day.

Eat with you all the time.

1016
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,200
What do you mean I don't know?

1017
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:25,200
I know a lot about how you like to eat.

1018
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,200
Fucking dumbass.

1019
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,200
I know you wouldn't like a fucking clam pizza.

1020
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,200
It tastes like shit.

1021
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,200
The thing is about clams on a pizza.

1022
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:35,200
Clams are boogers.

1023
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:38,280
you put them on a pizza it's just like fucking you're talking to your ass

1024
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:41,840
pizza you're talking to right clams seafood for me good as hell yeah oh I

1025
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:47,920
clams some of the best you can have is like Pat has been frozen in time yeah

1026
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,120
that's the other thing is it like boogers are they do there's a reason

1027
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,800
people like to eat their boogers they're salty so like if you could like trick

00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,240
France yeah like you could trick somebody in the thinking that boogers

1030
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:08,920

1040
00:50:54,440 --> 00:51:02,600
Israel and P-Town is like the other like it's like the other quadrant in the in

1041
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:13,320
the like you know the compass. Provincetown is like... it's like... it is dude I was there and I came to that realization.

1042
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:17,440
Provincetown is great because it's if you ever want to see like like the

1043
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:22,440
closest thing to identical twins that fuck each other you go to Provincetown

1044
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,920
and there's a million there's a million like like billionaire gay guys who have

1045
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,320
like perfect they follow the exact same workout regimen and they get the same

1046
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:34,600
like yeah like surgery and they dress exactly the same and then they just fuck

1047
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:39,320
each other it's awesome. You know who has a house in Provincetown is John Waters. That makes sense.

1048
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:45,000
And when I learned that in high school and like we would go yeah like I wanted

1049
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:50,320
to like like see him there I wanted to see his house so bad. Yeah and also like

1050
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:54,920
like the funny thing about that place is they they will put a drag show in

1051
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,040
anything yeah you'll be at like you'll be at a library and then you'll find

1052
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:04,840
yourself you're at a drag show now I was at a I was at I was in Provincetown I

1053
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:09,080
was at like some store with like my ex-girlfriend and we like we're standing

1054
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:13,060
in there and I was like they had like an Allman Brothers tapestry and I like made

1055
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,000
fun of it a little bit yeah why do they have like a fucking Allman Brothers

1056
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:22,340
tapestry and I heard like a like a couple of seconds later I heard like a lady

1057
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,420
like like breathe in and then she left or like she's about to leave and someone

1058
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,900
who's like you're right like what's going on it's like an employee and she's like

1059
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:34,280
yeah I have to go it's just um there's some bad energies in this and then she

1060
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,780
like went outside and just started like meditating it was so fucking weird yeah

1061
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:43,740
yeah it's it's a it's a very weird place you walk into like a like a butcher

1062
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:47,740
and they'll be like we're doing the MF Doom drag show right now.

1063
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:49,740
The MF Doom drag show?

1064
00:52:49,740 --> 00:52:52,740
And you, and by the way it'll be $80.

1065
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:55,740
That would never happen in Provincetown.

1066
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,740
It happened.

1067
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:58,740
They did a MF Doom drag show.

1068
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,740
They did Jackass the drag movie.

1069
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:01,740
That'd be sick.

1070
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,740
They did that.

1071
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:06,740
I think Salem probably has one of the highest like noise pollution levels

1072
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:10,740
during the day in New England because it may not be like a city,

1073
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:14,100
like there might not be like trains and shit running through it but every single

1074
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:19,500
person that is in Salem just feels the need to narrate everything they're doing

1075
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:22,740
out loud. They're all the type of people who look at strangers and go "so I guess

1076
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:27,740
they're playing music in the street now huh?" Everybody doing that to each other.

1077
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:32,060
Is Salem one of those places, I know Provincetown is, but is Salem one of those places where you can just

1078
00:53:32,060 --> 00:53:37,580
fucking have your balls out all the time? No I know Provincetown definitely is but

1079
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:38,780
Yeah. Not Salem.

1080
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:43,100
There was a record store my family and I went to.

1081
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:44,860
I think it was like 13.

1082
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:53,940
We went to Provincetown and my mom brought us in pretty quick because there was a surprise after the store.

1083
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:57,060
I cannot imagine walking around Provincetown with your family.

1084
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:58,340
Oh my god.

1085
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:01,340
We'd be in a lot of trouble.

1086
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:04,460
My dad, there's a place called the Fudge Factory.

1087
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:06,220
My mom and dad made us take a picture under it.

1088
00:54:06,420 --> 00:54:10,300
I bet they thought that was fucking funny.

1089
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,300
So we go like we went in the record store like we're just looking around then we went out

1090
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:20,340
my mom like showed us that they had like this big like paper mache dick in the in the window

1091
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,420
and there was a bunch of like Barbie dolls sitting around it like it was like a pool

1092
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,820
party and she was like isn't this funny?

1093
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,820
It's like yeah.

1094
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:29,420
I don't know why we had to go in the store like that.

1095
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:32,140
There are two different kinds of tourists in Provincetown.

1096
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:36,340
are gay guys who go there because they like it and they feel like it's like you

1097
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:42,440
know and then there's like Boston fucking morons who go because they think it's

1098
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:47,460
like the zoo and they walk around and they're like everybody is fucking dressed

1099
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:54,380
like Borat this is funny as fuck it's very cool what a beautiful city yeah you

00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:05,020

1105
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:25,480

1106
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:34,280
video of every joke he ever did yeah oh come on

1107
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:39,640

1108
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:44,000
anytime he's a lot of Bob's burgers there's a lot of jokes about Portsmouth

1109
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,160
New Hampshire too so I have to I got a show respect to my man Eugene Portsmouth

1110
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:50,640
- I feel like this is the only city I've been to,

1111
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,000
or the only town in New England I've been to

1112
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,660
that feels like the South.

1113
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:55,500
- Really?

1114
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:56,320
- Yeah, kinda.

1115
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,160
- So we got it.

1116
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,120
- Not as far as the people there,

1117
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:58,960
it's just the look of it.

1118
00:55:58,960 --> 00:55:59,780
- Just the buildings?

1119
00:55:59,780 --> 00:56:00,640
- Yeah, it's like a weird,

1120
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:01,960
it feels like it was transplanted

1121
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,080
from like Georgia or something.

1122
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,440
- You would think like Concord would look more like that.

1123
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,280
- I think I would.

1124
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,240
- We should take Caleb to like the Berkshires,

1125
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,360
or like rural New England.

1126
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:13,200
- Rural New Hampshire?

1127
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,020
- Yeah.

1128
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:14,860
- I gotta take you guys to North Carolina, bro.

1129
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:17,960
- Put him on a farm, see how he's gonna fucking react to that.

1130
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,240
I will fucking immediately activate.

1131
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,240
We could run up on the farm.

1132
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,240
You don't understand.

1133
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,240
We could, oh yeah, we, no we drove by it.

1134
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,820
Let's start trying to drown all the baby animals.

1135
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:30,240
We drove by it when we did that stupid fucking video episode, but like the farm that I like

1136
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,360
grew up kinda next to.

1137
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,360
The apple orchard?

1138
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,360
That one?

1139
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,640
No, not the apple orchard, but like in my old neighborhood there was like a guy who had

1140
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:42,440
like his horses run around, he had like this whole like, this whole like fucking farm thing.

1141
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,320
It was like, you'd like grow wheat or any shit.

1142
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,600
And I think it was wheat, I don't really fucking know.

1143
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:51,160
Because I called it the farm,

1144
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,760
but it was really just 'cause the guy had two horses.

1145
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,560
- Yeah.

1146
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,400
- And we used to like feed the horse--

1147
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,800
- That makes a farm, that's fine.

1148
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:58,640
- Yeah, it had like an electric--

1149
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,320
- More than one animal that's not a dog or cat.

1150
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,280
- It had an electric fence surrounding it.

1151
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,880
- So you're saying if you have one cow,

1152
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,880
that's a pet, right?

1153
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:08,720
- Yeah.

1154
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,840
- But two cow makes a farm?

1155
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:12,000
- It's not that it's a pet, it's just that it's not a farm.

1156
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,160
just a house with a cow. I think the requirement is you have to get some sort

1157
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,120
of material, some like Minecraft from these animals. Well yeah, that makes it a

1158
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:24,720
farm to some degree. Okay that's fair, I think that's the second requirement.

1159
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:28,880
Alright, third requirement, you need a big-ass hat. It needs a red barn.

1160
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:35,120
Four overalls, red barn. It did have a red barn. So, well that might be actually a

1161
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:39,360
farm. Broken down car somewhere. Yeah, broken down car that the guy just like

1162
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:43,280
always has he just like keeps unscrewing and screwing the same bolt with a wrench

1163
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:48,760
all day. Yeah I've been working on this Bessie for about 20 years. Covers it with a tarp

1164
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,600
because he thinks someone's gonna drive a hundred miles to come and steal it

1165
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:58,080
somehow like out of the barn. Yeah. Dude. We used to play a game with the the fence

1166
00:57:58,080 --> 00:58:01,520
because it had an electric and barbed wire fence around it. Oh dude electric

1167
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,560
fences I mean. We used to play a game where you could just see. It's a holy grail here.

1168
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:12,000
Who could touch the electric fence the most? Yeah, because it doesn't it's not like it's a low like it's a low shock

1169
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:15,480
It's not like it's not pain like I felt I felt the worst

1170
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,640
What you're if you put your hand around it it just goes like

1171
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:24,600
Yeah, I went I one time my dad all of his outlets in his house were completely exposed

1172
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:26,940
He just like never put on the face plates to him

1173
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:30,400
So one time I plugged in my phone when I was like 15 and I got like

1174
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,620
Electrocuted so bad. I like couldn't remember like the last couple minutes

1175
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:38,400
And that was way worse than electric fence.

1176
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,840
Electric fence is like a hand buster.

1177
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:41,840
That makes sense.

1178
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,760
They're not trying to kill the animals.

1179
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:44,760
They should though.

1180
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,200
They should make one that kills the animals.

1181
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,200
Yeah.

1182
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,720
Because then they'll really learn their lesson.

1183
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,320
Yeah, that animal's not going anywhere.

1184
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:57,040
Is it true that if you pee on an electric fence, your penis turns evil?

1185
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,040
That makes sense, right?

1186
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,040
I mean.

1187
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,040
I guess.

1188
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,040
It would conduct it.

1189
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,040
It's a stream.

1190
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,040
Yeah.

1191
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:06,820
if we tried that or not. Then you did get electrocuted.

1192
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:09,560
Yeah. You absolutely got. It shocked my brain.

1193
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:12,480
You got completely electrocuted. Yeah. Yeah.

1194
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:18,280
God. Well, now I like, now I can't go back and try it because it's not my home anymore.

1195
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:20,480
We'll find an electric fence. And the guy-

1196
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,600
Showing up, a 23-year-old showing up, you're like, "No, I just want to try something. I

1197
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,480
used to live here." I'm actually trying to conquer like the fears

1198
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,560
I had as a kid. So this is like the big one. So if you could just let me touch your fence.

1199
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:33,200
the thing they do in horror movies where you show up to a house and you're like, "This

1200
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,640
used to be my childhood house." But instead of like asking to like look under the bed

1201
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,160
or something, you just go out back and start peeing in the yard.

1202
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:44,400
You walk up and you're like, "Yeah, I actually used to trespass here when I was a kid. And

1203
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,160
I like come back there and piss on shit."

1204
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:52,640
I think the guy got rid of the barbed wire, like the barbed wire fence and like he just

1205
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,920
had like fence posts up. He got rid of the electric fence. Like I think the horses died

1206
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,240
or something but it yeah we like the electric fence was gone after I was like

1207
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:06,900
seven or eight so I never I never got to like never get the true electric fence

1208
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:11,520
yeah I never got to like yeah exactly like that's so sad dude yeah yeah you

1209
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:15,440
missed out I had a friend who lived right next to a farm and had an electric fence

1210
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:21,040
like 10 feet from his house yeah we we would just go up and slap it because we

1211
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,800
didn't really want to like hold it very long but we would just go fucking slap it

1212
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,800
And he turned into a juggalo pretty shortly after that.

1213
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,800
That'll do it.

1214
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:29,800
That's a direct correlation.

1215
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:30,800
I mean, who knows, man.

1216
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:31,800
Yeah.

1217
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:32,800
Yeah.

1218
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,080
I think it probably had something to do with it.

1219
01:00:36,080 --> 01:00:37,080
No way it didn't.

1220
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,800
Supercharges your brain, makes you more intelligent.

1221
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:42,360
Yeah, makes you way too smart.

1222
01:00:42,360 --> 01:00:45,520
The only way to go is down with the clown.

1223
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:46,520
That's right.

1224
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,520
Alright, bye.

1225
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:48,520
Bye.

1226
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:48,520
Bye.

1227
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,520
*sigh*

1228
01:00:50,520 --> 01:01:00,520
