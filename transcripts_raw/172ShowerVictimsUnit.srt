1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,560
- Clapped because Caleb is injured today.

3
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,400
- You stepped up, man.

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,880
- You did step up. - I'm pretty proud of you.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,240
- You're the host who stepped up.

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,160
- Yep. - Step host.

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,280
Yeah, it's disgusting.

8
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:17,120
I tried. - Oh wow.

9
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,400
- Yeah, we gotta really wipe down the table.

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,840
- It's our cums.

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,040
- Ew!

12
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,520
- We did it on episode, it's our cums.

13
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,760
It's not gross. - Ew!

14
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,240
It's not our cum? - It was happened on camera.

15
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,560
- It was DNA. - It's not our cum.

16
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,240
- It was cums that we didn't wipe down.

17
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,080
- DNA.

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,280
That's my DNA.

19
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,520
(laughing)

20
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,200
- Oh, that's pretty incredible.

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,040
- Yeah.

22
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:38,860
- I'm a little bit worried

23
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:40,520
'cause I have had no new experiences

24
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,880
in the last four days because of my neck being like this.

25
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,720
This is the only thing that I can think about right now.

26
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,560
- Yeah.

27
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,120
- Is my neck and how people, when I walk down the street.

28
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,960
- How are you gonna do--

29
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,760
- Especially little kids, they're like, "Hey, hey, hey."

30
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,740
- You're going to open for Adam tomorrow.

31
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:56,200
How are you gonna even do anything?

32
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,760
How are you gonna do any jokes

33
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,400
that don't have to do with the neck brace.

34
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,880
- Man, I'll probably just fucking destroy like I always do.

35
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,720
- Can we sign your neck brace, by the way?

36
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,560
- Oh my God, that's such a--

37
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,440
- Can I get a Sharpie and sign your neck brace?

38
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,640
- Yes. - You're in luck, buddy,

39
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,760
'cause I throw everything that I use

40
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,600
on the episodes down here. - Oh my God.

41
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,440
- Can you lean all the way over the table?

42
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,280
- Yeah, hold on.

43
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,100
(laughing)

44
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,940
Yeah, hold on.

45
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,200
(laughing)

46
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,000
- Okay, hold on, let me.

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,840
Well, it'll be sideways, but that's okay.

48
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,000
- You can stand up.

49
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,640
- No, it's too late, I already started writing sideways.

50
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,640
Oh, this is going to be so...

51
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh, you should have done it around. Oh, that's good too.

52
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,640
Here, let me sign it too. Let me sign it too.

53
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,640
You get the front because I like you more.

54
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,640
What? That's not nice.

55
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,640
You should see what I just wrote and you'll take that back.

56
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,640
And you should see what he's writing and you'll take it back.

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,640
This is just a guarantee that you write something very nice right now.

58
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
What is that? What does that mean?

59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Have a kick-ass summer.

60
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
Did you see what I did?

61
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,600
You gave me a hags? I gave you a hackas. My man. What did you see mine? I'm like I'd

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,800
What does it say? It says Cam plus Caleb with a heart with an arrow through it. Oh, I'm not you had to do a swastika

63
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,800
I was about to do it

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:14,760
I was about to draw a swastika on your neck brace as a prank

65
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,160
So that you don't know it's there and you walk around with your bald ass head

66
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,580
You got cam plus Caleb Hart and a giant

67
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,960
Right up the back they would nobody's gonna touch me though even it I could write anything

68
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,040
I want on here nobody me up. I'm already in a neck brace look at my awesome signature

69
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
This is a this is a great

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,760
Famous, I would write that this is a great lesson for any of our listeners who are maybe far, right?

71
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:47,680
Nazis or something is that if you want to have like here's my message to you if you're far, right first of all f off

72
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
F you, you fucker.

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
Second of all, if you want a good idea.

74
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
This is my message to you.

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,680
That's a big fat thumbs down.

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
I would do two thumbs down but I'm holding the microphone.

77
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,680
That is a double whammy right here.

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,680
This is called the double whammy.

79
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,680
I just invented it.

80
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,680
Two thumbs down by the way, that's a little strong for anybody.

81
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
It's a middle finger plus a thumbs down.

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
That's, I mean, two thumbs down.

83
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,680
That's all your thumbs.

84
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
I would say, you know.

85
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,680
Five fingers down. Could be a new one.

86
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,380
Yeah, five is all your fingers. Yeah, what is ten toes down mean is that a surfing that is not a surfing thing?

87
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:27,720
That means when you're standing oak on the ground. It's a Bay Area, but the bay that they surf in oh my god

88
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,920
But I your bloody brilliant. What does that mean though bloody brilliant? I think the Bay Area is kind of cringe

89
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:38,240
You are you're basically the opposite of this you're in my reach area is

90
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,680
You don't know what fizz is?

91
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,680
And you're talking shit about the bay?

92
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
You don't keep it three thou-wow?

93
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,680
You're being so fucking cringe right now.

94
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,680
Whatever.

95
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,680
I'm embarrassed to even be sitting here.

96
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,680
Just for no reason, I should bring this up, I think it's cringe.

97
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,680
What's that? Pig Destroyer.

98
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,680
Hmm.

99
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,680
What's Pig Destroyer? Just some random thing I thought of.

100
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,680
What is that? But it would be cringe.

101
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,680
*laughs*

102
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,680
Get some barbecue?

103
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,680
My mic.

104
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,180
- You gotta get a new cable. - Godfrey's cursing you

105
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,020
with a bad cable.

106
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,760
- I've switched out this cable a bunch of times.

107
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,520
I think it might actually be my mic, yeah.

108
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,480
- Damn, we might have to upgrade.

109
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,320
- Might have to frickin' upgrade.

110
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
- You guys at home might have to start paying us

111
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,000
way more. - Should we get, should we?

112
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,320
(laughing)

113
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,880
- Guys, it's so sad for you. - 'Cause we pay for these

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
on subscription.

115
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,560
- Yeah.

116
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,760
- These are after pay, for the 400.

117
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
- No, they're not even after pay,

118
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,200
we literally paid every month forever.

119
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,320
- That's what the $5 tier is really for.

120
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,800
- We rent them for $100 a month.

121
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,840
we do it, we have the podcast like the

122
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,200
under the guise of like us doing a show.

123
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,940
But no, it's just a good day for these fucking

124
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,280
spin off podcast under the guise of

125
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,560
just under the guise.

126
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,720
Oh my God. And it could be that it's the

127
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,880
bonus feed. That's the camera.

128
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,040
Oh, under the weight.

129
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,200
That's so smart.

130
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,480
This this.

131
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,520
Oh, this is $5.

132
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,360
It begins.

133
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,800
Thirty five dollars a month.

134
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,320
You can see under the table.

135
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,920
No, no, it's even better than that.

136
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,200
It begins like a normal episode.

137
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,480
Right. But then this camera slowly sort of

138
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,080
pans down right and we see our legs but then we keep going past our legs and who

139
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:12,920
do we see the borrowers yeah where the borrowers are like man you see that

140
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,760
motherfucking shoe the other day that was fucking hitting on the motherfucking

141
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,960
ground like that for the borrower accent

142
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Eddie Thompson.

143
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,960
Yeah, they don't know what walking is.

144
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,960
They drive around that.

145
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,960
The shoe that was hitting on the ground.

146
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,960
Yes.

147
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,680
I guess they would be New York borrowers, so they would have New York accents.

148
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,280
They're New York borrowers in New York.

149
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,560
They be calling stuff brolic.

150
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,480
Yeah, it's mad brolic on the floor.

151
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,480
And on the ground.

152
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,640
It's mad brolic on the floor today.

153
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,160
But I heard there's going to be a crumb.

154
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,840
Yo, I heard there's a crumb shower.

155
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Somebody's heating.

156
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,680
Dude, they be lining up around the block to get a crumb.

157
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Where are you from?

158
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,680
Where are you from?

159
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,680
Where are you from?

160
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,680
I'm from the bathroom.

161
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,920
(laughing)

162
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow!

163
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,160
(laughing)

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,820
Don't you ever come to the kitchen again, motherfucker!

165
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,060
(laughing)

166
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,760
Yeah.

167
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,000
(laughing)

168
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,960
That is sadly how it would actually be.

169
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,800
That is so fucking tragic.

170
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
That would be true.

171
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,480
It is tragic as fuck, but that is what it would be like.

172
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,680
- You know what the borrowers don't realize?

173
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,520
- What?

174
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,640
- Is that if the kitchen and the bathroom borrowers

175
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,520
got over their differences and teamed up,

176
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,200
they could fucking take down the CEO boardroom borrowers.

177
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,760
- Oh my fucking God, you're right.

178
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,600
- 1% of borrowers.

179
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,280
- The people who are way up on the first floor.

180
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,480
- Yeah, exactly.

181
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,320
- The penthouse.

182
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,160
- The kitchen table.

183
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,000
(laughing)

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,400
Damn, the kitchen table's C-suite,

185
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
looking down on all the other little borrowers.

186
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,920
- Their little suit.

187
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,280
- Look at them walking their dust bunnies around and shit.

188
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:00,240
- Disgusting, none of them know what it's like

189
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,080
to look at a big apple on the table.

190
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
- You ain't never had a crumb fresh off the plate.

191
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,960
Straight from the plate, you have 'em on the ground, man.

192
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,720
- He's got like a sprig of rosemary in his office.

193
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,120
- Just doing backstroke in the kitchen sink.

194
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,360
- Oh my God. - Oh my God.

195
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,400
- That's pissing me off just fucking thinking about it.

196
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,920
- Dude, they are disgusting, right?

197
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,040
- I fucking hate the top 1% of borrowers.

198
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,200
- Me too, they get to watch the TV like this.

199
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,840
- Occupied living room!

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,480
- Yeah, occupy under the couch.

201
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,380
That was a powerful movement.

202
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,880
It was a powerful ass movement for the borrowers.

203
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,720
Yeah, 'cause that's true.

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,540
Under the couch borrowers,

205
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,000
they get all the change in the cushions.

206
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,840
Yeah, exactly.

207
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,320
And a coin to a borrower, that's the size of the moon.

208
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,080
A coin to a borrower is the table.

209
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,440
That's a table, a rich expensive table.

210
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,080
That's a table that you put on top of a piece of dice.

211
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,800
Yeah, a piece of dice.

212
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,640
A piece of dice.

213
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Can you imagine a rich borrower's house,

214
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,480
just the kind of stuff that would be in there?

215
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,280
Oh my fucking God, string.

216
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,960
Just like a mounted--

217
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,800
Lots of string.

218
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,640
(laughing)

219
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,480
String everywhere.

220
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,920
A mounted ant head sitting on top of the fireplace.

221
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,360
Right? Just looking like that.

222
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
Yeah, we caught that one.

223
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,080
Me and the boys on an exhibition down into the garage.

224
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,760
A spider skin rug.

225
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,520
Oh my God.

226
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,640
Or a bee.

227
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,920
Yeah, a full bee.

228
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah, pet.

229
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,480
Oh my God, you're not allowed to have a bee?

230
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,000
I know a guy who...

231
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,400
So I own a bee.

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,600
You better watch out, you're going to get raided.

233
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:27,600
See, that's what would be even worse about the borrowers is the police would be even worse.

234
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,200
Oh my god, police borrowers?

235
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,840
That'd be awful.

236
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,360
The police are already, you know what they should call

237
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,600
the police in the borrower nation?

238
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,720
The stealers.

239
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,560
Yep.

240
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,400
'Cause they don't borrow, they steal.

241
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,220
They take.

242
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,060
They takers.

243
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,160
They take permanently.

244
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

245
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,820
Take her permanently.

246
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,660
Permanently.

247
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,500
Yeah.

248
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,560
If you guys were borrowers, what room would you be from?

249
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,400
Straight up.

250
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,240
Kitchen probably.

251
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
For me, the man cave.

252
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,240
Damn, actually I would have to rep the man cave as well.

253
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,240
I would have to rep the man cave as well.

254
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,080
I'd probably move.

255
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,920
Man cave nation?

256
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,480
- I probably moved to the man cave after my shit got--

257
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,600
- Straight live from the underground, from the man cave.

258
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,200
- Can you imagine though, if you were a bedroom borrower

259
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,320
and you were the one who had to live in the carpet

260
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,600
that got a cum in it?

261
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,080
- Yeah, that would suck.

262
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,920
You know what would suck?

263
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,680
Is if you're the bedroom borrower

264
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,800
and you're living in the underwear drawer

265
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,520
and you gotta live next to that stinky vibrator.

266
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,280
- Yeah, I actually would--

267
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:22,720
- Yeah, and you're so stupid and small,

268
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,280
you think it's a roller coaster.

269
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,600
- You shit on that thing, you sit on that like

270
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,720
- It's a fucking rodeo horse, whatever that thing's called.

271
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,480
- The bedroom borrowers, they're like a...

272
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,400
- What? - Mechanical bull.

273
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,680
- Mechanical bull.

274
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,600
- Rodeo horse, all right.

275
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,440
- The bedroom borrowers, they're like the hillbillies,

276
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,880
they're sitting on their porch on little rocking chairs

277
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,720
and there's two guys sitting together and they're like,

278
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,680
storm's coming, and then in the sky they hear

279
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
a thundering noise, ah, ah, ah!

280
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,720
- They got a banjo. - And a white rain.

281
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,720
God help you if you live where the lady's a squirter.

282
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,120
You might as well live in Seattle, dude.

283
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,960
They got a fucking--

284
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:07,640
Oh, we got six millimeters of squirt this year.

285
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,440
They make a rain jacket out of the remnants

286
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,480
of a used condom.

287
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,720
Oh, okay, well that would actually work pretty well, actually.

288
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,440
That would actually, that's a good idea.

289
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,320
Yeah, no, that's actually a wonderful idea.

290
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,440
You have a borrower's mind, my friend.

291
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,320
You do have a borrower's mind.

292
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,320
That's true. I do have, I was, I am part borrower.

293
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,880
Imagine going up to the toilet like it's a volcano.

294
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,720
Oh my god.

295
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,540
Wow.

296
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,380
That's flushed away though.

297
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,220
Hopefully, yeah.

298
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:32,040
And you're, and you are.

299
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,520
That's you're thinking more mice.

300
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,360
No, no, no, no.

301
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,520
Imagine he puts you under your hat

302
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,680
and you make an M.D. on all that fucking food.

303
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,800
Come on.

304
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,040
You're on this big train,

305
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,960
you're on this train of thought about borrowers

306
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,200
and you're throwing all this rat shit in it.

307
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,560
Imagine you hanging out with your sister D.W.

308
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
and you doing motherfucking homework.

309
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
Now you're on Aardvark.

310
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,040
Yeah, that's Aardvark stuff.

311
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,760
I thought that they were mice.

312
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,120
No, Mr. Ratburn, the gay guy is a rat.

313
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,280
Okay, well that's fucking--

314
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,880
That's kind of crazy, though.

315
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,560
They were like, hey, here's a--

316
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm a gay rat.

317
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,920
We're making the one rat the gay guy.

318
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,040
I think, you know, what I will say,

319
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,080
I think that's fair, but also I'm not sure

320
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,440
that you could call a gay guy any animal

321
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,120
and it would be a compliment.

322
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:10,960
I don't think that--

323
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,940
A unicorn?

324
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:14,440
(laughing)

325
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,000
They might like that.

326
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,880
I'm not sure there's any animal you could pick

327
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,360
from that show to be gay that--

328
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,200
- Are you kidding?

329
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,520
- Gay guys, gay guys, sound off in the Patreon comments.

330
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,560
What animal are you?

331
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,660
- Gay guys call themselves different types of animals

332
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,500
all the time.

333
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,280
- Yeah, they say bears, otters, twink.

334
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,080
- They don't have any of those on the show though.

335
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,360
It's rats and mice and aardvarks.

336
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,000
- No, they got a bear on Arthur.

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
- Who's the bear?

338
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
- Then they have a binky.

339
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,000
- Berry.

340
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,160
- What animal's he?

341
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,000
- Binky is a bear.

342
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,820
- Binky is a bear.

343
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,660
- He's not a bear.

344
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,480
- Yeah, that's a bear.

345
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,880
- Look up, search binky, Jubio.

346
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:45,720
- Binky, Arthur.

347
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,540
- Binky, Arthur.

348
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,380
- Tell me this is a bear.

349
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,380
He's a... no.

350
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,380
There's a moose.

351
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:50,380
There's no way this animal...

352
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,380
There's a moose.

353
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,380
There's a moose.

354
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,380
Brains.

355
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh, what the fuck is that, dude?

356
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,380
That's a bear?

357
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,380
That's a bear?

358
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,380
No, oh, his parents are... wait, he's an Asian?

359
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:58,380
He's a bulldog.

360
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,380
He's a bulldog.

361
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,380
He's a dog?

362
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,380
What?

363
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,380
That is not a...

364
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,380
If a dog...

365
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,660
If you showed me a dog that looked like that in real life, I would put it down.

366
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,900
Wait, guys, he used to be nine, but now he's ten.

367
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Oh, that's huge.

368
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Oh, thank God.

369
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:12,900
I think that the only woke character...

370
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,900
Wow.

371
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,740
(laughing)

372
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,940
- Wow.

373
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,900
- Wait, what's the picture next to it?

374
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:20,460
- That actually looks just like him.

375
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,740
- Look, it's the real-life Pinky.

376
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,260
- Wow.

377
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,900
I think the only woke way you could have a gay character

378
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,540
on Arthur is if it was just a human.

379
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,380
- Yeah.

380
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,300
- 'Cause gay people are human.

381
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,620
- They had Matt Damon on Arthur.

382
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,460
- Did they really?

383
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,280
- But they turned him into an art work.

384
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,980
- But they probably anthropomorphized him.

385
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,820
- They did, yeah.

386
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,060
(laughing)

387
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,900
- They made him look almost human.

388
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,740
- They made him look human.

389
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,580
(laughing)

390
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,180
- They made him walk on two legs.

391
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:43,540
- Made him speak English.

392
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,380
Kind of embarrassing.

393
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,040
But no, it should be a human.

394
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,960
Who else is on that show?

395
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,320
Arthur, DW, Binky, Buster Bunny.

396
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,760
Bugs, no his name isn't, it's Buster, right?

397
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,800
Buster, yeah, Buster Bunny.

398
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,640
Yeah, you tripped me up.

399
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,460
What is Francine?

400
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,300
Is Francine a bear?

401
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,840
Is also maybe, Francine is--

402
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,680
She's an aardvark as well.

403
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,200
Who, there is a fucking bear on Arthur.

404
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,040
Muffy.

405
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,760
Muffy has red hair.

406
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,920
Muffy's a gorilla.

407
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,200
What, there's so many confusing animals.

408
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,040
Yeah, Brain.

409
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,120
Oh, oh.

410
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,720
Steven, voiced by Steven Krapter.

411
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,280
Arthur Black Bear.

412
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,280
Who is this? I don't remember this guy.

413
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,280
That's Brain. Brain. Brain.

414
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,280
That was Alan Powers. Oh, that's his dad.

415
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,280
His name's fuckin' Alan. Oh, and May Lynn Barnes was also a bear, I guess.

416
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
Okay. Okay. We all remember May Lynn Barnes.

417
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,280
I don't. Biggies adopted little sister from China.

418
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:31,280
The Chinese female bear.

419
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:35,280
Oh. Um. She can understand what the dog says?

420
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,280
Yeah, there's still a dog in the Arthur universe. Yeah, alright, Ylvis.

421
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,280
Alright, you Ylvis motherfucker. You're the dog named fuckin' Pal.

422
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:44,880
What he's acting like Elvis over here? Yeah, does the dog say true?

423
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,480
You got me on that Wow

424
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,400
Whoa that was cool, I

425
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,040
Think that's a thing that should be touched privately. Yeah, I don't think we should

426
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,140
Just that it I honestly don't give a fuck about anything anymore since my injury

427
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,560
I have been feeling a little bit like that early when I went into that you have you have an air you have an air

428
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,960
of don't give a fuckness a little bit when I when I went into the bodega I give a

429
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,960
fuck activity I moved I moved I went to go get this right and I've been to over

430
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,360
and it hurt a little even slammed it down on the table yeah fuck it

431
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,840

432
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,520
I bent over and it hurt and instead of like just keeping that in I went oh and

433
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,920
a guy looked at me and I was like yeah fuck you man whoa I don't give a fuck if

434
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
You said that?

435
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,880
No, but I mentally communicated it, I think, pretty well.

436
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,640
You have mastered the subtle art of not giving a fuck, I think.

437
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,240
Ain't nothing subtle about it.

438
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
Wow.

439
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Yeah.

440
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,240
Attitude.

441
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
I'll flick you.

442
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,400
If you were, and honestly, now that I've had this realization, I will never eat pussy again

443
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
because that is so disgusting.

444
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
I'm ready to admit it.

445
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,800
You probably have your neck is probably going to hurt.

446
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,520
I bet you miss it so much.

447
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,520
Bro, I bet you fucking miss it so much.

448
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,920
Dude, why do they pretend, why does every, all these fucking ugly guys pretend like it's the best thing in the world?

449
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,420
Mm-hmm.

450
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
Dude, chill.

451
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,420
[Laughter]

00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,420
Dude, chill!

453
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,420
It's okay.

454
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:20,420
It's fine, it's not like, I'm not like, "Oh, that's the best thing." Just chill out, man.

455
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,920
Relax.

456
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,420
It's always ugly guys. You never see a really hot guy.

457
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:28,420
Brad Pitt never was like, "Honestly, I just love eating pussy. I eat pussy for hours."

458
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,420
And if he was, if he was, he was doing one of his funny roles.

459
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,740
funny roles exactly burn after reading yeah exactly he's playing a buffoon yeah

460
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,780
yeah and you'll see girls walk around I there there are girls who they love

461
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:46,060
famously love you can cock snatch no eating snatches there but that's the

462
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,060
same thing that's like eating that's like a lesbian but that's like eating

463
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,380
your own boogers that's like of course you like that yeah I guess who doesn't

464
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,860
like there are girls all women like eating pussy cuz everybody waves their

465
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,400
own farts into their face sometimes.

466
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,740
It's like, that smells good.

467
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:04,940
There are girls who are running around talking about how much they love sucking weiner.

468
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:11,140
Yeah, but they are similarly usually not that attractive and kind of just weird people.

469
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,260
Yeah. Yeah.

470
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:17,660
Thank you. I think anyone who's hyper sexual, if you like, it's not the type of person I like to hang out with.

471
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,820
I'm with you. Yeah.

472
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,940
I don't like I don't know.

473
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,460
I want to be hanging out with hyper sexual bitches all the fucking time.

474
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,220
- I literally wanna be surrounded by 10 dick suckers

475
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,500
at all times.

476
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,580
- You roll up to the club, 10 dick suckers deep.

477
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,100
- Oh my God, I'm rolling my Monopoly dice.

478
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,420
I see the number, I go, you.

479
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,460
- I'm rolling my-- - Today, you.

480
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,340
- I'm rolling my non-monogamy dice, right?

481
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,180
- Yeah. - I'm rolling--

482
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,100
- Oh my God. - Oh shit, I got snake dice.

483
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,900
- It says, yeah. (laughing)

484
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,980
- I guess I'm monogamous.

485
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:47,060
- Yeah, all right, I guess I gotta stay home.

486
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,420
I can't even go to the friggin' orgy that we're gonna have.

487
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,740
- If I had to suck anybody's dick in the world though,

488
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,040
it probably wouldn't be you guys

489
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,660
'cause I wouldn't wanna ruin our relationship in any way.

490
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:57,900
I think that it would... I know we've talked about this before.

491
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:02,020
And I was thinking about this in the shower this morning.

492
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:05,220
This is putting a Pert Plus bottle in your mouth.

493
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,220
I don't think...

494
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,140
You're sucking off your shampoo bottle and you're like, "This is definitely not Caleb

495
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,140
or Patrick."

496
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,140
You're talking up, you're like...

497
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,140
It's gonna ruin everything.

498
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,140
With the swab.

499
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,140
I got you.

500
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,140
We worked so hard for everything.

501
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,140
This is not going to work.

502
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,140
I'm not gonna do it.

503
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,140
I'm not gonna do it.

504
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,140
I'm not gonna do it.

505
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
I'm not gonna do it.

506
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,140
I'm not gonna do it.

507
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
I'm not gonna do it.

508
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
I'm not gonna do it.

509
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,140
I'm not gonna do it.

510
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,900
Is not you guys trust me this is not

511
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,380
It's a bottle of Alberto vo

512
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:38,260
From the fucking Dollar Tree, it's like a heavily. I got a nude body wash damn

513
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,460
I can sniff that on you right now

514
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:45,980
You're lying, and it's purple and when I rub it on my body. I feel like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle

515
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,500
Yeah, that's purple slime. Ooh. It shouldn't be purple a body wash. I know I think cuz it's lavender scent

516
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:56,220
Yeah, it is, but oh my God, he thought I couldn't fucking smell him.

517
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,660
No, I thought I couldn't fucking smell him, but I did.

518
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
What other body wash is going to be purple?

519
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,340
I don't know.

520
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,840
Ketchup?

521
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,340
Mountain?

522
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:02,840
Grape?

523
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:03,840
You think I'm wearing grape?

524
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,500
I'm doing grape body wash.

525
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,860
That's a good-- I'd wear grape.

526
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:09,980
[LAUGHTER]

527
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,660
There used to be-- when I was a kid,

528
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,660
it was like the best smell in the world,

529
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:19,220
this artificial grape-scented sunblock that my mom had.

530
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,740
And that artificial grape scent is like--

531
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:26,060
Remember there's a good hair gel that you could eat no I don't

532
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:33,540
You were just eating it my friend had my friend Nash he had a he had a

533
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,340
It wasn't really all right. I guess all right. I guess it's southern

534
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:42,100
I was gonna say you make fun of me for having a friend nicknamed chowder all this is his real name was Nash is a

535
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,100
name

536
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:50,740
Potion castle has ruined that fucking name from every time I hear it now. I think I think it's a fake name

537
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:56,740
Nash Greer. We all like Nash Greer. I forgot who Nash Greer was for a second. I don't remember what that is.

538
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:03,740
And was he the guy who... He was not the one who did that backflip though. He had blue eyes.

539
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:11,740
Beautiful blue eyes. Wow! Wow! His face is small. How many movies has this guy been in? Not that many I don't think.

540
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,740
Can we change that? Sorry I interrupted your story about Nash. This guy Nash, I went over to his house one time

541
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,600
One time is just super super rich he had a he had a pool that they would cover and it would become a tennis court

542
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:29,420
Wow, and he had a he had a a tree house that had inflatable furniture inside of it

543
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,300
It was like a giant like a little apartment. It was fucking crazy like you couldn't afford real for yeah

544
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:40,580
Like fucking broke in this tree house

545
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:48,480
Bathroom attached to his bedroom, okay, and I went over there as a leftist. I think that we should eat this guy's parents

546
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,500
I also think that we should turn his extra bathroom into a soup kitchen

547
00:19:53,500 --> 00:20:00,100
We take his bathtub that's also got hot jacuzzi jets

548
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:05,660
And we bubble that fucking soup up and he was a child that had a his and hers sink in his bathroom

549
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Yeah, and then I went over there

550
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:11,660
Very nice hair, and he would put his hair up, and I was like what do you have and he's like?

551
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,720
"It's this hair gel that you can eat."

552
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,960
And I was like, "What the fuck, that is amazing."

553
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,660
And it was like really sour raspberry flavored.

554
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,480
And I put it, and he squeezed it into my mouth.

555
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,860
- Yeah, I don't think that that was hair gel.

556
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,700
I think that maybe he was using--

557
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,900
- You played out some kind of homoerotic

558
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,820
kind of sublimation, I think.

559
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,100
That was kind of--

560
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,460
- It might have been just some goo that he had,

561
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
but he did put it in my mouth.

562
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,300
- I bet-- - Gummy hair gel.

563
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,540
- I bet it was just like non-toxic, right?

564
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,940
- Gummy, gummy hair gel. - So if it hits in his eyes,

565
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,180
he doesn't turn into a Resident Evil monster.

566
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,220
- I guess it could have been that.

567
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,820
Please don't buy 15 of the Gummy Gummy Hair Gel

568
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,100
Maximum Hold Extreme.

569
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,220
- Please buy them.

570
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,700
- But yeah, I guess now that I think about it,

571
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,300
he might have been making fun of me or something.

572
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,520
Like I was so stupid and poor that he was like,

573
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,940
just making shit up.

574
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,780
- Yeah, it was probably juicy drop pop, dude.

575
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,920
- No, no, definitely I remember that it came in like a big,

576
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,300
you know how like things that are not edible

577
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,260
usually come in a wider squeeze tube?

578
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,100
- Yeah.

579
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,680
- And if it's edible, it's in a thin squeeze tube.

580
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:13,520
you know you have tomato paste, you have stuff like that.

581
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,840
And then the big ones are usually different things.

582
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,680
- He has been going like this for the past.

583
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,240
- And you said it was a big one.

584
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,080
- It was one of these big ones.

585
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,520
- And that's when you're thinking about him.

586
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,680
- I'm not thinking about Nash.

587
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,320
- He's like, oh yeah, Nash had a big tube.

588
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,040
- Maybe he did, it's not my business.

589
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,560
- Nash had a big tube.

590
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,900
- I'll say this, I hope Nash is doing well for himself.

591
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:33,600
I hope he remained very rich.

592
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,440
- I hope he got broke as fuck.

593
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,520
- I heard he lost everything.

594
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,040
I was actually looking him up just the other day.

595
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,880
- No you weren't.

596
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,280
I was looking up to him Caleb's friend Nash

597
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:47,640
He literally did that with him. Yeah, you know he's so easy

598
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
I didn't suck his we were talking about me

599
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:55,240
Pretending to suck dick on a shampoo bottle and then you're like actually I did that one time with my friend when I didn't get

600
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,680
But that thing in my mouth he squeezed it

601
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:06,880
Squeeze tube that he squeezed into my mouth him one stroke

602
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,820
So funny that that was the lead into this fucking conversation I

603
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:15,720
Completely forgot about that

604
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:23,580
Because I was so taken aback by - that I forgot that we were imagining you in your shower sucking off a shampoo

605
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:30,000
Everybody

606
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,800
Caleb, this would ruin everything.

607
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,920
- Everything we've built.

608
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,880
(laughing)

609
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,560
- Our empire would crumble if this was either of them.

610
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,200
- We were about to go mainstream.

611
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
- Well, I think we were on the precipice of mainstream.

612
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,160
- We almost are mainstream.

613
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,480
- That's what I say.

614
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,320
- You don't want mainstream appeal?

615
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,160
- Okay, that's fine.

616
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,980
I think Caleb will go mainstream.

617
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,760
- That sounded really real.

618
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:49,680
- Not really.

619
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,280
- I'm ready to go.

620
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,120
- That did sound kinda real.

621
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,280
- I'm ready to go to Aruba, Jamaica.

622
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,120
That's what we're gonna do.

623
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,720
- Oh, I just wanted to hear you sing.

624
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,720
♫ Oh I wanna take ya

625
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,600
♫ Jamaica, Jamaica

626
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,440
♫ Come on pretty

627
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,600
♫ Not to Jamaica

628
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,800
♫ Jamaica, Jamaica

629
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,220
♫ We're gonna go to Jamaica

630
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,300
♫ China

631
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,140
♫ No China

632
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,980
♫ Not China

633
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,280
♫ We're gonna go back to Jamaica

634
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,120
♫ Jamaica

635
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,960
♫ Not China

636
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,040
- Apparently, I don't know if you guys have heard about this,

637
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,360
but apparently China and Russia are teaming up

638
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,520
to start World War III.

639
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,640
- 'Cause of Brittany Griner.

640
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,980
- Because, no, because of Vladimir Putin.

641
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Don't you hit the "bruh" button on me.

642
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Bruh.

643
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,060
Don't you dare.

644
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
We don't even have one.

645
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,060
I had one installed.

646
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,060
Bruh.

647
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:37,060
(laughter)

648
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:39,060
See, I had it installed right there.

649
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,060
Here, press it again.

650
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,060
Wait, say the China thing again.

651
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,060
China and Russia are teaming up to start World War III.

652
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
Bruh.

653
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,060
Yep.

654
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Damn, I didn't even think that Jubilee could do sound effects now.

655
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,060
Yeah, we have a human soundboard.

656
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,060
Oh my god.

657
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
Why didn't we think about that before?

658
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,060
This is gonna be really bad.

659
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,900
- I'm going to soundboard.com.

660
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,940
- Whoa, did you see the example sentence on that definition?

661
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,780
- What?

662
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,340
- It said, the example sentence is,

663
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,400
bruh, a male friend often uses a form of address.

664
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,780
Then the sample sentence says,

665
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,020
get off the internet and get a life, bruh.

666
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,820
- Damn, why would you choose that?

667
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:14,140
Just say like, bruh, pass me the handshake.

668
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:17,100
Nah, I guess that doesn't make any sense.

669
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,420
That's a lot of nonsense.

670
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,340
- Okay.

671
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,380
- Pass me the handshake.

672
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,220
- Pass me the handshake.

673
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,620
- I couldn't think of anything that would pass.

674
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,460
- You kind of killed that moment.

675
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:26,460
Yo pass me the handshake

676
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,140
Yeah, that's me that hand so I can shake it say that well

677
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:33,900
No, that's like kind of too long and for past me yo, thanks. Oh, that's me. Oh

678
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:37,100
Pass me your thing

679
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:45,400
Talking about a hand get my naked ass over here. Let me get my naked ass over there. So I can shake your hand

680
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,420
That doesn't even mean anything

681
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:56,460
I've gotten to the point in my life where when I go to the gym and I get trained, I feel

682
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:00,460
comfortable getting completely naked in the locker room.

683
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,460
I like it.

684
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,680
I actually like it a little more than not being clothed.

685
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,180
You are going to be a menace when you're 60 years old.

686
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,180
Oh my god.

687
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,180
Yeah, probably.

688
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,220
You're going to be...

689
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:15,620
By the time you're 60 though, they're going to have developed some new way to catch people

690
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:21,420
like you and you're going to go away for a long time.

691
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:24,420
I'm not doing I'm not like I'm not looking around.

692
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,420
Oh tiny fucking penis gonna.

693
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,420
I'm just standing there.

694
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,720
You said you enjoy being naked.

695
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,420
I didn't say I enjoy it.

696
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,920
I said that I'm comfortable with it.

697
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,720
Yeah, but by the time you're 60, I will enjoy it.

698
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,420
Yeah, when you're it's you get a taste for it.

699
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:44,620
You guys keep more and more, you know, you're like a psychopath you kill a squirrel you skin it and then you know by the time you're 30 years old.

700
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,620
I have to kill a gay guy.

701
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,320
I'm gay too.

702
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,940
When I was at UNCW, I remember I saw one of my teachers,

703
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:52,120
I had my first day of class with my teacher,

704
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
and then I went to the gym, and then walked in,

705
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,780
I just met the guy, and he was my teacher,

706
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,940
and then I walked into the locker room,

707
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,840
and he was just sitting there with his balls out.

708
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,680
I was like, you should be able,

709
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,940
they should have a different, for that kind of thing,

710
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:03,780
authority figures should have a different thing.

711
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,000
- They should have a naked room.

712
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,240
- They should have every social strata should have

713
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,520
its own gym. - Definitely.

714
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,760
- Yeah. - Yes.

715
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,960
- Everything except for--

716
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,480
- Teachers' gym. - At the very least.

717
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,920
- Police gym. - But not cultural, only--

718
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,840
- Definitely teachers need a separate gym, yes.

719
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,840
That's like, yeah.

720
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,640
Have you ever seen one of your teachers smoking?

721
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,720
Teachers, honestly, you know people, you know when you're in kindergarten, people are like,

722
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,360
I heard the teacher sleeps in the classroom.

723
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,120
They should because you shouldn't walk around and see your fucking teacher holding hands

724
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
with some hunk.

725
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:36,040
It's always sad when you knew a teacher was single because it's like, you don't have.

726
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,200
It's like, I'm going to have to fill that void.

727
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,800
I'm going to have to step up.

728
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,260
I have to step up and show her a good time.

729
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,420
- You don't have a husband, so maybe.

730
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,120
- Maybe.

731
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:47,960
- Maybe I could be the one.

732
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,340
- Blink, blink, blink, blink.

733
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,020
- I'm blinking my eyes at the teacher.

734
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,300
- Bat, bat, bat, bat.

735
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,840
- You know what, you don't have a husband,

736
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,440
you need somebody to work on your house.

737
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,280
- Yeah.

738
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,100
- You need a worker around your house.

739
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,780
- And if you don't want me to be your boyfriend,

740
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,060
then I will just give you boyfriend vibes during class.

741
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,300
- And I'll throw all these roses away.

742
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,340
- He's my school boyfriend.

743
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,820
- I'll just give you.

744
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,020
- I'll just have boyfriend vibes.

745
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:15,220
Okay, listen, I can either be your boyfriend or I can give you boyfriend vibes.

746
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,420
I tried to be my teacher's boyfriend. I got her a Virginia Tech flag.

747
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,120
Wow.

748
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Yeah, because she went to Virginia Tech and then that guy shot all her friends and I showed

749
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,820
up the next day and I was like, "Check this out."

750
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,320
I remember you telling me about that.

751
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,820
Yeah, I won it at Wilson's Family Arcade.

752
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,520
Whoa.

753
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,620
Yeah, which is a little funny to like, because that was the only school flag that they sold

754
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,420
and it was shortly after the shooting. And it's funny to be like running an arcade and

755
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,980
and then a mass shooting happens at a college,

756
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,400
and you're like, we have to order all those flags

757
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,900
and make them 50 tickets.

758
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,740
- Yeah.

759
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,560
- Because people are gonna want--

760
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:49,400
- Make them really cheap.

761
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,540
- Yeah, people are gonna want those.

762
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,380
- Yeah.

763
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:53,220
- The last arcade I went to,

764
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,680
the guy let us get prizes that was worth way more

765
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,860
than the tickets we had.

766
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,020
And I can't reveal where the arcade was

767
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,460
'cause I don't wanna blow up the spot,

768
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,660
but we are gonna go sometime. - No kidding.

769
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,740
That's not the last one you went to.

770
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,800
The last one we went to was the shooting one.

771
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,640
- Yeah.

772
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,020
- Bro, I went to Dave and Buster's recently.

773
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,700
- I wasn't thinking of that one as an arcade

774
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,500
I didn't get tickets true. I was bullshit. I went to Dave and Buster's recently and

775
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:20,100
I hit the fucking jackpot on that Thanos coin pusher

776
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,820
God, you're strong Dave and Buster's is the only good

777
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:28,180
Arcade because it's the only one so that plate place that we went that was a barcade

778
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:31,300
It was a places either have their prizes or beer

779
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:31,800
Yeah

780
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,860
And Dave and Buster's is the only place that has both and food and as place

781
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,420
I went to also had all those things and bowling - okay. Well, this is the most amazing

782
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:43,780
Is it Fun Spot in Laconia, New Hampshire?

783
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,980
Close to there.

784
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:46,380
It's in New England?

785
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,380
Yes.

786
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,380
And we're going to take a trip.

787
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,380
Fun Spot!

788
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,860
We're going to drive five hours to get to it.

789
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,860
You guys remember?

790
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:54,820
We should go to Fun Spot in Laconia because that's like the biggest arcade on the East

791
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,180
Coast.

792
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:59,460
This one is going to make you scream because they have a VR King Kong game.

793
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,740
They might have that at Fun Spot now.

794
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,820
And they have VR Raving Rabbids Racing.

795
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Shit.

796
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,180
You guys remember when we went to Jungle Rapids in Wilmington and we played, we did a...

797
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,380
Did we do go-karts?

798
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:12,220
Yeah.

799
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,040
Yeah, that was on tour.

800
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,580
Oh, go-karting in Myrtle Beach.

801
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,140
God damn it, dude, it's so funny.

802
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,700
That we live like children.

803
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,500
We have this rock and roll lifestyle.

804
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,740
We went on fucking tour and we rode go-karts.

805
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,540
That is what rock and roll guys do.

806
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,380
That's true.

807
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,640
Dude, I don't wanna go on tour and do drugs.

808
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,740
I wanna do all the stuff I wanna do when I was a kid.

809
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740
I guess it's a lot better that we're not doing cocaine.

810
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,020
Yeah, we're all like, wifed up.

811
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:36,380
We're not gonna go do drugs and fuck hoes on tour.

812
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,220
Yeah, no.

813
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,900
We're gonna go to Myrtle Beach

814
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,820
we're gonna eat is all you can eat seafood buffets.

815
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,460
- We spent so much money on a buffet.

816
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,020
- That is our version.

817
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,860
- I forgot about the buffet,

818
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,680
like it was us and then like--

819
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,460
- We're gonna stay at a beautiful hotel

820
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,100
with a view of the beach, look out the window one time.

821
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:52,940
- Yeah.

822
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:54,540
- And then close the curtains.

823
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,540
- Caleb's gonna throw fake dog poo

824
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,340
out of the hotel window because he got mad

825
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,580
that I put it in his hood.

826
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,420
- And it was there for hours when we went to 100 stores.

827
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,540
- We went to four different stores

828
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:06,660
trying to find an HDMI cable so we could play the Switch.

829
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,500
- Here's what wasn't funny about that.

830
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,320
- Memories.

831
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,320
- No, it wasn't funny about that.

832
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,080
I'm the one who bought the fake dog poop.

833
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,920
- You used it to prank me and then I pranked you back.

834
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,440
- The prank, you have to admit that that prank

835
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,080
was so much superior to the prank we did on Patrick.

836
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,280
- Our prank was that we just put it on the seat

837
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,120
that he was sitting in.

838
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,080
- It was very funny.

839
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,000
- He honestly did think it was real.

840
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,800
At least I didn't think it was real.

841
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,000
- You were coping so hard.

842
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,600
You were coping so hard.

843
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,720
We went to literally like four,

844
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,480
we went to the Piggy Wiggly.

845
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:42,200
I'm trying to impress the people at Piggly Wiggly and CVS and pretend I don't have poop

846
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,200
in my head.

847
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:48,040
See, if you had done that and we were in New York Manhattan, then I would have been embarrassed.

848
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,160
If I was walking around SoHo.

849
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,920
You were embarrassed, you threw the poop.

850
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,600
You threw the poop into the-

851
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,640
You threw the poop so- it's probably the farthest I've ever seen you throw something.

852
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
So I'm wrong.

853
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,120
You threw it from the hotel into the beach, into the ocean.

854
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Past the dunes.

855
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Threw it into the ocean.

856
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Yeah, so keep talking about how strong I am.

857
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,120
And you're so embarrassed.

858
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,120
Especially when I'm in the middle of this funny thing.

859
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
It's not a strength thing.

860
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
It wasn't funny.

861
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
It was a crime of fashion.

862
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,120
It's not funny to make somebody walk around with a fake dookie.

863
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Nobody made you do it.

864
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
You're the one who did it.

865
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
You were walking around.

866
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
You could have stayed in the car.

867
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
You could have checked your hood.

868
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
I could have stayed in the car.

869
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,120
I think I've thought about it a couple times.

870
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,120

New York City!

922
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,400
You guys gotta be the crowd.

923
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,400
Yeah, we are the crowd.

924
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,400
Can you give me like

925
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,400
Yeah, we are being the crowd.

926
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
Yo, Long Island stand up!

927
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,400
Staten Island, what the fuck is up?

928
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,220
- Wow. - Oh man, oh shit.

929
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:25,240
- Wow.

930
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,080
- Oh shit.

931
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,700
Ooh, I gotta say this.

932
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,560
I just got to say this.

933
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,040
So I'm in line at the store wearing my long pants as usual.

934
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,700
And then once I write the rest of that,

935
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,920
it's gonna be really good.

936
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,600
- Oh, that was just one,

937
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
I thought you were gonna be like,

938
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,280
just keep going and be like, yeah, and look at you.

939
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,120
- Maybe I, oh.

940
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,720
- Take a look at me now, guess what I'm wearing?

941
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,160
- My long ass pants. - I can change my whole

942
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,560
gimmick up, I can change my whole gimmick up on stage.

943
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,400
- What's your current gimmick?

944
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,720
- My current gimmick is that I really fuck up

945
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,400
every single time that I do stand up

946
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,880
and I forget most of my stuff.

947
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,960
(laughing)

948
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,720
- That's, you know, 20% true.

949
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,000
- I forget most of my stuff and I get up there

950
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,120
and I keep accusing the crowd of hating me.

951
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,080
(laughing)

952
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,160
- I do feel like-- - And I did that last night.

953
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,640
- How'd it go?

954
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,560
- Did not go well.

955
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,000
- You told them you hate me?

956
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,880
I woke up from a nap, Alex and I were trying to fix the internet

957
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,840
and he said, "I'm gonna go to this mic, do you wanna go?"

958
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,040
And I said yes, 'cause I have a couple shows coming up,

959
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,440
I gotta test some shit out, went to the mic,

960
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,380
got fucking bullet somehow.

961
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,440
- Nice. - Went first.

962
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,000
- That's first. - And I went up on--

963
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,960
- For people who aren't-- - All the civilians at home.

964
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,040
- Yeah. - Yeah.

965
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,240
- I think most of the people know--

966
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,760
- People who aren't comedically inclined.

967
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,800
- I think most of the people know what bullet means now

968
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,440
because of Green Room with Paul Provenza.

969
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,880
- True.

970
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:45,320
- But then I get up on stage,

971
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,520
I've been awake for 30 minutes.

972
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,360
- Okay.

973
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,180
- I get on stage and I say,

974
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,560
"Guys, I just woke up from a nap.

975
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,720
"I'm so sorry, I didn't think I was gonna go first."

976
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,040
- That was how you started your set.

977
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,980
By the way, professional comedian.

978
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,400
(laughing)

979
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,160
That is an entire job.

980
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,120
- My whole job, and I'm still going up,

981
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,920
and I'm still apologizing, right off the bat.

982
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,360
(laughing)

983
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,640
I'm still, it doesn't matter, I go up and say--

984
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,360
- At an open mic where nobody knows who you are,

985
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,440
Nobody cares at all.

986
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:14,720
Yeah.

987
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,880
And you're still going, I'm so sorry.

988
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,440
I'm so tired.

989
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,200
I'm so sorry.

990
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:24,920
And I tanked so bad that I drank 15 beers.

991
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,720
That's a ton.

992
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,840
No, I didn't drink 15.

993
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,360
I drank the equivalent of 15 beers.

994
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,080
In what?

995
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,680
The equivalent.

996
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,240
Dog beers.

997
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
I don't know.

998
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,920
Dog beers would be seven times as many as that.

999
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,320
But my new-- so my old gimmick is that the pandemic actually

1000
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:48,000
fucked me up and I am still a little nervous to do stand up, but now my new gimmick is I'm

1001
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,240
going to go out with the longest pants possible.

1002
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Oh shit.

1003
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:59,440
I'm going up size 36, 51s, Levi's 501s, shrink to fit.

1004
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,400
So once I wash them, once I wash them, actually then the waist has got to be way bigger because

1005
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
it's going to shrink.

1006
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,520
to go up with my 42 56 pants yeah and I'm walking around I'm like you see this

(laughter)

1014
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,680
- It's actually a classic bait and switch joke structure.

1015
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,220
So basically here's how it goes.

1016
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,680
It goes, so guys, some weird things have been happening

1017
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,900
to my body.

1018
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,740
That's how it starts.

1019
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,560
- Okay.

1020
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,400
- I'm sucking this water bottle.

1021
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,900
- So I have been completely, when I wake up in the morning,

1022
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,420
I'm feeling a little nauseous and I'm getting cramps

1023
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,600
and I don't even get my period anymore.

1024
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,820
and I actually recently got an ultrasound

1025
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,660
and inside of my stomach I saw a human infant.

1026
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,540
Yup guys, I think I'm becoming a werewolf.

1027
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,140
(roars)

1028
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:35,260
- And you're saying all of it.

1029
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,420
- And then I turn into a wolf.

1030
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,780
(laughing)

1031
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:41,540
- And my next, the next part of this bit,

00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,380
I'm gonna be sucking off this shampoo bottle.

00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,620
(laughing)

1035
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,300
That it's not my two best friends.

1036
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,420
(laughing)

00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:16,340
awww

1044
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:20,540
and then the final part of the gimmick is that he just squirts the shampoo into his mouth

1045
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:27,540
and then you said it out but that's what you did

1046
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,900
but it's not my new best friend

1047
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:35,420
it's not their kid, it's somebody else's kid

1048
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:39,140
it's not anyone else's kid, seriously

1049
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,740
me when i'm sitting on the toilet and i

1050
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:48,740
i've been sitting on the toilet for a long ass time and i get bored of reading the back of the shampoo bottle

1051
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:50,740
I wonder what this is like.

1052
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:54,740
I already read this thing like two full times.

1053
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
What if I just suck it off?

1054
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:59,740
Hold on, it's not my best friend.

1055
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:03,740
You spit it the first time and the second time you swallow just to see what it's like.

1056
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:07,740
I will say, jizz is probably about as palatable as shampoo is.

1057
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,740
Right? I would put them on the same level.

1058
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:14,740
No, no, no. I think if you heat it up, if you heat it up shampoo, it's probably the same.

1059
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,740
You've never tasted jizz?

1060
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
You've never gotten any jizz in your mouth.

1061
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,740
Really?

1062
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,740
Damn.

1063
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,740
Gay.

1064
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,740
Let's try it right now.

1065
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,740
Yeah, let's try it.

1066
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:32,740
You've never been trying to hit a bullseye right between your eyes?

1067
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,740
You've never been nutted in?

1068
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,740
But you didn't get to taste it.

1069
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,740
I'm really sorry.

1070
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,740
I'm so sorry.

1071
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
I've never been

1072
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,260
- It's never been come to my mouth.

1073
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,540
- You take the shampoo bottle

1074
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,700
and you like kind of like rim yourself with it

1075
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,900
and turn to yourself going, no, no, no.

1076
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,060
(laughing)

1077
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,420
No, no, no, uh-uh.

1078
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,260
- Not tonight.

1079
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,080
- No, no, no.

1080
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,740
You have to take me out first.

1081
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:01,980
(laughing)

1082
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:08,340
- The idea of somebody sucking off the shampoo bottle

1083
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,000
is so fucking funny.

1084
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,380
(laughing)

1085
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,260
- I think the reason I can't do standup now

1086
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:20,340
I can't do anything that isn't thinking about that. Yeah, I can't it's broken my fucking brain

1087
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,340
I can't get up on stage without

1088
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,100
Funny

1089
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:32,660
Yeah, I got the conditioner bottle and the other hand I'm sucking off the shampoo bottle and I'm doing a little voice

1090
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:35,020
I don't it's a conditioner. I'm like, honey. I'm home

1091
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
What the hell is this?

1092
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
I'm like, don't worry, come over here.

1093
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,020
(laughter)

1094
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,020
And you're not my two best friends.

1095
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
Are you with the shampoo?

1096
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,020
Are you with the shampoo?

1097
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,020
And these are shampoo and conditioner,

1098
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
they're not my friend's penises.

1099
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
No, it's actually, they are what they are.

1100
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
You tie, you tie, you tie.

1101
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,020
No, no, no.

1102
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,020
These aren't supposed to be people I'm sucking.

1103
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,020
It's supposed to be.

1104
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
I'm married to the conditioner.

1105
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,820
But the shampoo enticed me at the bar.

1106
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,460
And you tie loofahs to the back of them to simulate balls?

1107
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:12,460
You're grabbing the loofah.

1108
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:12,960
Oh.

1109
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,380
[LAUGHTER]

1110
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:19,100
Yeah, I'm sucking off the shampoo.

1111
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:23,340
But over-- little do I know, coming up behind me,

1112
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,700
the body wash with a shotgun.

1113
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,340
[LAUGHTER]

1114
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:31,100
Yeah, your girlfriend walks into the bathroom one day

1115
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:37,560
It's just like the shampoo and the conditioner both are just dripping little lines of each of them with the loop of hung like balls

1116
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:56,740
I can explain this it's gonna take me a while to explain, but whatever you do before I explain it

1117
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:59,260
Do not go to twitch.tv slash Cameron

1118
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,820
(laughing)

1119
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,100
- Don't look at anything on there

1120
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,740
before I get a chance to explain this to you.

1121
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,700
- Okay, okay, okay.

1122
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,900
Now let me explain.

1123
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,180
So, the shampoo and the conditioner

1124
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,980
are just shampoo and conditioner.

1125
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:13,060
They're not my two friends.

1126
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,500
And they don't, they're shampoo and conditioner

1127
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,820
that do not belong to anybody.

1128
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,780
They don't belong to my friends.

1129
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,980
So, these aren't their conditioners and shampoos

1130
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:22,820
that I took from them.

1131
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:25,220
- The Alexa is quietly playing behind.

1132
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,580
- Birthday, birthday, it's my best day of the year.

1133
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:31,860
Now that we got that out of the way, the loofah is supposed to be balls.

1134
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:32,860
And...

1135
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:36,540
Yes, I know you're thinking, "The loofah's supposed to be balls."

1136
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:37,540
You're correct.

1137
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:39,060
You're right about that.

1138
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:45,380
But, the body wash is mad at me.

1139
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:49,060
The body wash was on his way to come kill me.

1140
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,580
But I was setting off...

1141
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:52,620
He had a shotgun, which was soap.

1142
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,620
Yep, he had a full...

1143
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,620
It's a bar of soap.

1144
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,620
I carved, I whittled a piece of soap.

1145
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,620
It's a bar of soap.

1146
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:00,220
Wittle and looking exactly like a shotgun and yes

1147
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:04,020
I rigged it so that I could pull two little strings and make him waddle over and shoot it at me

1148
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,520
And look and look look at this. I'm getting Eiffel Tower

1149
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:13,440
The shampoo and conditioner we're doing it together don't look at my twitch cuz that's where I'm gaming and that's my

1150
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,520
That's my person to think I made this video for you

1151
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:23,220
There's a clip or I'm playing I'm playing like Minecraft

1152
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:26,300
Like yeah, I hate my fucking girlfriend fucking takes away my fucking shit

1153
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:40,120
Do not go to reddit.com slash the shampoo and conditioner guy don't look at the subreddit I posted

1154
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:42,820
And also that's not my user

1155
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,300
Shampoo and conditioner shampoo and conditioner suckers is

1156
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,460
That's gonna make me laugh right sometime. I unfortunately I think that'd be so funny

1157
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,600
Just trying to explain that on stage it's like no you don't get it. That's the worst

1158
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,340
You can't do anything that is really funny

1159
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:09,980
Anything that's rocks. No. Yeah, you have to do fucking stupid shit about the news

1160
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:15,140
You can't go up and just say so my parents are getting a divorce. I you know I here's a scenario

1161
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:20,140
I'm doing my little play, and I'm sucking it.

1162
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:21,140
Which is what it is.

1163
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,140
And I'm getting snuck up on by the body wash with the soap shotgun.

1164
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:26,140
Yeah.

1165
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:33,140
And some of the suds, the shampoo suds are going down my face, down my neck, down my whole body, whatever.

1166
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:34,140
It's a thing of Irish Spring.

1167
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:39,140
I look like Alexander Skarsgård in the Viking raid scene in The Northmen.

1168
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,140
Uh-huh.

1169
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:42,140
Shampoo cum all over my body.

1170
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:43,140
Just covered.

1171
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:46,500
I fall I hit my head on the corner of the tub I die

1172
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,680
Billy Mays they bring a detective in the detective is like my god the body was killed

1173
00:45:51,680 --> 00:46:00,820
He was sucking off the shampoo and the conditioner caught him

1174
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:07,780
The conditioner caught him yes, but then the conditioner joined

1175
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,820
Lining up the angles and be like wait wait wait okay, so the suds came from this angle, and they're just seeing the body wash

1176
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:20,620
My god

00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:26,700
Just slides our victims unit that's the one time

1178
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,460
Our victims unit that would be such a good show

1179
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:38,160
Showers victim unit and then the tagline of that's like the poster. It's like it's Christopher Maloney. Yeah on the poster

1183
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,140

(laughing)

1188
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:51,880
- The Shower Victims Unit deals with crimes

1189
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,500
that are especially sudsy.

1190
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,760
(laughing)

1191
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:57,700
Could be a very good show.

1192
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:00,660
- And 99% of the episodes are not sexual at all,

1193
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,460
they're all people who fell over in the shower.

1194
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,300
- Yeah.

1195
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,140
- Or like got--

1196
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:07,380
- But then there's one episode where maybe like

1197
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:13,360
30 minutes of the 90 minute show how long is it 45 minutes? I don't know 90 minutes 90 minutes pretty long

1198
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:18,340
That's the 90 minute pilot. It's good. They're doing a two-parter 30 minutes of that pilot is

1199
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:22,100
This whole shower thing that we're just yeah

1200
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:24,940
Yeah

1201
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:30,160
Did you just get a facetime? I got a call from Cedar Rapids. I got a I got a facetime from

00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:55,460
Ring back

00:47:55,460 --> 00:48:00,660
Don't really know what that is so my call somebody and you hear it would play a song

1208
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,860
So my cousin never even I've never experienced that in my life

1209
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:11,000
My cousin has has one still because he wasn't able to cancel it and then the company that did it went out of business

1210
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:16,480
I'm like horizon can't turn it off. So you call him. Why do you call him right now? Okay? Wait?

1211
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,180
I'll call him right now. I will read your fucking number out on the air if it's a fan

1212
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,700
Let's see

1213
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:26,700
His name is Matt

1214
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:29,220
I'll show you guys. This is what happens when you call him I

1215
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,940
I should look this number up because they've called me twice in a row. Why the hell are you calling me?

1216
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:40,780
What if he picks up? He got it fixed? No way

1217
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:47,740
This ain't right. Dude it used to be some fucking Beethoven song

1218
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,420
For real? What if he just picks up? What if he just picks up?

1219
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:54,420
If he picks up I'll just talk to him

1220
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:59,540
It's gonna you're gonna go to voicemail and you're gonna get his it's gonna read his entire number

1221
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:07,380
Shit was so funny for so long

1222
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:12,300
Wait for for 10 minutes. Yeah, you figure out what that number is

1223
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:16,220
But it was yeah, you would call him until like last year and it would be like

1224
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:18,820
What's the famous Beethoven song?

1225
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:24,720
Yeah, it was that one. Really? Yeah, is that Beethoven? I just guess whatever that song I'd think of that as Beethoven

1226
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,880
(humming)

1227
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:30,600
- And he was like, and I was like, why did you say that?

1228
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,800
He was like, I was 10 and I wanted whenever a girl

1229
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,360
would call me to think I was really smart.

1230
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:37,000
(laughing)

1231
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,320
- Oh yeah, that works.

1232
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,160
- That's pretty funny.

1233
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,880
- I miss when you would talk to girls on the phone all day.

1234
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,800
- Ring back, my brother dated this girl.

1235
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,160
- I didn't email, I was never emailing.

1236
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,400
- You ever do AIM?

1237
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,240
- No.

1238
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,060
- AIM instant messenger?

1239
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:50,900
- My brother--

1240
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:52,040
- AIM at the girls with my Nerf gun, pop, pop.

1241
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,720
- My brother dated this girl in seventh grade

1242
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,500
who he broke up with immediately after this,

1243
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:03,500
but he was out one day, and she called every single hour.

1244
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,360
- Wow. - She called the house,

1245
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:06,680
every single hour, and was like, "Get father?"

1246
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,840
- Well, that means she cares.

1247
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:09,800
- Yeah.

1248
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,640
- That means she cares about him.

1249
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:11,680
- That means she loved him.

1250
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,280
- Yeah. - Dude, I dated so many girls.

1251
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,360
- She probably killed herself.

1252
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,280
- She probably did.

1253
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,120
- After they broke up.

1254
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,840
- I dated so many girls in middle school

1255
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,480
that I don't even remember their names.

1256
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:21,040
- Yeah.

1257
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,440
- Well, does your wife know you've been

1258
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,080
dating middle schoolers?

1259
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:28,520
- No, I could have done that to your brother

1260
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,680
and I thought about it, but I said,

1261
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,720
man, I respect Patrick's brother too much

1262
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:34,220
and I wanna hit him with that joke.

1263
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,040
I've been recently thinking that I probably

1264
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:38,280
am losing my memory at a rapid rate.

1265
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,640
'Cause I've been trying to remember people

1266
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,960
who I was like close friends with in middle school

1267
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:42,880
and I can't remember their names.

1268
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,200
- I've been having, I'm sure this happens to everybody,

1269
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,720
but I've been having kind of lightning strikes of--

1270
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:52,160
It's Flint, that's Spark.

1271
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:56,000
That'd be cool.

1272
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:01,840
I've been having kind of Moses 10 Commandment moments

1273
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:04,000
where I feel like God is handing down to me

1274
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,800
the names of people that I went to high school with

1275
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,680
that I completely forgot about.

1276
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,800
I'll just be sitting around and I'll be like,

1277
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:08,920
"Oh my God, Chris!"

1278
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:09,760
Yeah.

1279
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:10,600
I had that on the bus.

1280
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,440
I don't remember anything.

1281
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:12,260
I've had that too.

1282
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,100
I had that on the bus the other day.

1283
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:14,720
But then, is there ever people that you were like,

1284
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:15,960
"Oh, I spent a lot of time with this person

1285
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,560
"and I don't remember their name at all."

1286
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,400
Yeah.

1287
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:19,360
You don't get that?

1288
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,560
Not really.

1289
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:22,500
- There's definitely people whose names I don't know,

1290
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:23,540
but that's 'cause I never knew.

1291
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,060
- But you remember their face, right?

1292
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:25,900
And you've definitely had a conversation with them.

1293
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,580
- Face, I'm really bad at remembering faces.

1294
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:29,780
- I'm pretty good at it.

1295
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:30,700
- I'm pretty good at names. - If I could see,

1296
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,380
I can't picture a face in my head.

1297
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:33,340
- And faces. - If I see a picture

1298
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,260
of them, I could get it,

1299
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,340
but I can't really remember somebody else.

1300
00:51:36,340 --> 00:51:37,180
- I'm just really bad at remembering people.

1301
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,100
- If you turned around right now,

1302
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,940
I wouldn't know what you looked like.

1303
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:40,100
- People were not, you're not meant

1304
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,340
to know this many people, man.

1305
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:42,620
- No. - You were meant to know

1306
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:45,660
40 people maybe, and now I know like 1,000 people.

1307
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:49,240
- My brain was, I think my brain was perfectly made

1308
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,500
for knowing this many people.

1309
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:51,340
- You remember everybody?

1310
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,160
- I remember pretty much everybody.

1311
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,500
- You're the next phase of evolution.

1312
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:54,340
- Yeah.

1313
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:56,700
- I think I just have enough plastic and stuff in my body

1314
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:57,540
that like the names get stuck.

1315
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:58,620
- Honestly, I have more people,

1316
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:02,220
I forget more people from like the past year than I have,

1317
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,940
like there's a bunch of people that I--

1318
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:06,260
- Well just you're at that age now.

1319
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,420
- Dude, if I forget a person's name,

1320
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,340
I feel like a complete fucking asshole.

1321
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:12,380
- Yeah, I go like this, uh!

1322
00:52:12,380 --> 00:52:13,220
- I'm the opposite.

1323
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:14,040
- I mean it definitely is.

1324
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,600
if I don't remember somebody's,

1325
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,740
like the other night when we were hanging out with Dan,

1326
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,920
Dan got a haircut and was wearing glasses though.

1327
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,920
- No, you fucked up.

1328
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:22,080
- I did fuck, I-- - How did you forget Dan?

1329
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,080
- Yeah, I know, that was cut, that was really honestly fucked.

1330
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,760
- That was fucked up of me, and Dan, I'm so sorry.

1331
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,480
- Dan, how could you forget that?

1332
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:31,320
- You can't roll that back.

1333
00:52:31,320 --> 00:52:33,480
- I'm choking up right now. - Amazing smile.

1334
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,720
- His smile is like so precious.

1335
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:39,640
- He had new glasses on and a haircut.

1336
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,560
- And he had the same attitude though.

1337
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,360
- Yeah, he had the same smell.

1338
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,840
I could smell his pheromones and recognize instantly,

1339
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:46,680
this is Dan.

1340
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:49,280
If I was blind or like a shark, I could've known.

1341
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,520
- If I was literally not human, I would've recognized him.

1342
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,960
- If I was a rock, I would've known that was Dan.

1343
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,940
- Dan, that is love.

1344
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,880
That is much fucking love.

1345
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,640
- That's right, Dan. - That is a lot of love.

1346
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:00,480
- But yeah.

1347
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,300
- That also happened to my friend,

1348
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:03,680
my friend Nat grew his hair out,

1349
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,880
and he got a beard,

1350
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:06,640
and he came up to me in a coffee shop and was like,

1351
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:08,240
"Oh, nice shoes."

1352
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,560
And I was like, "Oh, thanks, man.

1353
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,560
"What the fuck are you doing?"

1354
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,160
And I got so scared.

1355
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,400
- Yeah, I think that I'm gonna start--

1356
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,640
- It's scarier when you see somebody--

1357
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,000
- I'm gonna start claiming that I have some kind of

1358
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,760
like disability that makes me forget people's faces.

1359
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,880
- Yeah, face blindness?

1360
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,400
- I think I kind of do have that a little.

1361
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:26,060
- I thought I had face blindness for a while,

1362
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:27,680
but I think what I actually have is a thing

1363
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,840
where you can't imagine anything.

1364
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,300
- Oh, when you imagine an apple, what are you getting?

1365
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,520
- Nothing, I don't see anything in my head.

1366
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,440
- Whoa.

1367
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,120
- When I imagine an apple-- - That's scary.

1368
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,120
- Yeah, I didn't really realize I was--

1369
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:40,000
- You get zero?

1370
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:40,840
- Yeah.

1371
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:43,000
- Dude, you realize that you're less than.

1372
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,340
- I know. - Me.

1373
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:47,160
- Yeah, well actually, here's what's interesting,

1374
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,640
is I realized, I think that's the reason I can read so fast,

1375
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,840
'cause I don't have to imagine anything,

1376
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:51,920
I just read the words.

1377
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,560
- Yeah, I go about one word at a time, very, very slowly.

1378
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,000
- That's why you don't wanna read,

1379
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,080
I've never seen you read an erotic novel.

1380
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,840
- I read a lot of erotic novels.

1381
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,920
I just finish-- - For real?

1382
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,760
- And I just finish writing--

1383
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:03,280
- And that's why you like movies so much,

1384
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,000
'cause I can just imagine a movie any time I want.

1385
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,040
- Yeah. (laughs)

1386
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:06,880
- But you have to watch it.

1387
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,560
- I can see stuff in my head,

1388
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:13,560
like sometimes I get close to the veil.

1389
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,120
Sometimes I'm like--

1390
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:17,000
- You do have to practice it.

1391
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,060
- Well, there's sometimes there'll just be something

1392
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,520
where I think something happens

1393
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:22,180
and I can suddenly see something in my head

1394
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:23,320
and then it goes away.

1395
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,240
I really think I've been chosen by God.

1396
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,080
- I have this thing.

1397
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:26,900
- I think you probably have too.

1398
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:29,120
- God has been pressing down on my head from here to here.

1399
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,480
- You've been getting into the Bible recently, right?

1400
00:54:31,480 --> 00:54:32,320
- Yeah, I did study the Bible.

1401
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:33,160
- How's that going?

1402
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:33,980
Where are you at?

1403
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:36,600
- I have read very little so far.

1404
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,440
- It's pretty boring.

1405
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,260
- I'm gonna take that one home.

1406
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,960
It's actually really not, I mean I'm reading a translation.

1407
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,800
I think one of the translations.

1408
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:42,860
- Which translation?

1409
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:44,740
- Stephen Mitchell, Book of Job.

1410
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:46,660
- Oh, okay.

1411
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:47,860
- And it's one of the ones where it's like a poem.

1412
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,180
I'm starting with the Book of Job.

1413
00:54:49,180 --> 00:54:51,500
- I'd rather read the Mitchell Hurwitz Book of Job.

1414
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:53,260
- You should read-- - Okay, buddy.

1415
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,860
That might actually be the reference.

1416
00:54:54,860 --> 00:54:57,420
- Don't read, you should read King James Version.

1417
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,260
- Yeah?

1418
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:00,300
- That's a serious Bible, dude.

1419
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,340
- LeBron wrote that one.

1420
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,180
- KJV.

1421
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,020
- Oh my God.

1422
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:04,620
- Don't read NIV.

1423
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,580
NIV is like, they try to make it sound

1424
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:12,020
like a fucking, like a YA novel.

1425
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,860
- Yeah, yeah.

1426
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:13,680
- Don't read that shit.

1427
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:16,060
- No, it's so crazy and beautiful.

1428
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,900
- Yeah.

1429
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,720
- The Bible.

1430
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,700
- You're talking about picturing things in your mind.

1431
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:21,380
Picturing an apple.

1432
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,640
I, when I visualize an apple,

1433
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,660
I visualize the most beautiful, delicious apple in the world

1434
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,500
and I cry because I'm allergic to them

1435
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,900
and I can't eat them without my lip swelling.

1436
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,820
- You're allergic to apples?

1437
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,660
- We already did this.

1438
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:33,220
We said his favorite fruit was blue raspberry

1439
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:34,940
and lemon lime and stuff.

1440
00:55:34,940 --> 00:55:35,780
We did it really recently.

1441
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:36,600
- We did it yesterday.

1442
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,440
- See my brain just doesn't--

1443
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,100
- Your favorite food is bubble gum.

1444
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:40,520
(laughing)

1445
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,360
- Yeah.

1446
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,840
I did have some--

1447
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,680
- No but I do have this thing--

1448
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,040
- I had some bubble gum the other day.

1449
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:46,880
I was--

1450
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:47,700
- You have bubble gum?

1451
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:48,540
- I had some bubble gum.

1452
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,960
But it was Sam gave me some big league chew, man.

1453
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,640
(laughing)

1454
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,480
You got really excited.

1455
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,760
- I got so excited.

1456
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,440
I thought you had big league chew on you.

1457
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,840
- Sam gave me some big league chew and I like,

1458
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,240
he handed, the thing is with that,

1459
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,880
there's no real portion size.

1460
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:02,700
- It's so--

1461
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,540
- So he handed me a pinch,

1462
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:04,380
but the pinch was like,

1463
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,200
it filled up half my fucking mouth.

1464
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,800
- It's so funny that people chew.

1465
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,560
- It's like when you chew a...

1466
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:10,400
- It was made...

1467
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,880
(laughing)

1468
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:15,560
It was made to look like old chewing tobacco packets,

1469
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,880
but they don't even make those anymore.

1470
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:17,720
- Yeah, they do.

1471
00:56:17,720 --> 00:56:18,720
They still make chewing tobacco like that.

1472
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:19,560
- Oh yeah, they make...

1473
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:20,960
- Plus it's based on baseball.

1474
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:21,800
- Native American man.

1475
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,620
- Just thick cut.

1476
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,280
- I'm not calling it what it says.

1477
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:25,720
- You're not calling it what it says at all.

1478
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:26,720
- We got one.

1479
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:27,560
- True.

1480
00:56:27,560 --> 00:56:28,380
- Native American.

1481
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,480
I learned something about Native American culture recently

1482
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,040
that I can't remember what it was.

1483
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:32,880
- Wow.

1484
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,880
- So again, just keep going.

1485
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:35,040
- Okay.

1486
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,820
- You should get like a turquoise necklace.

1487
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,660
I have one.

1488
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:40,500
- You should.

1489
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,400
- I had one. - Do you need to go back?

1490
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,240
Okay, if we went--

1491
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:43,160
- I don't think I have it anymore.

1492
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,000
I had one as a kid. - If we were--

1493
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,560
- I had a turquoise and with a rattlesnake rattle.

1494
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,080
- If we were driving through Arizona again--

1495
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:49,280
- My great-grandfather gave it to me.

1496
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,720
- If we were driving through Arizona again

1497
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:52,720
with that same knowledge that you now have,

1498
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:54,640
would you have been going into those gas stations

1499
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,720
and buying just everything?

1500
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,960
- 100%. - You'd be fully decked out.

1501
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,560
- It's like literally a million percent.

1502
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,560
I would be so fucking decked out.

1503
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,480
- That is so awesome.

1504
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,840
- Yeah, so.

1505
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,960
- It's like when me and him go to fuckin' Ireland.

1506
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,880
- I'm also, when we go to Boston.

1507
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:09,200
- I have nothing.

1508
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,200
- You have, well you just don't have to exclude me.

1509
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,800
- You should start wearing a scally cap.

1510
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,480
- That's literally the only trait we share

1511
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,400
between the three of us.

1512
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:19,760
Other than that we're completely different.

1513
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:20,960
We're like circle, square, triangle.

1514
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:24,000
- You imagine him in like a fuckin' Thomas Shelby hat,

1515
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,200
like fuckin' Peaky Blinders.

1516
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,680
- Should I go full Peaky Blinders?

1517
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:27,600
- You should go Peaky Blinders.

1518
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:29,920
- Next episode, if you are not pullin' up here

1519
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,040
in a full fuckin' Peaky Blinders suit.

1520
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,320
I'm a little bit interested in trying out my new style.

1521
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:34,820
Yeah.

1522
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:37,080
I could get a peacoat, right?

1523
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:38,160
Who watches that show?

1524
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,320
What demographic is that show?

1525
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:39,820
My dad.

1526
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:40,320
My dad.

1527
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,600
I watch it 10 seconds at a time on YouTube Shorts,

1528
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,320
where he's like--

1529
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,200
I like when he goes--

1530
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,440
He punches a girl with a cane.

1531
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,320
I like that one.

1532
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:46,820
It's also--

1533
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:47,600
Cillian Murphy?

1534
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,520
He's so cool.

1535
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:49,520
He's very, very cool.

1536
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:50,720
He's the Scarecrow.

1537
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:51,240
Yeah.

1538
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:52,520
And he was a lady in the movie.

1539
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:54,200
When I was in 28--

1540
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,640
One of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.

1541
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,920
What I don't like about that show

1542
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,600
is that there's no earthly way that in,

1543
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,800
what time does that take place?

1544
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:06,000
Like the late 1800s or something?

1545
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,240
- 1980s.

1546
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:08,160
- No, it's not.

1547
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,680
- It takes place in the 1990s.

1548
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:10,800
- Yeah.

1549
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,960
- Takes place in, it's Ireland.

1550
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,280
- It's not the 1980s, it's like the 1920s.

1551
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,200
- It takes place in the 2010s.

1552
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,040
- No, it's like the, it's the 10s.

1553
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,980
- That's what people dress like in the 80s in Ireland.

1554
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:23,640
- The point is, in 1915,

1555
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,600
there's no way you're getting a haircut like that.

1556
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,480
- Yeah, yeah, there are.

1557
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,200
- There's no earthly way they're cutting your hair like that.

1558
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:32,800
What you that may be true, but also a lot of these things are cycles

1559
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:39,040
And a lot of times a haircut you get in 2023 is exactly the same as when you got in 1983

1560
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:44,560
Remember when that was like the the high and tight like the Macklemore haircut was first coming on the scene

1561
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,560
Then Richard Spencer took it down

1562
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,360
Yeah, yeah

1563
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,320
BOW BOW BOW

1564
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
Because people were going my mom

1565
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:51,600
Got one

1566
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:54,320
Got one. No, my mom was like I saw this guy

1567
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:57,200
At a bar last night. I thought he had the coolest haircut

1568
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,040
I asked him like what the style was because I think you would like it. He was like oh, yeah

1569
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,040
It's an old Hitler youth haircut

1570
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:08,320
People were fucking walking around calling that haircut the Hitler youth yeah, I mean yeah, well

1571
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:14,200
Yeah, what but that's like what people were fucking listen like that fella. He already got a mustache. You can leave the hair alone

1572
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:22,920
You can ruin one hair style, and it's a mustache. Yeah, you know you don't get the hair, too

1573
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:28,580
Yeah, you already took down the greatest mustache of all time. Yeah, it would have been legend everybody be rocking

1574
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:32,900
There's the dude the dude from Sparks had it wait. Give me your finger Japanese guys had

1575
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:39,280
The Hitler stash for a long close-up. You'll watch it. He would look so good if we can rock that

1576
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,560
You'll watch a Japanese movie. I fucking hate him so much

1577
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:52,640
Dude you ever seen a you know sparks the band that guy I am gonna flip you off in your face

1578
00:59:52,640 --> 01:00:00,160
Okay, you know I wasn't because of that I just don't want to talk about the band sparks that guy had a Hitler mustache forever

1579
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,160
Yeah, Japanese guys were still trying to make it work in like the 60s. Yeah. Yeah, well they can do that

1580
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,600
Yeah, cuz I think they can't I think they're the ones who really can't do that. Yeah

1581
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,880
Japanese can't do it

1582
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:14,880
Buddy, have you ever heard of the world war two?

1583
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:21,040
But here's an idea I thought of for a name for a parody movie that I just thought of this is like the next

1584
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:27,980
This is gonna be the next scary movie. This is gonna be the next disaster movie. Okay, it is a cuz we've gotten so much fucking zombie bullshit

1585
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:33,000
Walking dead last of us, etc, etc. You look like a huge fan of the last of us right now

1586
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:39,560
You look like the the kid from up. I was about to say you look like a Pixar character

1587
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,040
Yeah, you look like the kid from up right now

1588
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:42,880
- No.

1589
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,700
- You look,

1590
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:45,960
(laughing)

1591
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,180
you don't look human.

1592
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,480
- I look,

1593
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,900
- You look like a fucking egg.

1594
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:52,740
(laughing)

1595
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,560
You look like speedy bulpy.

1596
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,400
- The whale.

1597
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,040
- You look like speedy bulpy.

1598
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:57,840
- I think I could,

1599
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,100
(laughing)

1600
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:02,840
- Guys I'm having so much fun today.

1601
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,640
- A, but it's a zombie parody movie.

1602
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,200
And it's called,

1603
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:09,720
Drumroll, can I get a drumroll?

1604
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:11,200
- That's the title?

1605
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,280
- 28 movies later.

1606
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,400
- Wow.

1607
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:17,520
- 'Cause there's been fucking 28 zombie movies.

1608
01:01:17,520 --> 01:01:18,360
- You know what I would do?

1609
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,880
I would do a pizza parody called The Last of Crust.

1610
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:21,720
- Ooh.

1611
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:22,540
- And it would be the end of the pizza.

1612
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:23,380
- The Taste of Crust.

1613
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:24,220
- The Taste of Crust.

1614
01:01:24,220 --> 01:01:25,200
(laughing)

1615
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,720
- Dawn of the Bread.

1616
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:28,120
- Oh my God.

1617
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:29,960
And then you could do The Walking Bread.

1618
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:30,800
- Yeah.

1619
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:31,640
- And Day of the Bread.

1620
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:32,560
(laughing)

1621
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,400
- Yeah.

1622
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:34,220
- Have you seen this?

1623
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,060
- How many zombie movies?

1624
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:35,900
Zombies 3?

1625
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,720
- Zombies the movie, it's like a musical

1626
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,560
that was on Disney+.

1627
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:39,800
- Oh yeah, I've seen all three of these.

1628
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:43,200
- Joe put that on when we first moved in together.

1629
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,560
Joe put that on and made me watch it with him.

1630
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:48,800
- That is bullshit.

1631
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:49,640
- That's not right.

1632
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:50,480
- Motherfucker.

1633
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:52,480
- He gave me, he said that I could have some of his food

1634
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:53,960
if I watched it with him.

1635
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:54,800
So I watched it.

1636
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:58,320
- What kind of weird transactional food friendship

1637
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:00,200
are you in with Joe?

1638
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,280
- You know him.

1639
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,840
You know how he acts.

1640
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,080
- Yeah, he is a weird guy.

1641
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,480
He is weird.

1642
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,400
Do you ever have friends where you're like,

1643
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:13,960
like both of you, I would probably pay $2,000

1644
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:15,800
if I could have just go into a time machine

1645
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,720
and just watch like one day of what your lives were like

1646
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:19,720
before I met you.

1647
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:20,560
Yeah. Really?

1648
01:02:20,560 --> 01:02:22,280
You know, like growing up and just be like.

1649
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,440
Growing up, how far back are you going?

1650
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:27,400
I've told you a good chunk of stories.

1651
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,640
What's like the most, the crucial boy year,

1652
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:30,600
probably 13, right?

1653
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:31,440
16.

1654
01:02:31,440 --> 01:02:32,280
16?

1655
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,120
Yeah.

1656
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:33,940
Not for me, man.

1657
01:02:33,940 --> 01:02:37,160
I was basically smoking weed the entire time that I was 16.

1658
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,000
- I was smoking so many cigarettes.

1659
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,600
- What grade is 13?

1660
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,900
- Eighth. - Eighth grade?

1661
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,520
- I think I was designing a website

1662
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:45,840
for most of that year. - You would have seen me

1663
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,420
making, yeah.

1664
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:51,000
You'd have seen me, like you'd go summer 2011,

1665
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:54,000
I'm 13, I'm making fucking YouTube poops.

1666
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:57,400
- When I was 13, I think I basically was watching,

1667
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,960
who's that guy who made really terrible sketches

1668
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,440
on YouTube, Julian something?

1669
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:04,080
- Oh yeah, Julian Smith. - I remember him.

1670
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,640
- I was watching Julian Smith and I was like,

1671
01:03:06,640 --> 01:03:07,680
I think I'm gonna do that shit.

1672
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:10,760
And me and Chad would sit and make YouTube videos

1673
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,600
that we never uploaded.

1674
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:15,160
- I think I was probably playing Minecraft

1675
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,000
in eighth grade, playing a shit ton of Minecraft.

1676
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,560
- And I definitely had just discovered--

1677
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:18,400
- And TF2.

1678
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,520
- I had just discovered,

1679
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:21,600
I think I just watched The Usual Suspects

1680
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:23,720
and I was like, dude, movies are fucking amazing.

1681
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:26,520
- That's probably also around where I watched Fight Club

1682
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:28,960
and was like, oh my God.

1683
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:31,600
I think I watched it like 10 times or something.

1684
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,360
- Yeah, I used to watch all that shit so much.

1685
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:34,440
- I said that around the same time.

1686
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,440
- Summer 2011 is when I got in trouble

1687
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,200
for, from the Comcast Corporation,

1688
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,360
for copyright infringement

1689
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,520
because I downloaded Saints Row 2.

1690
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,360
- Damn, I had the same thing for Sniper Elite.

1691
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,080
- I got a letter in the mail that said

1692
01:03:48,080 --> 01:03:51,360
if you illegally download anything anymore,

1693
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,480
you are fucked.

1694
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,560
And then my little brother got us in trouble

1695
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:59,120
for downloading Taiyo Kru's Dynamite MP3 on Utorrent.

1696
01:03:59,120 --> 01:03:59,960
- Come on.

1697
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:00,780
- He got us in trouble again,

1698
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:02,000
so he got us our fourth strike,

1699
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,460
I think it's like six strikes for copyright.

1700
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:05,420
- Oh, that's good though.

1701
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:08,060
You could download everything in five downloads.

1702
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:09,380
- I'm thinking that it's funny that,

1703
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:12,580
but in like, yeah, back in like late middle school,

1704
01:04:12,580 --> 01:04:14,900
early high school, I watched the movies I liked

1705
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:17,020
like a hundred times in a row.

1706
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,020
And it's so funny to think about,

1707
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:20,380
that's like when your brain is like,

1708
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:22,140
it's like Play-Doh, like you're developing.

1709
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,780
You're like, I'm gonna watch,

1710
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:25,980
like I would never watch a movie

1711
01:04:25,980 --> 01:04:28,580
more than like one time a year now.

1712
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,180
And back then I was watching like Fight Club

1713
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,100
like 10 times. - Me too.

1714
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:31,940
- Whatever you did in those years.

1715
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,540
- This is probably not doing anything to me.

1716
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:35,220
- They say whatever you did in those years

1717
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,140
is what you will do for the rest of your life.

1718
01:04:37,140 --> 01:04:37,980
- Yeah, it literally ruined me.

1719
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:40,420
- And I was literally playing Tribes Ascend

1720
01:04:40,420 --> 01:04:43,020
and listening to WTF with Mark Maron.

1721
01:04:43,020 --> 01:04:45,940
- Holy shit, I forgot about fucking Tribes Ascend.

1722
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:46,780
God damn.

1723
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:51,060
- I had a, my mom got me this refurbished Windows XP laptop

1724
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:53,540
and the only game I could run on it was Fallout 2.

1725
01:04:53,540 --> 01:04:55,220
- Nice.

1726
01:04:55,220 --> 01:04:57,180
- So I was playing Fallout 2

1727
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,860
and making YouTube poop music videos.

1728
01:05:00,860 --> 01:05:06,540
YTP MVs. We need to man. I was listening to Block Party. We should restart YouTube. I don't

1729
01:05:06,540 --> 01:05:10,500
know what that is. That band. Really good band. I don't know what that is. I still listen

1730
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:17,300
to them. So. Music wise. No Jermuk Hotel. Yeah I was probably getting into that. Yeah.

1731
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:24,380
And AFI. Yeah. Alright. Well. That's the episode. Let's say Saturday. What do we got? Anything

1732
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:30,340
coming up? I don't know. Are you? Is your stuff already? Saturday the. Are your tickets

1733
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:32,040
already all unbuyable.

1734
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:35,940
Yeah, I mean, I guess there might be some tickets for tonight's show in Providence.

1735
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:40,940
And then next, I guess I can start on like the end of March.

1736
01:05:40,940 --> 01:05:41,940
I think I'm going to Raleigh.

1737
01:05:41,940 --> 01:05:42,940
What are you bumping around, Drew Bio?

1738
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:45,340
I think I'm going to Raleigh to do good nights in Raleigh.

1739
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,940
Do I plug the fucking New York show I'm doing?

1740
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:50,140
Uh, sure. Go for it.

1741
01:05:50,140 --> 01:05:53,340
Okay, I guess.

1742
01:05:53,340 --> 01:05:57,740
Live Forever at BCC, March 11th.

1743
01:05:57,740 --> 01:06:03,740
That's gonna be me, my roommate Alex, and our friend Benny Feldman is hosting.

1744
01:06:03,740 --> 01:06:04,740
Amazing.

1745
01:06:04,740 --> 01:06:09,740
Alex is also hosting, and then I think I'm on Tiny Boys at Bushwick Public House.

1746
01:06:09,740 --> 01:06:10,740
Why are you laughing?

1747
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:11,740
Yeah, what's funny about that?

1748
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:12,740
Why are you laughing?

1749
01:06:12,740 --> 01:06:14,740
Because I'm thinking about a tiny boy.

1750
01:06:14,740 --> 01:06:16,740
Who's doing stand-up.

1751
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:24,740
On the 28th, I'm gonna be at the gym. I'm gonna be running maybe a mile and a half, two miles in the morning.

1752
01:06:24,740 --> 01:06:25,740
Two miles?

1753
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:30,780
two miles. Maybe a McGriddle afterward as a reward if I do a long run. And then I think

1754
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:37,300
I'll probably be headed home, maybe do a little writing, a little research on various topics.

1755
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:41,980
Probably going to eat lunch around two. Then I'll be waiting for my girlfriend to get home.

1756
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:46,260
Once she gets home, I'll ask what she wants for dinner. Then maybe I'll cook some fish.

1757
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:53,020
And then that night I'll probably be on Fortnite. On Tuesday night. Do you guys not care about

1758
01:06:53,020 --> 01:06:57,580
plug? I have just as much a record of my stuff as you guys. Should I just fart into the microphone

1759
01:06:57,580 --> 01:07:06,580
right now? I might be in Boston. Oh wow! I'm gonna be in Boston around St. Patrick's Day.

1760
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:14,660
I'm probably gonna do some shows. Oh and the March 20th I'll be having a road test. I need

1761
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:16,060
to go. Alright, bye!

1762
01:07:16,060 --> 01:07:18,300
(laughing)
