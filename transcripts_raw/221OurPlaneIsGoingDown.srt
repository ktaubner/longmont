1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,200
Hello, hello, hello, Cameron. What is something amazing for you? Okay, I have

2
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:22,320
a gift for you. Oh my God. He's been giving out so many gifts. There was an

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,400
incredible. We'll get into the gift from yesterday in a minute as I'm too

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,920
excited to think about anybody else's gift right now. Close your eyes. Okay,

5
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:35,200
Do I close them too? Hold on, keep your eyes closed. Do I hold up my hands?

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,320
Cameron, I don't want to spoil it, but it's exciting. Do I hold up my hands yet?

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,600
Yeah, hold your hands out. Well, it's not that big. That's a classic joke. Okay, you

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,080
could probably just do one hand actually. Okay, that actually worked. I think this

9
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,120
is because I'm so proud of you in the gym. Oh my god. I got you this very, very

10
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,360
special gift. Wow. And tell the people what that is. This is a free Junior

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:04,400
Frosty for a year with any purchase from Wendy's for the Dave Thomas Foundation

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,800
for adoption. Yeah, and this is a Christmas special. Oops, that Wendy's

13
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,520
runs every year. Guys, I can't believe it either. I can't. I really can't.

14
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,160
Thank you so much. I also got the same gift last night.

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,400
It's don't tell him that, but he was there. I was there because I saw I saw

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,720
the blatant disrespect. There was a disrespect. Yeah, I have a problem with

17
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,700
and here's why I can put it on my keys and by the way, here's why I wanted to

18
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,880
give this to you, Cameron one because I'm proud of you this year. You've been

19
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,820
getting into the gym. You give it your all you're getting you're really you're

20
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,460
becoming

21
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:44,760
you're becoming an amazing man and it's amazing to see you blossom in front of

22
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:50,320
me right as your eldest as your eldest brother. This is an amazing amazing

23
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,600
thing that I've been seeing out of you great is just it's really incredible and

24
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,480
the number two reason is Patrick didn't say thank you when I gave him the same

25
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,760
gift yeah and refused to say thank you and I kept asking to say thank you and I

26
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:05,360
said no. Thank you. He just kept saying no. Thank you, because he just doesn't

27
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,860
and I'd like to understand why that I don't know why that is. I mean I do have

28
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,980
a problem accepting gifts and both compliments and gifts. You know this

29
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,520
about me, but why couldn't you just say okay?

30
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,920
I gave you ice cream. I said okay therapy

31
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,720
frankly, have a problem with. Okay, I gave you ice unlimited ice cream. Yes,

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,920
it's crazy. It is the best gift. It is the best possibly get I limited ice

33
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,320
cream. I just and it's a don't know why even after it goes on your runs out. I

34
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,220
don't even know why I don't even know why that so I'd like you to say it now.

35
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,920
Thank you, Caleb for the unlimited junior frosties for a year.

36
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:54,400
It is going to make me so fat for only okay. So now he's already saying that

37
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,580
yeah. First of all, he said only a year. I'm not yeah for a year. It's going to

38
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,360
make me fat. You're already like a junior for us.

39
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,520
That you don't have self control. Just because I gave you a limited ice cream.

40
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,960
I'm not blaming you. I'm saying that this is a good thing. You're not even

41
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,400
getting fat yet and you're already, you're getting, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,160
I'm saying fat when I mean I'm bulking. You pre blamed me for your, I'm not

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,320
blaming, I'm not blaming, I'm thanking you for helping me with my bulk.

44
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,160
So when I get, when I look, look at me now.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,860
yep, you can go wide. Now I can go wider. He can go wider now, but I have a

46
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,040
bicep dimple now that you pointed out.

47
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:37,180
You I think I was just check attention to his friend's bodies very much this

48
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:37,420
one.

49
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:43,900
We were at the gym and I did this and you went, oh, bicep dimple. Yep. He was

50
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,060
so more excited than I was. You started, you brought it up again. You're way more

51
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,280
excited. I don't even remember this moment. You said this, you pointed at me

52
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,660
what we were doing. He was more yeah

53
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,380
well. It made me excited. It made me excited. It got me that yeah, the beauty

54
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,060
of accepting it is yeah gifts from your and that is my that is actually it was

55
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,940
my new year's resolution. Really what a bicep dimple, no learning to learning to

56
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:16,580
accept compliments and stuff all right. Mine was get a new car. I didn't have

57
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:20,780
any this year. No, I didn't have time to think of it in time. I don't think I've

58
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,120
I'm living like I made a bunch of resolutions, but I didn't make any that

59
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,460
is really powerful. I've been going to bed early, waking up early, reading

60
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,540
every night, going to the gym. Well, those are resolutions, but I didn't

61
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,580
resolve to do any of this stuff. I'm just randomly doing it. He has zero

62
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:36,380
resolve. I'm just doing it on accident. I'm just I literally

63
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:40,500
I just happen to do it. He's actually slipped into the most healthy. If you

64
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,580
were watching my life out from outside like a movie, you'd think that I made a

65
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:46,900
big list on a piece of paper and things I had to do this year, but you I have

66
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:50,180
zero goals. Yeah, you don't give a fuck about any of this shit. I hope I end

67
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,900
this year in the same way I ended last year on the couch on my bed yeah on the

68
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,900
bed. Well, it's night time. I just sleep is true midnight yeah. What are you

69
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,980
going to do? Stay up? I don't say past midnight. What you have one you have one

70
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:09,300
resolution me, which is what is it play play all games play all games.

71
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:17,580
It is a resolution. I don't make the ring a tuxedo all games. In fact, I

72
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,680
girl. If I made any resolution, it was playing no games, but I didn't make

73
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,560
that he didn't make that even if I did, I would be failing it because I'm

74
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,580
playing all games. Yeah, well, so it's a reverse resolution. The reverse

75
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:32,340
resolution is a good idea. You said it reverse unsolution, an unsolution so

76
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:32,580
that

77
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,700
so when you don't do it, so if you don't do it, you did actually complete a

78
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,980
guess. A desolution would just be something like don't eat candy. Don't

79
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,780
don't stop this. Stop that. Yeah, good one. Don't eat poop is a good one that

80
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,100
I have trouble with.

81
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:51,700
I have a little every year. I've never completed it. It's always it always

82
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,000
like I get through January fine, and then you eat one. I'm like

83
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,080
now I can do it. I got a power through here. Come say Margerie,

84
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:06,280
here comes a day. There's all the people, just one crumb, one dingleberry,

85
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:10,760
yeah, all the people eating shepherds pie and cottage pie and you're just in

86
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,800
the bathroom locked under one of the stalls trying to eat their shit. Yeah,

87
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,940
this is a because what can hurt just once just one. I made it through two months.

88
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,300
Everybody's Irish on St. Patrick's Day. You gotta eat it. Yeah, I deserve this

89
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,660
shit. Literally. Yeah, literally. Oh, I went home. Everybody's saying, "Where's

90
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:34,600
Caleb on the last episode?" I went home for a bad news type of situation, but I

91
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,180
took a plane there, guys.

92
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,580
And here's what I've noticed about planes. Here we go. Yeah, so go ahead and

93
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,200
buckle up. Here we go. And another thing about going home, I got a Columbia zip up

94
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:50,640
that I stole from my stepdad. I saw this is my new type of look. I saw this. I

95
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,480
now... You guys both are wearing new things. I now... He has a what? A

96
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,680
heather gray hoodie. He noticed that buckles. You know why I noticed this?

97
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,000
'Cause this is something my dad would wear. So I... What a gray hoodie? Well,

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,560
this exact type of... We got the same damn pants on, motherfucker. No, yours

99
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:07,040
are... Yours are Carhartt's. What's this kind of fabric design called? Damn.

100
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,840
This is called the... Heather. Heather gray. Heather gray. Yeah, heather gray.

101
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,160
but this is what a beautiful name for a woman. It is so it is a hot. If I was

102
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,980
married to a woman,

103
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,420
I would take her long legs, so I become Patrick Gray, Heather,

104
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,900
Patrick Gray. I forgot about him. Oh yeah, that's her buddy.

105
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,540
I haven't seen him in years. So

106
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:32,580
what was I saying? Oh, playing my plane observation right. Have you guys know

107
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,960
well, maybe this is just me whenever I go on a plane and I don't really like

108
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,540
planes that much. I pretend I am fine with them, but I get pretty scared on

109
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,320
them sometimes yeah, and I think the

110
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,620
people the plane people know this, and so they decide to seat me. It doesn't

111
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:53,500
matter if I'm number eight or number twenty eight. If I open my window, I

112
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:59,140
look directly at the wavering yeah, that is is about to yeah off the plane,

113
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,840
and I don't know how this is possible on the plan on the ride up there. I sat

114
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,980
like eleven F and on the ride back. They move the wings yeah. They

115
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,280
moving to wherever I am. How big is the fucking wing? Maybe it's the cheapest

116
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,280
seat. They just put you in the wing yeah, so that you get that nobody wants

117
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,600
we

118
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,140
can't change the wings every flight because they know that nobody wants are

119
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:25,420
the ones where you are responsible for everyone's safety on the plane. If

120
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:31,620
there's a right, I let that is a really good or air marshal those seats. The

121
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,540
worst seats, I hate it when they come up to are you they say, hey, are you

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,120
are you come to the plane?

123
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,020
Are you comfortable flying the plane and landing? I hate it when I fly spirit

124
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,600
airlines and you know that they are barely they're holding that plane

125
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,020
together with duct tape. I suppose spirit they come up to me. They come up

126
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,200
to me with a badge and a gun and they say are you you are you prepared to be

127
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,120
the air? Are you comfortable being the air marshal on this flight today guys?

128
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,560
It's coming. What

129
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:03,040
the big the big commercial airplane crash is coming? I think I think that

130
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,080
every time I've been

131
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:10,100
almost two years. We're going on tour. I know we're going to die. Don't we don't

132
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,220
serious the giant commercial airplane crash that will completely redefine the

133
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,220
airline industry forever. That's a change, change the regulation. Everything

134
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,600
will change things. Maybe we'll get safer, maybe not it's coming. So here's

135
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,580
my valance big bopper buddy Holly.

136
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,920
I really really really is coming. I think so to I almost don't want to get on a

137
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:38,280
plane for the next five years. Not going to be in the States. It is going to be

138
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,840
in the state. What are you talking about? That's the only way anything all

139
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,000
the time everywhere, everywhere else. It will be in Canada. They will be in

140
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,240
Canada. Well, that's still it'll be on air. Still the United States, it'll be

141
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
on air, not Canada, but it'll be a plane from it'll be an air lingus plane from

142
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,920
Canada. I don't like that. It's going to happen in the US, though, because I'm

143
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,160
talking about I think so. U. S. Airline, I think I think it will crash.

144
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,420
hmm. I think two planes are going to are going to collide when they're landing

145
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:07,860
breaking bad. Wow, I think it's going to be an air traffic issue. You saw the

146
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,080
video the other day where the pilot was chewing out the air traffic control

147
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,940
person because they were about to collide into each other. They do it

148
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:16,980
happens all the time. It happens literally six hundred times a year that

149
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:20,120
play passenger planes almost collide into each other. So one of these times

150
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,580
somebody's going to get. I thought I'm saying bro it's going to happen. It's

151
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,560
crazy and you guys see this Boeing stuff. What's happening with bone? You guys

152
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,980
haven't you know when the entire side of the plane blew off and they had to land

153
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,680
did you guys not see this? Maybe this is your prediction. You're serious. You

154
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,660
didn't see this. I did not there was a there was a fucking I don't remember

155
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:38,260
which airline it was, but they took off they're flying and then Julio look this

156
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,420
up. They they want it fucking the one of the windows, you know how it's like a

157
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:47,680
window like segment yeah. It came, it blew off oh that's bad and and it was

158
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,980
just it was completely depressurized. They had to land and nobody was in that

159
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,260
seat, but if it happened, they would have just been so

160
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:57,780
instantly and then they check the plate and they're like yeah. All the bolts on

161
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,820
this plane were loose.

162
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:03,940
They hadn't tightened the bolts in like ten years. I always and it's bow. It's

163
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,140
Boeing plans. You see look at this is your air. This is your no no no no

164
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:13,460
everybody's going to die yeah. I mean I just can't happen. This is they need to

165
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,020
fix this.

166
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:18,660
Please tell me they at least fixed it. I don't tell you that they're not still

167
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,300
flying this play.

168
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:23,900
Seems like a recipe. This is Caleb's plan. You just duct tape over that damn

169
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:27,740
spot and start flying it around. Am I right? You don't I don't strike you as

170
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:31,700
that kind of person. You do that all the time with your car, yeah tape stuff you

171
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:35,240
duct tape. You've had like five duct tape situations on your okay one time.

172
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,900
Yes, I did have a pink kids hand mirror that replaced the side view mirror and

173
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,000
yes it was duct tape, but that was only for for what about your car window.

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,200
What about the hood of your car? The car window is saran wrap by the way, not

175
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,380
duct tape, asshole dumb ass and that was only for a month and a half. Why would

176
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:54,380
they break into your car with how it looked someone broke it in his air

177
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:59,520
they didn't break into the car. They just threw a beer bottle through the window.

178
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,120
Okay, it was a terrorist. You know why it was your Bernie sticker. It was fully

179
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,640
the Bernie sticker and it was a Heineken, which is a conservative conservative

180
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,280
right wing style beer. Yeah, I saw somebody put up

181
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:14,720
like some flyers around the neighborhood for like it was like communist meeting

182
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,700
or whatever you got to organize or yeah, I was like pictures of Karl Marx or

183
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,420
something and like something made me laugh was like someone went by and like

184
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:25,640
tore down part of it and scribbled over it with sharpie and like wrote a bunch

185
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,640
like USA forever long live USA and it's so funny to me to be like a full like

186
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,320
USA, USA guy living in Ridgewood.

187
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,200
So yeah, just there is a guy I see him on the walk over sometimes and he'll have

188
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:46,480
his garage door open, whole garage trumped out like big like yeah, I guess

189
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,160
also that is like that's why this neighborhood still cool because you

190
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,920
don't have it's not all

191
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:58,040
the hippie the hipsters. I bet also the people like that are like so much more.

192
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,360
They dig their heels in so much more because of all the communists and they

193
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,240
see me walk around them. Exactly. You guys should see me walk around this

194
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,320
neighbourhood, big hoop earrings, a shirt that goes to my nipples on the

195
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,200
downwards way, just right above them. Yeah, yeah, fishnet. I have a fishnet. I

196
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,480
fishnet shoes. Everyone sees your arca tattoo on your belly. Yeah, yeah,

197
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,560
the arca tummy rocker.

198
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:25,960
you have a big portrait of Arca on your I do

199
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:32,360
I look good, but a lot of people don't like it, and so I think that that's the

200
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:35,360
other thing that's coming as a retaliation against me. I walk around

201
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,760
with an under bite. So people don't talk to me. That's smart. That's really smart

202
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,260
when they ask you stuff. You just go. Nobody asked me stuff. You walk around

203
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,160
with an under. I don't want to talk to anybody. Say under board to you. Oh,

204
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,260
hell no guarantee it, because I don't want to know that voice sounds like no

205
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,360
people got a little bit of spit in it. Yeah, exactly and showing your teeth

206
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,680
like an angler fish to not just in the job. Just yeah, I'm afraid they'll bite

207
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,080
but I'm not doing that walking up to the game in contact.

208
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:06,960
So when you walk you walk up to the bouncer and just go hello, you walk

209
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:11,880
into a bar walking fully like like knuckles dragging on the ground until

210
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:17,440
you get to the bouncer. So they style just yeah. Hello. Hello. That movie

211
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,320
scared me when I was a kid because I thought usual suspect anybody who has a

212
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,940
disability could be faking it

213
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,540
and could be

214
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,520
isn't that scary. Yeah, that's a scary idea. Did anybody that's really fucking

215
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,620
scary. Someone pops out of the wheelchair and now listen, they got

216
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:38,740
Ganondorf powers. Get the fuck away from me man. Stay back. Stay down.

217
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:44,920
Yeah, say a pig get back down or don't become the pig. Stay a pig. Stay a pig

218
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,040
Ganondorf a pig.

219
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:51,940
you're saying so it stands up out of their wheelchair. You say stay down and

220
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:55,740
I got no Ganondorf the man and then Ganon you're always getting confused in

221
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,920
offensive ways. Yeah,

222
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:03,880
you are easily. Yeah, this is like I step on the real you type of I step on

223
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,440
rakes confused. You is the real you know

224
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,920
the confused me is yeah that the really you really pops out when you get

225
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,920
confused. I don't call disabled people pig. You literally just did about thirty

226
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,960
I was saying that Gannon is a pig. It's always something crazy and new to or

227
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:24,160
I've never heard in my entire life. Anybody say something like that, it

228
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,760
sounds awful. It comes out and I'm like that is a horrible. That's crazy. That

229
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,360
is horrifying. What have I said? What have I said like that besides pig? I'm

230
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,520
sure that somebody can make a super cut there. Yeah, there could easily be a

231
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,200
super cut of all the times that you've actually said something horribly

232
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,600
offensive as a confusion.

233
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:47,400
I thought we were talking about something else. You get confused for one second and you go

234
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:55,360
just Doug Stanhope instantly. It's a very interesting quality to your body. Interesting. So what's

235
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,040
going on? We, last night, did our Q&A. We did a Q&A for Job the Play. We had three old

236
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,320
women walk out. No, I saw you. I saw you posting about this and you're wrong. No, no, no, there

237
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,620
there was an old woman who walked out and stared at us. He did not see her.

238
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:14,380
We took that look at the strike, but you're saying you're here to touch it

239
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,220
too, because then he will

240
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:19,620
it's strong the strength. So he's distracted by my strength. It's it's

241
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:24,260
I didn't see the first person walk out, but the majority of people who walked

242
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:26,820
out and this is you're trying to give false info to make it seem like we

243
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,420
bombed when we didn't we didn't bomb. I'm not saying we bombed. I'm just

244
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:33,320
saying that there was a little lady, the old ladies who walked out, walked out

245
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,260
after we finished our portion and we said okay, now we're going to take

246
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,380
questions from the audience. That's when they left. They were like if these guys

247
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,700
aren't talking anymore, I'm fucking off. They love us. They hate the audience.

248
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:48,100
All right, well, I thought that that was a failure and on us to the old

249
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,540
community, but no actually they don't have a they hate each other. It's like

250
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,140
it's like when you go to a concert, you leave after the opener. You that's

251
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,180
because you just like the opener. It's not because opener was so bad. You can't

252
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,100
even handle the main event anymore. Yeah, exactly. That would be a silly. There

253
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,180
because my friend told me that the woman he was sitting next to

254
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:11,840
scoffed and said stupid after our first question. She was probably my first

255
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,740
question. Yeah, I actually

256
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:19,000
what was do you remember it was not does. Oh, I remember what it was. It

257
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,620
won't make any sense because nobody's seen the play, so it doesn't matter. Go

258
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,380
see the play. It's very good thing. It probably sold that lady was probably

259
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,900
chilling dude. She's probably moaning, one jilling you ever heard. She called

260
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,940
She called her vagina stupid?

261
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:35,440
Yeah, she was calling herself, she was dirty talking herself in the middle of the chair,

262
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,440
giggling because we were on stage, and moaning, and...

263
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,440
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

264
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
That'd be kind of cool. Has anybody got in trouble...

265
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:43,940
Cool?

266
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,440
If a fucking hot old milf was gilling in the audience?

267
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
And calling herself stupid? You'd feel bad.

268
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Why would I feel bad? She's getting a nut.

269
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,940
Hmm.

270
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,440
To me.

271
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:55,940
Okay, you're weird.

272
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
How's that weird?

273
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,940
You're a little weird.

274
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,940
How is that weird?

275
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:03,320
a little bit weird. If you're saying if a guy did it, it'd be okay, it'd be weird.

276
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:06,840
If anyone was jacking off and calling themselves stupid, it wouldn't be. I

277
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,840
don't think that's that crazy. It would be weird. It's been done. You witness

278
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,440
somebody, you witness somebody masturbating and they're going. I'm so

279
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:20,520
stupid, I'm so dumb. Oh, I'm a piece of crap and they're there in public one

280
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,840
because you're witnessing. I'm

281
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,040
would it be better if they're going? I'm awesome. If I'm the best

282
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,400
way, because that is a that is a psychopath sex criminal. The other one

283
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,560
is also a sex criminal, but they're ready to go to jail yeah. They want you

284
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,160
to say buddy. You have to stop doing that and they go okay yeah you're

285
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,240
right. They're remorseful. This other guy thinks he's God yeah, this thing

286
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,920
I'm awesome. He thinks he's in a time loop. Has there ever been a peewee

287
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:57,400
Herman at a play? No, yes, Lauren Bobert, oh yeah, oh she's she got she got she

288
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,740
did a two person Herman Yep at the play

289
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,420
P P. We we she did a P P. We Herman

290
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:11,920
Herman P P. We Herman Herman Herman Herman, she P, she did a P. She took her

291
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:18,600

292
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,060
yeah she

293
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:24,660
yeah exactly yeah, so yeah, I guess that it wasn't a play. What play was that at

294
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,200
Beetlejuice that's why I said until his beetle juiced. I thought he that was his

295
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,220
his face. He made booty. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

296
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:37,540
he didn't get he didn't get to not he nutted so hard his head shrank. He has

297
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:37,660
a

298
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:42,860
they kicked him out for he could not that's a bullshit. That's a man nut.

299
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,620
Let him know let him fucking let that boy nut let her not or him let him let

300
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,460
it off at Beetlejuice. You know what I'll say this about her. She is midi to me

301
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,280
really is it because of her political views, I have a hard time separating

302
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:02,000
women from their political views, so yeah, I think it is that okay.

303
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,220
Also, would you ever date like a Nazi woman?

00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:33,100
actually from a different part of their stomach spots. Yeah, she's dressed a

309
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:38,100
new. It's a new type of she's dressed in a paper bag, a trader, a trader,

310
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:43,100
revealing. It's a big one. It's a trader Joe's bag from a giant trader Joe's

311
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,100
that's what's the sized up was the body like she has one tooth that's long and

319
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,220

320
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:30,440

their head and they spin around. They have that she has that okay yeah dater

322
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,080
okay, but that's settled because

323
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:41,660
people would like shit is she like really loud about her political. She

324
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,840
can't speak. Oh well, then yeah, I don't care if she's silently she's she's

325
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:49,660
written five hundred. Are you going to say we're going to say it's we're going

326
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,060
to say it's like when people have like a dog that's got a wheelchair? No, but

327
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,980
I'm sick of that, too.

328
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,860
I'm sick of that. How many dogs do you see with wheelchair? I see you. How can

329
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,480
you be sick of that? How can you be sick of it? I saw there was a dog in my

330
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,700
neighborhood. Oh, wait, sorry. Do you have a woman in your life who sends you

331
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,360
these videos every fucking day? Because I do I don't see disabled animals from

332
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,940
here. You get pictures of dogs in wheelchairs, dogs in where they have the

333
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:16,480
back legs are replaced by wheels. I got them chopped off. You get videos of

334
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,060
those every day pretty often. Okay, this is your wife wants to do that to fill.

335
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,460
Here's what I don't like with dogs. She wants to take Phil's back. I'm done.

336
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:28,780
I'm done with the three legged dog. Don't show me this dog anymore. I don't

337
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,620
want to see this dog and everybody is and nobody's paying attention to my dog

338
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,300
because they're so obsessed with this fucking dog that has three legs. You're

339
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,520
My dog is better than the three-legged dog.

340
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,320
Your dog bite is not better than the three-legged dog.

341
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
It is better than the three-legged dog.

342
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
Your dog bited Cameron.

343
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,600
Your dog bited me all over my whole body.

344
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:45,600
That's fine.

345
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
I trained him to do that.

346
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,600
I don't care that much about it.

347
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,600
I trained him to attack you.

348
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:49,680
Here's the other thing I'm done with dogs.

349
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
You don't like Phil?

350
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,680
I don't fuck with him anymore.

351
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
That's fine.

352
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,680
We fell out.

353
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,680
You fell out?

354
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,720
He's still rocking with me.

355
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,720
Was it money?

356
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
No, it was his barking.

357
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
It was too loud.

358
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
It was too loud.

359
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,720
It hurt your ears?

360
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
No, but it startled me a couple of times.

361
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

362
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,560
hurtled me a couple times. Oh, I'm sorry about that. I'm also done with dogs that

363
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,360
have two different colors of eyes. Border collies. I don't give a fuck and

364
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,200
people who have that to heterochromia is out for 2024. Get a contact. I'm

365
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,160
throwing that shit away. Make your eyes match. I don't want to see two different

366
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:23,200
colors of eyes and then I'm trying to pick which one to look at. I'm honestly

367
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,640
done with any color of eye that's stranger or catches your eye or

368
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,720
interesting in any way. Enough of the purple. Even a color, even a blue that is

369
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,560
too pale, very bright, brown that has too many flecks of green. When the sun

370
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:40,340
shines into a hazel, a hazel that's too hazel, it needs to all be muted and

371
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:46,040
gray, gray eyes, brown eyes. No, just gray, just just as gray as what I'm

372
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,760
nothing, just nothing too crazy with the eye color, but especially these two

373
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,020
different colors of eyes. I'm sick of that shit and no hair too long or short.

374
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:57,480
Yep, have a perfect length, have it in between. Yeah, well, except for me.

375
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,040
Well, you don't have any. Yeah, you not that it's too short. I do have hair.

376
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,440
Well, you don't just don't have it. I don't grow it out. Yeah, you have it

377
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,840
doesn't grow. It doesn't have hair on my head. It does. It's not on your head.

378
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:13,740
I have hair in your bathroom drain. Yeah, because I shave it off

379
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,840
into my drain.

380
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:21,340
Right. So the play we did the we did the Q and a last night for the play and

381
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,140
also last night was the drop of the release of junior associate.

382
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:31,440
We were all in short film, short film done by the home planet guy.

383
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,880
And you may have heard a song at the end of the movie.

384
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,680
And I just want to say right now that was not the first song

385
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,280
that was supposed to be in it.

386
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,720
They went behind my back and they changed the song.

387
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:51,080
I actually wrote a song for the end of the movie and it was not used

388
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,760
like a credit song, like a song in the credits.

389
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Yes. Do you want to show it?

390
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Yes, I would like to. Julio, can you pull this up? I sent it to you earlier.

391
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,760
There is a... This is my... This was supposed to be the song at the end of the

392
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,760
movie. Why didn't they use it? And Joe and Alex, if you're listening,

393
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,360
what the hell? Why the hell didn't... This is not it. You're opening up

394
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,880
AO Technology again. It's a file. You're opening up me singing AO Technology.

395
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,720
Don't play this. Don't play this. Well, maybe mute this and then play

396
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,600
the song under it. No, I think you can just probably play the song.

397
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,100
Okay.

398
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,700
Okay.

399
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,800
Yep. So there's a play button.

400
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,600
All right. So this is your

401
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,100
song.

402
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,940
was a purple fish inside of Alex's suitcase when there was supposed to be a bunch of papers

403
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
and documents.

404
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:41,700
Then Alex and Patrick, they get a call from Caleb from the phone in the house.

405
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:46,740
The house has a phone on the wall and then they go to the parking lot where they meet

406
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:53,100
Caleb and Caleb shoots at them and then Caleb goes to his uncle and he meets his, I think

407
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:57,180
it's actually his grandpa, then he meets his grandpa at the restaurant and his grandpa's

408
00:25:57,180 --> 00:26:00,220
He's disappointed, then he tells him about New York.

409
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,740
And then from New York they go to back to the restaurant where he is on roller skates.

410
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,460
And when he's on the roller skates, he sees Alex and Patrick.

411
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:15,020
And then he sees them, and then they see the owner of the restaurant.

412
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,580
That is Caleb's grandpa.

413
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:20,500
Remember, that's Caleb's grandpa, 'cause it comes up later in the movie.

414
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,860
Then the movie ends, and it is, they end up eating fish.

415
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,720
and they have a good time in the end of the movie.

416
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:36,300
So that was the original. I am getting men in black Adams family, deep blue sea

417
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:40,920
vibes from this heavy. Yeah, it was supposed to be. It was supposed to be

418
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,460
that song at the end of junior associate. This has all the traits to me of a good

419
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:49,420
credit song, which is that if you just listen to the song, you don't have to

420
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,620
watch the movie exactly and I get everything you need. What I would have

421
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:57,100
I liked from you as some kind of spoiler alert type of thing. Maybe that was the

422
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,420
entire movie. I don't think it's... There's some stuff I didn't say. It says

423
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:05,660
everything. You said everything. I left out a few things, left out a few

424
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,260
details. Okay, so that's why people are watching movies. Oh, I can't wait to see

425
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:12,340
the details in this movie. Yeah, people... If you're a cinephile, you love

426
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:18,300
details in movies. I guess that is true. Yeah. I guess that is true. So, I left

427
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,900
out some details so that cinephiles could watch. This is a song that's not

428
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:26,460
certainly great for cine files, but it's also great for audio files. So I just

429
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:30,180
want to say about this song, it's for files of all types. Yep,

430
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:36,500
blank a file, you know, you'll like this song. A file. And it was made by a

431
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,340
blank a file. A file. Exactly. An audio file. Well, come on, it's a mix of

432
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,500
files. All types of files. A file, probably some other ones. No. Yeah. No,

433
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:49,260
no, no. But they did use this song and they made it, they used some song, it

434
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:54,100
just some guy saying purple, purple fish, some fucking guy, some guy. I don't know

435
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:59,220
it is bullshit. Why? Yeah. Why did they use my song or at least the Patrick cut?

436
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:04,100
Really? Yes, that's a good idea. We should black and white five hours long.

437
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:08,580
We should get a recut of the movie. Five hours long, black and white. Yeah, the

438
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,900
ending song has changed. Let me get into that editing booth. Yeah, let me turn

439
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,780
those knobs. I want to splice film. This is what I want to be doing. I don't want

440
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:20,140
to be in the movie. Even I just want to be I don't want to be in it anymore,

441
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:24,860
deciding which shots go into this shit and making sure that there's cameos from

442
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:28,460
everybody that I like. And let me tell you what, Cameron, if I was in charge of

443
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:31,300
this movie, right, we would have seen the front of your fucking head. Thank you.

444
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,380
Yeah, the back of your head is not enough, bro. We will show the back of my

445
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,860
head doesn't look good. The back of your head looks like shit. It's a bad and I

446
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:42,340
said that on set. I said this head looks like fucking shit. Can we get? That's

447
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:45,820
why they changed it. Can we have him eating at the restaurant backwards so

448
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,660
that we can at least see the front and not even because I like the front all

449
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,800
that right. No, I'm not saying I'm not saying the front of my head is that

450
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,500
great, but the back really is the worst part of you know what I would love.

451
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,460
There's nothing to see it's completely nothing. There's nothing loved in that

452
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,460
moment right before they cut to us

453
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,860
two hours. My dinner with Andre style you and Alan talking. Oh my God, or

454
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:10,020
without you guys, I mean dinner without no idea how deep we got. Oh, what do

455
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,780
you guys get on? I know mostly talked

456
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,380
well. I can't was the extra that Cameron sat next to who then did our focus

457
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,260
group episode. We really like we were fast friends.

458
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:26,020
We talked about my engagement to be married. Is he engaged? I didn't learn

459
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,540
any facts about him at all. That is you were talking about

460
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:33,500
yourself. He basically did not even really answer many questions or volunteer

461
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,340
much information

462
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:40,540
and more. Most of the conversation was silence, but he did enter a top ten in

463
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,640
your life? He was it was very fun and it was kind of

464
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:50,340
it was me and him and and Sean Bay and Sam and we were all sitting and

465
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:53,500
we all kind of were having the conversation with him and we all thought

466
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,140
that he was great. And he really was fine. You know when you feel when

467
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:01,160
you can kind of feel that somebody in a friend group is destined for greatness.

468
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,800
Yes, yes, he was kind of holding court over all y'all.

469
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:09,560
And he doesn't need to share that much about his life. Yeah, a silent but

470
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,460
strong tie. Yeah, he's kind of an outlaw and one of the and if you go back and

471
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:19,460
watch junior associate again, you pay close attention to him. One of the goats

472
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,360
when it comes to mannerisms for a dinner conversation. Yes, I mean he's doing

473
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:24,660
this.

474
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:29,660
Well, he's thrown in some of these. What's that? What is this? I don't know.

475
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,960
You'd have to ask him. I don't think I've ever been in a conversation at a

476
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:37,260
restaurant. Well, I've done this with my hands. Well, he's showing off different

477
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,260
He was showing you a spec?

478
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:45,260
He was showing you a thing. I mean, I don't know, understand what you have to just watch it and see.

479
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,260
Okay. I haven't watched it.

480
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,260
I want to see my dinner with Alan so bad. I need to see my dinner with Alan.

481
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:56,260
I don't think that you... I honestly can't imagine you having a one-on-one dinner with somebody.

482
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,260
Me? I have one-on-one dinners constantly.

483
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:02,260
With who?

484
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
My girlfriend.

485
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,260
But girlfriends, you sit there, you look at your phone, that's easy.

486
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:10,420
I mean, my dinner with Andre style, let's talk about life.

487
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,060
I've done it before with some people.

488
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:14,060
You've gone deep?

489
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:17,380
I think it's mostly, it's not dinners, it's mostly lunch.

490
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:20,160
You have a luncher type of vibe.

491
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,820
I get lunch, but I don't think dinner.

492
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:25,740
The kind of conversations you have over a lunch are very different from a dinner style

493
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,740
conversation.

494
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,180
Dinner is when you're allowed to drink wine.

495
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:33,460
So the wine comes out, the wine is pouring out of the sheepskin.

496
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:38,340
and you just I mean anything is on the table at a dinner conversation. Oh yeah,

497
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,900
I'll talk about it. O's steak well, besides the food, even asparagus spare

498
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,780
besides the food, Sam well, not the lemon, not just like candles and all

499
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,620
that kind of lemon, lemon, lemon, you don't eat lemon at dinner. No, you

500
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:55,540
lemon on you put lemon on stuff. I call lemon limb. Well, that you call lime

501
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,420
must be a regional thing. Okay,

502
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,980
really

503
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,900
You call lime, lye? You're not even saving a syllable there.

504
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,700
What about salt?

505
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,000
Sal.

506
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,220
You call it s...

507
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,140
Pepper is pep?

508
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,640
Pep.

509
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,140
Okay.

510
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,620
Okay, that one makes sense. I've heard pep before.

511
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:12,940
I've heard pep. I've heard pep.

512
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,220
What do you call ketchup?

513
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:15,400
Chup.

514
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,080
Chup.

515
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,460
Chup is good.

516
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:18,260
Chup is good.

517
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,340
I like chup.

518
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,220
Chup is very good.

519
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,260
What do you call mayonnaise?

520
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,160
Mayo.

521
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,440
He came up with that one.

522
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,340
That's universal.

523
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,200
Oh yeah.

524
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:25,960
That is universal.

525
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,460
What do you call mustard?

526
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:26,960
Yeah.

527
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,940
Don't say it.

528
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,440
I know.

529
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:28,940
I know.

530
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,440
I know.

531
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,140
I know what you're going for.

532
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:33,180
I actually call it empty

533
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:40,640
two syllables. Okay, all right, you'll pass the empty. What do you would you

534
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,740
call sauerkraut? Oh, that's tough, because I can't I can't actually our

535
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,980
because that's what I call sour. It's actually easy. It's a crowd is a bad

536
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,220
word. No, it's not. If it's a bad word, I don't know. I thought kraut meant

537
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,420
German. Yeah, isn't that bad? It's not bad. I don't think so. They have kraut

538
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:58,460
raw. I guess what I'm thinking of is that they would just is that in all the

539
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:02,100
war movies. They call them krauts and I mean, they're the bad guys in those

540
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:06,180
movies. It's true, but it still sounds like a rude word. They should just suck

541
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:09,940
it. Does it just mean I think you can call germans whatever I always

542
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,700
assumed it was that ending. I mean, I'm not either, but but I mean, I was just

543
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,420
saying, I think you're do you think enough time has passed though that

544
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,460
they're like that it's like all right, we've had our fun with germans yeah.

545
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,220
I think you're saying it's time to forgive and forget the hall. No, no, no,

546
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:29,480
no again. He's walked into a confusion. It is a confusion situation, but you

547
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:29,700
think

548
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:34,000
that was fully, but do you think enough time has passed

549
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,600
not to forgive and forget, but to stop calling the crowd time has passed is a

550
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,860
crazy thing to say not even a hundred years man. All right, well, once we hit

551
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,600
the a hundred years, I guess we can stop calling them crowds and stuff

552
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,560
and stuff.

553
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,300
I mean to stop, we can keep I guess

554
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:56,520
that whole thing, you call them Nazis or the I don't call German people Nazi. I

555
00:33:56,520 --> 00:34:03,040
knew that they're rude. I call bisexual cashier's. I want to I call people who

556
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,440
does like my videos on line Nazis and techno yeah. I hate that techno crap.

557
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,900
You like it. What are you talking about techno sex? You need techno at the gym?

558
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,440
No, I don't yeah. You do I did a here that's I did a fully no techno work out

559
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:19,600
that is not German style. That's not a yeah. That's a talion that's trance and

560
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:24,840
hero dance. That is Italian. They did not get any heat at all for World War II. You don't

561
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,840
see anyone making fun of Italians for that. Italians. That's because they... They kind

562
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,400
of fucked up their whole government. I don't think the people who were in Italy even knew

563
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,000
that they were in a war. Yeah. That's a good point. They were just fucking bumbling around

564
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,460
walking into each other. They were just fighting over pizza stuff. The funniest one is Japan

565
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:48,240
because people got pretty mad at them of course, but they kind of just roll with it. It's so

566
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,540
so far you're watching an anime from the two thousands and they'll be dressing up

567
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:55,380
as Nazis in it. Yeah, I started playing Persona three and everybody's got a big

568
00:34:55,380 --> 00:35:01,740
red armband and they're just, they look like full Nazis style swastika. Japan has

569
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:05,660
a very interesting, very interesting ideas about World War Two still is very

570
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,980
funny. Do you think there's a guy that can kind of just get away with it?

571
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,340
Because people are farther away, because we're like, oh, they don't understand.

572
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:14,620
Yeah. Do you think there's a guy on one of those islands that still thinks the

573
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,600
wars happening, probably not. Yeah, I think the last guy was there, the guy

574
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:25,120
like the last guy that didn't know the war ended probably on an island. Yeah,

575
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:30,460
no, no, no. When do you think? Oh, what do you think? People were like a chill

576
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:34,160
dude. Imagine I don't know what's the latest like. Do you think like maybe

577
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,560
like one thousand nine hundred and eighty one there's still a guy there

578
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,920
and then they come over and they're like isn't there a famous case of this?

579
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,920
Look at this. This is called Donkey Kong. Did that ever actually happen or is

580
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,400
that's something that for a long period of time, though, besides just being like

581
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,400
the 50s.

582
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,400
Was it the 50s?

583
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,400
Yeah.

584
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,720
Was it the 50s where all that they were like, "Hey, we got black and white TV now"?

585
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,720
Imagine us three, we get trapped on a stranded island.

586
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,160
A stranded island.

587
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:04,920
And we're sitting there and we see a galleon coming across the horizon, and we start readying

588
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,280
our arms because we're thinking, "Is this guy going to be an SJW or is he going to be

589
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,080
be right based guy like us and then they show up and they say guys, the war on

590
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,360
woke is over. We lost you guys have been fighting this war on woke your

591
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,800
prisoners of war. Now yeah,

592
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,560
that would be a woke lost woke lost. So we woke never. I thought you were

593
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:25,800
saying

594
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:30,280
I thought you said we lost no woke law, then who then great say well, the more

595
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,520
interesting thing is they come by. They say the war on woke is over and woke one

596
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,600
and then you're like do first of all do I believe them yeah and second of all,

597
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,800
what the fuck do I do? I'm doing that's the more that's I mean that's a movie,

598
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,160
the banana to my head, pull that's a that's a novel. That's an eighteen

599
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,960
hundred's novel right there is that's a beautiful. You are now a prisoner of

600
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:53,080
prisoner of war, and we are going to we've all been prisoners of woke. You

601
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:57,240
were going to put you in a bra yeah coconut bra that we made on the island

602
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,300
exactly and there's going to be the Abu grade picture of us getting

603
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:04,240
electrified, but instead of a bag over our head, Cove, a nineteen mask in

604
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,800
ninety five.

605
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,000
Now it's not going to be that is going to be one of the cloth ones and it's

606
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:14,660
to say like wear a fucking wear a fucking mask, Nike or Nike, it's gonna be a Nike

607
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:19,260
branded mask. So that's a really scary kind of being a prisoner of war must be

608
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:23,920
very scary. It doesn't seem that bad. It depends on the war, but like when you're

609
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:27,120
a prisoner of especially, I guess what I want I'm thinking of is is when you're

610
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,560
not even like a soldier. I guys read this book about

611
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:35,860
history of whaling and I forgot which war it was, but like the whaling wars,

612
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,120
but you know people would just be out whaling like up in the Arctic and then

613
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,120
ship the whatever war was the other country would just come and capture them

614
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,860
all and like sink their ships and take them all as prisoner. It's like they're

615
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:52,020
working man chill out. I would switch sides yeah. They wouldn't let you I'd

616
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,740
make them feel bad for me. I do the I do the best cry ever from the video and

617
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,780
did you guys know really bad? They let me go. This is something insane that I

618
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,480
learned from the from the

619
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:09,100
from this book in the eighteen sixties they were using. They were using literal

620
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:12,100
miss exploding missiles to kill way.

621
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,280
They're used. They had like harpoons for a while and then they invented in

622
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,560
eighteen sixty. They literally had a like is like a giant like rifle that

623
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:28,040
shot out an exploding missile. They would shoot it into the whale and it

624
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,640
would go into the well to be on a delayed views. They would shoot in and

625
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,100
that would just explode. Just to shit eighteen sixties. Why were they doing

626
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:38,500
that to because it can't even get like the you can't even get the blubber or

627
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,540
anything or you can

628
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:44,680
are big. You you shoot the whale, you hold the plate out and it lands

629
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,800
perfectly on your okay well yeah, and then so there was another guy who was

630
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,020
trying to invent a shoulder mounted one and he could never do it and he blew his

631
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,900
entire hand off. Try to like conservative patriot. Have you seen that video?

632
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,160
Coolest thing is that video never seen that guy conservative patriot where he

633
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:04,440
fires an RPG and it burns his entire face. Oh my God, no awesome. He put it

634
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,340
on YouTube and it goes it's it's me. It's called like my RPG exploded my face

635
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:13,640
parenthesis slow motion and slow mo video of it burning his face. That's

636
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:18,400
insane. It's really, really bad, like a really bad burner. It's probably fine. I

637
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,080
think it was quite bad. Yeah, yeah, like it's not like like he doesn't look like

638
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,040
Indiana Jones opening up the Ark of the Covenant. Well, Indiana Jones or I'm

639
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,320
sorry, Nazis and Indiana Jones opening up the really look like that. When it

640
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,400
melts, if it was like plastic and wax, it was made of candle. Yeah, if you have

641
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,480
a candle face, yeah, I guess so, but if you have a normal skin, I think it would

642
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,180
probably just burn and curdle. Yeah, it would just flake away. Yeah, was it

643
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,800
doing that because of the Ark of the Covenant? Did it look like that or does

644
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,900
it do that? Because that's what a human face would look like if it was burned

645
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,240
the Ark. The Ark is the Ark. Okay, so it was a horror that we couldn't

646
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:59,960
understand right. Well, we under I mean Spielberg or you're asking if the arc

647
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,700
physically burned their face or if it was super natural. If it was super, it

648
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,360
wasn't super natural at all. Okay, it was a big fire. Oh yeah, and it just

649
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:11,720
burned them for no reason. Oh all right. Well, there was a reason. There's a

650
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:16,720
laser beam. Is there anybody currently on the search for

651
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:23,760
the great cup, the holy grail? Yeah, probably I bet there is. I mean, I think

652
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:27,420
it's also one of the I bet it's also one of those things where, if you look it up,

653
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,300
I bet that, like

654
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,180
you know, twelve to fifteen archaeologists have been like we found the

655
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:39,980
grail that the Holy Grail was based on. Yes, fuck that fuck that right. I want

656
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:43,860
to see I want an extra arm. Yeah, this is the shit I want. What did the Holy

657
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,740
Grail do you drink from it and you become? I think it's eternal life. I

658
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:54,220
I believe it's eternal life. The when we when I was a kid, a big news story

659
00:40:54,220 --> 00:41:00,700
broken my church that they had found Noah's Ark. Oh wow in laid into a

660
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,500
that's pretty incredible in somewhere in the Middle East and

661
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:10,220
guys, it turns out it's not true. Yeah, yeah, I know what he probably did was

662
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:14,060
took all the pieces of the Ark and made like his own like mansion. The Ark

663
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:16,940
wasn't even that big. It was like yeah, I know, but you can still make us pretty

664
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,820
sizable house. What's a piece of that? It was some cubits. That's the

665
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,820
you know, like a cubit is a cubit is your is your elbow to the tip of your

666
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,760
middle finger. So it's a unit of measurement is different based on who

667
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:32,340
is so maybe no one that's a big able. Yeah, he could yeah. So how big you

668
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:35,900
said the arc was a cubit? No, it was quite some of it. It was quite some

669
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:39,620
cubits, but it wasn't so many that you think you could fit every animal on

670
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:43,260
this motherfucker, but I had you're supposed to kind of understand the

671
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:47,620
spirit of the rather follow the spirit of the story rather than the letter of

672
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,100
it. It's not literally that there was two animals. There's probably one of

673
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,940
each animal. Okay, so you are a heretic,

674
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:58,260
so you believe your believe the love this is the I believe this is this. Yes,

675
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:03,340
you said my beliefs exactly. I believe this is this. I think that God was

676
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,760
in the sky. No man, you're not supposed to read it and go. I literally took

677
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,700
seven days to

678
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:13,700
to create one. You're probably what you're supposed to read and be like it

679
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,140
probably took like six to eight. I do remember one of the five, one of the

680
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:20,760
early atheistic owns I had on my mom,

681
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,380
which there were many of was oh yeah, God created in seven days. Interesting,

682
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:32,180
because he didn't make the sun until day two or three, which the sun is how you

683
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,380
determine the day. So tell me how many fucking days that was you fucking bitch.

684
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,540
Well, he made the son to correspond to the nine years old. Did she say that

685
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,140
back to you?

686
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,820
No, I think she told me to go to my room, which is how moms moms should be on

687
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,580
every debate stage for every presidential debate. They'd win every

688
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:49,940
time.

689
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:54,140
Why do you want to raise that? Go to your room, go to your room right now, go

690
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,660
to your room,

691
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,940
what

692
00:42:55,940 --> 00:43:03,940
go go three to go to your room is so funny. It's so funny to send a what

693
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,340
did you see your fucking sorry? I used to go to my room all the time. I know

694
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,940
it's just very it's really funny. It's not even it's completely it's just

695
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:15,540
something that's just like I just can't do this right now. I don't want you here.

696
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,060
I wish I didn't have a t right now. Punishment, but I don't want to see

697
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:23,300
you're here. I can't stand looking at my child. Just go to your room, like

698
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,540
go away, go like go to your room and don't come out. Yeah, just go go to your

699
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:32,660
room. I never got to go to your room. I just got go away. I feel like go away is

700
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:36,380
hard. You didn't have a room. Oh yeah, damn I did have a room, but I shared it

701
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:39,500
my two brothers, so it was not mine. Oh yeah, I'll go hang out with my brothers

702
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:43,100
and fucking think about football with them. Yeah, what a punishment. Yeah, I'll

703
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:48,180
go to my room where the PlayStation One is. Yeah, stupid. No, I would go to my

704
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,540
room and I had a chair I would masturbate in. In the chair? Yeah. Does it change it?

705
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:56,700
What kind of chair was it? It was one of these big circle ones. Oh. And I'd go in

706
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:59,380
there. What, like an armchair? You would wipe it on the chair? Hell no.

707
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,780
Treat it like gym equipment. It was a big leather chair. You'd fucking finish

708
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,940
and just get a wipe down for the next person.

709
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,100
No, it was one of the, what do they call, I don't know what those are called.

710
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:14,340
They're like the clamshell chairs. Yeah, it's a loveseat, right? No, not a loveseat.

711
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,180
It was like a crappy, it was a... It was a loveseat, but you got it in a circle?

712
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:19,700
It's not a full circle. It was just like a,

713
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,500
I don't know how to describe this. I don't understand. I'm not so good with

714
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,220
language, but it was like a,

715
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:27,540
it was like me doing this, and if you sat on it...

716
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:32,460
I guess I can imagine maybe. Not really, but I'll give it to you. So it was a chair

717
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,720
that was shaped like a hand.

718
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,300
No, I'm moving on from the

719
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:42,400
I'd like to move on to the, but it wasn't cushioned. It was cushion. Oh yeah,

720
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:45,160
but it was one. It sounded like it wasn't. It was a cushion that sat on

721
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:48,900
top of it. It wasn't like made out of cushions like couches. It was plastic.

722
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,340
It was wood or bamboo or something that bamboo is wood. What's that called

723
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,900
wicker wicker?

724
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:02,120
You're jacking off in a wicker chair. I'm old school baby. That's I'm old

725
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:05,220
school. There's no way your mom didn't know there's no way your mom didn't

726
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,560
hear

727
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,680
like all moms always know that their kids are jacking. Dude, that is the

728
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:16,540
biggest terrifier of getting a kid. Yeah, is there gonna jay know if it's

729
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:21,080
way too early? That's bad if it's way too late. Yeah. If your son is going to

730
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:23,660
college the next day, you hear him jack up. You hear him in the bathroom. I

731
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,000
guess

732
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,460
yeah, I guess what would happen is you're kind of like

733
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,560
that's bad. Well, you are

734
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:39,160
I made butter. I made boogers at the front. You would be kind of surprised

735
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,480
because you would think he you know he would be going through the ages,

736
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,560
thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, and you never kind of you never catch him

737
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,040
or notice any signs that he is jacking off and you think oh well great. I

738
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,900
mean he's I guess he's just a very secretive kid. I always thought I was a

739
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,000
parent. I would know, but I guess I guess he's just a screet. That's good

740
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,440
for me. I mean, yeah, which great yeah and then eighteen rolls around eighteen

741
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:03,660
and he starts he's allowed to realize all what will you just realize all along you

742
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:07,200
thought he was being so conscientious and discreet. No, he just didn't know how

743
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,920
he's touched in the head. He didn't know how your son has been touched. Well,

744
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,800
what if what if your son was just such a you, you raised him so right that every

745
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,940
single rule he sees that web, that porno website and says you must be eighteen

746
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,020
plus to enter any porno websites to check off. I'm not going to use your brain to

747
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:26,860
think a different did you watch it first time you jacked off to do jack off to a

748
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:33,160
website. Yeah. Internet poisoned. I jacked off to a bath tub that I was in. That's what

749
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,880
you were supposed to do when you were a kid. If you want me to be honest, it was a DVD

750
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:43,320
that I stole when my uncle lived in my house. You fucked a DVD through the hole. I used to

751
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,560
think about that all the time. That's what I did. I saw the lady on the DVD and I said,

752
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,200
"Well, I'm just going to put it right through the hole in the center of the disc." No, my

753
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:58,760
My uncles, I had like all three of my uncles lived in my house at some point because they

754
00:46:58,760 --> 00:46:59,760
needed a place to stay.

755
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:00,760
An addict porno DVD?

756
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:07,640
My uncle Kevin had the most porno in the house and he put it in storage in the basement and

757
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:14,640
we found it all and my older brother, he had a, it was a photographed version of the Kama

758
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,820
Sutra.

759
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:20,120
So it was like these artistic photos of like people fucking in different positions, you

760
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:26,960
can have that and my older brother stole it and then showed me that he hit it and

761
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:31,400
I got in trouble at a family cookout that we were having and like it was like

762
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,500
the there's the porch in the backyard and then our like the window from our

763
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:42,200
bedroom looking down. So I got sent to my room and I said, Oh yeah, you guys are

764
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:48,160
getting me in trouble. Well, Paul has this and I threw the book out the window

765
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,080
to get him in trouble as well. I was taking him down with me because he was

766
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:56,880
the one that got me sent to my room and I threw the comma sutra down and then

767
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,280
he ran upstairs and beat the shit out of me and then he got in the most trouble.

768
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,280
You just reminded me of a time when my mom was having her wedding rehearsal in

769
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:11,000
our backyard and I didn't want to be involved with it. So I went upstairs and

770
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:14,120
I opened up all the windows and I had some speakers and I played jizz in my

771
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:17,960
pants at like maximum volume and like ruined her

772
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:24,640
and that was probably most trouble I was ever in. But man, it was fun. I

773
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,360
avoided trouble completely for doing that because my mom, my mom said,

774
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,600
I'll deal with you later. And then they had to sit my brother down and be

775
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:37,760
like, you can't be, you can't be jacking off because the Lord does not want

776
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,320
you to do it. Really?

777
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:44,420
They said that and they also told us that we can't be looking up porno on the

778
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,620
computer because one the Lord and to every website that as porno on it has a

779
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:53,920
virus. That's still true. I think yeah, that is I still still true. If it's not

780
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,320
one of the big three, then I've told the fake taxing on here. It's how your dad

781
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,120
was watching fake taxi all day. My dad was watching fake taxi off the website.

782
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,420
He's trying to call one. He was off. He was off the website, watching the

783
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:12,020
trailers to calling one of the like cab services and being like yeah and send me

784
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:16,100
to go. I need to go to the airport tomorrow morning at like five thirty

785
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,240
am. See you then. Could you send me the fake?

786
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,540
Oh, by the way,

787
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:26,460
send me the fake text and I want to do and I only need five minutes when you

788
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:32,720
wake up to go to the airport at four AM. You have like an early flight. You like

789
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,980
yellow cab you get in. Oh Fuck, it's a

790
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:39,480
let's get this over with come here.

791
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:46,120
I'm in a fucking run. Did they ever do a fake ambulance where someone's in a neck

792
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:49,920
brace and getting their butt fucked? Eric, I did really yep. I remember that

793
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,640
wasn't an Eric. I was an Eric Andre one. Remember watching that being like Jesus

794
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:58,080
because that was the one where he was that's one of the most of the Eric Andre

795
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:01,660
show completely left my mind. I can't even remember a single episode of it.

796
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:06,100
come on craft this one or whatever upset me so much. Well, I guess you're right

797
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,740
this upset, but I mean the pranks this upset me so much because it's he's like

798
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:14,380
the it's the one where the person it's like a passed out woman, like in a

799
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,380
getting loaded into an ambulance and he starts fucking her.

800
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,660
Nice

801
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:25,500
so I saw an amazing. I saw that in real life. I would kill myself. I try to kill

802
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:30,260
him and then I would kill my I saw an amazing post today. I opened up reddit to

803
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:31,960
look at the Ridgewood subreddit, which I'm a

804
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:37,860
really good one from it that I showed you. I have I love this subreddit. I

805
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:42,540
open up reddit and it says recommended post and it's a post on the Eric Andre

806
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,820
subreddit and it said is this show real?

807
00:50:45,820 --> 00:50:50,780
That was a god damn. I wish I thought of that.

808
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:57,060
I'm going to send you a pic that you have to show. I do love the Ridgewood

809
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:00,680
subreddit because it's mostly just neighborhood. If you have if you live

810
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:04,660
in a neighborhood that has a subreddit, it's incredibly recommend or a

811
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:07,820
neighborhood or a better than next door for sure, because it's go on this

812
00:51:07,820 --> 00:51:11,580
website, go on. Well, it's all it's all search your town who are like

813
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:15,660
they're all just it's either people who are who are posting like what the hell

814
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:19,420
happened to this restaurant? Yeah, or people who are like anybody noticed that

815
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:22,580
like it's just the most inconsequential. Anybody noticed that there was a bug?

816
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:25,740
Yeah, the other day, what the hell is that about? Has someone noticed more

817
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:29,180
at this our slash Ridgewood post that I painted a tribute to the Grand

818
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:33,540
View right. Oh my God. Wow. We need to buy this from this person.

819
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,660
We need to buy this.

820
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,100
Wow. We used to go there all the time. This is kind of right in

821
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,380
between, I would say,

822
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:45,820
earnestly trying to paint something and painting something shitty on purpose,

823
00:51:45,820 --> 00:51:49,660
so you know that it was earnest. Yeah, it's not trying to be funny

824
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,420
enough, it feels like. The Grand View Rite Aid is closed. I know.

825
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:56,740
so that's why that's why that's what the tribute is yeah. This trip we need to

826
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:01,060
buy that paint. If you listen to the show and you made that painting, we will

827
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:04,940
give you twenty dollars. Oh wow, they even they looked it up off Google. Oh my

828
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:09,680
God, that was that's how we go put the side by side of the right and the

829
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:13,580
painting. If you saw a drink, look at that, I literally looked up that it's

830
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:17,920
got the same tree. If you saw a tree is only there in the show from May

831
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:25,580
2023 to August 2023, nine times out of ten, it was purchased from that rated

832
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:29,260
not for me. It was a little far. Not me either. Probably a little far. I guess

833
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,100
closer to I don't really I don't like right. I didn't like that. I just like

834
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,420
that right. It because nobody went to it and it's on the way from my house to

835
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:40,580
wherever I ride it in Walgreens. These for these chain pharmacies, I don't like

836
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:46,180
them because I always feel like I'm being accused of stealing. Yeah, the I and I

837
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:49,200
don't like to have a security guard yeah and if you're going to have a security

838
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,700
guard, I think that you should have to I would feel better if they checked my

839
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,260
receipt yeah, because I was saying I'm going to walk out and they're going to

840
00:52:55,260 --> 00:53:00,820
be. I feel the way yeah, I totally agree. I will say, though I have any if I like

841
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,800
a if I'm got if I'm buying over the counter medicine or like so if I

842
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:09,240
anything that I need to go to a place like that for I can't ever. I feel a

843
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,060
thousand times less comfortable and like a small like bodega style one just

844
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,900
because I don't know. I just grew up going to CVS all the time. I think

845
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,140
they have the wrong medicine. I just well, I just yeah, I'm always like only

846
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:24,320
CVS is going to have what I need. Yeah, yeah, I it took me a while to get

847
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,700
used to going to a right at or a Walgreens. I went to brand loyal. There's

848
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:32,860
there's one there's a pharmacy closer to my apartment and I went to it and I

849
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:37,500
needed the pain medication for my my wisdom tooth surgery. Yeah, and the guy

850
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:37,940
was like

851
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:42,940
listen, that's on back order. I won't have twelve until Monday.

852
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:50,480
like can I just give you six and then you can ask the doctor to send me

853
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:54,540
another prescription, and I was like what you haggled with a pharmacist. I

854
00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:58,020
well, I got that's always what it is yeah yeah, you're like do you have do

855
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:01,720
you have this do you have do you have zyrtec and they're like no, we have

856
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:06,820
our flax yeah. I don't want our it's also the same color. We have our flax.

857
00:54:06,820 --> 00:54:09,380
It's the same color and it's a little weaker and it costs seven hundred

858
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:11,400
Yeah, with insurance.

859
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,400
Alright, that sounds good to me.

860
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,400
Yeah, I'll take it. I'll take Zarflex.

861
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,400
I haven't taken prescription medication in a very long time.

862
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,400
I was on Adderall for a little bit, then I stopped because it was making me crazy.

863
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,400
You know I want to take one of these, what are they called?

864
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:25,400
The antibiotic pack?

865
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,400
Where you have to take every single one every day?

866
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:29,400
Oh yeah.

867
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,400
The antibiotic advent calendar?

868
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:37,400
If you have the advent calendar version, it means that the pharmacist or doctor thinks that you have a brain of a 12 year old.

869
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:41,400
Okay, well, I haven't taken it in years. Yeah, but because antibiotics did you

870
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,920
guys know this antibiotics are good or bad and I can't remember which type

871
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:52,560
it's bad not for you, but it's bad in the grand scheme of things because the

872
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:56,400
grand scheme. Well, the more antibiotics that people take the more that

873
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,480
viruses and stuff adapts to them. You know, it was fine. I know it's take

874
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:04,000
them the less that they're come up with a new biotic as a species. I was taking

875
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,640
when I got the wisdom tooth out again, I was taking antibiotics and then I was

876
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,640
eating yogurt because there was a stitch in my mouth, but the yogurt I was eating

877
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:16,960
was probiotic. Right, so you think maybe it cancelled out? I think that maybe my

878
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,440
mouth is infected. Why the damn antibiotics so big? The pills, they're

879
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,880
gigantic. I have a hard time swallowing those. It might as well fill up my butt.

880
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,480
The biotics you're getting, the biotics you're getting rid of. My mom put it in

881
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,920
my ass. The bacterias,

882
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:33,200
a suppository? Yeah, when I was like kind of too old to

883
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:37,340
I probably could have done it myself, but my mom was like, "You're going to mess

884
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:40,400
it up. I'll put it in your ass." I was like nine years old,

885
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,220
and I will never forget that. I was sitting on the bed sideways,

886
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:48,940
and I was sitting there thinking like, "I think that I'm ten and I could

887
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:49,940
do this myself."

888
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:54,860
And she was like, "That wasn't so bad, right?" And I just ran away.

889
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:59,860
And I don't, it only, it wasn't, it was like one pill that she had put

890
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,960
up there. It might have been a tracking device. Yeah, I think it was a

891
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,980
right? You got fat bastard. That's the thing that sucks about having babies is

892
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,020
you have to do that kind of tracking device. It's all this disgusting stuff.

893
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:12,440
When I was a kid there, I don't know if it was flu shot or some other type of

894
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,620
vaccine where they were like,

895
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:18,660
"Oh, you can either get, like, the shot or you can get, like,

896
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,700
mist." A hamburger.

897
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:27,620
Like some kind of, like, you breathe it in, right? And I was still young enough

898
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,220
that I was like, "I really didn't want to get a shot." And it was just scary.

899
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,620
And I was like, "Okay, I want to get the mist. I don't want to get the shot."

900
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:35,700
and they were like, "Oh, you can't get the mist because you have asthma,

901
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,580
so you can't have it. You have to get the shot." And ever since then,

902
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:41,740
I always feel like there's gonna be some scenario where, yeah, they're gonna

903
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:44,340
be like, "Okay, you can either take... You can get the pill or you can

904
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:46,660
get the suppository." And I'll be like, "Okay, please, I can have the

905
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:50,220
pill." And they're gonna be like, "You can't. Actually, there's something

906
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:52,860
wrong with your mouth and you can't have it." They see you turn around

907
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:56,360
for one second, "You gotta take the suppository," and we have to do

908
00:56:56,360 --> 00:57:01,000
an on site application. How is a suppository better than just taking it

909
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:04,800
by the mouth. It's a mucous membrane in your asshole. Oh yeah, it's the same

910
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:08,960
reason. I imagine it's the same reason that if you pour a beer up your butt,

911
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:13,280
you get drunker. Oh, and you can put cocaine in your ass. Yeah, okay,

912
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:17,000
'cause what's his name? Did that who? Scott Storch? Oh,

913
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,880
never heard about that. No, that's a different. That was way far. It's way

914
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,160
farther away from Steveo than I got. Steveo Scott Storch used to blow.

915
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,240
That's what he is now. The damn vegan cocaine up Mariah Carey's asshole.

916
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,760
yeah, it's called a Miami blizzard. You never heard about this. No, why do you

917
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:36,100
do it to Mariah Carey? She was just a very nice your assholes out

918
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:43,200
walking around with her ass out, and he shot it like a dart like Ace Ventura

919
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:43,620
directly

920
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:46,660
and

921
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:49,420
yeah, Kobe

922
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,660
Kobe.

923
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:54,460
Yeah, the

924
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:58,560
you can do all sorts of drugs in your ass. I don't know about it, but isn't

925
00:57:58,580 --> 00:58:02,740
there's always a little bit of poop in your butt. Maybe you're what I imagine

926
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:05,980
and there's always a little bit of poop. You don't finger your ass with the

927
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:09,780
white to try to clear out at least like a like a you know you you've said this

928
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:14,260
so many times and every single time yeah, I don't say no do that, then you

929
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,100
have nasty asses whiteys. I don't really care.

930
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:22,420
I don't care if you're nasty ass on the inside. No, it's sides of part where

931
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:26,620
people might have access soon. No one is having access anytime soon. You don't

932
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:31,740
know that I don't know that you could get in trouble, then that's on them. If

933
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:34,760
they if they find out it's dirty in there, but first of all, I don't want

934
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:38,400
them in there. It's a deterrent, but you can get people. You can get yourself out

935
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,660
of trouble. I keep I keep it a little dirty like a poison dart frog. Exactly

936
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,900
it's like a biologic. There's a reason that there's a biological reason that

937
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:50,140
shit stays inside your butt, even when you wipe yeah to get it out.

938
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,940
What yeah it's like power washing the reason it stays inside is to get it out

939
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,340
yeah, so you can get so you have so you can get a satisfaction. I understand

940
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:02,280
satisfying. I cleaned out one finger one like nail

941
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:08,120
as I am like up to your nail. You have a coke nail for poop. No, it's a normal.

942
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:10,540
My nails are all short, but you just go to the nail bed.

943
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:16,100
You create a glove of baby white. So I've never he's Julio's your flesh and

944
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:19,260
baby wipes in your apartment. Now here's my question. I that's another thing.

945
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:24,340
Let me flush that not in this city. Fuck all that. Maybe maybe some new style

946
00:59:24,380 --> 00:59:28,740
plumbing and listen, I'll pay the fine in some I'll pay the fine, but I'm let me

947
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:31,860
let know that's terrible for plumbing. I don't give a my brother's a plumber. He

948
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,500
told me how bad it is. I hope he fucking not the

949
00:59:34,500 --> 00:59:36,340
not the plumber

950
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:41,180
and don't throw away. I don't care. The plumbing is the most important part of

951
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:44,340
your house, because I've seen those videos. The part of your house where the

952
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:47,860
videos where people get their plumbing backs up and then their toilet starts

953
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:52,060
shit doing shit, but they let me tell you like it's like not my problem. I'm

954
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:56,940
I'm renting I'm flushing the wipes. I'm putting aerosol cans in the trash

955
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:59,960
flushing on batteries, olive oil directly

956
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,380
olive oil. When I'm done with it, my shit is literally seventy five percent

957
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:07,520
olive oil and that's going in the fucking pipes. Yeah, okay, what am I

958
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,580
supposed to do sift through and throw the olive oil? I'm pretty sure I'm

959
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:15,240
pretty sure I did that well yeah. So here's a question if we can't flush the

960
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:19,680
baby wipes yeah. What the hell am I supposed to do reach into the toilet and

961
01:00:19,720 --> 01:00:24,220
grab the white covered in shit. Yeah, because the other option with a

962
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:28,660
flushable with the other option is throwing it out in the trash and I

963
01:00:28,660 --> 01:00:31,640
don't know how often I clean the I don't know how often I empty the

964
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,980
bathroom. What if I put it in a nasty bullet and I believe don't do it.

965
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:36,000
Get my girlfriend does it

966
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:40,600
wait misogynist bala. You make your girlfriend throw away your shit. I

967
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,720
don't make her throw with the shit. You put the shit wipe in the trash. No,

968
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,240
I flush him

969
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,200
my man.

970
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:51,520
I'm just sick. No, no, I'm it's regular toilet paper. I don't like rules. I

971
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:55,040
don't like regulations and I'm gonna be watch my shit baby wipes in the toilet

972
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,600
regular wipe trash. I

973
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:04,100
put oil and grease down the sink. I put large chunks of food down the sink. I

974
01:01:04,100 --> 01:01:08,300
or when I was living in Boston, I have we have the thing on our drain that has

975
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,440
little holes in it. So you try to try that away. I don't it's it's completely

976
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:16,040
attached on. I can't throw it away. I jam stuff through it. Oh yeah, yeah,

977
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:21,560
I put a chicken bone. Really yeah, no disposal. I don't have a disposal by

978
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,000
bone.

979
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:26,080
It just goes away. I it's gone. I'm never going to think about this fucking

980
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,880
bone again. I don't care what I'm saying man. I'm renting yeah. What's going to

981
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:33,160
get stuck sideways in the plum the plumbers? Oh, no water can't get by

982
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:37,240
water. You want me to feel bad for water? It's ninety percent of the earth

983
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:40,480
and my body. When I was living in Boston, I poured a hole. I had a

984
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,880
it was like a late crusade thing filled with

985
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:49,060
vegetable oil and I was deep frying something and I didn't know what to do

986
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:53,960
with the oil. I just poured it down the sink. Yeah, I do it whole like three

987
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,480
court thing. Well, it was probably it was probably one and a half quarts of

988
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,980
olive oil or vegetable oil straight down the drain. Yeah,

989
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:04,800
what am I going to do with it? But we had a disposal, so I think that if you

990
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:10,560
turn it on, it cuts up the yeah, I'm supposed to make an a only in your this

991
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:14,800
is a this is a tip for renters. If you have a garbage disposal, pour that oil

992
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:18,440
directly in your little bit of lemon juice. Yeah, a little bit of lemon juice.

993
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,520
I would turn the garbage disposal on. There goes a mayonnaise and that's a

994
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:24,840
really high speed thing because it's supposed to cut up chicken. Well, you

995
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:28,800
need an egg. You need to put one egg. Yeah, not with how fast this is going

996
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:32,400
to blend whatever. All you have to do is you just reach past the blades, put a

997
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,400
plug in under there, put in all your ingredients, flip the switch, blend it up.

998
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:42,800
He's been abbreviated and then you take a straw and you can either drink it

999
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:48,280
right out of the sink drain or you can do a little siphon action. You put your cup

1000
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:52,180
on the ground long straw. When the plumber shows up, you open the door, you're

1001
01:02:52,180 --> 01:02:55,500
wearing a leather jacket. He's not going to fuck with you. No, you got a bunch of

1002
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:56,580
chains all over

1003
01:02:56,580 --> 01:03:00,380
leather jacket with the chains. You're looking like Robert Halford. Do something

1004
01:03:00,380 --> 01:03:04,200
basically like Robert Kelly. I ate 4000 doughnuts right before I opened the door

1005
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:08,800
powder all over my face. What the fuck is up plumber? Well, you're mad at me

1006
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,720
because I made a I made a baby wipe mayonnaise.

1007
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:12,220
I

1008
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:17,080
fucking

1009
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:22,720
you should have got a real job. I mean all you have to do to the plumber is say

1010
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:26,880
it wasn't me. It was my neighbor. Yeah, I the guy before me. Yeah, I'm renting. I

1011
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,280
don't know anything about this shit man. I'm renting. This was the person that

1012
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:36,840
just make this face. I don't know shrug and you wide eyes. Oh or or make a

1013
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:40,160
here's how you let him how you make them. Let you flush make the plumber laugh.

1014
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:44,080
The plumber comes, he's doing a routine. He routine he's just trying to fix your

1015
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,560
sink. You have a leaky faucet or something, and then he's leaving. He's

1016
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:49,160
like, yeah, I'm finishing up. He said, oh, before you go, I have something for

1017
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:52,520
you. I know I'm not supposed to throw these away. Giant bucket of all my

1018
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:56,720
shitty baby wipes with all my diarrheas from a year. Yeah, I can't say here you

1019
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:59,520
go. I know that you don't want me to flush these, so I figured here you go,

1020
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:04,520
and here's all my oil, and here's also all my oil, my bacon grease and my bones

1021
01:04:04,520 --> 01:04:09,040
and many, many bones that I did not want to flush or yeah, you can make a stew

1022
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:13,080
of these. Yeah, so go ahead, knock yourself out. Yeah, you're gonna knock

1023
01:04:13,080 --> 01:04:17,020
yourself out with the smell of these. What the smell of my apartment has been

1024
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:21,240
bad because of the chloroforming the plumber. It's just shit. Yeah, stinky

1025
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:21,760
duty.

1026
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:23,320
Oh, you

1027
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:29,680
three miles in the face. Terrible. There was a kid that was telling me about in

1028
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,880
high school. This kid was telling me about jencom and how poop if you

1029
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:37,640
ferment it is like it could get you high. And he told me in the same vein is

1030
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:44,480
chloroform if you take it to your fingers and put it on your taint and you put it

1031
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:49,280
up to your nose it can knock you out. I heard that too actually. That could have

1032
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,680
might have done this might be a repeat story. That might be a repeat story. I smelled

1033
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:58,840
pretty bad. After a hit session, throwing that ball on the ground. Oh yeah.

1034
01:04:58,840 --> 01:05:04,720
That's a good workout. I love that one. You hate it. I love it. He begs not to do it every time.

1035
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:07,520
I beg not to do it every time, but then when I'm in the middle of it, the rush

1036
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,620
of adrenaline, I guess, like throw a ball. Tell them about the workout that

1037
01:05:10,620 --> 01:05:12,320
he likes and what it looks like.

1038
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:18,880
So we do dips on chest day and there's a machine that does yeah, it's the so

1039
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,240
we're all doing the dips, the standing dip where you're just lifting your body

1040
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,480
up. If you don't know exercising, yeah, you're lifting your body up with with

1041
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,140
your arms and I did the scene. The dip is where you sit down and you hold two

1042
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:34,620
the bars that extend behind you and you you do this same motion like this

1043
01:05:34,620 --> 01:05:39,520
and it completely looks. I would say pat only likes to see to dip. He doesn't

1044
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:42,400
like the standing one do this. He won't do the sending one. He only does the

1045
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:47,920
one working my way up to it and the it looks exactly like he's. I was saying he

1046
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:52,820
only does the seated dip because it's genetic memory of being an Irish peasant

1047
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:57,060
carrying a wheelbarrow full of potatoes across a bumpy road. I want to get a

1048
01:05:57,100 --> 01:06:01,360
video of it because it looks that even the posture you use for it is unlike

1049
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,480
anybody I've ever seen. Use that yeah

1050
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:10,020
a ride. Yeah, it's also it's a face while you do it, it's bumpy dirt road

1051
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:11,260
with a wheelbarrow of

1052
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:17,520
cabbage and then it's also it's also an Irish indentured servant in America,

1053
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:18,420
like

1054
01:06:18,420 --> 01:06:23,900
carrying a rickshaw with the American times for the first millionaire in

1055
01:06:23,940 --> 01:06:25,940
America, the slave of

1056
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:31,980
Rockefeller, I've done I've done research on my ancestry. No there. I

1057
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:36,580
think some people on my mom's side came over from the potato famine. Yeah, so

1058
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,860
there's no way that that is not a genetic memory. This I think you've

1059
01:06:39,860 --> 01:06:44,900
unlocked. Yeah, you needed to look up documents to find out that your Irish

1060
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:47,180
heritage maybe had experience being peasants.

1061
01:06:47,180 --> 01:06:49,940
What do you mean by that

1062
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:57,480
peasant race. Yeah, fully all three of us. It's okay. All right, we're going on

1063
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,420
tour. Yeah,

1064
01:06:58,420 --> 01:07:03,860
with with world's biggest army. It's us home planet and Pierce Campion going to

1065
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:09,420

1096
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,400
voice, hearing this voice saying you getting this, you had a call. I was

1097

gonna say I wouldn't know when you pull up to the

1098
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,500
my scenario is you imagine being a ketchup lover and yeah getting that

1099
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:49,960
mustard.

1100
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,640
My scenario is you pull up to the McDonald's, you pull up to the

1101
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:56,240
McDonald's drive through, you say hey yeah, can I get

1102
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,880

1107
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:15,320
This is the this is the cashier who's talking to you through the speaker and

1108
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:17,300
and that's actually pretty funny. I guess I'm playing the guy in the

1109
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:20,920
restaurant. Okay, cool you so just get ready for your big your big moment

1110
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,500
because it's coming up again, but it was very funny for that to happen for

1111
01:09:24,500 --> 01:09:29,160
someone for you. Pull out you pull up to the to the drive through and you're

1112
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:32,680
saying like yeah. I want a burger and then say oh yeah, I bet you do want a

1113
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:36,180
burger on and then you pull it. They're like okay, next one. Don't you pull up

1114
01:09:36,180 --> 01:09:39,380
and it's just the guy you just there for the looking very stupid. You're like

1115
01:09:39,380 --> 01:09:40,120
sorry about that

1116
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:48,180
the window. I forgot about this part of it. I'm new here. I forgot you were

1117
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:51,280
going to see me. He's my first day on the job yeah, he's like

1118
01:09:51,280 --> 01:10:02,020
he ducks down really quick and then he throws the bag in the car like a

1119
01:10:02,020 --> 01:10:04,120
grenade. The restaurant is like

1120
01:10:04,120 --> 01:10:06,660
and then the guy in the restaurant is like

1121
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:14,780
This is so much better than McDonald's in Paris.

1122
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:17,780
[Laughter]

1123
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,780
