Nice.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
Nice!

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Original recipe episode. Are you excited, dude? It's been so long.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I know.

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
I don't even remember what this is like without Patrick.

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,800
I know it's better, but I don't remember what it's like.

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,640
what it's like.

12
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,880
- Oh, there's less stories.

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
- Less stories, less cross talk.

14
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,880
- Less crying.

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,680
- It takes up less, the video call takes up less space

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:38,720
on my desktop.

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:41,240
- Yeah, it's just easier to edit.

18
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,340
- Easier to edit, yeah, true.

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,840
What else?

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,640
Less N-word saying.

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
- Yeah, that we have to cut out in post.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,080
- That we have to cut out, we do cut a lot of that out.

23
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:01,800
It takes like me like five hours to edit each episode. We record episodes six weeks in advance

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,420
Yeah

25
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,760
Just so that you can do

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,780
As many scrubs as you can of the episodes trying to get rid of all the inbox drops

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,880
He'll do he'll do this thing where he just whispers in into somebody else's microphone

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,980
So yeah, just make sure I can't just mute his his track

29
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:22,920
Define you have to go he'll hack it'll even when we're like apart for quarantine

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,760
He'll somehow find a way to make the zoom call make the audio come from the other channel. Yeah

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:34,860
The we sent we tried to export the work. We tried to add to a to like a firm in China

32
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,000
That does that kind of thing?

33
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:43,200
But it was so much work that all the workers ended up killing themselves jumping out of the factory fire

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,160
They cause a yeah. Yeah, cuz the computer blew up

35
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,380
It was struggling too hard and then they made evil Chucky

36
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,200
Yeah, and then that's when they made evil Chuckie. Yeah, that's actually the backstory. Did you see the new child's play the remake?

37
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:01,760
No, I'm is it um, it's pretty good. But um

38
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,400
It's not it's not come out. Uh

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:10,800
2019 sometime. I don't know. Um, I saw with Alex and when we saw it some guy

40
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,640
There were two insane things during that movie there in the theater some first there was like this

41
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,520
You know like how they'll do is nothing where it's like a super tense build up to a jump-scare

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
and then it'll just go like silent for a minute.

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,840
Yeah.

44
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,600
Like so it was like, "Doooooo!"

45
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,880
And then there was silence.

46
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,320
And then someone in the back of the theater farted really loud, right?

47
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,840
In the silence.

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,440
[Laughter]

49
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,520
Did you guys, was your first thought like, "That's a weird thing to put in the movie"?

50
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,640
I was just laughing for like 10 minutes.

51
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,040
Just like...

52
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,920
That's so funny, dude.

53
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,000
And then also in the second half of the movie, somebody in the back of the theater,

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,840
probably the same person, fell asleep and started snoring really loud.

55
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,080
(laughing)

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,840
- So there's me and someone going like (snoring)

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,280
(snoring)

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,380
- Have you ever fallen asleep in a movie?

59
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,480
- No.

60
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,740
- No, never? - I've come close to it.

61
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,000
No, I'm getting banged for my buck, man.

62
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,840
- True.

63
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,520
When I had MoviePass, dude, that was such a bizarre time

64
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,120
in I feel like everybody's life.

65
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,520
- If it was raining out, I would just be like,

66
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,460
"All right, I'm gonna go see a movie

67
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,200
"'cause I don't wanna see the rain."

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,480
- I skipped like so many classes that semester

69
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,720
that MoviePass existed.

70
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,140
And I would just go to movies and I would just fall asleep in all the movies.

71
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,240
I would just sit in the very back row and text.

72
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,860
Yeah, that's the best.

73
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,560
It gave you this ability to just watch a movie like you were watching it at your house.

74
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,560
Like it didn't matter.

75
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,840
You didn't care if somebody talked over it or whatever.

76
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
So great.

77
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,600
Do you remember when we went and saw Three from Hell?

78
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,760
Yeah.

79
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,500
And we were both just like so freaked out by like all the people in that fucking movie

80
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,500
theater.

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,180
people walking around. Yeah, there's like people walking around, there's people with like

82
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,760
big bags and also just like a Rob Zombie movie every like a Rob Zombie movie with

83
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:03,540
a limited release. Yeah. Everybody in the audience looks like a shooter. Yeah. You

84
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,700
know what I mean? Like that's like his demo. Everybody's there to do the devil's work. Yeah, yeah. And so yeah I

85
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,700
had I kept like going to the bathroom. I feel like I went to the bathroom like six

86
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:16,740
times. Yeah. Last movie I saw in a theater was Birds of Prey and that's our I've

87
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,740
I've already that was already when I was having like movie theater shooter

88
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,600
anxiety and I was already like man I do not want to go to the theater ever again

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,180
but I was like okay I'm gonna go see Birds of Prey with my girlfriend.

90
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,520
Yeah well didn't know it was just like a date night so it's like alright I can

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,720
risk it for date night you know and then literally um so partway through the

92
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,620
movie a guy wearing a trench coat and sunglasses came up to oh so me and and

93
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,660
luckily it was just three kids trying to sneak into the movie. Me and Anna were sitting

94
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,940
like somebody had taken our seats and then we got there a little late so the

95
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,660
movie had already started so we didn't want to like ask them to move so we just

96
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:00,660
like sat in other seats yeah and so yeah and then so like halfway through the

97
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,660
movie some guy comes in with sunglasses and a trench coat on and he he just

98
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:10,660
stands next to us like he just stands next to us for like 10 minutes just

99
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,980
standing up like and i was just freaking out and then he just go he goes up to the

100
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,020
very back of the theater and sits in the very back and i was like oh yeah we're

101
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,940
gonna die and then like 10 minutes before the end of the movie he walks

102
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:25,220
down from the back of the theater he walks up to us like stands next to us

103
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,500

118
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:40,140
fix mass shootings. Unless I get to a point I'm like well they took care of it. I mean

119
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:44,180
that's I'm pretty sure that's what they were trying to do with 5G and it

120
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:50,460
accidentally caused coronavirus. It accidentally caused coronavirus. They're trying to smooth out the minds of

121
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:55,700
shooters. Gotcha. They're trying to cure this condition called shooters mind. I

122
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:00,940
have a shooters mind. Yeah I can't help it I just look around and I see I see the

123
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:09,700
ducks from duck hunt on it overlaid over everybody's faces. Oh my god. Dude, I'm back to being paranoid

124
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:17,460
about my Joe Biden video getting me in trouble. Yeah. I feel like I'm immune just because

125
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,340
I can be like, "Your Honor, it was not posted on my account." Yeah, no, yeah. I mean, yeah,

126
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,700
I felt when I got that viral tweet that was like, "I'm gonna vote for Joe Biden in the

127
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,780
head until he wins. I was like I also started to freak out about that, but then

128
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,100
I was just like just not because like I like I just I now would be such a

129
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,420
terrible time for like people to show up at your door. Yeah. Like I'm not like I

130
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:44,700
don't want to go something you know what I mean? I don't want to take me somewhere

131
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,500
for questioning. Yeah if it was like if it was like in the middle of like finals week in

- It sucks.

135
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,740
It's crazy that they're still doing school.

136
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,660
- I can't believe it.

137
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,540
I can't believe I'm supposed to care about this shit, dude.

138
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,500
It's so stupid.

139
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,780
- I just feel like you don't have to.

140
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,420
You can coast so hard.

141
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,740
- I have been, but I still, like the thing is,

142
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,620
I have a fucking paper due this Sunday

143
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,300
that's 25% of my grade in a class.

144
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,500
So it's like, I can only coast to a degree.

145
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,900
- You should be like the Van Wilder of online college.

146
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,720
Just like--

147
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,220
- I don't know who that is.

148
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,340
like from the the national and you're talking about you're thinking of rip van

149
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,060
winkle the guy who fell asleep for a hundred years

150
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,620
that's what i'm thinking of

151
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,640
no you should just be in the zoom calls you should just be in the zoom calls like getting a blowjob

152
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,340
underneath like like right outside of the frame of the video you know

153
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,940
playing flash games and stuff and your professor just keeps going like

154
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:46,020
van wilder what are you doing

155
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:49,060
you're like sorry buddy i have just skipped all the zoom calls

156
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:52,940
uh... yeah i mean because i've only been to like two of them because you can just be like

157
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,180
"Oh, everyone else in my house has to work from home,

158
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,780
"so my Wi-Fi can't handle that many people on meetings."

159
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,880
And then every once in a while,

160
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,780
the teacher will be like,

161
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,460
"Okay, you have to come to this one."

162
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,300
And I'll be like, "Fine."

163
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,140
And then, yeah, I just played Bloons 3 on Cool Math Games.

164
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,340
- Fuck yeah, dude. - Yeah.

165
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,980
It's hell, dude. - I gotta get into Bloons.

166
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,260
That's what my younger brother's been trying to make me do.

167
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,180
- Bloons was all I did in LA.

168
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,020
- That was, um...

169
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,860
(laughing)

170
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,620
- So, I played Bloons in class.

171
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,500
- Oh my God, dude.

172
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,540
- And LA put me in such a flash game hole.

173
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,340
I played so much Bubble Spinner in that fucking class.

174
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,820
- I've been playing Hedgehog Launch 2.

175
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,660
You like that one?

176
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,740
- Oh shit, dude.

177
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,620
- I've been just listening to Longmont Potion Castle

178
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,460
and playing Hedgehog Launch.

179
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,460
That's what I've been doing most nights.

180
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:42,020
- I should, I've been trying to find good games

181
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,220
for my phone.

182
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,060
- Yeah.

183
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,540
- But there's like no, there's not a single good.

184
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,040
- You can, the good ones are like,

185
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,120
- There are really good like roguelikes,

186
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,860
if you like, which are just like lame though, is the thing.

187
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,920
Like you just have to already be into roguelikes.

188
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,760
- Yeah.

189
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,900
- Or like, there's good like card games too.

190
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,260
- Yeah, I guess I could play Eternal.

191
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,700
I should get back into Eternal.

192
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,860
- Eternal rocks.

193
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,700
- It's a fun game.

194
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,940
- But like Dream Quest, also all the good ones

195
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,820
have just really ugly art 'cause they're just made

196
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,580
by like random programmer guys

197
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,220
who just make them by themselves.

198
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,780
Dream Quest is probably the best iOS game.

199
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,860
If anybody likes card-based roguelikes out there,

200
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,180
that's my that's my recommendation is dream quest i dream and many hours into

201
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,660
that game

202
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,620
very good it's the ugliest game ever though it's like somehow a step below ms

203
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,220
paint graphics

204
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,300
like if you look at dream quest it's it looks like it was a little new

205
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,780
grounds games it's work it's like

206
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:39,460
the worst graphics i've ever seen in the game

207
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,540
it's worse than pong

208
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:46,420
it's it's worse than dirt on the ground

209
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,340
has worked on the ground is good that's a great graphics than paper google dream

210
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:53,860
quest you'll see what i mean search it right now yeah this does look pretty bad

211
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,260
it's like yeah it's like i loved it i love the little they really they really

212
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:03,500
they obviously like hired some shitty uh some shitty like online artists to do the

213
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,340
little icons for the people yeah it's like because it is not the person who did

214
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,980
the rest of the art like the russian deviant art it's like knockoff deviant

215
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,900
art art yeah it looks like uh like uh chris chan yeah and then like the all the

216
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,300
The icons are just stick figures.

217
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,140
It's great.

218
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,960
- Fuck that rules.

219
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,800
- But it's a great game.

220
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,140
Really, really fun.

221
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,540
- I've just been playing RuneScape.

222
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,920
That's what I found.

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,300
Yeah, Krause.

224
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,700
Krause put me onto the mobile RuneScape.

225
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,820
- Shout out to Krause.

226
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,420
- Shout out to Krause.

227
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,820
They put me on the mobile RuneScape

228
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,460
and I've just been cutting wood, dude.

229
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,300
- Yeah.

230
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,140
- It's so boring.

231
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,780
I don't know how I ever liked it when I was a kid.

232
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,620
- Yeah.

233
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,020
- Like RuneScape, it's only the grinding.

234
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,780
There's no like, like every, every,

235
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:51,500
like there's no voice acting or like anything interesting

236
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,340
about the game. - I mean the trick with gaming

237
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,780
and stuff like that is you just have to take

238
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,100
like the gaming red pill, which is just like,

239
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,620
games are nothing, games are just numbers

240
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,140
that you watch go up, it doesn't matter what you're doing

241
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,600
and then you'll be happy just like, yeah,

242
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,980
just playing like, press the space bar 100 times.

243
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,820
Like, 'cause then it's just like--

244
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,660
- True, cookie clicker. - Like, well yeah.

245
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,620
- Cookie clicker maybe is like one of the best games ever.

246
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,940
- That is, yeah. - 'Cause as far as like

247
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,400
enjoyment. - Yeah, shit like that.

248
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,320
Once you just realize, oh, I don't need to see a cool monster

249
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,440
and listen to cool music.

250
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
I can just click the mouse a bunch of times.

251
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,360
It's just like, it's a fast travel forward in time.

252
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,160
That's all it is.

253
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,160
- Yeah, I've been trying to play more story games, though.

254
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,000
- Yeah.

255
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,200
- Like, I played Firewatch.

256
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,560
I just like all those gay girl games.

257
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,400
- Yeah.

258
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,240
- You know, anything that's like--

259
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,640
- Pregnant Princess Dress Up.

260
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,320
- Pregnant Princess Pussy Press--

261
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,920
- Pussy Pimple Popper.

262
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,640
- Press the Pussy, which is one of the,

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,560
sort of like it's a cookie clicker for girls where you just keep pressing the

264
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:52,200
clit and and trying to make the girl come yeah but it's your own hand yeah but

265
00:12:52,200 --> 00:13:00,080
it's a game called vagina simulator and you just keep trying to make it come but

266
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:06,720
it's completely impossible and that's the lesson of the game is that you can't

267
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:13,600
make one orgasm no matter what you do you get it gives you you can literally it's

268
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,880
it's like it's like that game where you fucking draw things or whatever and they

269
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,560
appear it's like that yeah but you but you put anything you want in it and it

270
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,320
won't happen scribble nuts scribble nuts that's what it is I love that yeah I'm

271
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,440
Try a cucumber yeah

272
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,480
Does a very loud

273
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,120
Big red X. It's really loud. It's scary. Yeah, and then the girl falls asleep

274
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,120
And you have to you have to wait

275
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,040
Wait 24 hours

276
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,640
full hours

277
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:55,960
Yeah, this is the girl is sleeping. Please log back later

278
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,200
Because the other lesson is that girls sleep all the time

279
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:05,440
Girls will stop sleeping and they're impossible to make come

280
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:13,920
Recommending movies

281
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:22,360
Watch Anna Karenina stop trying to make me come and watch Anna Karenina. Yeah, let's go to the store

282
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:33,480
It takes a week. You have to go to the store and she won't leave the makeup aisle and all

283
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:38,660
of this you only see from the like you just see the vagina in the store. You just hear

284
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:48,240
the sounds of a store. And then it comes with it's a and then it's paired with a partner

285
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,880
game called penis simulator and you scroll your cursor over the penis and it comes.

286
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,400
You launch the game and instantly it comes.

287
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,520
It comes right onto the screen.

288
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
Yeah.

289
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,600
And then you can never open it again.

290
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,600
It's always a high score.

291
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,600
Yeah.

292
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,600
Exactly.

293
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,200
Yeah, there's a leaderboard with everybody who's ever played it and they all have one

294
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,760
point.

295
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,840
We should design a game.

296
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,320
We're good at this.

297
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,120
Yeah, we should.

298
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,720
What about Monkey Quest?

299
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:22,720
Alright.

300
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,400
Yeah, you are a monkey.

301
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,760
And you live in the jungle.

302
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:32,520
You live in the, not only do you live in the jungle, but you have to get bananas.

303
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,640
Oh my god.

304
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:42,480
You have to get a hundred bananas before a gang of...

305
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,960
Of men with yellow hats.

306
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:50,680
South American natives eat your brain. Okay. Yeah, out of a bowl. Yeah. They use

307
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,640
your skull like a bowl and they heat your brain up in the microwave. They have

308
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,960
microwaves but they still eat monkey brain. Do you think there's a god that lives in the

309
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:01,800
jungle? Do you think there are any gods in the jungle? I think there is a god and

310
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:09,360
he does live in the jungle. And he is a monkey. Yeah. Yeah. He hates

311
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:15,040
hates TV and modern stuff. That's why he stays in the jungle.

312
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,040
What if Dr. Manhattan was a monkey? Think about that for a minute.

A blue monkey? Yeah. He gets like Dr. Manhattan god powers

Yeah, it's like when you're in like middle school. It's just like oh I wanted a comic book that has that's

332
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,200
Says blood or nudity in this. That's what's cool

333
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:31,880
And you borrow from your friend and then you give it back with all the pages fused together

334
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,120
Yeah

335
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:40,800
It must have gone stale yeah

336
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:43,040
(laughing)

337
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,280
- When did you buy this?

338
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,680
I think it expired while it was in my possession.

339
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,560
'Cause all the pages are stuck together.

340
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,680
- Yeah, I think I used it up.

341
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,480
Yeah, I turned the pages for the last time

342
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
and they just, they turned off.

343
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,400
- They just melded into one big page.

344
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,220
- Yeah.

345
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,160
- I wanna do the thing where I need to find a book

346
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:07,280
big enough that I can glue all the pages together

347
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,280
and then build a compartment in it.

348
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,980
But I don't know what I would keep in the compartment because you don't really smoke weed

349
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:16,380
And I don't have anything to hide

350
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,600
You know, yeah

351
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,000
You put water in it. What did you put food in?

352
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,560
Some lips, yeah

353
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,880
It's my lunchbox

354
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,920
Yeah

355
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:37,760
Like somebody finds your chips and that's fine. Yeah, and then I said it with my gun

356
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:43,120
Yeah, you can keep on my desk put more chips into it. That's a good point

357
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,500
I want to get I just want to be rich enough that I can build one of those secret doors in my house that I move

358
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,800
like, you know, I move a copy of

359
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:56,360
But I'm like I make the book like a

360
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:03,280
Something really stupid like a Malcolm Gladwell book. Yeah. Yeah, I make that they move what what the dog saw

361
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,320
Yeah, a secret compartment opens up. Yeah

362
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,680
and it's a more Malcolm Gladwell books it opens up and it's just a sign that says

363
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:17,280
you have terrible taste in books you are an idiot

364
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:23,760
psychology you try to take yeah you try to take outliers off the shelf it just

365
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:33,240
shoots you in the head it's just a string with a gun yeah yeah yeah but if

366
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,680
try to take the official Pokemon strategy guide gives you a cookie. It gives you a

367
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:42,480
yeah it gives you a cookie falls out of where the book was. Yeah. So that trap is you

368
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:50,920
just hide a cookie behind the book. The ultimate trap. Yeah but with a Malcolm Gladwell book you put a

369
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:57,680
venomous cobra behind the book. We found when we were I'm helping Janna

370
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,440
like move Janna's parents move stuff out of their cabin their like storage cabin

371
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:09,600
and yesterday we we like brought some stuff into like a different like storage

372
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,400
shed that they have with it does not have a door and we walked in and there was I'm

373
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,800
not exactly was the there was the biggest snake I've ever seen in my entire life

374
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,520
just like looking at us and we just threw all the stuff at it like all these boxes

375
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,640
and then ran away and it's probably still in there damn yeah you had like a

376
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,140
- It's what they said, but when I was a kid,

377
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:38,360
we would catch snakes, and like venomous ones,

378
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:43,360
like cottonmouths and like copperheads and shit,

379
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,400
'cause they're very common in North Carolina.

380
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,760
And we didn't know what they were though,

381
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,520
so we'd use sticks and me and my older brother

382
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,000
would bring them into our house

383
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,240
and let them like slither around the hallway.

384
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
(laughing)

385
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,160
and my mom would be like, "What the fuck are you doing?

386
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,000
"What is this?"

387
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,800
It's our monster that we found.

388
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,840
- Yeah, this is our Pokemon.

389
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,280
- Have I ever told you about the Serpentarium

390
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,480
around town? - Yes, yeah.

391
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,800
- Dude, I drove by it the other day.

392
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,480
It's so sad.

393
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,600
Now, the Serpentarium, I don't know if I've talked about it

394
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,600
on the podcast, maybe I have, but it's basically,

395
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,920
it was a snake museum run by a crazy guy,

396
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,080
and the gift shop was filled with propaganda

397
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,240
about chemtrails.

398
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,080
- Yeah.

399
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,080
- That was like we had to enter and exit through that area.

400
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,920
And also birds, like parrots that were not in cages.

401
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:40,700
- Is that what Banksy based his movie off of?

402
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,720
- Yeah, yeah, it was actually,

403
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,680
he based it off of the serpentarium

404
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,280
in Wilmington, North Carolina.

405
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,780
But you would walk in and then,

406
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:50,960
and it would just be like every snake

407
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,480
that the guy who owned it had ever been bitten by,

408
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:58,480
And then also his fucking, what's that thing called?

409
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,920
The monster.

410
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,980
- The monster?

411
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,720
- What is it called?

412
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,500
The dragon, Komodo dragon.

413
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,320
(laughing)

414
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:10,640
I wanna have the monster, the Japanese monster.

415
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,340
So he had a Komodo dragon that was like more his pet

416
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,180
than anything else.

417
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,020
- Yeah.

418
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:21,200
- And he would personally go in and feed all these snakes.

419
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,040
- Yeah.

420
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,140
and it never went well.

421
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,440
Like you'd feed them once a day

422
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,900
and every Yelp review for the place,

423
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,860
every single one of them was just like,

424
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,360
yeah, he tried like feeding the alligator,

425
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,340
like the anaconda while I was there

426
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,500
and it got out.

427
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
(laughing)

428
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,080
It started chasing like my kid.

429
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,160
And then,

430
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:46,820
and then it closed because the guy's wife

431
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,320
shot him in the face because he was throwing snakes at her.

432
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,520
- Yeah.

433
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
That's awesome dude.

434
00:23:52,520 --> 00:24:00,040
And then Janna's like a family friend of Janna's ended up adopting their baby.

435
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Yeah.

436
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,040
Damn.

437
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,080
But then so anyway it used to be this awesome place and now they took the building and they

438
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
turned it into the Museum of the Bazaar.

439
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,720
Ugh.

440
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,520
Which is, oh it sucks.

441
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,520
It's like five dollars of admission.

442
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,080
Those kinds of places are always awful.

443
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,600
They're so terrible.

444
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,520
say um it's it's basically like it's one of those things where they just get like

445
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,880
a like I don't know like a petrified bat or something yeah they'll have like a

446
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,600
Dracula yeah they'll have like a glass case full of like Star Wars Funko Pops

447
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:35,720
and be like this is these are bizarre memorabilia yeah these were owned by

448
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:43,000
John Wayne Gacy fans clown no yeah all all those those places my my ghost

449
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,040
Hunter uncle did an investigation of the Museum of the Bizarre. Did we watch that?

450
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:52,520
I think we did watch that yeah yeah I do remember that. Yeah and he was like

451
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:58,840
there was like something it was like it was like like a skull. I just remember

452
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,200
him holding like the meter over it and he's like there's definitely something

453
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:09,680
going on with this skull. Yeah there's something going on with it. We should do a Ghost Hunter

454
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,780
episode that's a good idea that's a really good idea yeah maybe we should

455
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:20,120
delete what I just said one of my favorite back to snakes one of my

456
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:23,320
favorite Yelp reviews I've ever seen it somebody posted a screenshot of it I

457
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:27,400
haven't been able to find it again I don't remember what it was but it was

458
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:33,280
like a review of um the Hollywood sign and it was just like I tried we tried

459
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:38,480
hiking near the Hollywood sign and my with like my my baby and like the baby

00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:45,820
carriage and the baby got bitten by snakes yeah that's how many stars I was

461
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,360
a one-star review I believe yeah has to be one stars yeah no that sounds like a

462
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:57,240
three-star to me I mean you did yeah you got to see yeah you got a snake action

463
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:04,280
posted by the snake appreciator that's five star the snake lover the baby got

464
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:14,840
bit by snake the baby. Posted by fuck my baby. The snakes are crazy. There's this video of

465
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,480
an anaconda swimming like right after it's eaten so it's just like huge like it just

466
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:25,760
like it's stomach is all like swollen from it's just eating and it's just like so big

467
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:31,760
it's crazy snakes are just are they're. Yeah anacondas are crazy. What 20 feet long or some

468
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,120
Yeah, and then so and then like right after they eat they're just like so thick they're just giant they're like

469
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,920
They're crazy

470
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:46,000
But I could I could fight and kill one. Yeah, I could fold one in half like a piece of paper

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,400
Yeah, like ice cube in the movie. Have you seen Anaconda? Yeah, it's a good movie. It rocks, dude

472
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,600
my favorite part of the movie Anaconda is um

473
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:56,240
the fact that in the

474
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:02,640
The anaconda whenever it attacks it like it rears up and it's about to and it opens its mouth like it's about to bite

475
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,440
You know and it makes there's a noise that snakes make right?

476
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,160
There's a really obvious snake noise like a snake's hiss, but the anaconda in the movie anaconda goes like

477
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:15,320
Like does like a velocity

478
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,360
Yeah, it has a dinosaur voice you guys forget what snakes

479
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,320
It was a pretty clear. They have a pretty iconic sound. It's either a hiss or sometimes a rattle.

480
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Yeah, I don't know whose idea it was to make the snake scream. But it's very stupid.

481
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I'll tell you who it was. It was the voice actor who did that thing.

482
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,320
Yeah, like I'm gonna do something different guys.

483
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Yeah, he was like, guys what if we... No, he's one of the writers. He was like, I can do this cool noise that we can put in the movie.

484
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:53,560
Yeah, it was a producer. It was a guy who just like, yeah.

485
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,080
I'm only funding this movie Ice Cube if I can go, "Reee!"

486
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,880
Yeah, if I can make a pig noise.

487
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,320
Or if the snake sounds like a pig.

488
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,560
I want a pig. I want to do, I want to feed a bunch of pigs something cool.

489
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,880
A human body?

490
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,160
No, not a human body, but like a cow body or something.

491
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,840
Yeah. Did you ever see that movie

492
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,680
where the people, where people are like,

493
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,040
with Danny Trejo, where the people are like half pig,

494
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,840
half zombie or something?

495
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,140
- I don't think so.

496
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,960
- It looks very bad, but it was like,

497
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
it's an old, it was like 2011 or something.

498
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,800
- An old movie?

499
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,680
- Yeah, it's old, it's very old.

500
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,520
- It's an old movie.

501
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,640
(laughing)

502
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,720
- Yeah, but it was just like,

503
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
like the whole concept is like,

504
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,060
we started breeding, we discovered like,

505
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,520
the way to build like a Master Chief Super Soldier

506
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,320
is

507
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,520
bill is made all that's a big people half people have

508
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,200
pete that's a big conspiracy theory and um...

509
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,400
there's i feel i might have talked about this before but there's the i've started

510
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,080
i found this podcast one time online it was called like exo politics radio or

511
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,240
something

512
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,140
yeah uh... was from a specific state is just one guy calling himself on the

513
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,440
telephone somehow like like

514
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,280
who i think he was like calling

515
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,280
he's like his home phone from another phone and like recording the podcast onto

516
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,680
the answering machine

517
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,760
like some something weird like that like he just wasn't using a computer and he

518
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:21,640
would just tell stories about like aliens and stuff and yeah one of them was a

519
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,920
scientists are creating pig human hybrids because there's a coming war

520
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,080
and that's like that's the most powerful soldier

521
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,240
is the same guy who said uh... that uh...

522
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:35,480
uh... there's a virus coming from outer space called the wolf

523
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,520
who named it the wolf uh... that's what it's called

524
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:43,360
that's like it's cosmic name it was like a virus and or an evil entity

525
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,960
he's like he's like a something bad is coming

526
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:49,660
and he might meet you know i think i think we might have gotten in with the

527
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,360
world

528
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,580
it

529
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,680
uh... i think

530
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,820
all my god

531
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,440
we might be susuming right now we might be talking shit about the wolf walls

532
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,640
zooming because of the wolf here

533
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,680
only god sucks

534
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,000
yet this is

535
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,320
we need to get out the fucking the

536
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,480
pig human soldiers to fight the war and yet a crime we we we

537
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,160
yes

538
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,240
(laughs)

539
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,280
- From the wolf.

540
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,280
The wolf will fuck them up too, dude.

541
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,120
- Fuck.

542
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,940
I don't, that's, oh my God,

543
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:22,380
pigs probably can't get it, right?

544
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,080
- Maybe not.

545
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,060
- Maybe that's the key.

546
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,440
Maybe we should splice our DNA with pigs.

547
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,260
- That's not a bad idea.

548
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,960
They're smart, they're pink.

549
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,000
- They're hungry.

550
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,500
- They're, (laughs)

551
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,340
the three best traits.

552
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,320
- And they love mud.

553
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:47,760
We're trying to create a hybrid species with the intelligence of a human and the adoration

554
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,560
of mud that a pig has and the desire for slop.

555
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:58,560
Yeah, and the ugliness of a hog.

556
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:05,160
Yeah, and the friendliness towards spiders of a hog.

557
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,640
The power to grow intensely fat.

558
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,760
To grow huge and giant.

559
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:11,760
I just want some tusks.

560
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,680
Yeah, oh, now that would be cool.

561
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:21,400
I want some tusks, but on my, like on my pelvis so when I have sex the girl can ride it like

562
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,400
a motorcycle.

563
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,400
Right, like handlebars.

564
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:29,720
Yeah, like sitting, or no, you could sit in them like stirrups.

565
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:33,120
Or no, stirrups are on your feet.

566
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,480
I'm gonna also install, I'm gonna install stirrups on my feet

567
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,800
and sort of do a crab walk

568
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,400
and have the girl get on top. Just installing an entire

569
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,480
like a motorcycle along your front side

570
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,120
so they can sit down, like handlebars on your head

571
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,760
and like pedals down your feet. And the girl sees me at the bar and she's like

572
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:00,960
I have to fuck that guy. I've always wanted to fuck a motorcycle.

573
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,800
What's your name?

574
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:02,300
Harley.

575
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:02,800
Motorcycle.

576
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:03,300
Harley.

577
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,500
[laughter]

578
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,160
Motorcycle guy.

579
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Motorcycle.

580
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,660

[laughter]

582
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,860
I thought it would be Davidson.

583
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,360
Why?

584
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,060
Why?

585
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,160
Why? What are you talking about?

586
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,500
You're racist.

587
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Yeah.

588
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,760
Just 'cause I'm white?

589
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,800
You think my last name's Davidson?

590
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,460
Davidson's a white guy's name?

591
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,860
Is that why?

592
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,260
How the hell do you know I'm Greek?

593
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,300
[laughter]

Yeah, I'm Greek and I have a Greek last name. Motorcycle.

597
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,600
Motorcyclopsilus.

598

Yeah, Motorcyclopalypse.

599
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,940
[laughter]

600
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,280
If you could be fused with one item, what would it be?

601
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,020
Uh...

602
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,820
Money.

603
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,180
That's not a bad idea, you sexy son of a bitch.

604
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,820
Yeah, perfectly flat.

605
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:54,620
Oh my god, so flat. Yeah, woven.

606
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:58,360
People think you're paper, but you're woven upon further inspection.

607
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:59,860
Yeah, green.

608
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:04,180
Yeah, when you when you walk out into the light little hundreds start appearing all over you. Yeah

609
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:09,380
And I could just I could pay for things with myself and then crawl out of the register. Yeah

610
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,180
I'll be paying with my cash creditor yourself

611
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,180
I will be paying with myself. Yeah

612
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,780
You can never eat at sweet green

613
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:26,840
Yeah, they won't even let you into sweet green. I hate sweet green because of that one experience

614
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,900
Yeah, where you had to pay for me?

615
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:29,540
Yeah.

616
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,540
In the most embarrassing day of my life?

617
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,040
Yeah.

618
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:35,540
I just don't understand the cashless thing.

619
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,980
It's uh, it's stupid.

620
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:43,380
I mean, you're telling me you're a place where you have to pay for the food,

621
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:46,100
but you don't accept money?

622
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,300
Yeah, no money.

623
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,580
We don't want your money.

624
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,620
What is that?

625
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:50,740
Does that make any sense?

626
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,340
Yeah, we just like to think about money.

627
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,500
Yeah, we just like, we like points.

628
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,940
We take points here, not money.

629
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,580
They're gamers.

630
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:01,220
Yeah, I should be able to exchange my RuneScape money for that.

631
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,220
For Sweetgreen?

632
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,220
Yeah. My GP.

633
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,220
We only take RuneScape gold.

634
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:09,220
Yeah, we only take RuneScape gold.

635
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,220
You can trade. If you have something rare like a party hat,

636
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:14,220
then we'll cater your house.

637
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,220
Yeah.

638
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,220
My hair hurts.

639
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,220
What other items could you be fused with?

640
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,220
What other items would be good?

641
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,220
One of those fish that sings on the wall.

642
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,600
Credit card.

643
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,820
A credit card would be, you'd get a lot of action.

644
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,980
Yeah.

645
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,580
But if you, the thing is, if you were one of those,

646
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,660
if you were one of those singing bass fish,

647
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:41,300
you could just have a beautiful voice.

648
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,460
You'd go on American Idol.

649
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,300
One of the most beautiful.

650
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,620
Go on American Idol and be like, okay.

computer, so I'm really hoping that that was some accident

675
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,460
and then I just get a free computer.

676
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,140
- That'd be pretty sick.

677
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,340
- That'd be so sick, it was like $800.

678
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,180
- Damn.

679
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,660
- It's like the only money that I had.

680
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,580
- I'm gonna try ordering 100 computers from Walmart

681
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,420
just to see if they'll do it for me too.

682
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:08,060
- Yeah, well they delayed it like a week,

683
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,560
so I thought that I would maybe get a credit back,

684
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,900
but a full refund doesn't really make any sense.

685
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,620
So it must have been, but I called them

686
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,560
And the lady that I was talking to was like such an idiot.

687
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:20,860
She had no idea what I was like talking about.

688
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:24,140
And I like it was a complete miscommunication somehow.

689
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,840
And I left her a great review.

690
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,460
And I'm hoping that maybe she accidentally

691
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:31,960
hit the refund button or something and got fired.

692
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,500
(laughing)

693
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,340
That'd be awesome.

694
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,660
(laughing)

695
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,460
- In the big red, that was easy, refund button.

696
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,700
- The refund, yeah.

697
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:42,980
Yeah, when somebody makes no sense to you on the phone,

698
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:44,020
you just press that.

699
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,860
- Yeah.

700
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,440
- Yeah, sorry Aaliyah.

701
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,580
I'll give you the, I'll split the 800 bucks

702
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,940
with you if you hit me up.

703
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,220
- Yeah.

704
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,060
Oh, now there's a good scam.

705
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,980
You tell them you give them half the money.

706
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,420
- Whoa.

707
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,620
- Genius.

708
00:36:57,620 --> 00:36:59,200
- That's not a bad idea.

709
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,040
- Yeah.

710
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,460
Yeah, I just, I haven't been doing much.

711
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,020
I mean, I have school, so I have that,

712
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,060
I'm not super bored 'cause I just gotta do

713
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,340
all this schoolwork stuff.

714
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,900
- Yeah, I mean, I've been just like walking around,

715
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,580
'cause they have like woods behind their house here,

716
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:18,660
so I've just been walking through the woods

717
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,860
and just like, just like picking stuff up.

718
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,940
- Yeah, man, I wish I was near like woods or something.

719
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,780
- I feel like I'm nine years old again.

720
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,940
Like I'm just walking around looking at bugs

721
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,220
and picking up sticks.

722
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,460
And then just like coming back to Jana and being like,

723
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,180
hey baby, look at this cool stick I found.

724
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,980
- Yeah, I'm just going on the damn computer.

725
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,620
Yeah, I'm trying to not go on a damn computer as much because it is it is starting to turn

726
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,020
me into a cyborg.

727
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,420
Yeah, I just I really I just watch for a few hours every night.

728
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,180
I just been watching like rare Slipknot interviews.

729
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,780
So it's a how rare can a Slipknot interview be?

730
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:04,500
Well stuff that was like just on like one VHS in like 1999 or like stuff that like aired

731
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:08,860
one time and like German TV in like 2001.

732
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,820
They're not a German band are they?

733
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,820
They're from Ohio, right? They're from Iowa.

734
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:16,820
Oh, why you are. Oh, why you are you? Oh, why you are.

735
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:19,820
They're from Hawaii, why you? Des Moines. Oh, really?

736
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,820
Hawaiian slipknot. Hawaiian slipknot. There's an idea.

737
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,820
They're pretty cool. They all wear layers. We'll get there.

738
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:28,820
They all wear tiki masks. Tiki masks and coconut bras?

739
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,820
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

740
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,820
I was a huacalui before I was a man.

741
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,820
Yeah. Wait and hula. What about that?

742
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:49,220
Whoa think about that for a minute. Oh my god. Don't blow your mind. Instead of that album Iowa, it's Hawaii.

743
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:54,660
Whoa. The good thing that makes Slipknot Interviews so great is

744
00:38:54,660 --> 00:39:00,220
they want the like brains behind the bands like the band leader is um clown

745
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:05,100
who's the guy who wears a clown mask yeah yeah and he's just like he's the biggest

746
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,140
biggest dipshit like he's just like a faux deep like fake philosophy guy. Uh-huh.

747
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,020
So he just always says like just the stupidest shit, but it's so great. It's so

748
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:19,100
much fun. Like he'll just go and be like yeah you know according to the dark

749
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,980
philosophy of Slipknot we actually we believe that the mask is sort of the

750
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:27,900
truest form of the face and it's about the dark heart that resides within

751
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:33,020
humanity and in a way we're kind of all an infection upon just like like this

752
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,500
says all this shit, it's just like, what are you talking about dude?

753
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,500
Like, what does he play, you said?

754
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,660
He's percussion.

755
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:41,420
He's one of the guys who hits the beer kegs.

756
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,300
But he like designs everything.

757
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,260
He's like a visual artist.

758
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:49,380
And he's the one who made them all wear masks and shit.

759
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:50,500
And he goes by Clown?

760
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,180
Clown, yeah.

761
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,340
Sean Clown Crayhan.

762
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,340
They should add Jim Carrey mask to their roster.

763
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,740
They should.

764
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:02,740
That'd be really-- a lot of energy, I think, it would add.

765
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:08,760
Yeah, or the or the tiki mask from from crash bandicoot. What's a kuaku? Yeah

766
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:23,440
He jumps on every time this Jamaican boy, so she had the Justice League dude, yeah, yeah, they said spider-man

767
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,660
Why did you make a man never get a mass they should make a band out of all the superheroes

768
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:35,620
Oh my god. Oh fuck dude. That's probably what they're gonna do next with the MCU. They're gonna make MCU music

769
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:40,460
I'm surprised there isn't like a

770
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:45,140
Like a serialized podcast. Yeah. Yeah, I bet yeah, I will

771
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:52,260
Yeah, that is weird. I'm right one. I feel like there should yeah, that'll be if it isn't it'll be soon

772
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:59,220
Yeah, like like it's like a story one. Those are always those always suck dude. Yeah, only good one is branch Berg

773
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:05,820
I've never listened I don't listen to podcasts. It's it's really good. It's um, I know I know about it

774
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:09,980
I know absolutely thing. I know I know it. I just never listen to it. Um

775
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:16,200
They uh, you know, it's really upsetting to think about is you know, how like so much like, um

776
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,060
metal music from like the 90s and shit and earlier - it's just like a bunch of it

777
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:27,500
It's just like the lyrics of like the lyrics are just like the plots of horror movies like

778
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:33,980
Like in like 10 years or like 20 years do you think they're just gonna be bands that just like are telling the story of

779
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,900
Infinity War like in their lyrics

780
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:44,460
Just like yeah, it's this tracks called like like the purple specter and it's about Thanos I

781
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:50,460
Want them to do like like a horror movie that's like

782
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:56,340
Eight-legged freaks or a horror song. That's a like it freaks a metal song. I bet there is

783
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,340
- Look at this.

784
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,180
- I love that video.

785
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,020
- Look at this.

786
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,060
(laughing)

787
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,580
- Yeah, I'm also reverting.

788
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:04,500
I'm reverting to just like living the life that I did

789
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,660
when I was like a homeschooled 16 year old.

790
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,580
- Yeah.

791
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,460
- Like I'm just like gaming and just,

792
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:14,660
I look at the phone a lot.

793
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,220
- I'm so surprised I haven't been gaming.

794
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,300
I just haven't gamed at all.

795
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,500
- No Binding of Isaac?

796
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,340
- Nothing.

797
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:24,020
I mean, literally just like Hedgehog Launch and like--

798
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,860
- So funny.

799
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,100
- Flash games, that's all.

800
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:29,080
I mean, I just don't have a, I don't know what it is.

801
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,480
I don't know if it's the attention span or what.

802
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,940
I was, I meant to start playing Death Stranding during this.

803
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:33,780
I still might, but.

804
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:34,860
- You have Death Stranding?

805
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,700
- Yeah.

806
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,300
- Oh my God, you gotta get on it.

807
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,500
- Yeah, but I don't feel like it, I don't know.

808
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:41,740
- Yeah, I mean, the thing is, I also have,

809
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:44,020
like Flash games and shit have kinda ruined my attention.

810
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,780
Oh, you know, Super Mario Maker

811
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,580
ruined my attention span with games.

812
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:50,460
- I gotta get back on Super Mario Maker.

813
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,280
- It's the best.

814
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,040
It's like, the thing is, it's like the only game

815
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:53,880
you ever need.

816
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,700
- It's so good.

817
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:55,540
- So that's why it sucks,

818
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,220
Like anytime I'm like, "Oh, I should put some time into something like with the, uh, like

819
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,220
I should like replay Uncharted or something."

820
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:03,220
Yeah.

821
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,220
Instead, I just play Super Mario Maker.

822
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,220
Yeah.

823
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:07,740
Because I can just be like, "I want to be the fastest guy.

824
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:10,700
I have to beat all these Korean kids on the leaderboards."

825
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:11,700
Yeah.

826
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:17,780
For something called, uh, called, uh, SpongeBob Speed Run 2.

827
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:22,180
With a 0.0001% completion rate.

828
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:23,180
Yeah.

829
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,020
(laughs)

830
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:26,140
- The problem, I'm just not very good at video games,

831
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,980
and so I just, there's always a point when I--

832
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,020
- Hold on, I can't hear you.

833
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,860
- What?

834
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:29,820
- Where'd you go?

835
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,220
- You can't hear me?

836
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,380
- I can't hear you, you're very, very quiet.

837
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,400
- What the F?

838
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:39,340
Well, I did nothing changed on my end.

839
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,180
Hello?

840
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:41,100
- Let me see, maybe I--

841
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:41,940
- I think your headphones are fucked up.

842
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,260
- Oh, my headphones.

843
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,780
- You're so stupid, dude.

844
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:45,620
- I'm sorry, continue.

845
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,100
- I'm just not very good at video games,

846
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:49,200
so just every game I play, there's always a point I get to

847
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,580
where I'm just like, oh, this is too hard for me.

848
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:55,660
like urges like i'd like i'm at the point where it's not enjoyable to play anymore

849
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:59,000
because i'm just i uh... i don't know that's just

850
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,100
some gay is like like persona five i want to finish the game so bad but i'm

851
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,300
just like them at the bar is a garment i would just end up using a walk through

852
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:09,040
unlike the puzzles and shit so it's just like

853
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,580
yeah i always have a high i'd always use walk throughs

854
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,980
like i'd never at when i was growing up i would never ever do like a puzzle

855
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,860
without a walk through absolutely

856
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,780
'Cause I didn't give a fuck about,

857
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,020
I don't care about the puzzle.

858
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,380
Like I just wanted to play,

859
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:25,140
I wanted to, like in "Nights of the Old Republic",

860
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:28,900
there's like a couple puzzles where you like have to move,

861
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:32,100
like on a cube in a way that like everything lights up,

862
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,280
but like every square, one of those puzzles

863
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,580
where like every square lights up some squares

864
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,940
and turns some off,

865
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:40,780
and you have to like leave with all of them lit up.

866
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:41,620
- Yeah.

867
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:44,060
- And I made my grandma do it.

868
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,740
(laughing)

869
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,300
'Cause I couldn't figure it out.

870
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,600
And I was just like, "You have to do this for me."

871
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,180
And she was like, "Okay."

872
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:53,780
It was like the only video game.

873
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:57,020
I don't even know if she knew what it was.

874
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:00,180
She was just like, "Make sure you're not allowed

875
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:04,660
"to leave this room until all of those squares are lit up."

876
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,500
And she did it.

877
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,300
- Dude, in 10 years, kids are gonna be doing,

878
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,500
are gonna be making their grandmothers

879
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,740
finish Pussy Presser for them.

880
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,940
- Yeah, yeah.

881
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:17,100
Yeah, little do they know, their grandmothers will die

882
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:24,820
they finish that fucking game. That's how you get rid of your grandparents. You can say,

883
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:28,540
you gave them the game. Yeah, you can't leave until, you know, you're not allowed to have

884
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:34,460
your insulin until you play Pussy Presser and beat it. Yeah. Pussy Presser, well how

885
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:43,700
hard can that be? Yeah, seems easy. No, wrong. The hardest game ever made. My, I've been

886
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,700
hanging out with my younger brothers nine and

887
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:49,440
just seeing like all the seem like the media that he

888
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:56,780
Like the the games and the TV shows and the videos that he watches and stuff the stuff that he consumes

889
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:58,340
is

890
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,340
so just like

891
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:06,820
Completely blackmailing me in like the craziest way like what what is he's he'll just watch like he'll watch like a two-hour

892
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:09,340
video that is like

893
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:13,140
like all of the like jokes from

894
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:20,860
like Johnny Test. Dude yeah that shit oh my god. Like it's just and it's just

895
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:25,260
somebody being like you smell like a total fart and then on to the next one.

896
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:31,860
It's crazy dude or like or like you like using like throwing slime at my mom. Yeah

897
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:38,020
like it's it's yeah I mean it's not not to like be like yeah all like lame and

898
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:42,700
black pill or whatever but like um no we don't know what they would all this

899
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:45,300
is what computers are gonna do to kids when they grow up.

900
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:46,140
- Oh my God, dude.

901
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:47,300
- Nobody is grown. - It's completely

902
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,500
destroying this kid's brain.

903
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,940
- Just like in general, like you go to a restaurant

904
00:46:51,940 --> 00:46:54,940
and you see a kid who's like six years old

905
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,020
and starts crying and their mom just gives them an iPad.

906
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:00,780
And it's like, that has never been a thing before.

907
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,060
- It's so crazy. - These kids are gonna grow up

908
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,780
and they're just gonna be insane.

909
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,580
They're gonna just be-- - It's like how we,

910
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:10,380
it's like how I imagine cavemen would've felt

911
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,720
about like if they saw like toys.

912
00:47:13,720 --> 00:47:14,560
- Yeah.

913
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,400
- You know what I mean?

914
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,220
- Yeah.

915
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,060
- Like that's how I feel about like--

916
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:17,900
- That cannot be good.

917
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:20,220
- Yeah, they're like, you're at a restaurant,

918
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,860
the kid cries, they give them this thing,

919
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,220
they give them a little truck.

920
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:25,800
They're gonna grow up thinking that you can just

921
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,180
get a truck whenever you want.

922
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,020
- Yeah.

923
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,020
- Like that's how I feel, but it is true.

924
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,380
'Cause just like this, you know,

925
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:33,740
just and it's like my younger brother,

926
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:37,440
his entire personality is just like an amalgamation

927
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,400
of Irish YouTubers he's watched play Minecraft.

928
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,240
You know what I mean?

929
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,360
- Yeah, I mean, and also I feel like these kids

930
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,160
are gonna grow up and like at the age of 25,

931
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:49,720
they're all just gonna spontaneously go blind.

932
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,440
Like-- - Yeah, yeah, exactly.

933
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,600
Just like-- - Yeah, just not be able

934
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,320
to read anymore. - Yeah, there's a limit

935
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:58,160
to your eyes that we will never hit in our lifetimes.

936
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,000
- Yeah, but they will hit-- - But they already have.

937
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,760
- By the time they turn 13.

938
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:01,760
- Yeah. - Yeah, exactly.

939
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,360
He definitely has had more screen time in his life than me

940
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,640
at a third of my age or whatever.

941
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,000
- Insane, so scary.

942
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,240
- Yeah, man.

943
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,500
I'm excited to see what that's like.

944
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:15,080
I'm excited to be an old crotch.

945
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,920
I'm excited for what is like the,

946
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,960
it's like a hack, like stand up bit I feel like,

947
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:25,960
but what the thing is that it becomes mainstream in society

948
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,880
that our generation is just gonna be like,

949
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,200
nah, we don't want that.

950
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,040
- Yeah, yeah.

951
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,080
- You know?

952
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:33,920
- Yeah.

953
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,080
- It's like break dancing.

954
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:38,300
- Yeah.

955
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,120
- Yeah.

956
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:40,620
- Yeah, no, it is, 'cause the thing about it is

957
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,780
it's going to be something that we just can't,

958
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:44,380
like we will not be able to under,

959
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,220
like it is incapable.

960
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,340
- Honestly, I think it'll probably be

961
00:48:48,340 --> 00:48:50,500
people will not eat meat.

962
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,620
I think that's kind of the next thing.

963
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,520
And like a lot of people our age will be like,

964
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:56,820
no, meat is--

965
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,100
- It's like so important, yeah.

966
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:00,900
- Yeah, delicious burgers and fries and shakes.

967
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:02,460
- I bet it's gonna be something that we just like

968
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:03,900
can't even comp, like it's gonna be,

969
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,900
They're going to start going into the fourth dimension.

970
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,900
I don't even know what this is.

971
00:49:08,900 --> 00:49:09,900
Yeah, exactly.

972
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:12,900
We're going to be so confused by whatever it is for sure.

973
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,900
Yeah, kids are going to start turning into pure energy.

974
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,900
Kids are going to start duct taping a keyboard to their penis.

975
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:22,900
And they're going to be like, "See, this is normal.

976
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,900
This is what everybody's doing."

977
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,900
And we'll be like, "Why do you have a penis keyboard?"

978
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:31,900
And they'll be like, "All my friends have a keyboard penis."

979
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,020
People are gonna start being able to turn into animals people are gonna start

980
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:42,380
Putting microwaves on their heads. Yeah walking around with yeah, they're gonna have TVs for heads and you can watch

981
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:49,060
Silverstein like that shell Silverstein poem where the kid watched too much TV. Yeah, he became a TV

982
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:53,240
Yeah, we're gonna be like you can't you can't just have a TV. You can't just be a TV

983
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,420
Yeah, and they'll get all this

984
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:04,740
gonna say they're gonna say okay zoomer yeah they'll say okay okay regular head

985
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:08,660
okay me that's the next big thing people are gonna have different things for

986
00:50:08,660 --> 00:50:17,860
heads oh not just anything how about a crate car for a crazy head is that what

987
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:24,420
you're crazy yeah okay what if they had a crazy for a head it's not a bad idea

988
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:29,420
Yeah. Yeah. People are going to start cutting out like removing their noses.

989
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:35,900
Mmm. Go MJ? Flat face. Flat face? That's what it's going to be called. They're

990
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:40,660
calling it right now. You know these women they're already doing stuff like that you

991
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:44,940
know. Absolutely. You just haven't been paying attention to their tyranny. Yeah. I

992
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:49,300
mean if you follow the trend it's just it's a it's there's a graph of flatness

993
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:53,780
of size of the of the of the face shape of the face it's going to be it's going

994
00:50:53,780 --> 00:50:58,260
to be a paper. Exactly. That's I'm the scientist who did a study on it and

995
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:04,340
that's what I had. I think laser beams might be the next big thing. The thing is

996
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:07,100
people have been saying that for like a hundred years. I think it's gonna catch

997
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:13,740
on I think it's gonna next few weeks. What is what is the technology where you

998
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:20,020
officially say like we're in the future? The portal to hell.

999
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:26,220
before that. Have you played Minecraft? I would say like a laser. They can make a

1000
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:30,020
portal to the other side of the earth and I would say no. That's not the future. Not

1001
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:37,500
until we go to hell. So I think for me it's probably like probably a

1002
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:45,380
laser beam gun. Yeah. I think that that's the point like a stormtrooper type

1003
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:49,220
laser beam coming out of the tip of a gun. Yeah. Well the thing is I bet I think

1004
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:50,740
- I think the reason, the thing about that is

1005
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,740
it's always just like, oh, the stuff that we thought of

1006
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:54,820
like as like, oh, this is gonna be the future,

1007
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,340
like back in the day, it was always just like,

1008
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,220
yeah, like laser beam guns,

1009
00:51:58,220 --> 00:51:59,940
it's just like not efficient or whatever.

1010
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,780
Like it's gonna end up being something--

1011
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:01,600
- Yeah, it doesn't make any sense.

1012
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,580
- Like it's gonna be something even crazier.

1013
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,720
Like it's gonna be like a sound gun

1014
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,180
that's so loud that it annoys you to death.

1015
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,020
- Yeah, a poop gun. - You know, it's like

1016
00:52:09,020 --> 00:52:09,840
something that you would just

1017
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:11,060
haven't seen in a movie. - A gun that makes you poop.

1018
00:52:11,060 --> 00:52:13,260
- Yeah, exactly, and it kills you, yeah.

1019
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:14,100
- That would be the most devastating.

1020
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,540
- 'Cause it drains your body of moisture.

1021
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:17,380
Can you imagine if we could drop a bomb,

1022
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,140
like a nuclear bomb that doesn't,

1023
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:25,140
the warhead just hits the ground in the middle of Hiroshima.

1024
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:27,980
We do Hiroshima again, but with this bomb.

1025
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,340
It hits the ground and people are like,

1026
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:31,180
"Oh, it's not exploding."

1027
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,020
And then, yeah.

1028
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,340
God, I have to shit so bad.

1029
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,860
And then it's just, everybody shits until they die.

1030
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:39,220
That is what, that'll be the,

1031
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:41,340
when that happens, I'll say, "We're in the future."

1032
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,260
Yeah, but not until then.

1033
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,780
But not a second before.

1034
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,540
Even a portal to hell can't get me to admit

1035
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,380
that we're in the future.

1036
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:50,340
I refuse.

1037
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,820
Nice burp.

1038
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:53,660
- Thanks.

1039
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,060
- Disgusting monkey.

1040
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:56,540
- Not a monkey.

1041
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,360
- You should be a monkey.

1042
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:01,860
- But if I was, I would be grateful to be considered one.

1043
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,860
So why don't you chew on that for a while?

1044
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:07,460
- I'll chew on it, I'll spit it back at you.

1045
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,940
- Chew on you.

1046
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,660
I'm chewing your little wee wee.

1047
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:13,180
- Because I've been driving around Jana's car,

1048
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:15,300
I didn't think about this, but all my parking tickets

1049
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,220
have been going to her parents' house.

1050
00:53:17,220 --> 00:53:19,020
(laughing)

1051
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:20,640
- You're getting a lot of parking tickets?

1052
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,800
- Yes, I got here.

1053
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,140
And it was just like, I have them all piled here.

1054
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:27,980
They were just like-- - Oh man.

1055
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,300
(laughing)

1056
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,980
- I got here, and they were just like,

1057
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:35,820
"Hey, do you have like 11 parking tickets?"

1058
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:37,500
I was like, "Shut up!"

1059
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,340
(laughing)

1060
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:41,240
Yes. - That's a mistake.

1061
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,820
- Yeah, and so now all of it,

1062
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:45,420
The thing is I'll just never pay them.

1063
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,420
- No reason to.

1064
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,980
- You can kind of just do that.

1065
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,420
As far as I know, you know Angela Sawyer?

1066
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:53,260
- Yeah.

1067
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:58,260
- She, her house, nobody knows who would listen to this,

1068
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,460
but she's a Boston comic who does shows in her house,

1069
00:54:01,460 --> 00:54:05,020
but her entire house is like flyered

1070
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:07,420
with all of her unpaid parking tickets.

1071
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:08,260
- That's sick.

1072
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:11,980
- So that has in my head, I never have to pay this.

1073
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:13,680
But now that I think about it,

1074
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,440
I don't think she has a car anymore.

1075
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:22,800
So that might have factored in.

1076
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:23,920
- Yeah.

1077
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:25,600
- On all my late fees.

1078
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:26,520
- Fuck.

1079
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:29,040
It's pretty sick. - God damn.

1080
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,880
I hope that doesn't fuck up my probation

1081
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,000
and for my speeding ticket.

1082
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,720
- I bet it does.

1083
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,080
- God, that would suck, 'cause then I would go to jail.

1084
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:39,480
- Yeah.

1085
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,560
Right now, too.

1086
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:41,880
- Yeah.

1087
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,000
- That would be dog shit.

1088
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:44,840
- Yeah.

1089
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,100
- And I also haven't paid that fine either.

1090
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,840
Dude, I'm a legal genius.

1091
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,340
I'm out here, I'm not paying any ticket,

1092
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:56,440
I'm threatening authorities online and public officials.

1093
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,580
I'm just, you know, I'm invincible.

1094
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:02,600
- If you go to court with a blindfold on,

1095
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:04,940
they can't send you to jail

1096
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,740
'cause they won't be able to see your face.

1097
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:08,660
- That's true, that's called blind justice.

1098
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:09,560
- Exactly.

1099
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:12,840
And it's because if you go in with a blindfold on,

1100
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,120
it's always justice prevails.

1101
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,380
- Yeah.

1102
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,220
- That's that concept.

1103
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,520
- Well, if you go in with a blindfold on,

1104
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:20,000
you become the judge.

1105
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,560
- Yeah, they make you hold two things and weigh them.

1106
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:26,480
And then if you correctly guess which one is heavier,

1107
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,840
they send you home.

1108
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:28,680
- Yeah.

1109
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:29,520
- And the jury's all just like,

1110
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,320
"Come on, man, we wanted to decide something."

1111
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,160
- Yeah, we were excited.

1112
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:35,360
- Have you ever gotten called for jury duty?

1113
00:55:35,360 --> 00:55:38,040
- I've gone, I, just getting called, getting selected,

1114
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:41,240
I've been called but not selected.

1115
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,400
- Or you've been summoned or whatever.

1116
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,360
- Yeah, summoned, yeah.

1117
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:47,640
- Did you, I got it like three times in North Carolina

1118
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:48,960
and I ignored it every time.

1119
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:51,360
And then at some point I had a warrant for my arrest.

1120
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,240
- That's pretty sick.

1121
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,360
- But I don't think they were related.

1122
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:55,200
- Yeah.

1123
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,960
- I think that was because I was driving without a license

1124
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,320
and they caught me.

1125
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,160
- Uh-oh, uh-oh.

1126
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:01,980
- Oh no.

1127
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:03,280
- I'm done getting in trouble with the law.

1128
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,040
I'm on the straight and narrow from now on.

1129
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:06,880
- Oh yeah?

1130
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:07,860
- What are you gonna do?

1131
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:09,420
- What is a crime you're gonna do?

1132
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:13,760
- I'm gonna play tetherball with a policeman's thingaling.

1133
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,100
- Whoa. - Yep.

1134
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:19,300
I'm gonna go, I'm gonna knock down a building.

1135
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,320
- Well, I don't know.

1136
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:22,160
No, you won't.

1137
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,860
- Yeah, yeah. - No.

1138
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,220
- And you're the one who gave me the idea.

1139
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:28,660
- No, I did not give you that idea.

1140
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:33,300
No, no, I said smoke weed with a bullfrog.

1141
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:34,780
And you said I'm gonna knock down a building.

1142
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:37,860
And I said, I heard the secret message you put in there.

1143
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,180
No, no, that can't be my fault.

1144
00:56:40,180 --> 00:56:41,620
Yeah, I'm going to,

1145
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:46,740
I'm gonna assassinate a Mr. Clean.

1146
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,300
You're gonna assassinate Mr. Clean?

1147
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:50,520
Yeah.

1148
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,800
You'll need a cartoon gun.

1149
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:52,960
Here, take this.

1150
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:57,140
So you can hand it through the screen.

1151
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,140
I've been walking, one of the things that I've been

1152
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:02,860
like helping around doing yard work and shit at the house.

1153
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:06,060
One of the things is they have a carpenter bee infestation.

1154
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:08,580
And these things fuck, they fuck wood up.

1155
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,500
- Yeah, yeah. - Let me tell you that.

1156
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:15,500
These guys love wood and there's like holes in everything.

1157
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,140
And so what they've been having me do

1158
00:57:17,140 --> 00:57:21,700
is they gave me just a tennis racket

1159
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,460
and I've just been walking around

1160
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:26,900
and just absolutely smashing these bees to pieces.

1161
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,060
- Damn.

1162
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:32,540
- It's like the greatest video game I've ever played.

1163
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,260
it's so fun

1164
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,460
here is destroying these 'cause they're huge and they don't sting

1165
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:39,340
over really

1166
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:42,020
yet they don't have stingers so i just go around

1167
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:42,780
and i just

1168
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,580
whale on

1169
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,120
i'd just absolutely

1170
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,260
that sounds like a psychopath behavior to me

1171
00:57:50,260 --> 00:57:50,940
no

1172
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:55,460
you know no is killing animals in your house they're not animals

1173
00:57:55,460 --> 00:57:56,620
there nothing

1174
00:57:56,620 --> 00:57:59,100
there nothing to me

1175
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:02,500
that's the others the healthy mind you know no we talk about

1176
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:05,500
- No, it's okay to skin squirrels 'cause they're nothing.

1177
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,340
- They're nothing.

1178
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:07,700
(laughing)

1179
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,940
The best part is, the best part of it is,

1180
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:12,260
sometimes what I love is,

1181
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,740
sometimes I'll accidentally hit 'em

1182
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,660
too lightly on purpose, right?

1183
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,180
So I'll just incapacitate 'em,

1184
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:19,780
and then I have to destroy their brain with my foot.

1185
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,700
- What the fuck?

1186
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:21,540

(laughing)

1188
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:28,700
Yeah, so I'll just hit it so it's just begging for death.

1189
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,940
And sometimes I'll kill it,

1190
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:31,420
sometimes I'll just leave it there.

1191
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,680
(laughing)

1192
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,220
