1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Perfect.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:07,320
Alright, now we can go.

3
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,400
Should we introduce the podcast first or open the beer first?

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
Man, fuck you!

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,400
I'm sorry, I'm just asking questions.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,560
People know who you are.

7
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:16,560
Open your beer!

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,600
Alright, should I show it before I open it?

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,040
No, dude, you open it.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:26,280
Here, open it and I'll try to guess what it is.

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,280
That is a can of beer.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:37,600
No, that is a can of refried beans that you just opened.

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:46,600
I think you have been mixed up for the guy to my right.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:53,200
Nope on the video Kayla is to your right so you just call him a Mexican honky.

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,920
What do you guys mind?

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:03,920
is a malta, goya malta. That's what I'm guessing. You got it completely right. Yep, here it

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,520
is. That's, you're not drinking beer. There's no way that's a beer. That's a fucking root

18
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:15,520
beer dude. How is this not a beer? How is this not a beer? Show me the label. Show the

19
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:24,520
label. No. Show the label. What are you afraid of? You didn't get a beer. It's a beer. Oh,

20
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:31,700
I did a double trick. I'm drinking a light beer today that I'll actually be able to

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,900
finish. I threw out, I had another one of those stinky beers in the fridge still.

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,980
Yeah. And I think I just threw it out. I don't know what happened to it. Did you

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,420
check to see if that one also had the the infection, the cordyceps infection

24
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:53,340
thing that was sitting on the bottle cap? I preferred not to know. So if I have

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,320
like have cancer which I might because I'm growing a I'm growing a thing on my

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:05,700
head. What? Let it just happen. Wait what are you growing on your head? A little

27
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,260
little tumor. You have a bump on your head and you're talking about this

28
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:16,100
publicly? Yeah. Dude what if this is like the fuck what if this is the beginning

29
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,940
what if this is like yeah dude that's bad you definitely have brain cancer. That's

30
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,940
That's fine.

31
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,940
Doctors there?

32
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:25,940
Yeah.

33
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,940
It's fine.

34
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,940
I'll be fine.

35
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,940
Yeah, I mean it's fine.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,580
I've had a lump on my head for my entire life, so you're probably okay.

37
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
I'm living.

38
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,940
Yeah, but you'd be able to see if it was getting worse.

39
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,100
Yeah, is it red and pounding?

40
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,980
Does it look like a weak spot?

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,980
Did you see it?

42
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,660
Like if I hit you three times?

43
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,420
I would love to fight Jubio in a boss fight.

44
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,420
You know a target just pops on to his head after two critical hits.

45
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:58,420
Oh, absolutely. And you know his eyes go like completely X when he dies.

46
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,420
But then he like, his second stage is... Imagine his giant head

47
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:06,420
as the body of a butterfly, right? And it just has two

48
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:10,420
huge wings that come out of it, like the uh, like the Star Fox

49
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,420
boss. Yeah, but it's made entirely out of taco shells.

50
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,420
I wanted to ask, who do you think would drop the best loot out of all the boss fights

51
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,420
of the three of us, but I think we know who it'd be.

52
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,420
Rex!

53
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,420
Yeah, obviously.

54
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:25,060
Rex, are you kidding me dude?

55
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,420
I'm drinking a Foster's dude.

56
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,420
Oh, nice.

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,420
Look at this beer.

58
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,420
I'm going to, well I haven't had it yet.

59
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,420
I'm going to take a sip.

60
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:38,100
I'm going to have one of these in a minute.

61
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,060
It's pretty hard to sip with a broken neck.

62
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,300
Yeah, I was going to say, you've got to like really just do that motion.

63
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,360
- Yeah, so I've been offsetting it by leaning to the side,

64
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,660
but this is how I have to,

65
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:50,960
I'll sit completely up straight right now, okay?

66
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,800
- Mm-hmm.

67
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,860
- Oh my God.

68
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:55,660
- This is how I've been for two days.

69
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,980
I've been at about a 10 degree angle.

70
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,360
- Dude. - Uh-huh.

71
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,380
- Because, but I'm just kind of doing this

72
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,780
to make it look a little bit normal.

73
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,420
- Oh yeah, you look normal now.

74
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,260
- Yeah, I know.

75
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,660
- I think you just got over it.

76
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,220
- I think I'm fine, actually.

77
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,740
- I caught a glimpse of Rex's beer.

78
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,900
I'm gonna say grape cake.

79
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,380
- I mean, you're not, you're actually not wrong.

80
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,460
- It is grape cake?

81
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:23,300
- No.

82
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,060
- It's grape cake.

83
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,660
- So I guess I'll introduce my beer.

84
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,660
I have a 405 North Lizard Blizzard.

85
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,860
- You need to be killed.

86
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,860
I hope the big one hits right now.

87
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:45,020
slushy super size with blood orange cake mix and lemon drizzle.

88
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,260
Whoa, so it did have cake.

89
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,580
It did have cake, he was right.

90
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
Wow.

91
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,900
Man, you really, for somebody who now has one of the number one beer podcasts in the world,

92
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,900
you really hate beer.

93
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,900
You do not want beer, man.

94
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:09,220
I bought two sours and then I'm going to drink them both and when they're gone I'll drink

95
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:16,220
a different beer. Oh, okay. Damn, he's gonna get crazy. I can't have more than one sour.

96
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:21,900
It gives me diarrhea from being completely honest. Well, I bought these two sours last

97
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:27,900
week, so I drank one, and now I'm drinking this one. And then you have a normal beer.

98
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,980
And then I will have a normal beer. Does someone who doesn't know what sours are, are sours

99
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:37,940
just like the Taylor Quinn style like ice cream drinks that Rex gets?

100
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:43,020
Okay yeah yeah it's like a from what I understand because beer you make beer in

101
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:49,280
a big pot and at that end with the sours at the end you basically you store like

102
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,400
you throw in like all your Halloween candy right at the end that makes

103
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,580
whatever fucking Rex is drinking that cost $12 a can. See Foster's man you know

104
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,220
this is the most popular beer in Australia?

105
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:06,340
- You're kidding.

106
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,540
- No, I'm serious.

107
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,980
- I thought it was the VV Long Neck.

108
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,220
- I don't know what that is.

109
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:16,100
- That one video, that's a VV Long Neck?

110
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,300
Have you ever heard of that?

111
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,700
- I'm really having a hard time,

112
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,980
like I got the first two sips

113
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,260
because it was at the top and it was full,

114
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,460
but from now on I don't know how to sip this.

115
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,520
I like can't move my neck backwards.

116
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,780
You have to dig for it with your tongue.

117
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,420
Oh, I didn't tell you how to do it, right?

118
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,420
No.

119
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,420
You need a straw, by the way.

120
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:42,620
I do need a straw to drink my beer.

121
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,140
You know how dogs drink water?

122
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,140
Where they put their tongue down and then they cup the water?

123
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,780
Oh yeah, I make a little bowl with my tongue.

124
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,780
You have to do that, yeah.

125
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,780
You have to learn how to do that right now.

126
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,780
No, I can't fit my...

127
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,780
I was going to try.

128
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:54,780
You need some sort of horn.

129
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,780
gonna try. You need some sort of horn. You're gonna cut your tongue if you do that. I need

130
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:08,060
a bugle. Yeah, yeah. Okay, what happened to your neck? You need a bong. So listen guys,

131
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:14,460
yesterday I went to the gym, right? That's a man does. And I was doing shoulders, doing

132
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,260
some shoulders, my shoulder day. And I haven't done shoulders in about two weeks. It's the

133
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:22,580
last day of my week and the last couple weeks I've been going out of town on the weekends.

134
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,380
I haven't been able to do my Friday workout.

135
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,860
So yesterday I was like, "You know what?

136
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,860
I'm going to do it.

137
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:29,860
I'm going to go hard.

138
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,020
I'm going to train as hard as I possibly can."

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:39,740
So I got there and I started working out and then this friend of mine, a comedian that

140
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,940
I know, who also goes to that gym that I see there pretty often, he walked in near the

141
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,980
end of my workout and I was like, "Hey, what's up?

142
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,900
Good to see you."

143
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:56,420
And then he posted up at a bench right behind where I was about to do my upright rows, which

144
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,660
is where you take a barbell and you just lift it up to your chin and bring it back down.

145
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:06,220
So I started, and as soon as I started my first one, I was like, "Oh, this is way, way,

146
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,640
way too heavy.

147
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:11,460
This is not the right amount of weight that I'm supposed to be doing."

148
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,460
But I just kept going, right?

149
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:17,300
Because I was like, "I'm not going to try one time and then drop it while this guy I

150
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:21,460
nose right behind me, right? Because then I got to look to him and be like,

151
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,220
Oh, like make some face.

152
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:27,580
So instead I just kept going,

153
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:33,020
but then I felt the worst pain I've ever felt my entire life in my neck because

154
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:37,100
I was straining too hard and I clearly pulled something.

155
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:40,620
But then I had the same problem again where I was like, okay,

156
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,860
I'm not going to yelp out in pain in front of this guy. Like it's only worse now.

157
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,100
Right? So instead of stopping, I just kept going.

158
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,860
I was like about to cry. It hurts so bad.

159
00:08:54,860 --> 00:09:00,700
And I just kept going. And then I finished that exercise. I was like,

160
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:06,380
man, and he's still here. So I just got to keep working out. So then I tried to do two other

161
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:14,220
things. And then eventually I let, uh, I basically had a full on ego death at the gym. And I,

162
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:21,020
I gave up and I went into the locker room and I just laid on the ground for like 15 minutes.

163
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,140
And I was like, "That'll probably be fine."

164
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,480
And then I got up and it was way, way, way worse.

165
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:35,540
And since then I haven't been able to move my neck and I've just been sitting in my bed

166
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,940
and I don't know when I'm going to get better.

167
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:42,900
And I don't even know what to, I don't even know what kind of doctor you go to when you're

168
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,400
and you've just destroyed your entire body.

169
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,580
'Cause basically everything from my waist up

170
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,540
is if I move it, it's in total pain.

171
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,100
I definitely have destroyed my spine,

172
00:09:55,100 --> 00:10:00,100
all of my vertebrae, and maybe my brain as well.

173
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,260
- Yeah.

174
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,900
- You should probably go to an urgent care.

175
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,380
I would call that a-- - Shut up.

176
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,700
- Urgent situation.

177
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,700
- Yeah, anyways, I have two questions here.

178
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,540
Number one, did he even notice that you were there still?

179
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:16,540
I'm not going to look at him to check.

180
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,300
He's not my boyfriend.

181
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,420
I'm just fucking, I just know he's there.

182
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,420
He's a friend of mine.

183
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,420
I don't know him that well.

184
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,420
His name's Kristoff.

185
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,620
He's a funny comic.

186
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:31,860
He was just sitting behind me and I was like, you know what?

187
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,540
I'm not going to do that.

188
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:40,180
So you were doing the opposite of the TikTok gym girl where you're like actually looking

189
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,540
for someone to look at you and you're trying to impress them.

190
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,500
Oh no, I actually felt exactly like the TikTok gym girl,

191
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,020
where I almost wanted to go up to him,

192
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,020
even though he was not looking,

193
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,300
he was minding his own business doing it.

194
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,980
I almost wanted to go up to him and be like,

195
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,260
can you please just turn around?

196
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:57,300
Just literally like, I will pick up the bench for you,

197
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,460
you can stay on it.

198
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,860
Just turn and look the other way.

199
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,780
And if I'd done that, I would not be injured right now.

200
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,600
Yeah.

201
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,300
It was at the point yesterday where like,

202
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,180
I couldn't take a full breath

203
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,140
without just being in the most excruciating pain in my life.

204
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,380
(laughing)

205
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,860
- I think you'll be fine.

206
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,820
- Yeah, I think I am gonna be fine.

207
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,500
- Yeah, it'll go naturally.

208
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,500
- Have you Googled any of your symptoms?

209
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:25,300
- I mean, yeah, I'm pregnant.

210
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,460
(laughing)

211
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:32,460
As far as symptoms, I did try Googling neck hurts so bad.

212
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:35,660
(laughing)

213
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,600
I mean, it's just like, yeah, you just gotta wait.

214
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,320
- I mean, I feel like every man has this happen to them

215
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,800
every once in a while, right?

216
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Like the last time it happened is when I was moving in

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,000
into my apartment here, I picked up a desk

218
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,140
and I just picked it up wrong and I was immobile

219
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,920
for probably two days.

220
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:00,240
- Yeah, it also happened to me, I tried moving

221
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,040
like a mini fridge, this mini fridge right here.

222
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,720
I was moving it by myself and I hurt my back

223
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,480
and I was like, oh man, I think I'm gonna die.

224
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,080
- I thought I was just fine, now I have cancer.

225
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
- How many days did it-- - But it's like

226
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,760
a different thing.

227
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,320
- Wait, so now I'm gonna get cancer?

228
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
- Yeah, in like two years. - Yeah, from a beer.

229
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,320
- Yeah, from a beer.

230
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,880
You're gonna drink a smelly beer,

231
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,800
and you're gonna have cancer in two years,

232
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,280
or three from now.

233
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,760
- Okay, I'm fine with that.

234
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,680
- Yeah, but your retrovirus is gonna be completely fine

235
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,320
soon, I think.

236
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,760
- Yeah, I think that I'm,

237
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,060
I think this might be my worst ever sports injury,

238
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,480
which is pretty sad.

239
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,000
because I go so hard.

240
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,800
I wanna like, I would love to tear my ACL.

241
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,560
You guys ever fantasize about tearing your ACL?

242
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,920
Because then you just get to like sit at your house

243
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,600
for like, nobody can ask you to do shit

244
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,860
for like three months.

245
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:56,860
You just fucking sit at your fucking house and watch TV.

246
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:00,000
- I do think I end up on house arrest

247
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,960
and I just play video games for like three years

248
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,000
while I await trial.

249
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:04,840
I think that's my--

250
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,680
- Dude, house arrest sounds amazing.

251
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:11,520
I would get arrested and charged for something that I definitely didn't do.

252
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:16,720
Just like you said, you await trial, you do house arrest, and then when they finally,

253
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,040
when you are in court, it's like so clear that you didn't do it.

254
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Right.

255
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,640
Because you were so normal during house arrest.

256
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,640
Yeah.

257
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:30,120
Like, and also like, just the, the, like they set up your case and then like, they just

258
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,160
don't see the evidence for three years.

259
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,240
But the entire time you were no, you were in a different state the entire time.

260
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,960
just didn't tell them so that you could get on house arrest yeah play Red Dead

261
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Redemption and then just really dealt right exactly get through all the games

262
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,320
that are in my backlog oh my god we should set up a like a system like uber

263
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,560
but for like grappers to like just have like fall men don't just like yeah I'll

264
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:00,960
be a house arrest for you I would the house or the thing where where mobsters

265
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,120
would have somebody go and do time for them if you could do that for house

266
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,040
arrest, I would do that in a fucking instant dude.

267
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Oh my god dude.

268
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,240
Imagine making like six grand a month to stay home and do nothing.

269
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh my god.

270
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,120
I would do that for young thug right now.

271
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,400
I would do that for young thug.

272
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,680
I would do that for young thug for ten years.

273
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,000
Do you guys think that he's gonna be, you think they're gonna give him...

274
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
They're gonna kill him.

275
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,080
Yeah they have to be giving him the death penalty right?

276
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,080
They're gonna kill him man.

277
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,080
That's so sad.

278
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,720
Did you see that video of that guy like admitting like everything?

279
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Just like completely snitching?

280
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,720
No.

281
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:38,240
Everybody instantly was like, yeah, it was all him.

282
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,880
He was like doing all these songs,

283
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,720
and while he was doing that,

284
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,200
he was killing people and all this shit.

285
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,040
Yeah.

286
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,640
You guys believe it?

287
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,720
I kind of believe it, dude.

288
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,760
Oh, 100%.

289
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,320
Yeah, like he's definitely going to--

290
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,520
He's cool.

291
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,720
Yeah.

292
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,440
Well, you think it's cool to be a thug?

293
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,400
Yeah, definitely.

294
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,600
Here's your first clue, prosecutors.

295
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,640
Check out his name.

296
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,800
Yeah, Young.

297
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,960
- Young Thug, you missed the important part, Thug.

298
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:10,960
He was telling on himself there from the get go.

299
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,940
- Oh man.

300
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,360
- Is that your closure statement?

301
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,200
- Huh?

302
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,020
- Is that how you say it?

303
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,860
- Oh yeah, my.

304
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:18,700
(laughing)

305
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,640
Your honor, you must not look at no further

306
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,300
than the boy's name.

307
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,400
T-H-U-G.

308
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,420
- And that's it, I'm done.

309
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,680
- Holding my breath like that really, really,

310
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:36,000
really hurt me guys. I'm really, really hurt.

311
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,400
What is the thing we could, the thing you could do right now that will make you feel better?

312
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,800
I think if you like get up and get up and down.

313
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I've tried everything. I've tried watching fucking body cam footage all weekend. Didn't

314
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:56,000
help. I tried eating like all the cheese that was in my fridge. Didn't help.

315
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,640
How about ice? Just ice your entire back.

316
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:06,180
I haven't done ice, I've been doing the other end of the spectrum in terms of temperature.

317
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,440
Which is to say heat.

318
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,840
And I've been doing heat, but it just makes me sweaty and I have this heating pad that's

319
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:21,060
got this plastic outside and so I, last night I fell asleep with it on my back and I woke

320
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:27,100
up and my sweat had just fused it to my back and I had to rip it off like a temporary tattoo.

321
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,420
It was so bad, man.

322
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,940
I'm really excited for episode three of this podcast.

323
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,480
We've become oxys we took.

324
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,620
- Oh, that?

325
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,040
I have been sitting around thinking

326
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,380
how amazing it would be to get,

327
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,440
like 'cause nothing, like Tylenol

328
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,820
doesn't do anything for this.

329
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:46,700
I looked my wife in the eye yesterday

330
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,940
and genuinely asked her, I was like,

331
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,480
do we have any muscle relaxers?

332
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,340
And she was like, why would we have muscle relaxers

333
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,080
just like sitting in a pantry?

334
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,340
But I figured it was worth a shot.

335
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,260
I might have my mom send me some.

336
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:04,260
That's what I used to do. I used to steal painkillers from my mom.

337
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Because, you know, old ladies, they just get surgeries or they even just have friends who just kind of

338
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,260
come over and leave their medication in the cabinet or something.

339
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
Yeah, and that's five day supply.

340
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:22,260
Yeah, dude. And then you fucking take those and you play...

341
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:27,260
What's that game with the...

342
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,760
The one, you play that one game?

343
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,080
(laughing)

344
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,480
- Oh I know what you mean, yeah the one game

345
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,320
with the guys and the controls.

346
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,040
- What was that game that everybody used to play,

347
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,320
or at least I used to play, that was like--

348
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,500
- Minecraft.

349
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,760
- No it's like a rhythm game where you're like a ship

350
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
that's like driving--

351
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,440
- Just Dance.

352
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,040
- Back and forth, no it's not Just Dance man.

353
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,640
- A ship that you're driving back and forth?

354
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,440
- This is just gonna drive me crazy man,

355
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,520
there's nothing that I can--

356
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,360
- Yeah you're saying nothing right now.

357
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,560
- What are you talking about?

358
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,800
- You know what I'm talking about.

359
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,520
I legitimately have no clue what you're talking about.

360
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,560
You're acting like a fucking asshole.

361
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,560
I'm not.

362
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,560
I wish I knew.

363
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,560
Audio surf.

364
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Audio surf.

365
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,560
My god.

366
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,560
I used to play a lot of audio surf.

367
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,560
That's so old.

368
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,560
I haven't played audio surf since I was like 13.

369
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,800
Yeah I know, I was playing audio surf.

370
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,760
I just put in, you could put your own songs in.

371
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,760
That was amazing.

372
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,760
Yep.

373
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:23,760
Skrillex.

374
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,480
Didn't that shit used to not transfer that well?

375
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,960
No, no, it worked fine.

376
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
It worked okay.

377
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,560
Yeah, it was only like three tracks or whatever.

378
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
It's not that hard.

379
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Yeah.

380
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,560
Okay.

381
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,200
Have you ever seen somebody like, you know those Japanese rhythm games that are like crazy?

382
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Uh-huh.

383
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
Yeah.

384
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
They're like really weird ones that up there.

385
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,400
It's like a bop it that the guy has to play while he's like on a treadmill and he's like

386
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,880
blowing into a straw at an arcade.

387
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
Yeah.

388
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,880
Yeah.

389
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:55,880
I was at an arcade maybe like a year ago

390
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:59,040
and a guy, I was just playing like Jurassic Park

391
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,760
and shit, it was for a birthday.

392
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,920
And a guy came in and he came in,

393
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,280
said hello to the person working there,

394
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,120
walked up to that machine,

395
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,880
and just immediately started setting world records

396
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,800
instantly, like doing the most incredible things

397
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,800
I've ever seen somebody do.

398
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,680
Like it was athletic what he was doing.

399
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,520
- Yeah.

400
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:23,240
And then he left and I asked,

401
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,960
and we all just like watched him.

402
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,960
And he was not a good looking guy,

403
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,080
he was like an ugly skinny dork.

404
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,640
And I asked my wife, I was like,

405
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,280
be honest with me, was that a little bit attractive?

406
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,320
She was like, yes, yes it was.

407
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,040
- Yeah, 100%, yeah, totally.

408
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:42,160
- Yeah, that was pretty attractive.

409
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
- Yeah, those guys are like the modern superheroes.

410
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,320
No one knows who they are, but they just like walk in,

411
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,320
They break a bunch of records in your sleeve.

412
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,820
He was there for like 20 minutes, dude.

413
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,320
He was like there between two other things.

414
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:52,820
Yeah.

415
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,320
Just to like obliterate this game.

416
00:19:55,320 --> 00:20:01,820
I've been thinking, I've been trying to find a machine that's like only available in Japan and Korea.

417
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,320
I'm trying to find where there's one in America.

418
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
It's like the new DDR, it's called Dance Crush.

419
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:15,820
Where it's like, it's a whole mat that's like a 3x6 touch screen that you like stand on.

420
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:19,500
You just like go hard on it. You just like there's no like you know

421
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,360
Way you have to be on it. You just have to like be in the way of the notes and shit

422
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:30,020
It's and it like videotapes you and I've watched videos of guys that's pretty bad

423
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,220
And I'm like these are the coolest guys maybe in the whole world

424
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,840
like like cool Korean guys and like flowy clothes and just like

425
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:45,040
Doing like a like a shuffle and like you know just I hate when a game records you man when we went remember when we went

426
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,800
to that Topgolf with the--

427
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,640
- Oh my God, the last--

428
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,160
- The last thing it videos you.

429
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,320
I literally went home from that trip

430
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,680
and programmed it, I haven't missed a week

431
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,000
in the gym since then 'cause how unathletic

432
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,840
and fat I looked swinging a golf club.

433
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,200
I was like, this is an actual wake up call

434
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,140
that Topgolf just gave me.

435
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,840
- Well, the thing is, they don't ask for your consent,

436
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,600
which is the problematic thing.

437
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
- That is fucked up.

438
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,800
- Yeah.

439
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,320
- You know, I'm out here, I'm playing golf

440
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,520
for the first time in my entire life.

441
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,960
- It was so hot too.

442
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,640
- I don't want you to record me, I'm wearing jeans.

443
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,360
My friend's wearing headphones.

444
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,600
- Yeah, Rex had on over ear headphones

445
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,240
to take a conference call while he's on the golf course.

446
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,400
Just, I mean, I've never seen anybody do anything

447
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,960
that cool in my life.

448
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,280
It was unreal.

449
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,120
- We got assaulted.

450
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,160
There was assault that happened to us in Topgolf.

451
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,000
- I agree.

452
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,820
- And we need retribution.

453
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:48,460
So funny how bad I was with the headphones on and then like taking them off was like

454
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:53,860
taking off like a weight vest.

455
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:57,300
I looked like I had a fucking weight vest on in that goddamn video man.

456
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,300
Yeah we looked bad.

457
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,300
That was a bad time.

458
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,940
It was a sweaty, it was the middle of the summer.

459
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,060
I think it was the end of the tour right?

460
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,420
Is that why we were there?

461
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,420
Yeah.

462
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,420
Something like that?

463
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:08,420
Yeah.

464
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,420
Cause Jubio was there too.

465
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:10,420
Oh yeah.

466
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,940
I'd just been drinking for 25 days straight.

467
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,900
- Right, drinking and sitting in a car.

468
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,060
- Yeah, that was so bad.

469
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,900
- Yeah.

470
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
- But it was fun, man.

471
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,260
I miss playing golf.

472
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,780
I need to find a golf buddy up here.

473
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:29,860
- I'm gonna head up my local Topgolf more,

474
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,740
but I don't wanna go by myself.

475
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,740
I'm gonna feel stupid. - You guys have a Topgolf?

476
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,700
- Yeah, we got a Topgolf.

477
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,300
- That's amazing. - That's crazy.

478
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,580
- It's funny, it's one of those things

479
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,940
that gets advertised a lot.

480
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:42,640
like if you look like the airport in mexico city

481
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,300
but there's a big science like

482
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,940
that the dot top of over there

483
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,480
for that just a p top off and that's it

484
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:54,820
with a level to make this a people fly all the way real just a fuckin

485
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:59,940
it's very much top of the so much fun and i want to play a rebirth again

486
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,520
there's a top golf in uh...

487
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,460
either jersey or pennsylvania

488
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:12,860
has like, they have like stand-ups come and perform there.

489
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,500
And that is like a dream gig.

490
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,340
- Oh my God, how do you do that?

491
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,780
- I have no idea what the, I don't know.

492
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:20,720
I know that Matt McCusker did it a couple years ago.

493
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,060
And I know some other people

494
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,940
who have like gone and done shows there.

495
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,260
And it's like, yeah, so they have like,

496
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,380
I don't even know what the setup is.

497
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,280
I feel like the only way to make that fun

498
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,460
is if you're like in the middle of the thing,

499
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,700
like theater or the round. - Yeah, people just

500
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,820
hit the ball. - So it's like, yeah.

501
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,700
Maybe you get like a dome or something,

502
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,580
but I would do stand up if I had a loud ass microphone,

503
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:47,060
just sitting there in the middle of the fucking,

504
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,300
in the middle of one of the nets,

505
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,820
like a spider caught me at the top of the call.

506
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,100
One of the circles.

507
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,540
- How comedy, how comedy do you feel like

508
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,020
the public will be there?

509
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,660
How receptive do you think they'd be to your comedy?

510
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,820
- Well, that's how you would know

511
00:24:03,820 --> 00:24:04,860
if you were doing well or not,

512
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,700
'cause you're too far away to hear the laughs.

513
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,900
if they hit you at the ball that they don't like it very much uh...

514
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,700
but if they're sort of hitting around you

515
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,840
if they're hitting around you in the form of a heart

516
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,180
then that's a pretty good indication that they like it

517
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:21,260
yeah maybe if they're not hitting at all maybe they're laughing too much to hit the ball

518
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,140
oh that's a good point too

519
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,580
oh fucking god damn it

520
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,900
what about you rex have you ever had any awesome injuries

521
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,800
of course

522
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,100
you know i hurt myself all the time trying like

523
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,060
You know, you have that moment where you see yourself

524
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,460
getting fat, looking terrible, and you're like,

525
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,060
okay, this is it.

526
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm gonna get my life in order this time.

527
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,100
I'm gonna exercise, I'm gonna eat right.

528
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,940
And then you exercise two times,

529
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:52,700
and immediately you just get the worst injury known to man.

530
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,940
- Yeah, a life-altering injury.

531
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,220
- Yeah. - Yeah.

532
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,140
- Just trying to get back into it.

533
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:01,600
- That's why I'm kind of amazed that I hurt myself now,

534
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,820
is like, I should have hurt myself

535
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,140
right after that Topgolf thing,

536
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,000
when I first started going back to the gym.

537
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,820
But now, I've been like, you know,

538
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,940
working out pretty consistently for like six months

539
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,660
and this is when it decides to strike

540
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:18,620
is while Kristoff is admiring my amazing Adonis body.

541
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,660
- Right.

542
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,500
- Worst timing.

543
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,300
But you did a good, you did the smart thing

544
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,940
and you got into DDR.

545
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,760
- Yes.

546
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,620
- Which some might call low impact.

547
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,860
- Yeah, funny you say that.

548
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:32,420
For twice now, I've gotten like ankle injuries from it.

549
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,260
yet is basically just no excuse for that

550
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,500
yeah

551
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:42,860
you know you know that i was a little after like an hour and a half it is just

552
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,580
like

553
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
it's hard to stay on your feet

554
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:51,360
you know i would do d_d_r_ if they brief if they changed it from

555
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,480
being dancing if they say if i get some a trick myself into thinking that it was

556
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,300
some kind of

557
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:59,180
boxing footwork game where they like

558
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:02,620
it's a r_u_d_ you pretend you're fighting fucking a vendor holyfield and

559
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,500
and uh...

560
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,780
music a song plays. What if you were dancing along to Rap God by Eminem?

561
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,980
Specifically the verse where he goes, you know, "Real hard." Say what now? Yeah. What the fuck did you just say?

562
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:22,800
Okay. I saw a guy on YouTube yesterday just post a like a 30 second 200 note

563
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,300
chart where he was doing the verse from Rap God just doing like you know. And

564
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,460
you're telling me that he you're telling me that he lived to post this video. Yeah

565
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,820
Yeah he looked exhausted. He looked like he just ran a marathon in 20 seconds.

566
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,820
Was he white?

567
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:39,580
No he's Korean. He's the shirtless Korean man that I watch.

568
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,580
That's awesome.

569
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,580
Completely shirtless.

570
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
Completely normally by the way.

571
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,580
Okay. Alright, why does he put on a shirt I guess is my only question that I have for

572
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
you.

573
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Because he's so sweaty after.

574
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:54,500
Yeah I mean, just sweat through your shirt man.

575
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
No.

576
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,140
Do you guys sweat a lot?

577
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,140
Me? Yeah. I'm sweating right now.

578
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:05,140
I took Ashwagandha before this. I'm sweating bullets.

579
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,140
Wow. You took Ashwagandha before...

580
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:10,140
I don't think that's how Ashwagandha works.

581
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,140
It's in the blend that I took.

582
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,140
The four pills that I took that had Ashwagandha in it.

583
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:18,140
Dude, I'm so excited that you're getting into nootropics.

584
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,140
I know.

585
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:23,140
Being a supplement guy just feels right for me, doesn't it?

586
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,140
It really does, man.

587
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,140
You already look so much better than you used to.

588
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,140
- You look amazing. - Something incredible change.

589
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,140
- Yeah. - Thank you.

590
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:34,140
I've been a-- I've done all sorts of kind of odd supplements.

591
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Ever since I was like 15, like, I've just kind of ordered stuff that I thought was funny.

592
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,140
- Yeah. - And started eating it.

593
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
- I took-- - I used to do--

594
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:46,140
- Colloidal gold. I took colloidal gold. - Really?

595
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,140
- Yeah. Not even silver, gold. - Wow.

596
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,140
- Why gold? - 'Cause it's fun.

597
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,140
- That's just plain good luck. - Yeah, exactly.

598
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:59,740
eating gold. Blessed by a Reiki master, it was $30 for a droplet bottle and it looks

599
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:06,780
amazing and smells exactly like cum. It looks like cum. It straight up just looks exactly like cum.

600
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,580
Some guy sold you cum.

601
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:18,940
Said it was gold and he was like some fucking jew's gonna order this and put it in his mouth.

602
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,340
He's really underselling it because it was like $30 and to fill up a bottle

603
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,740
That big with cum would not be worth it.

604
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,840
That's like not valuing your time though.

605
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,840
I will say, cum, in a weight sense, cum has to be worth more than gold, right?

606
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,340
Right. 100%. Good cum? Reiki master cum?

607
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:45,840
It would take me a year and a half to fill up, to break the surface tension on the top of a penny with my cum.

608
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,340
That's how little my fucking... that's how little my loads are.

609
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,300
Yeah, this dude's making $30 every six months.

610
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
That's a sign of a slob.

611
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:00,300
It's called passive income.

612
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,580
Yeah.

613
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,580
No, you gotta work for that, dude.

614
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,300
Yeah.

615
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
You have to work for that shit.

616
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,420
You know what they say?

617
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,740
Do what you love, you'll never work a day in your life.

618
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,220
That's right.

619
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:10,860
That's true.

620
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,060
Yeah, I like cumming a single fucking quark once a day.

621
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:21,560
Dude, me and Noah, when we were in high school,

622
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:26,560
I ordered something called Zataichi Lucid Dreaming Tea.

623
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,060
Oh my God.

624
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,500
And it was really expensive.

625
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,980
It was like, I think I'd just gotten a job,

626
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,300
I was like 16, I was working as a parking attendant,

627
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,000
and I finally had like a checkings account.

628
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,260
So I was ordering shit online,

629
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,020
and I ordered this shit 'cause I was getting really

630
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,220
into lucid dreaming 'cause of Sinbad, the comedian.

631
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:49,500
He talked about lucid dreaming and astral projection.

632
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,580
I was like, I'm gonna do all this shit too.

633
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:55,740
So I ordered it and it came and I was so excited for it.

634
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,700
It was like $80 and I opened up the package.

635
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,140
It was like a silver package.

636
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:04,940
I opened it up and it was literally just like wood.

637
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,120
It was like mulch.

638
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,100
There's like no herb in it at all.

639
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,380
It's like pieces of twigs and branches and wood and shit.

640
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,860
I was like, ah, fuck it, dude.

641
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,180
The monks probably know better than me.

642
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:21,980
So Noah came over, and it was I think 4th of July or some shit.

643
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:30,580
And we brewed this tea, and it was truly to this day the most like despicably disgusting

644
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:34,060
unpalatable thing I've ever had in my mouth.

645
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:38,780
And so we like tried drinking it and then we ended up cutting it with lemonade, it didn't

646
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,180
help at all, it made it worse.

647
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:48,460
Chug the entire thing, we go to sleep, and the next day we woke up and we were like, "Oh

648
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,980
man, did you have any dreams at all?"

649
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:54,020
And we're like, "Nope, not even a single dream."

650
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,540
So then I gave it to somebody, I don't remember who, but I gave it to somebody because I told

651
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,460
them about it and they were like, "That sounds amazing."

652
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,380
I was like, "I just told you it didn't fucking work."

653
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:07,460
I kind of want to get back into lucid dreaming, that sounds pretty--

654
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:10,260
Yeah, have you ever known anyone that's had experiences with that?

655
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,100
I used to know this kid in high school.

656
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,940
- Lucid dreaming?

657
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:17,740
- Who told me about this very real,

658
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,800
I don't know, detailed experience about him taking a nap

659
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,700
and being like, "Whoa, dude, I was out of my body

660
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,240
"and I was walking around and I saw myself

661
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,980
"and I saw my brother in the other room

662
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,140
"and he was just playing a game."

663
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,640
And I was like, "Wow, this is the most incredible story

664
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,020
"I've ever heard in my entire life."

665
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,080
But I never really have done it myself,

666
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,480
So I just want to know if you guys have any experience.

667
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,440
- I used to lucid, the reason I bought the T

668
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,680
is I used to lucid dream very often.

669
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,920
That was like, yeah, 'cause I was, you know,

670
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,160
I was homeschooled, I had nothing else going on.

671
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:52,360
So I would just like sit in my room

672
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,120
and try to lucid dream and astral project.

673
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
(laughing)

674
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,920
Mostly, I tried to ask for, I tried to ask for, yeah.

675
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,880
I tried to ask for projecting one time

676
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,800
'cause I was like, you know what?

677
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,580
I don't think this is real, but it's worth a shot.

678
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,180
you know, my time isn't worth that much.

679
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,340
And so the whole point,

680
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,820
the whole thing with astral projecting

681
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,900
is that you sit on your bed

682
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,020
and you like put something in front of you.

683
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,660
Like for me, I think it was a pair of socks

684
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,300
that I put in front of me.

685
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,940
And then you close your eyes

686
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,460
and you just kind of like empty your head

687
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,460
until you're like right about to fall asleep.

688
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,220
And then right as you're about to fall asleep,

689
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,220
you're supposed to reach out and try to grab the thing.

690
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,420
And so that is supposed to like, for whatever reason,

691
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:42,220
you're in that split second where you're about to fall asleep

692
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,140
you're some Casper-like ghost that's sitting in your body

693
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,340
decides it's time to leave.

694
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:52,320
And so I tried it.

695
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,740
And then I just woke up the next day.

696
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,140
I just slept the entire night.

697
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,580
I tried it at like 7 p.m.

698
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,540
and I just woke up the next day at like 8.

699
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,620
I just slept a bunch.

700
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:05,980
But I had a fair amount of lucid dreaming experience.

701
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,760
My first one ever, I think I was 14,

702
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:12,460
and I had a dream that I hooked up

703
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,120
with my cousin's girlfriend.

704
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,820
- Okay.

705
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,300
- Well, not a dream that I did.

706
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,520
I went into the dream and I was like,

707
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,240
I thought she was so hot, and I was like,

708
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,940
we're going on a date in my dream world.

709
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,960
And then I mostly played basically Roblox

710
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,160
with the rest of my time, where I was like building,

711
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,760
I built like a city.

712
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,120
See, lucid dreams never make any sense

713
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,120
when you try to explain them to somebody.

714
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:37,960
But when you're doing them,

715
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,720
they are pretty much in the top two coolest things

716
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,460
that you can do as a person, I would say.

717
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,840
- Yeah.

718
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,160
You're supposed to have like an object

719
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,400
that reminds you you're dreaming, right?

720
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,640
Like a red ball or some shit like that?

721
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,800
- I never did that shit.

722
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,840
That's some, nah man, fuck that.

723
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,560
I don't give a fuck if I'm dreaming or not.

724
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,880
That's not my business.

725
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,720
- Have you ever heard about like tulpas?

726
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,520
Where you like give yourself schizophrenia?

727
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,020
No.

728
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:00,520
No.

729
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:10,020
There's like a, it used to be a big thing among like the, the brony community where you would basically give yourself schizophrenia and then imagine you were talking to like Applejack.

730
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:11,520
Uh, and then-

731
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
How do you do that?

732
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:16,520
I'm not sure. I never delved too far into it. I don't know the techniques.

733
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
But I think-

734
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,520
That's bullshit. There's no way that you can give yourself schizophrenia. I mean you can give yourself schizophrenia for your feed for sure.

735
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,520
No, you can absolutely, no you can give yourself schizophrenia if you try hard enough.

736
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:32,500
I've done it. I've given myself momentary, like week-long bouts of schizophrenia just by like

737
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:37,120
intensely focusing on like someone's tweets for too long and trying to

738
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,760
Imagine what their inner mind looks like

739
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,220
So you can make fun of it better

740
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,380
For me if you just if you don't if I don't sleep for a couple days it starts to get pretty bad

741
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:52,700
Oh, yeah, Toba is a seemingly sentient autonomous mental companion. Okay. Yeah

742
00:34:54,420 --> 00:35:00,700
I used to you know during my Adderall days I'd be up for like you know 48 72 hours

743
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:06,900
And there'd be like a cutoff point where you'd start to like go a little crazy, and you'd start to hear

744
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:13,860
Voices and you get really paranoid and then like during that period you would literally like just develop schizophrenia

745
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,220
Yeah, that's just you know yeah, it was awesome

746
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:22,460
I'd like constantly be like looking out of like a window and shit like being like

747
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,700
Fucking rear window just to my neighbors

748
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,520
my most

749
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,500
Powerful recent kind of mental delusion is that I thought I

750
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:38,420
Thought there was a guy in my neighborhood those actively trying to kidnap Phil

751
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:43,700
My dog yeah, yeah, I think I told you about I was like he's seriously

752
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:49,580
Weird and then one of the reasons why I was like I was like you know you when you're in that kind of

753
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,820
Mode you're being paranoid you like

754
00:35:52,820 --> 00:36:01,220
Kind of make ties that don't really exist. So one of the reasons why I thought he would do this is because

755
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:07,060
One time he pulled up to a red light. I saw him pull up to a red light in his car and

756
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:13,760
He finished his bottle of Gatorade and he threw the Gatorade bottle out of the window and in my brain

757
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,440
I was like this guy is clearly an evil person if he would litter so what else would he do, right?

758
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,840
He's capable of anything.

759
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:29,160
He's capable of great acts of evil, like littering the day before the street sweeper comes.

760
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,360
So it's pretty, I mean it's scary.

761
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,360
Abundantly.

762
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,360
Yeah.

763
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:41,760
Well thankfully I take these healthy brain pills.

764
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,760
Is that what they're called?

765
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,760
Yep.

766
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Yep.

767
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,520
They're traditional Chinese medicine.

768
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
You take nine of them.

769
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,480
Here's the thing about traditional Chinese medicine man if you empty one of those pills onto a fucking chicken thigh

770
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,480
It's gonna be the greatest

771
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,200
Yeah, it's just season. It's a ball of season. It's literally a

772
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,000
Monterey steak seasoning blend yeah

773
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,120
How do you know what some brides?

774
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:15,240
Traditional Chinese medicine is but how can you tell from the traditional? How can you tell how to traditional?

775
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:21,040
Yeah, how do we know that the manufacturers of this this bottle know their traditions?

776
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:26,960
What do they take? Well, I assume Qingdao Growful Pharmaceutical Co. Limited

777
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,800
Knows what they're doing

778
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,540
What what's in that bad boy? You want me to read the ingredients to you?

779
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:38,820
Yeah, hit me with the highlights at the very least. All right, so top one jujube seed

780
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,480
Then we got dong quai root

781
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,200
Chinese yam rhizome

782
00:37:45,200 --> 00:38:03,120
Lycium berry, schisandra fruit, amber, red-rooted sage root, oriental ginseng, and oriental arbovitae

783
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,120
seed.

784
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:09,920
Okay, so ginseng is pretty much the only thing in there, right?

785
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,920
Yeah.

786
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:15,160
You can't just be like, oh yeah, there's Chinese seeds in this.

787
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,640
There's Chinese carrot seeds in this.

788
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:22,600
And they're little tiny brown balls and you take literally nine of them three times a

789
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,600
day.

790
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,600
What?

791
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Yeah.

792
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,320
Nine, three times a day?

793
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,240
Yeah, it goes absurdly fast.

794
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,400
It's like...

795
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,600
Tell me, so how long have you been taking these nootropics?

796
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,240
So I started the nootropics like a week and a half ago.

797
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,240
Have you noticed any difference?

798
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,760
How are you feeling?

799
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,520
I've done controls, right?

800
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,840
Because there's caffeine in them.

801
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,960
So I've balanced it.

802
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:51,280
I've tried just a monster, which has more caffeine.

803
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,720
And what I think it is, is there's L-theanine in the nootropics that just make it better

804
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:56,720
caffeine.

805
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,920
And none of the other shit works.

806
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,440
So you really just need to be taking L-theanine.

807
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
Right.

808
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,240
I'm paying $75 a month for L-theanine.

809
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:13,240
Yeah, it's a pretty, it might be 15 bucks for 90 capsules of L-Theanine if you just order

810
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
that.

811
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
Yeah, exactly.

812
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,720
You know, they sell, here I'll show you, so here's one I haven't tried yet.

813
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,440
Here's Logic, like the wrapper.

814
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,160
And it comes...

815
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,760
So I'm curious because the, wait, wow, oh it comes in its own little thing.

816
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,760
Yeah.

817
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Oh wait, I know that company, what are they called?

818
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Thesis.

819
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:42,760
on Instagram and they caught me at a particularly low moment in my life where I was susceptible

820
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,760
to buying things on Instagram.

821
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,000
I also like that like I know that company has ones that are called like Mood and like

822
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,160
Energy, and you bought Lodge.

823
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,760
No, hold on.

824
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,940
So they, here's the thing, right?

825
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:01,720
So they send you a survey that you fill out where they're like, you know, what's wrong

826
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:08,040
with your brain and I'm like, I'm fucking retarded. Give me the best you got. And they're like,

827
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,860
at the, you know, you know how like with your DNA, they were like, 99% of people have less

828
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Neanderthal DNA than you. They were like, 97% of people scored higher on our survey for

829
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:26,480
getting a more normal brain. So they were like, here's what you need. Because they send

830
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,520
you four blends to start with and then they like, kind of send you a follow up email to

831
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:35,920
be like which ones worked for you, which ones didn't. So you get energy, you get creativity,

832
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,240
which is what I took for this one. And logic.

833
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:43,640
That's why you're so creative right now.

834
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:47,740
You know that it takes, any pill is going to take longer than, you took it one minute

835
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,280
before we pressed record.

836
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:56,120
Yup, and it's completely working right now. I feel so creative. I'm creating right now.

837
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,000
You seem creative. I'm getting a lot of creative kind of stuff.

838
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,560
What's your most creative idea right now?

839
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
Should it?

840
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:07,660
No because it's my business, dude.

841
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:08,660
I got a business idea.

842
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,360
I don't want to talk about it.

843
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:20,960
It's a stress relieving item shaped like a certain body part for people to chew on and

844
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,960
kind of – but it's for relieving stress.

845
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:31,120
You're making a dildo made of bubble gum?

846
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,760
That's a pretty good idea actually.

847
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,160
I had an idea the other day.

848
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,040
Because I hate movie theaters.

849
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,440
I hate movie theaters.

850
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,240
Every time I go to a movie theater I freak out and I run out at some point and I have

851
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,880
to go to the bathroom and piss into the toilet to collect myself.

852
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,880
I was thinking about a movie theater that is just individual little rooms with just

853
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,960
normal-sized TVs, nothing crazy, but you're this close to them so it might as well be a

854
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,280
big ass thing. You still get the experience, right? And you can have single person rooms,

855
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,160
you can have two person rooms, you can have ten person rooms if you want to bring your

856
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:12,320
whole family, right? And they're just kind of little stalls right next to each other.

857
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,280
Tell me that this is not the worst idea you've ever heard.

858
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
It's really bad.

859
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:17,280
It's a bad idea.

860
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,720
If we're doing Shark Tank, I got another I came up with the other day.

861
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,480
Isn't that just like the urinals of like the Chili's?

862
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,680
You just stand in front of the urinal, they have like, some of those have like screens

863
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,920
where it would like just show you ads.

864
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,840
There definitely has to be a bathroom there so you don't miss any of the shit.

865
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,080
So yeah, it's a bathroom with a TV.

866
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,400
Or if you need to pump gas, maybe it could be a little screen right there too.

867
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,000
Yeah, they definitely don't have those yet.

868
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,360
Here's my idea, you ready for this?

869
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:52,040
It's a thing you put on your wall that will make noise, it'll like vibrate the wall in

870
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,120
a perfect way to block the sounds of sex coming through the wall.

871
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,640
So it works both ways, right?

872
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:02,000
So imagine a hotel, right?

873
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,120
You know you're gonna be, you're fucking, right?

874
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,120
You're getting it on.

875
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,120
And you don't want anyone around you to hear it.

876
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:16,200
So you turn it on and it just sounds like TV static and like reruns of Seinfeld.

877
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,240
Which the TV that's in the hotel room wouldn't do the job.

878
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,040
Right, of course not.

879
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,120
But, you know, imagine the reverse of that.

880
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,520
Which is, you're in the other-

881
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,520
Is this like a portal thing?

882
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,520
Yes.

883
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:32,200
And then the reverse of that, which is, you're on the other wall of someone getting their

884
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,200
shit on.

885
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,200
They're being loud, they're being obnoxious, they're banging the bed into the wall, just

886
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,120
being fucking annoying.

887
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:47,400
if you could hear like you know some sort of music that distracted you from that.

888
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,100
You know? So it's a speaker that you take with you it just like sticks to the wall.

889
00:43:53,100 --> 00:44:01,000
It's a speaker that can only play one song. Yeah. But no no no it uses like like artificial

890
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,400
intelligence to figure out the rhythm that's going on and then like matches it to you.

891
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,240
you. Right? So you kind of like don't figure it out for a minute. Like you can reasonably

892
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,180
decide in your head that you're not actually listening to someone who's not.

893
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,480
Somebody might be hanging a painting.

894
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,480
Exactly.

895
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:19,400
Yeah, that's actually a pretty good idea.

896
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
Thank you.

897
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,400
Yeah.

898
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,240
Yeah. Because, I mean, I don't know. That is...

899
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:30,760
One of the worst experiences is listening to someone else have sex. It's not enjoyable

900
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,760
for anyone involved. You know, knowing someone is hearing you have sex, that sucks. Hearing

901
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,680
someone is even worse.

902
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,680
Yeah. Luckily I'm never really, I'm not very good at sex, so I'm never like banging the

903
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,720
headboard against the wall or anything. You know, I'm usually falling asleep in the middle

904
00:44:53,720 --> 00:45:00,400
of it. Usually doing it in like the one chair in my house that I can do without hurting my

905
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:05,400
hips right I don't I don't really have to worry about this on the chair on this

906
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:12,360
product this problem but some people probably do yeah well you know you put

907
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,840
a plegic so you can't really do it anyways and I live next to a lesbian so

908
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:25,720
I actually like hearing the sounds mmm yeah yeah what sounds they make yeah

909
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:31,400
it's mostly like this I mean I count it from the time when they start cooking

910
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:42,640
each other a meal that's your wall speaker yeah I go again and then I'm

911
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,500
hearing they're watching fucking devil wears Prada they have the bass turned up

912
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:51,080
all the way on the movie right and then they start getting hot and heavy right

913
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:55,080
and I hear 500 buttons unbuttoned from a flannel.

914
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,080
It's pretty amazing.

915
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,080
Alright, I'm opening my second beer.

916
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:08,080
But it's not a beer, guys. I'm going to be real with you.

917
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,080
What is it?

918
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,080
It's a White Claw Ruby Grapefruit.

919
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,080
Amazing. I thought about drinking a wine cooler as my second beer.

920
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,080
That's a great idea.

921
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:27,880
I haven't had a wine cooler in so long. A Seagram's. Yeah, that's the only brand I know of that

922
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:33,440
makes wine coolers still. A blue looking Seagram's that I looked at in the fridge and then said

923
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:41,440
"eh, maybe next time." Yeah, it just wasn't that tempting. I think we should expand the

924
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:47,240
bird category to anything that has alcohol in it. I think we ought to be more exclusive.

925
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,240
Because honestly, this is the only time I drink beer.

926
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:56,240
And this is also, this is probably the most alcohol I drink in an average week.

927
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,240
Yeah.

928
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,240
Uh, Brex, who's this guy?

929
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:03,240
I'm a fucking loser, dude.

930
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,240
Nice.

931
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Um.

932
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:10,240
[laughter]

933
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,240
He showed his ass.

934
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,240
He showed his ass.

935
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,240
I

936
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:22,840
Love that you live in a an actual frat

937
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:28,960
Yeah, that's the problem that the fact that he's in a hallway

938
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,140
So yeah, if you want to leave the house you have to go through at least when you lived in the dinner

939
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:35,140
He's doing you had some

940
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:43,360
Yeah, that's where the idea of the sex oh, yeah, wait, what am I fit of course you can't have sex in that room

941
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:48,280
I've done it, but if you do you have to like alert everybody in the house

942
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:53,600
You have to make sure there's nobody in the rooms on the other side right got a lot like schedule thing

943
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:59,680
Yeah, yeah, it's unpleasant

944
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,600
born of necessity

945
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,720
Yeah, I guess that is amazing. Thank you I

946
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:10,600
Think I'm going to watch one of the Steve Jobs doc or

947
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:17,300
Biopics pretty soon because I need to be inspired to be an amazing great man and leader. Yeah

948
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:27,820
CEO I think you could do a good job of encouraging people. I don't think so. The problem is I'm Johnny Ives

949
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,560
Yeah, I'm no Steve Jobs. I'm Johnny Ives

950
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,120
Yeah, I know what you're talking about. That's the guy the bald British guy in the Apple commercials

951
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:40,620
we'd be like, "We actually made it completely out of metal this time."

952
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:41,620
That dude.

953
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:42,620
You don't remember that guy?

954
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,620
Nope.

955
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,620
I've only known of one Apple commercial and we don't want to recite it right now.

956
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:51,620
[Laughter]

957
00:48:51,620 --> 00:48:53,620
It's really bad.

958
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:54,620
It's really bad.

959
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,620
That's not appropriate.

960
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,120
It's not even funny.

961
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,620
But Rex is going to recite it right now.

962
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:00,620
Go ahead.

963
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,620
I'm not going to do that.

964
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:06,820
Rex, Rex, what do you guys, where do we think we'll be in 10 years, guys?

965
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:10,420
What do you mean?

966
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:16,440
Where, what kind of stuff do you think we'll be doing in 10 years from now?

967
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,620
This is a kind of drinking talk that I like engaging in.

968
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:20,620
Yeah, yeah.

969
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,220
Probably on the phone.

970
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:25,220
You will definitely be on the phone.

971
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,220
Yeah.

972
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,220
Yeah.

973
00:49:27,220 --> 00:49:32,220
For me, it's like, best case scenario, I'm gaming.

974
00:49:32,220 --> 00:49:34,960
I'm jacking off three times a day.

975
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:39,960
I'm jacking, I'm reading books that are, you know, for babies.

976
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,580
- Yeah.

977
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,420
- Worst case scenario, I'm doing,

978
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:44,340
- You're literally reading.

979
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:47,220
- Worst case scenario, I'm doing the same thing.

980
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,420
- You're doing like a, like a Superman schedule

981
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,220
where you like follow a strict thing,

982
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:55,260
but it's like first meal chicken nuggets.

983
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:56,660
And then like the reading thing,

984
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:01,100
like you're cracking open good night moon yeah like a reading light one of those

985
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:08,380
curved reading lights you have a kindle copy of good night moon I think the best

986
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:12,540
and worst case scenarios are exactly the same thing for me it's just yeah one I

987
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:17,420
have more money than the other the true the middle ground is the one that sucks

988
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:25,940
where I just have a job yeah we I was talking with wifey about a job there's

989
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:29,260
and someone I know has that seems pretty miserable,

990
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,300
but it makes them super, super rich.

991
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:36,140
And I was like, man, should I try to get a job like that?

992
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:38,100
She was like, fuck no.

993
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:38,940
- Yeah.

994
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:40,220
- And I was like, oh, this is the real difference

995
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:44,100
between men and women, is that I would love

996
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:46,260
to make a million dollars and hate

997
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,100
every single second of it.

998
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:48,940
- Yeah.

999
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,700
- And she just wouldn't do that.

1000
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:52,940
- Yeah. - What's the job?

1001
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,220
The job is Alaskan crab fisherman.

1002
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,220
Mmm.

1003
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,220
No.

1004
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,220
That would be sick.

1005
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,420
You'd be awesome at that, I feel like.

1006
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:05,220
It doesn't matter what the job, any job.

1007
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:07,980
Your head would like get covered in ice.

1008
00:51:07,980 --> 00:51:08,980
They'd have to like-

1009
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:09,980
I wanted to do that when I was a kid.

1010
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
Yeah.

1011
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,980
I used to watch Deadliest Catch.

1012
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:12,980
Right.

1013
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:18,300
And I was like, man, that just seems like the perfect job for me.

1014
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:23,840
But then I got to high school age and I didn't know what kind of degree to pursue that would

1015
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:27,020
in with me being shipped up to Alaska. But then I know somebody who ended up

1016
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,940
working at a fish cannery in Alaska and they said that it was the most amazing

1017
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:35,140
experience of their life and they got paid less than minimum wage.

1018
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:40,980
But they loved it. But also this person's not particularly smart I would say.

1019
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:46,740
Yeah. The one job that I think of like that where it's like a lot of

1020
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:52,100
effort and I think they pay them a lot is those ones we like to have like

1021
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,100
to climb like a big tower to change a single light bulb.

1022
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:56,940
- Oh man.

1023
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,460
- This guy has to do this thing for like,

1024
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,860
once every two years, but he gets paid $60 million to do it.

1025
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,300
And I'm like, I wanna do that.

1026
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:07,140
Can I do that?

1027
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:07,980
- Those are good jobs.

1028
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,820
You know what you could pursue is deep sea,

1029
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:14,540
there we go, ooh, a guava cart.

1030
00:52:14,540 --> 00:52:16,820
That looks good, I haven't had that one.

1031
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,440
- I thought it said wabba cart.

1032
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:21,300
- Deep sea welding is something that you can do.

1033
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:25,300
So you work on like oil rigs and you weld stuff,

1034
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:31,020
but it takes like, the way that you do it

1035
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:32,600
is that you only work like six months

1036
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,820
out of every two years, but for that six months

1037
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:39,100
you live in an underwater bubble

1038
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:42,260
and like 10% of everybody who's ever had this job

1039
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:45,400
just dies in the most horrific possible way.

1040
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,740
But you make like 500 grand a year.

1041
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,580
- Yeah.

1042
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:50,300
It's cool.

1043
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,280
water welding is really cool. Yeah. I don't think I could weld. I don't think I would be

1044
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,780
good at welding. Yeah. My problem with it is that it doesn't make any sense because it's

1045
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:05,780
fire underwater. That's why it's so hard. Right. That's true. The entire warlocks. Yeah,

1046
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:12,780
exactly. They have to find the only wizards that are still alive after a hundred years.

1047
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:18,380
Yeah, it doesn't really make any sense to me.

1048
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,380
Yeah.

1049
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,820
Honestly, my dream job is professional gambler.

1050
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:23,820
Oh, for sure.

1051
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:29,860
I mean, that's obviously like, for me, retirement is just like gambling on Twitch all day.

1052
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:31,540
And they took that from me.

1053
00:53:31,540 --> 00:53:32,740
That is so fucked up.

1054
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:34,740
Luckily you're going to Kik.

1055
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:35,740
Right, exactly.

1056
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:37,140
We're sending you right over to Kik.

1057
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:41,660
It is funny that you would be such an amazing Terrain Wrecks TV.

1058
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:42,660
I know.

1059
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,540
I was like, if you just, 'cause you have that in you.

1060
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,020
- I do. - That exact lifestyle

1061
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:49,860
you have in you is so, like.

1062
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,380
- If that existed like seven years ago,

1063
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:53,500
you wouldn't even know me.

1064
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,580
- If you had just had the idea first, that would be you.

1065
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,540
- I know.

1066
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:00,260
I didn't know about gambling at the time.

1067
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:03,100
When I was 19, I didn't know what gambling was.

1068
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:04,980
It took me until I was 25.

1069
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:08,180
And then unlock something in me.

1070
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:11,620
- Did we gamble together for your first time?

1071
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:12,620
For real, yeah.

1072
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,620
Yeah, 100%.

1073
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:14,620
Wow.

1074
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:15,620
Amazing.

1075
00:54:15,620 --> 00:54:16,620
Yep.

1076
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,460
And just like anything else, I immediately got addicted to it.

1077
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:20,460
Yeah.

1078
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:21,460
Pretty much anything that's...

1079
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,540
I could see myself getting addicted to everything, you know?

1080
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:26,540
It's so easy.

1081
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:27,540
Yeah.

1082
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:28,540
Everything is so great.

1083
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,900
I don't understand how you can be depressed when everything is so awesome.

1084
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:36,460
There's drugs and gambling and everything that's fun to do in the world.

1085
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:37,460
You are right.

1086
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:38,460
Yeah.

1087
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:44,620
You know just to distract yourself with stuff that ruins your life instead. Yeah, who gives a fuck man?

1088
00:54:44,620 --> 00:54:47,260
You're not that important. You don't need to like write a book

1089
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:50,940
Yeah, you fuck you need to find the thing that gets you

1090
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:54,500
So addicted that you forget about everything else

1091
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:59,780
Yeah, you need to literally devote your life to going into debt to like I'm the opposite

1092
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,780
I don't think I could ever get a bye Toshi. I

1093
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:10,340
Think that that a jubio. I think that you are afraid of just how unbelievably addicted you could get to anything

1094
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,440
Yeah, I think that you have set to measured

1095
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:19,580
Such a such an open dopamine loop that anything could sneak in there

1096
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:23,920
Anything dude you could get addicted to fucking frying eggs

1097
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,940
Anything no I am I've got a perfectly strong will

1098
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,700
And I can never get addicted to anything.

1099
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:35,700
I mean, I do too. That's why I've never been addicted to anything in my entire life.

1100
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:40,700
I just get infinitely close and then back off at the last second.

1101
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:46,700
Literally like unmeasurable the distance between where you are and addiction.

1102
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,700
The untrained eye would never be able to tell the difference.

1103
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,700
But I can stop anytime I want.

1104
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,700
You walk right up to the edge.

1105
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:54,700
You know what we should do?

1106
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,700
We should start like Big Brother but for like gambling streamers.

1107
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:06,760
I just have a house with a bunch of cameras and it's just people gambling all day on YouTube.

1108
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:12,340
But that completely removes the drama that makes Big Brother at all an entertaining show

1109
00:56:12,340 --> 00:56:13,960
because nobody's going to leave their room.

1110
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:21,400
You think Trainwrecks has ever left the six runescape tile distance that it takes for

1111
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:25,000
him to walk to the kitchen sink and do code?

1112
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:30,080
I used to just brother as like an example of an ongoing thing forever.

1113
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:34,840
You just think we should have CCTV cams that sit in these people's houses?

1114
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:35,840
Yeah.

1115
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:36,840
Alright.

1116
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:40,260
Yeah, I think we will watch that.

1117
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:46,140
I think in general, I would love to watch every single Twitch streamer with more than 10,000

1118
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:47,760
average viewers.

1119
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:50,000
Just see what their inner life is like.

1120
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,000
I would-

1121
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:52,000
That's not good.

1122
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:53,000
Yeah, it's not good.

1123
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,000
And that's the point.

1124
00:56:54,000 --> 00:57:00,240
Yeah. No, I want to see Hasan like head in hands depressed 18 hours a day.

1125
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:11,100
Do you guys... I'm sure he does that on Twitch. I think you guys ever think about how like

1126
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:15,880
most people that you meet like who are even just like a year or two older than

1127
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:21,080
us just have no idea what we're talking about when it comes to like like nobody

1128
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:27,000
knows if they're over 30 who like a Twitch streamer is. Oh yeah. My brother could not

1129
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:31,880
name a single one. Yeah. Yeah. It's for very, it's for people who are addicted to their

1130
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:38,880
phones. Yeah. Whereas your brother, you know, he has much cooler addictions. That's true.

1131
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:45,160
Pool, playing pool. Playing pool. Yep. Pool and golf. That is a pretty amazing combo. Oh

1132
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,400
Dude, that's the awesomest, yeah.

1133
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,320
He would, your brother would be the most successful

1134
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,180
businessman alive 30 years ago.

1135
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,280
- There's no doubt, yeah.

1136
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:59,640
If you put him in Glen Gary, Glen Ross, he'd be like--

1137
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:01,080
- Yeah, he's Alec Baldwin.

1138
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:02,640
- Rushing it, dude.

1139
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:03,480
- Yeah.

1140
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,320
- He'd be crushing it.

1141
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,140
- Yeah.

1142
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,680
- I feel like there is a,

1143
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:14,360
you know, the connector from the Matrix?

1144
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,360
that goes into your neck.

1145
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,360
I feel like somebody is

1146
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:23,360
kind of fucking it up every single time they try to plug it in.

1147
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:27,360
And it just keeps hitting the most painful part of my spinal cord

1148
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:29,360
over and over and over again.

1149
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,360
Yeah. I think you do need help.

1150
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,360
You legitimately should go to a doctor.

1151
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:35,360
Shut your bitch ass up!

1152
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:37,360
You know this!

1153
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,360
What? The doctor doesn't do anything for stuff like this.

1154
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Maybe you should go to a chiropractor.

1155
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,360
That's a bunch of malarkey.

1156
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:50,360
So he breaks your back, you're like, "Alright, here you go, you're done, bud."

1157
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,360
You're like, "Oh, thank you." And then like in an hour, you die.

1158
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:58,360
I would rather be fully, permanently paralyzed than whatever in-between state I'm in right now,

1159
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,360
where I can't fucking tie my shoes.

1160
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,360
You don't have shoes you could just put on?

1161
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:10,360
I do. I just was using that as an example. I can't tie my shoes normally, okay?

1162
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:16,160
I think you're kind of currently that, you know, when you're watching one of those documentaries

1163
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,640
with like, yeah, and Gary was just walking around with this pain in his ass for a month.

1164
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:23,640
Little did he know.

1165
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,000
Little did he know he had ass cancer and he died one day from the explosion.

1166
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:35,040
You think I had spine cancer that was suddenly on set at the exact time that I was lifting

1167
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:39,280
a hundred pound weight in the worst way possible?

1168
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:42,020
I think, yeah, yes.

1169
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:44,240
- That'd just be plain unlucky, man.

1170
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:45,460
- Yeah, you slip the disc

1171
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,420
and it turned the cancer into overdrive.

1172
00:59:47,420 --> 00:59:49,880
- I could have a slipped disc,

1173
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,440
but I think slipped discs usually happen

1174
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:54,320
at the bottom of your back.

1175
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,000
So I'm not gonna worry about it.

1176
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,960
- You probably just tweaked your neck and pulled a muscle.

1177
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,040
- I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

1178
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:05,880
I'm gonna eat about two and a half milligrams of THC

1179
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:10,680
and I'm gonna play Counter-Strike Surf

1180
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:12,680
for the next two and a half hours just silently.

1181
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:14,360
- Is that your new addiction?

1182
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,560
- That is honestly the most addicted I've ever been

1183
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,080
to maybe anything right now.

1184
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,480
Is I'm addicted to Counter-Strike Surf.

1185
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,240
Yeah.

1186
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:24,320
- You should get into TFT with us.

1187
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:28,160
Requires no movement, no fast movements whatsoever.

1188
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,680
- But it's completely reading.

1189
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,640
- Not really.

1190
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,720
- No, it's just, it requires thought.

1191
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,720
it's looking at pictures all day

1192
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:39,040
okay i'll put it to you to get this

1193
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,960
most most might have a new rex just

1194
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:45,080
just like spends together in the disco called is completely silent for the

1195
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:45,840
alia

1196
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:50,700
but what's really for us on side filled and we just watch that and play it

1197
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,240
that's not a little fiend

1198
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,080
uh... seinfeld deemed crossword today in new york times and across the world

1199
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,340

1200
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,920

1201
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:04,340
the difference and i really can't

1202
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:09,460
And I actually now that I think about it, it's only a Jewish themed crossword.

1203
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:14,860
But one of them was, it was a roll on Seinfeld and it was Elaine.

1204
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:16,500
And I was like, huh, oh, it's Seinfeld.

1205
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:22,380
And then it was like, chutzpah and like, Hebrew word for this.

1206
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,660
And I was like, it is Seinfeld themed.

1207
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:25,660
Wow.

1208
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:26,820
This is Seinfeld.

1209
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,820
This is Curb Your Enthusiasm.

1210
01:01:27,820 --> 01:01:28,820
Yeah.

1211
01:01:28,820 --> 01:01:29,820
Yeah.

1212
01:01:29,820 --> 01:01:30,820
I think you didn't get to make that joke.

1213
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:33,220
That's the only two Jewish shows, right?

1214
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,220
What are some other...

1215
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:37,220
Is there other Jewish shows?

1216
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:39,220
Well, right. I mean, all of them are obviously Jewish shows.

1217
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:41,220
But like, you know...

1218
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:43,220
That's like it.

1219
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:45,220
Those are the most, at least.

1220
01:01:45,220 --> 01:01:47,220
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1221
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,220
Is there some sort of like Jewish cartoon?

1222
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:51,220
Young Sheldon.

1223
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:53,220
Is Sheldon Jewish?

1224
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,220
I've never watched The Big Bang Theory.

1225
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:57,220
He's annoying, but I don't know if he's Jewish.

1226
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,220
No, he's not Jewish.

1227
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:06,220
I know, I'm reading it in your eyes, it's like a teleprompter.

1228
01:02:06,220 --> 01:02:12,700
I love all Jewish people so much, man.

1229
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,700
I know.

1230
01:02:13,700 --> 01:02:18,820

1231
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:22,980
Yeah, sure, why not?

1232
01:02:22,980 --> 01:02:26,420
I really just want a Jewish mom so badly because they're so hot.

1233
01:02:26,420 --> 01:02:27,420

01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:28,940

1236
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:38,540

1241
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:14,180
watched a lot of stand-up comedy and my mom was so annoying and uptight in my

1242
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:19,620
head I like after watching you know enough comedy I was like the problem is

1243
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:24,380
my mom isn't getting laid. She needs to fuck something so she can fucking stop

1244
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:29,980
just bothering me all the time. So like I remember she had this like boyfriend and

1245
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:33,120
he's talking about getting like a like a Hummer like the like the you know the

1246
01:03:33,120 --> 01:03:38,780

1248
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,300
She'll stop being so fucking annoying

1249
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:53,260
If she gets a dick yeah, she gets a dick you know and my 12 year old 11 year old brain that made sense

1250
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:56,420
Obviously, I don't think anything

1251
01:03:56,420 --> 01:04:01,820
Nothing would have saved her an 11 year old to be thinking about it's like I need to get my mom

1252
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:07,020
I need to get some guy to rail my mom so she shuts up. Yeah

1253
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:12,400
I've always been thinking it's like you you've always been thinking about your mom getting railed

1254
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:18,820
No, no, just admitted that ways to get rid of shut up to get her. Yeah, like a fucking dick in her mouth

1255
01:04:18,820 --> 01:04:20,460
So she can't talk

1256
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:24,020
What is wrong with you if you were my son thinking about the specifics?

1257
01:04:24,020 --> 01:04:26,620
I would suck your penis if you were my son honestly

1258
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:30,260
All right, I gotta go piss

1259
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:32,260
