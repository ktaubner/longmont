1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, this is recording too.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
So, Patrick, why do you have a book in your bag?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Or rather, let's start, what's in your bag?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
What's in your bag?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Okay, so, I didn't think I was going to have to talk about this, but

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Now you do. You flashed it on purpose.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I've been reading.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
You have not been reading the Rent-is-all World History.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I've been reading lately. I've been trying to brush up on some stuff that I already knew.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Name one thing that happens in this book, and without opening it, you can't open it to read it.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,500
today in

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,980
nineteen forty five World War Two ends

13
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,820
cetera.

14
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:42,560
Can I say I was one of the chapters? This is the second time that I've noticed a

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,760
book in his in his bag and do you know what the first book was that I noticed?

16
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,800
I do this one is a world history textbook for people who aren't who aren't

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,800
watching the video. The first time I noticed a book in his bag was a couple

18
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,680
weeks ago and he had in his bag a copy of the outsiders. Wow, a bad news is

19
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:03,240
I graduated to world history. Bad news, there's conflicting forces in Japan.

20
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:09,040
Right now? No, this looks like it started in the 1920s. I think there's

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,280
conflicting forces in Japan, the different Pokemon. Yeah, I think it's

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,160
I actually think it's... I think it's whites versus Japanese right now. I

23
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,400
think it's tradition versus technology. Guys who keep moving, white guys who

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,800
move over there. You think Japan is whites versus Japanese? I think right

25
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:24,820
That's Japan.

26
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,820
In the dating pool.

27
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:29,300
The dating pool in Japan is whites versus...

28
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:37,740
It's lanky little white guys or big fat white guys versus big fat Japanese guys and lanky

29
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,220
little Japanese guys.

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,220
Why are you...

31
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,380
If they have the same body types, why are you specifying the body types?

32
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,220
Because of their different stats and skills.

33
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:49,780
Who do you think has better stats, the whites or the Japanese?

34
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:57,740
I think personally, and this is based on stuff I've read in here, this book, I think personally

35
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:06,460
on the whites team, I think that lanky wins most of the time, but on the Japanese side,

36
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,140
big fat juicy boy.

37
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,460
And who do you think should win in the dating pool in Japan, whites or Japanese?

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,460
Japanese.

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,220
You think Japanese should only date Japanese people?

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,340
I think that Japanese guys...

41
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,180
Japanese guys. You learn this after you read world history and you got to the

42
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:23,580
end of World War Two and you came to this conclusion. That Japanese guys should

43
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,060
date white ladies. That's not what you said. In Japan. Let's try to get him

44
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,700
today. You try to get me every single day. Let's try to get him. Okay, here's

45
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,460
what's worrying me about this development. Here's what's worrying me.

46
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,860
Napoleon falls from power or unless that's good, I don't

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:44,820
actually don't know. Was Napoleon a good man or a bad man? I think he was small.

48
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:50,700
he was book and certainly small. This book ends in the cold war. Yeah, I don't

49
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,660
know what the curriculum is. It's all on the it's on the back. I'm it seems like

50
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,820
it's all in the back. What this kind of worries me, because it means it means

51
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,100
that you think that the podcast is going to fail and you will need to go back to

52
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,980
school. I've already been going back to school for what for history you're

53
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,180
studying history at what college curry curry college yeah online.

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:17,500
you're doing online history classes at curry college. Yes, to finish your

55
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,520
degree and this is my text. Do you think? Oh, you know what I think is

56
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:24,800
you're a spilling Susan. We have hand towels now. Oh yeah, I bought a hand

57
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,220
towel.

58
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:29,020
Go get it. Don't just let it do that. Get a hand towel right now. Let it

59
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,980
spill. Go. He's mad that I called him a spilling. Go whatever. Holy shit.

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,760
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Cameron, you're going to get excited. Okay,

61
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,280
what's this?

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,900
Pages one sixteen through one seventeen. Oh, those I like that. Guess who shows

63
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,180
up?

64
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:49,980
Yeah, geez, let me guess a little and he's from okay. I'll give you yeah.

65
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,780
Give me some money. Let me guess. Okay,

66
00:03:51,780 --> 00:04:00,020
he's big and yellow Sponge Bob. No, no, but you're on the right path. Okay,

67
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,420
Larry the Lobster, who turned yellow, what is wrong with your brain? He's

68
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,740
bigger than Sponge Bob, a big yellow guy from history, a big yellow guy from

69
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:16,220
what a big yellow guy from a cartoon. He's not in the book. It says it right

70
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,220
here.

71
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:26,420
117 I'll give you a hint. Bart's father too big of a hint. I think it's Mo. He

72
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:31,020
doesn't know anything about Homer shows up. So I knew that one 17 and says what

73
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,820
he was pretty early in his that's earlier than I thought. I thought it was

74
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,620
That's page 117.

75
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,620
Wait, what's it?

76
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,120
What is it?

77
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,920
How is he on?

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,720
Oh, yeah, different Homer.

79
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,120
Yeah.

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,620
What?

81
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,420
It's a different Homer.

82
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,520
It's a different Homer.

83
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,220
Let's check.

84
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:45,820
Let's check.

85
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:46,720
Some fucking Greek loser.

86
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,320
Let's consult the book.

87
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,120
How funny is it that we named Homer Simpson after Homer Homer after Homer from the Odyssey.

88
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,820
Did guys have one name back then?

89
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:57,620
I believe so.

90
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:58,220
Right?

91
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,220
So they were Homer.

92
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,520
You'd say you're Homer and then you'd say what Homer, what your address was basically.

93
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,920
Yeah, that is what was your name? What would your name be if you were in

94
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,960
ancient Greece? You would be Patrick of what of

95
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,280
what's your address? My address is 2060 Gates Avenue.

96
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:21,480
You live there? Yeah, you don't live there. You don't live. I live. You just

97
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,480
made that up. Currently, I live there. That's a pizza place because of a

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,720
problem. Yeah, that's a pizza place with the worst pizza ever. Don't go. Do not

99
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,080
go. Go there. It's the worst pizza I've ever had in my life.

100
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,740
But yeah, I am a little worried about you giving up on the podcast because you're not giving

101
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:44,320
up. I'm just trying to maybe make the conversations a little bit more interesting. Right. Okay.

102
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:48,180
I'm actually really good at cleaning. I just look at your puddle under your stand. Yeah,

103
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,520
you are. You are sloppy. Well, guess what? This is your belate with no sugar in it. So

104
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,640
it's not sticky. So it actually doesn't matter. What happened? Food is a weapon. Food is a

105
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,120
as a weapon in one thousand nine hundred and thirty two when peasants failed to

106
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,120
meet unrealistic crop quotas, Stalin retaliated by seizing all of their grain

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,080
to sell on the market. Hello to more yes, wow crap and people idolize. We don't

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:16,040
more people idolize this Stalin figure. He's using food as though he's having an

109
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:21,640
international food fight. How cool well no because how despicably evil give me

110
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:25,080
that book right now. Don't drop that book. How despicably evil do you have to

111
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,080
way to take food, one of God's greatest gifts and use it as a

112
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,620
as a complete. Well, I was thinking something about God

113
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,020
this morning that this is kind of off top. What if God was on

114
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,120
the bus? No, I was thinking that basically Tom Cruise would

115
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,000
be such a horrible father and his children, maybe because he

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,500
was in Scientology. So maybe his children would suffer and

117
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,200
they wouldn't like him very much as a father. And if God

118
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,900
was good, then what he would do would be would let a Tom Cruise

119
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,200
fan of Tom Cruise's movies reincarnate as Tom Cruise's kid

120
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,580
and keep their memories, because that's the only way you could have tom cruise

121
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:01,140
have a kid and that what is like the psycho? Why you thought about this

122
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,520
earlier? This is not in the hour. No, I was after the shower. That's when you

123
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,460
get your best ideas yeah after the show yeah after the show when I'm clean. I

124
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:11,220
was thinking about mission impossible and I then I was thinking about that.

125
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,260
What kind of thoughts do you sit there having about mission impossible standing

126
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,820
and I was thinking I'm excited for mission possible.

127
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,180
You are a simpleton. I'm not a sim. It's less than a week till I get your not

128
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,900
impossible to read world history. I already read all that shit. Really

129
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,460
watching movies here. Tell me something. Tell me about the instability in

130
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,300
Ireland. It was rough for the Irish. It was right for the Irish. Yeah, points

131
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:40,700
points. Cameron, did you know that there was actually absentee landlords who

132
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:44,780
owned large estates but did not live in them? Remind you of any city in

133
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,740
America? Uh huh. New York and New York City. New York City is a bunch of

134
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,960
Saudi Arabian guys that have $400 million apartments and they don't live in them. But I actually

135
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,860
think I read that that was not true.

136
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,220
Yeah, I thought that my landlord left the country, but then I saw him.

137
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,540
Yeah. In the country?

138
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
Yeah, outside my house.

139
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:10,540
I saw our landlord for this building whipping it on an e-bike with his little helmet.

140
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,540
Yeah, he was getting it.

141
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,100
He was like going at fucking...

142
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,100
I can't even believe that.

143
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,940
What's that motorcycle guy?

144
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:19,180
China was at the Cold War's wild card.

145
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,420
really yeah wow they were kind of a bonus game because of the the information

146
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:28,380
they could spread well basically they or their population of one billion the

147
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:33,260
communist basically triumphed sadly oh yeah in the cold war yeah and they made

148
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,540
a bunch of red photos yeah they made a bunch of red photos

149
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:40,540
wait for example red photo red painting of a guy with a gun

150
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:45,420
holy cow if you guys were in china would you have stood in front of that

151
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,080
that tank I will be in the yeah

152
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:54,420
follow whatever possible career path. I could to be in that tank. Please God put

153
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,500
me in that fucking well. Why do you need to be there right now? If I had

154
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:58,780
my

155
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:04,200
watching on TV, I'd be getting such fucking FOMO. I'd be like fuck and I

156
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,520
would not be doing that left right. I would be going for

157
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,440
yeah, exactly. I would put a cannon thing in the guy's mouth. Shoot it

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,160
Actually, I would just start. I wouldn't even shoot it. Why do you think? Why do

159
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,360
you think

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,000
that should have been fucking me? I'm a certain me stood in front of that tank

161
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,660
because he was like, stop, let me in. Let me in. I want to

162
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:33,200
he was on the lunch run. Yeah, he was supposed to be in the tank. He was

163
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,560
supposed to be in the tank. He was supposed to be hanging out with them.

164
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:39,720
He was supposed to be helping them out. That actually is me when I in 10

165
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,480
years travel back in time to try to get into the tank and then I find out

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,680
but I'm the tank man. That's an amazing story. I just wrote that is an amazing

167
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,440
story. The guy who wants to go back so he can be in the tank. He thinks tank man is

168
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,900
the man in the tank and he goes back and he is trying to and he's like well, let

169
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:59,600
me get a snack for all my new friends and also a couple of twenty four ounce

170
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:04,480
sodas. Yes, and then he has. Do you think they had those in communist China? I

171
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
don't think they even I don't think they even had water. If you ask me really

172
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,760
yeah, it's just because of the because they treat people like machines. Yeah,

173
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,000
exactly what you read in here. They put gasoline in people's ears. Yeah,

174
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,960
really? No, I don't know. A hundred percent. I mean, it probably says, I

175
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,080
mean, we can consult, we can consult this. It probably says what they, what

176
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,920
they drank in here. Yeah, I feel like this says that

177
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,080
this book, this is a New York Discovery School textbook, probably liberal. I

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:32,680
think, no, I think that maybe, I mean, we're in Queens, I think that maybe

179
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:36,680
this book is saying that in China, they used to make all students eat poop.

180
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,920
Do you think a book changes based on where you are? Yes.

181
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,420
Let's see what it says about our Lord and Savior.

182
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,820
That's what I'm interested in.

183
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,420
That's a good point.

184
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,720
How far back does it go?

185
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,320
Does it start in Mesopotamia?

186
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,620
I really hope.

187
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,120
Why does it say New York table of contents?

188
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,920
Oh,

189
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,720
ancient Rome and the rise of Christianity.

190
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,220
Yes.

191
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,120
That's a whole chapter.

192
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,620
Okay, let's see.

193
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,120
166.

194
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,620
Hold on.

195
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,720
Let's see what it says about God.

196
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
About the one.

197
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,320
Probably says nothing.

198
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,420
It probably says absolutely nothing.

199
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,920
It probably says something like.

200
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,520
Romana a new religion Christianity arose in a distant corner of the Roman Empire.

201
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,320
They're already trying to qualify it. Yeah. Oh, it was so far away from Rome.

202
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,720
It wasn't directly in the Coliseum. Shut up

203
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:23,420
with the culturally diverse Roman Empire various religious beliefs coexisted

204
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:28,520
Jupiter Mars Juno. That's two planets and a movie that is not any kind of

205
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:34,320
religion. Yeah, Juno is what was that one? That's June. No, that's June in

206
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:40,960
in Spanish, but what planet is Juno Juno's a moon of Saturn in the movie.

207
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:44,800
I don't know as big as a one of the planets have possibly a trillion moons.

208
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,000
You'll like this Patrick. You'll like this next part. A Jewish rebellion is

209
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,680
defeated. What do you mean that like that part? I just don't like that. Isn't

210
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,120
that what you strive for? No most of the time to defeat a Jewish. My look my

211
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,920
Jew, me and my Jewish rebels

212
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,060
we are a bell against undefeated. We are undefeated, you're on me and all my

213
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:08,240
rebelling against Judy, you know my J. You plus Jews are under the dogs.

214
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,300
They're my J. Dog, we got him again

215
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,480
a double G's double G

216
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:20,500
D, A, W, double G, D, W. If you oh my God, if you were in there, if you were

217
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,520
an ancient Christian, D, W, I don't get her ass out of there. I would like to be

218
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,540
walking up to everyone in history, just saying shit like it's my turn. Yeah,

219
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:35,580
tank man. She walks up to tank man saying get the hell out of the street.

220
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:39,340
It's my turn to stand here. Yeah. Oh, my God, and today it would probably be

221
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:43,060
blown up today would probably be Tesla man or something or Tesla woman,

222
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,860
Tesla in the square, Tesla, anion devil,

223
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:53,620
the Tesla anion devil. What's that a guy? It's a little guy. That's one of

224
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:57,860
the cars. He runs on a lithium ion battery. I think I want to buy an

225
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,900
electric car. The thing is about Tesla...

226
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
You should get rid of your car.

227
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
Shut up!

228
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Your car is like...

229
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
My car is awesome.

230
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Your car is on its last limbs.

231
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:08,900
It doesn't have limbs, it has wheels. It's on its last wheels.

232
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,900
Cars are... wheels are a car's limbs.

233
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,900
You watch too many cartoons.

234
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,900
I watch too much car... I've never actually seen cars.

235
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
Really? I've seen cars over a hundred times.

236
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,900
I think Pixar fell off.

237
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
Over a hundred times.

238
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,900
Easily. Easily a hundred. My little brother used to watch cars every single day and I

239
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
I had to watch him and I would watch Cars every single day.

240
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:32,900
At that point when Cars came out I was already watching like Jackass and like Naviva La Bam.

241
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:39,900
I thought Cars was gay. I thought liking Cars as in the vehicles was gay.

242
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Whoa!

243
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,900
That too. That's what I thought as a kid.

244
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,900
As you get older though you realize that it's actually kind of cool.

245
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Realize it's actually kind of gay.

246
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
It's not gay to like Cars.

247
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,900
I like El Caminos because that's what my name is Earl Drove.

248
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
Oh yeah he did.

249
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:05,580
did. He had a really busted El Camino that had a purple door, or a blue door. He had a

250
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:11,460
blue door on the side of it and he had a brother named Randy who was a fatso who was in love

251
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:21,660
with Catalina the maid. My name is Roman. If you were an ancient Roman and they pull up

252
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:26,660
up. My name would be played in my name is played in. If you were an ancient Roman

253
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,260
and the disciples pulled up on you and said yo mother fucker, yo played in hop

254
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,020
into chariot, we're going to Bethlehem. Would you go? Would you believe in

255
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:43,220
Christ? Because I like to say I like to think that I was going there to beat the

256
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:47,700
fuck out of pretty sure they're beating him. Okay, no, if I was there when he was

257
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,440
to doing stuff. I think there's a decent chance. I think that if you're if

258
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,400
somebody turns water to wine in front of you before you know about magic tricks,

259
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,100
you have to believe he's God. Yeah,

260
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:02,400
what I yeah. Do you think Jesus was just doing magic? What I want to know, I

261
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,800
think he was. I mean, could do you think that couldn't a Roman person wrote

262
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,880
there's not it's not like a Roman mythology didn't have some kind of

263
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,440
monster that could turn water into wine or something, but with Roman mythology,

264
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,540
I think they all knew it was not really when they were on their way to

265
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,760
Bethlehem. They were Roman because you could like if I was a Roman guy and I

266
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,720
was into and there was nobody up there. I was into Jupiter and Mars and

267
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,600
whatever. I would be like, Oh my God, this must guy must be Jupiter. I

268
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,800
wouldn't think this is a new type of God. I honestly also starts with J

269
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,420
completely new thing. I probably would be a little bit like well. We already

270
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:40,880
have cooler God. Yeah, yeah, eyes and shit like you want. I guess it would

271
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:45,260
kind of like Pokemon where I'd be like, I want to go back to the first game where there's

272
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,780
only like one or two. Yeah. You want me to like, there's too many. Now they have just

273
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:55,260
a normal guy. Yeah. The guy with long girly hair. He's really good at cooking. That's

274
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,540
his thing. He can make a bunch of food. He can make bread into fish. No. Right? No, he

275
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:04,060
can make bread and fish appear. Oh, okay. I thought he'd turn the bread into fish. I

276
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:10,860
thought it was a lot of, uh, what is it? Transmorphication. Thanks for the... He was doing... Transmorgifying

277
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:15,560
transifying what's trend, not trans modifying chair and that's a Calvary

278
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,760
Hobbs. Yeah, that's a thing. I thought that's what Christ was doing was with

279
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,300
the bread transubstantiation. You you you to you to you know who you to remind me

280
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,500
of goofus and gallant, who's who

281
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:33,540
this is goofus and you are gallant gallant was fire gallant. This was a

282
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:37,040
piece of shit about that. You don't think you're goof. I've never seen

283
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,760
Goofus so you didn't you didn't read highlights. Goofus would not

284
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,240
read Goofus and Gali. He did not know the difference between right and wrong.

285
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,600
Yeah,

286
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:51,320
he looks cool. He looks like actually wait, go back. You think Goofus is cool.

287
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,640
You're Goofus. Go back. You Goofus for real.

288
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,540
Go back to those. Go back to yeah. He looks like

289
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,120
Karen Carpenter

290
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,020
I didn't know the Carpenters had a song called Goof. It's not a very good name

291
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:13,040
song. I bet this song is probably pretty cutting for goofus. I bet he does not want to hear

292
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:18,920
that one. How incredibly dumb do you have to be as a parent to name your child goofus?

293
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,980
You don't know. That's like naming your kid Karen. You're putting them down the wrong

294
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:28,040
path instantly. I feel like if you named your kid goofus, I think that you had maybe the

295
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:35,040
epidural hit you a little too hard. The epidural. Oh, the thing that makes the pussy sound?

296
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,240
the pain. So I was a kid reading. Is that what it does? I thought it was a

297
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,340
painkiller. Yeah, dilates their vaginas. Oh, I thought that it was. I thought

298
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,140
that that was like the same as dilated. No, I think they get. I think they

299
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:49,840
get fentanyl. Now I heard a story. I want to get if I were real quick.

300
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,640
If I was a kid and I was reading goofus and gallant, I would be

301
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,400
reading it and I would be like, well, this is all very interesting,

302
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,840
but thank God my name isn't goofus or gallant and I can just be

303
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,640
a normal kid. Yeah, it must be really hard. If your last name was

304
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:06,240
goofish see that would be tough yeah. Mike goofus yeah. What if you only knew

305
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,780
Japanese and then you started reading goofus and gallant and you read gallant

306
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:14,180
and goofus and you thought that goofus was the good one. Oh, you're reading

307
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:18,680
right to left. Well, they still do the things they still translate it. Yeah,

308
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,700
so well they're still drawings. I'm doing this stuff yeah, but you think

309
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,240
that the last one's the good. They will be captioned. Oh, you can't think that

310
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,040
the last thing done is you can't yeah. You can't read even though it's called

311
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,240
gallant and goofus yeah, but you don't know what that means either

312
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,300
right you're thinking even read it. You're just looking at the pictures.

313
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,420
I said these are two things. The second guy would be the thing would be the

314
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,660
good one. If there was two and it's supposed to teach you a lesson. So all

315
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,620
of a sudden you're the one you're putting you're doing pranks, you're

316
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,460
putting salt in the sugar and you have no one to tell you. Otherwise,

317
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,220
we may be gallant could show up.

318
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,540
He's not real Patrick.

319
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:56,940
You didn't even know he existed until right now and you're already thinking

320
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,820
that there's a guy you're telling me about yeah. These are two people. I

321
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:04,120
you? Yeah. No, they're drawings. You, you, they're cartoon stories all the time.

322
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,220
Like, oh, and we, we used to, you're the one who would have friends,

323
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,720
Ben Gufus and Gallant. Yeah. I never said we used to, you are the

324
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,740
one with the Theo Vaughn stories. I do not say that I ate a

325
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,900
bullfrog. I never do anything like that. You, you, you told me, I used to

326
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,840
hit myself in the nuts. That's all I used to do. You told me,

327
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,060
that's the only crazy thing of my life. You said that you made a

328
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:25,020
kid in your neighborhood paint your fence white. That never happened, man.

329
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,460
You would say, you say, oh, I made this, when I, like,

330
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:31,500
growing up. We used to have this kid called fucking bullfrog and we there was

331
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,000
no you had a friend named chowder. We would really name different. We would

332
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,100
pay him. You had a buffet of friends. We did make him do stuff you that's what it

333
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,720
is. You would a friend. You were crazy and you had food friends. Admit it. You

334
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,800
were sitting in your house right now. I had this is my friend. Yeah, you say

335
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,220
mom, please catch a mustard come over later.

336
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:55,900
Your mom says ketchup can come over, but mustard is a bad and yeah, mustard is a

337
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,280
I must go everywhere together. I can't invite just one of them. Their best

338
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,620
friends. They live in that big white house in our kitchen. Oh my God, when

339
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,960
your mom is like you have to invite broccoli to your birthday party. I

340
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,100
fucking like mom. I want to invite crunch bar. Yeah, crunch bars. I want

341
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,040
crunch bar lolly. He's not a good cat. You guys remember any birthdays from

342
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:16,760
when you were growing up. I remember my brother's like

343
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:22,280
fifth birthday, because he tried to blow out the candles by spitting on them. No,

344
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,580
I remember my first birthday after I started being home. You don't remember

345
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,960
you're okay, not my first

346
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,300
I was going to say you say stuff like that all the time. Remember your first

347
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,680
you do say you remember your first I had remember my first birthday. I left

348
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:40,520
was your first memory, my first memory, the thing that's happening right now. I

349
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,580
can remember now. So you just tried to say I think he knows yeah

350
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:50,120
I can remember I claimed for a long time. I could remember my first steps.

351
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,960
I claim that to my mom. She's like no, you can't yeah. I was like you're

352
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,760
probably right. I used to say shit like that all the time. There was like

353
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,900
in kindergarten. They had like a thing in the back of the like kindergarten

354
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,760
yearbook. That was like kids say the darndest things and it was they would

355
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,460
just write down shit that kids in the classroom said and like a good chunk of

356
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:13,640
it was stuff that I would just like try to say to the teachers. So I would sound

357
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:18,320
cooler. What would you tell the teacher? I told my teacher that I saw the Statue

358
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,720
of Liberty when I moved to America from Boston.

359
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:29,480
And that's like that's back. Yeah, that is a darn thing. Yeah, it is a darn thing for

360
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:37,040
sure. My first birthday. Oh, my mom knew Christopher Columbus. Those are the most

361
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:42,400
wild lies I've ever heard. How old were you? I was five. Oh, I think I was like,

362
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,840
Oh, yeah, my mom knows that guy. I first day of first grade, I told everybody in

363
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,200
the class that I had been skydiving. Wow. The day before. Sick. Yeah, it's cool. And nobody

364
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:57,620
believed me, but it was true. It wasn't true. I remember my first birthday after I started

365
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:03,760
being homeschooled. I like left sixth grade and then over the summer didn't really see

366
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,720
anybody then I have my well, I guess it was the next year, but I had my first birthday

367
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:13,520
after that. I invited like all my middle school friends and they had all hit puberty and I

368
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,080
So I was just a little ass kid and just like eight grown men walked in and they all were

369
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,560
trying to have sex with my mom.

370
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,960
And I had to get in between them.

371
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
They, "No!"

372
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,360
Hey, if you want to have sex with my mom, you're going to have to go through me first.

373
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,360
And then they did.

374
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,360
That's what you did.

375
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,360
What's that?

376
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,660
I hissed at them.

377
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:32,660
You did the dog whisperer.

378
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,660
Oh, the Caesar Milan.

379
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Yeah.

380
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,660
You should be able to train people like that.

381
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,660
Have you seen this guy Jackson Galaxy?

382
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,660
No.

383
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:41,440
He's like Caesar Milan for cats.

384
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,760
Cats do not need to be anything.

385
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:49,760
anything. Your cat needs to be put down. You like him, you just pretend like you don't like

386
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:57,760
him on the podcast. You like him, he cuddled up on you. He cuddled up on you and you were

387
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:05,440
holding him and you were like he's cool. He can sense it. Well, he still likes my cat

388
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
and he doesn't want to admit it. You like Phil and you don't want to admit it. I admit

389
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,580
that I like actually all the time. You don't feel and I are feeling our good

390
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,880
friends now. Phil likes you a lot more than like me. Clancy does not like me.

391
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:23,120
One Joe's dog Clancy hates Joe's dog. It's just every single time. It's the

392
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,720
nicest dog in the entire world until he sees Patrick. He turns into a complete

393
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:32,040
because I walked in with a skateboard one time and the wheels were still

394
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:36,280
spinning. It's also because every time I tried to show it to him so that he I

395
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:41,080
I didn't I don't know how to go socialize with dogs and I tried to show it to him

396
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,320
to show him that it wasn't a threat and then he ran over and tried to bite me.

397
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:52,680
You walk like a monster at him. You do when I have a heavy step and he doesn't

398
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:57,680
like loud noise directly towards him. I don't do that much that I don't know

399
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:03,000
what did I do and you inject him with things. I've still let me Joe Joe told

400
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:07,020
to feed him a Cheez-It so that he would stop barking at me.

401
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,900
And did it work?

402
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,400
Yes.

403
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,180
No, it didn't.

404
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,860
It did. It worked for a little while.

405
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,620
And then I moved a chair.

406
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:16,380
It was a spicy Cheez-It. It was a prank Cheez-It. I had one and it spiced me out.

407
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,180
Didn't spice you. You have a crazy low tolerance.

408
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,780
I used to have an extremely high tolerance and then as you know I was dosed.

409
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,980
You were dosed?

410
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,020
I've told you this before.

411
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,580
What happened?

412
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:30,700
My cousin, Nicholas, dosed me with pure capsaicin when I was 16 years old.

413
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,200
Oh.

414
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:36,780
he spent all year synthesizing pure capsaicin from a fucking Carolina Reaper.

415
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,380
No, that's what they just call like bell peppers down in Australia, down under.

416
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,700
A Carolina Reaper?

417
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,620
No, just they call capsaicin.

418
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,660
All peppers are called capsaicin down there.

419
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,460
They are so backwards and upside down.

420
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,380
They call it the name of the chemical?

421
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:52,620
Yep.

422
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,060
That's weird.

423
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,020
That's really weird.

424
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:58,860
Australia is... people don't talk about how fucking weird it is down there.

425
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,580
I think that they do pretty often.

426
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,780
Their toilets are weird.

427
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,780
often. What do you mean? I think there's an entire Simpsons episode actually.

428
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:09,740
What? Knifey Spoony. Yeah, but that's a Crocodile Dundee parody. I mean,

429
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:14,340
noping the fuck out when I see Australian wildlife. Crocodile Dundee is

430
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:17,660
like... You know what I've heard from people? He's Australian, but that's like

431
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,980
a parody or whatever. People who I know in Australia have literally gone home

432
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:21,620
with a girl,

433
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:25,820
a couple of drinks, right? I'm not gonna say they're sober. They go home with

434
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,220
a girl, they wake up the next day. She's a crocodile? It's a fucking spider.

435
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:36,940
it's a giant black spider. Oh, it's biting their finger. You I saw a picture

436
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,460
on Twitter. It's a sperm crawled into someone's shower. Oh, I saw that. Did

437
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:44,940
you see that? There a sperm and Australian wild sperm? Yeah, they got

438
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:48,420
they float in the air. It's called like a rat tailed bug or something.

439
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:54,540
No, it's not. Yeah, it is. It's called a rat tailed bug, Australian sperm,

440
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,900
wild sperm crawled in my ear.

441
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:05,780
wanted a few good. This is Jubio. You did not look up the right thing. I

442
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:10,280
wonder if I if I can look up a rat tail bug, look up rat tailed bug,

443
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:14,260
Australia. No, this is not. No, it's all sperm. Wait, have you guys? Sorry,

444
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:17,220
this whale thing just made me think of this. Have you guys heard that there

445
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,740
have been five shark attacks on Long Island in the last two days, but Long

446
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:24,340
Island on Long Island on the South Shore Long Island,

447
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:29,400
that can't be what it is. That is what it is. That's not that is a right to

448
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,960
bug. Yeah, a wild sperm crawled across their foot. It looks like a finger with

449
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,700
a long nail. Isn't it crazy? Yeah, that's disgusting. So get this you'll

450
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,740
like this Cameron yeah

451
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,460
five shark attacks in two days, but every single one of the people

452
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,580
was a whale. They did not see a shark and they didn't see what bit them. So

453
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:52,660
they're alleged shark attacks, but people, but they have been putting out

454
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,540
drones to like like out on the sea to see because you can see usually the

455
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:00,040
sharks and where they're where they're swimming. I have trackers too, but they

456
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,500
cannot find any sharks. That's crazy. Some kind of aquatic animal that is not

457
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,580
a shark has been biting people. I've been saying avatar two is coming. It's

458
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,540
coming out in real life. That's what it may be. I was like this is happening

459
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:11,860
now. I

460
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:17,540
okay, tell tell what you said about avatar being okay. So first of all,

461
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:21,700
there's the orca attacks. Yeah, that are orcas attacking ships that happens in

462
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,940
Avatar 2, Paya Khan, the rebel Tolkien sinks the ship. Yes, I remember this.

463
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,020
Yeah, a Tolkien. It's like a Pandora and whale, but they're highly intelligent.

464
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,340
Yeah, and also very emotional. And they sing and speak, and there's a musical

465
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,380
number. They can speak, but they don't sing, and there's no musical number. And

466
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:40,580
they love. There was also submarines. There's submarines in Avatar 2 that go

467
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,020
down.

468
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:46,940
The submarine was going down to... Oh, my God. To the Titanic in real life. James

469
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,980
Cameron's favourite movie. What happens in Avatar 2, a giant boat sinks, and

470
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:54,520
there's submarines involved. He did another boat sinking movie. It's so

471
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,300
sick. You didn't see it. No, I haven't seen Avatar to whoa. I don't go to the

472
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:02,280
movies. Blue people. Well, it's on Disney plus and a way of people where I can't

473
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,100
watch movies. I will be coming soon. That is the next thing. Yeah, so

474
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:10,780
just keep raspberry. Just keep an eye out. I can't think I can't remember

475
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:14,220
exactly any examples. I've definitely seen some blue people. I can't remember

476
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,760
specifically where when, but it is happening and you'll notice it when you

477
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:21,720
wait and now these a little silver people are eating colloidal silver as a

478
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,680
health thing because I haven't a long time ago because a new tropic I'm

479
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:28,340
talking about blue people goof and not people who turn blue but completely

480
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,120
blue when it's Paltrow has been selling colloidal so there's a big dunkley

481
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,140
osteos shark monster and avatar too and that's probably what's attacking these

482
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:41,840
don't go off on my island yeah dunkley osteos osteos osteos I do think that

483
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,460
it's probably it's probably has something to do with these UAPs that

484
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,460
we've had been having all of the time.

485
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,460
What's a UAP?

486
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,460
Unexplained Alien Phenomenon?

487
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
Ariel.

488
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,460
Ariel.

489
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,460
Yeah, this fucking guy.

490
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:52,460
But close, but close.

491
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,460
This fucking guy.

492
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,460
It's like he doesn't know that Marco Rubio, one of the most trusted people in all of America,

493
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,940
has been blowing the whistle on this.

494
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,940
Really?

495
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:04,380
They've been doing hearings in Congress.

496
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,380
Isn't Tom DeLonge there?

497
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,700
From the entire Congress.

498
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,540
Everything that Tom DeLonge said three years ago is coming true.

499
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,580
Tom DeLonge said three years ago, in three to five years you're going to have disclosure.

500
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:17,980
I just remembered that I saw a video a couple days ago. I can't believe I just

501
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:21,300
remember they were testing project blue beam in Dubai by making a bunch of

502
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:26,380
holograms of whales, blue line up into the sky, blue beam, what's blue beam?

503
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:30,420
That's the where they're going to end the world with holograms. Why would that

504
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,780
in the world? Well, they're basically going to use holograms to cause every

505
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:38,100
religious event like the second coming and all this stuff. Everything is

506
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,540
going to make it seem real. They're going to make it seem like aliens are

507
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,240
come in and contact us with holograms, so that we everything they're going to

508
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,880
rain. They're basically ramping up the world to the next level. Do you think

509
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,940
they're going to create a new world government? So there you're saying that

510
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:54,240
Jesus is going to come back, walk down from the stairway to heaven, simulate it

511
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:00,380
and say I am I'm the savior. I'm come again. By the way, do not touch me. Do

512
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,580
not touch anything that I'm on and also there's going to be a new government

513
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,460
and it's going to be fire. Yeah, the new government, you guys all got to get in

514
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,120
on it. You should all be ruled by this new government. That's basically what

515
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:16,080
probably getting pretty pretty close to the seven sisters of the Apocalypse.

516
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,640
Yeah, I think that all that I thought it was for horseman

517
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:25,140
whatever. What is the seven sisters? I don't it's my own thing. Your own thing

518
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,600
that you made up. I mean, I just said it's all like the twits. I like the

519
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,160
twins. I think I think it's all the famous twits, Mary Kate and Ashley T and

520
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,720
Tamara

521
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,340
sisters. That's for we go. We need so it's it's repair. Okay, we're going to

522
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:42,740
add Elizabeth Olsen. It's okay. And then a triplet is there any famous triplet.

523
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,340
Well, I'm saying you can add Elizabeth Olsen to get her to an odd. No, it's

524
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:50,040
two pairs of twins and three the Kardashian girls. Holy fuck. Yeah. So

525
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,740
there you go. Actually, I think that the four horse though, they've been

526
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,440
around a long time. Yeah, the seven sisters. The apocalypse started a while

527
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,140
ago. Yeah, it's a 30 year tribulation. So long to get ready.

528
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,040
That is the first one of the episodes.

529
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,040
That was fire.

530
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:12,440
It takes so long to get ready that you think that that apocalypse is going to start now?

531
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,400
They've been getting ready for it for years.

532
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,440
You're looking down at your watchers and saying, "We gotta go.

533
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
We gotta end the world."

534
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,640
Oh my God, the devil's having a hard time with these broads.

535
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,960
The devil is tapping his foot on the floor and he's going, "I'm not done yet.

536
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
I'm not done yet.

537
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,240
I'm still getting a blowout in my hair."

538
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:34,980
Me and Julio were on IMDb looking for movies for movie Mondays and I saw that

539
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:39,580
you can that you can put podcast episodes on IMDb and it was making me

540
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:43,100
laugh thinking about it, having this podcast on IMDb and going to the

541
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,340
soundtrack section. It says zombie nation

542
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,480
you got

543
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,940
to five hundred. I are on IMDb for a student film that has never or student

544
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
should have been censored. We I think

545
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:10,580
I just I don't I don't want that on my IMDB page. I want that gone. I don't

546
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:14,320
think you can take stuff off. Yeah, I know. I don't want it on there. Somebody

547
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,980
should make some I mean you can just put any movie on there, right? Yeah, so we

548
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,340
should make maybe a bunch of stuff, a bunch of awesome movies and put them on

549
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:24,580
there and send them to different producers. I see we've done a million

550
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:28,640
movies, nine point seven. I don't even know that. I don't know. We had a nine

551
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,800
What gave Patrick Goes to Jollibee like anything under a 10?

552
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,040
That's pretty funny. That's fucked up.

553
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,440
That is fucked up. Wait, what are the five user reviews?

554
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,040
Director Kayla Pitts. Director Kayla Pitts. That's a little...

555
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:44,360
Wonderful story of redemption, friendship, and a big, sexy, Filipino bee.

556
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,920
The director was Noah.

557
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,160
Wait, wait, there's spoilers for this one?

558
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,880
Can you see it? No, you can't. Oh, you can't.

559
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,760
I really like the scene where Patrick describes where he found out about

560
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,920
Jollibee, subtle brainwashing with the Patreon supporters part, but overall,

561
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,160
great film if you like food and want to see it. Stay away if you're a jellybee hater.

562
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
That's a pretty good review.

563
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:04,160
That's a good review.

564
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
So these are all 10 though.

565
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:10,120
Awesome movie. Touching story of friendship with laughs along the way. Patrick is my favorite.

566
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,680
Look at you buddy. Getting some props. Getting a nod.

567
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,960
Hopefully that's written by the Oscar, the Academy.

568
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:19,960
The Oscar Academy?

569
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
No, but it's Jay Haywood.

570
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,240
The Oscar Academy.

571
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,240
Jay Haywood.

572
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,240
Jay Wood.

573
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,240
It does not sound close enough to the Academy of Motion Pictures.

574
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,640
He's got wood like Hollywood. That's true. So yeah, but it's Haywood. That's a

575
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,520
worst town. I think that the four horsemen are already here. You want to

576
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,600
know who I think it is? Yeah, Bert Kreischer, Joe Rogan. Okay.

577
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,880
XQC, Hassan Habi, Aiden Ross, and Rice Gum. And Rice Gum. Yeah. I think it's

578
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,240
the streamers, man. Yeah, makes sense. Straight up. I think the streamers are in

579
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,040
charge of the apocalypse because I think they're screamers. I've been watching,

580
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:58,520
Well, these days you watch an excuse. I've been watching these all these

581
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:01,480
streamers 24 hours a day trying to study how to

582
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,640
take him down. You had to take them down. I've been studying excuse. It

583
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,480
turns out all you have to do the way you kill a streamers. You call the

584
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,280
police on them.

585
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,580
That's all you have to do. You call the cops and you say this guy is screaming

586
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,400
so loud into his microphone that you need to go kill them and they say we'll

587
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:21,480
be right over. I 40,000 people. It shouldn't it. It would be terrible. It

588
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,880
would be so bad. It's probably happened right excuse you getting swatted.

589
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:31,920
I think so. His reaction to that would be very funny. I think. And it would sound a

590
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:37,400
little like this. Oh my god, you guys, there's a bunch of cops at the door. You know I thought that he was from

591
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:45,240
Africa or something. Apparently he's Canadian. He's from like Quebec. He's some fucking Canadian guy.

592
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:49,720
He's a streamer that my girlfriend loves. Yeah and he goes, his whole thing is that he

593
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,760
goes really crazy on the stream.

594
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,480
Yeah. OK. He he watched I got

595
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,640
started watching it because he was

596
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,920
watching this thing where it's like

597
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,540
it's him reacting to the origin

598
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,640
of Jeff the Killer.

599
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,140
Like it's him watching one of these

600
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
like YouTube thing.

601
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,100
Cannot believe this guy has 50

602
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,980
million dollars.

603
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,920
That is so honestly that's so

604
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,980
100. He's made 100 million dollars

605
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,100
signing his little deal.

606
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,580
Yeah. That's what I think it is.

607
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,380
Well, he got banned from

608
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:22,240
or not banned, he got in trouble because he streamed the Dark Knight, right?

609
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,440
I have no fucking clue.

610
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,360
He streamed the Dark Knight on kick and then immediately he was like, okay, what my next

611
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,800
course of action is I'm going to start watching all of Breaking Bad.

612
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,600
Whoa, because there's just no rules on that website?

613
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:41,480
Well, no, there is rules and he is void, like, fucking up the terms of his own contract.

614
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,360
Oh, they won't let, he can't get in any trouble.

615
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,360
He's there.

616
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,360
No, absolutely not.

617
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,360
No, he's the number one.

618
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:50,280
Other guy they have on there is that guy that watched his wife get fucked or

619
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,400
something or his girlfriend.

620
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,000
Sneeko.

621
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,720
Sneeko, yeah.

622
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:53,800
I love Sneeko.

623
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,320
Yeah?

624
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,400
No.

625
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
You're a big fan of his?

626
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,800
I love Sneeko.

627
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,040
He's Andrew Tate's little friend?

628
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:01,720
He's just like--

629
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,760
Or no, that's Aiden Ross.

630
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,360
He's a kid who used to make Call of Duty videos where he would play Call of Duty

631
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,000
and then debate somebody about gay marriage.

632
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,040
And then now--

633
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,520
Jesus Christ, dude.

634
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,440
And now he makes videos where he gets beat up.

635
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,240
This is so stupid.

636
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,320
I think it's awesome, dude.

637
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,680
I think that this is what kids should be looking up to yeah and definitely on

638
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,280
podcasters. I'm so no, I think no, I think these kids should be watching all

639
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,600
these streamers. I think grown men should be watching us and they should be

640
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:33,760
adapting their lives to try and be like us more. I do think that our number,

641
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,000
we're about to experience a huge, a huge drop in numbers. Why is that? Because

642
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,000
Ian and Anthony bought Smosh. Oh yeah, that's going to affect us. I think a lot

643
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,120
of people are going to take their money out of this and put it into whatever

644
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,760
Absolutely. No. And Ian, if you're, Ian and Anthony, if you're watching, if you need a

645
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,760
third guy.

646
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
No.

647
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,320
If you need a third guy.

648
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,440
No, no, no, no, no.

649
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,200
Maybe could go like, maybe could be like your little like, like punching bag or like maybe

650
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,400
like a, like maybe you could put him in, maybe he's, maybe I'd be an apple or like a donut

651
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,040
or maybe I could be the food in food battle.

652
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,160
Why are you obsessed with this food being human food? This is all you care about now.

653
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,960
you could base me like a big turkey, put me in the oven, put me an apple in my

654
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,600
you want them to cook you know you could in and slow rose me put me in a in an

655
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,180
answer. Trager first of all surrender, surrender. This is directly addressing

656
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:33,720
Ian and Anthony Anthony stop wearing short shirts, yep, where a long or

657
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:37,960
large sleeves and wear gloves, where cover up those damn tattoos, Anthony

658
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,840
those damn tattoos, you're never going to get a job. You look crazy. Okay, we

659
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:50,640
don't know why you had to rejoin. I am bringing you to a Dominican barbershop

660
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,780
called the Sopranos, and we're getting you a haircut for real for real. I'm

661
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,280
getting you fitted for a tux, because you need to stop dressing like a baby.

662
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,400
Nice guy, though. Yeah, amazing guy. He's the creator of Smosh. He is an amazing

663
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,480
guy. He's going to create me into a big pork roast. But if you guys need a guy

664
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:11,360
who can come in and maybe be like, instant, I would say like instant sixth

665
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,520
six man off the bench production six man. How many guys are in Smosh? I think

666
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,160
a lot of guys. Yeah, no, no, no, there's a whole thing. I have like a whole

667
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,840
bunch of groups. It's a Smosh fan.

668
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,400
The apple in the video only

669
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,200
focused on Ian and Anthony and the also they were going to have with my just now

670
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,000
real. It just made me realize that you said you wanted to be a turkey with an

671
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:34,880
apple in your mouth. Yes, they put apple in a turkey. They're going to cook me

672
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,720
Sish one style. How small is this apple and how big is this turkey's fucking

673
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:43,600
mouth. One of them has to be bigger, small. What's going on? Why do they put

674
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:47,520
the apple in the pig's mouth? It's not making any flavor. It's last moment.

675
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,480
You can't tell me that you don't, that you look at that pig and you don't

676
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,660
think that looks incredible with the apple in its mouth. The apple levels. I

677
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:57,860
bet the apple with the apple a hundred percent level. I think I know what now

678
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:01,460
that I'm thinking about it, that apple tastes probably well. The apple doesn't

679
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,120
have any of the seasoning on it. I'm just talking about looking at the apple

680
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:08,020
looks awesome. If anything, if anything, that apple is going to taste like a

681
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,600
pig's mouth. You don't have to eat the apple necessarily. Here's why. The pig's

682
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,640
mouth probably tastes good if it's cooked. Here's why they do it. I know

683
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,980
exactly why they do it. I just figured this out. Why? The last thing that I

684
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,560
want to see when I'm about to eat something is its teeth. Or its tongue. Or

685
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,320
its disgusting tongue. Yeah, looking at me like Xs in the eyes, I don't want

686
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:30,320
that at all. Plug that shit up. An apple, I like apples. I would love to see an

687
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,440
apple. When I'm eating something, I usually prefer to see an apple. You know

688
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:39,580
I do suffer from oral allergy syndrome and the only way I can eat an apple is if it's

689
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:45,880
cooked. It's a big problem for me is that every time I want to eat an apple I do have

690
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:49,220
to go to a luau. You have to get it out of a pig's mouth. I have to get it from a cooked

691
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:56,220
pig's mouth. Do you guys know Napoleon was exiled to an island? Elba. No. He spent the

692
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,220
He spent the last 20 years of his life just sitting in a...

693
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,220
What are you doing?

694
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,220
He's wiping.

695
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,220
You don't need to wipe right now.

696
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,220
We're going to get spots and stuff all over the table.

697
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
I told you there's no sugar.

698
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:08,220
First of all, where the hell are our coasters?

699
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,220
Why don't we have coasters?

700
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,220
My coasters are right here. Cameron and Patrick.

701
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,220
That's pretty good.

702
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,220
What does that mean?

703
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,220
My coasters.

704
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,220
Co-hosters.

705
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Oh, co-stars.

706
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
Yeah.

707
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,220
He said co-hosters. That's not what it was.

708
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
Co-hosters.

709
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,220
Yeah, Napoleon spent the last... He was owning for quite some time.

710
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,020
quite some time and he spent the last that's a great way to go out. I heard

711
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,500
that they sent him to

712
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,940
Idaho.

713
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:33,540
I think that he was probably on the island the whole time though and I think

714
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:38,800
he was probably just like fuck. They sent Napoleon to Idaho and then he did a

715
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,740
dance in front of his whole school and won Pedro the election is what I heard

716
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:47,740
through his shirt and dancing.

717
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:50,620
His shirt said vote for Pedro.

718
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:58,340
What I mean, what do you want me to what do you want me to say that I don't know

719
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:01,840
maybe you could talk more about the movie that I'm referencing. Yeah, and

720
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:07,140
his uncle played had a football. Yeah, there you are now you're getting it and

721
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,140
wait, wait, wait and his brother tried to do time or went. No, it didn't try to

722
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:17,640
do time travel. His brother had a girlfriend. Yeah, and what was her name?

723
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:24,240
Clifford. No, it wasn't. It was I don't know. It starts with an L. Come on. You

724
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:24,740
got this

725
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:33,040
fonda La Fonda. Her name was La Fonda and that's right. His grandma or aunt or

726
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,540
whoever that is. That's their aunt. She do you think that you could do something

727
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:40,940
bad enough in today's world that you get fully exiled to an island? I think you

728
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,640
just can you don't just go. Yeah, you don't either get killed or get sent to

729
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,340
jail that you what do you think you could do where now that you need to go

730
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,700
to an island. Now the people who are doing the bad stuff, now the people

731
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,000
that are doing the stuff that could get them exiled, actually like to have

732
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,260
their own little private islands where they can go do that shit. Wait,

733
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:00,740
holy fuck. Now the island is a prize. What they need to do,

734
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:03,540
they need to take... You have to live with a thousand other people.

735
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,080
Yeah, you gotta put these guys in a tiny home in the middle

736
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,280
of

737
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:10,820
Madison Square Park. You have to live in a brownstone with eight other people.

738
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:13,820
You have to have brothers and sisters. A co-op. You have to have...

739
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:17,980
sorry, cheaper by the dozen style. We're giving you we're making your parents

740
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,460
have sex. I'm a bunch of brothers and sisters.

741
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,180
You're watching the sex happen.

742
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:26,460
101, a bunch of little brothers and sisters and you have to, you have to

743
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,260
co parent also until they get older and then they do not respect you because

744
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:34,340
they're latchkey kids. Yeah, that's right. Your mom and dad work double

745
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,300
shifts at TGI Fridays. Dad's the manager, mom is a waitress and they met

746
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:45,480
while your dad had his other family. So your dad cheated on his wife with your

747
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:51,600
mom, then that split happened. His whole family is like wrecked. Now he has to

748
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:55,140
come live with this like lady. He knocked up and guess what he knocked her

749
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:58,940
up with octuplets and those are your brothers that you got to watch

750
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:01,420
you're cheating on your wife.

751
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:10,760
I have some bad news and I have some

752
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,900
try to keep it as a secret family and yeah, just like Holy like where's

753
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,280
ninety five percent of our

754
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:23,880
I don't know. Oh my God, you know what it is. I didn't use tap to pay at the

755
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:27,720
gas. Oh my God, somebody scammed my somebody to my credit card info yeah.

756
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:32,060
This is bullshit. Oh my God. I accidentally ordered eight of these little baby.

757
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:35,900
Well, I guess I'll just go. Somebody's hacked into our goddamn Amazon.

758
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:40,620
What the hell? Why do I have one of these buttons that keeps ordering diapers?

759
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:41,740
One of these Amazon buttons.

760
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:48,700
Too late to cancel it now. Yeah, honey.

761
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:51,700
I fell on the five tripped over my own shoelaces again.

762
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,580
I hit the fucking button eight times.

763
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,300
And yeah, I put the wrong address in so you won't even see it.

764
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,860
I got to go pick these up. No, because I don't know, because then you know what

765
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:02,580
like someone's just going to steal them anyway. I might as well just resell

766
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,860
them. Maybe I'll handle this. I'll resell them on the Facebook marketplace.

767
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,260
You imagine

768
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:12,940
I got this. You imagine how much of a nightmare it would be to if you had

769
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:16,820
octuplets and you lived in a I mean a bit. I guess I can't think of any town

770
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:21,060
that has eight different classes in a grade. I can think about this like

771
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:26,320
a big a big, but if you're a relatively small town where maybe there's three

772
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,280
classes of each grade, you just put them in different grades. You put the baby

773
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,920
in in fucking fifth grade to start. Yeah, and then it goes down. Yeah,

774
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,360
then it snaps back around. Yeah, so they're gonna be once they're mature

775
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,500
enough to be. Do you remember the case of the, it was called the Benjamin

776
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:45,120
family? No, the Turpin family, the case of the Turpin family, the case of

777
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:50,920
the Turpin family. Pray tell the Turpin family. They like it was this family

778
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:57,040
of like, I think it was like eight and they were all like, the parents would like lock

779
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,320
them up, like chain them to their beds and shit. So like a really, really sad story with

780
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,760
the, like they all had the same like bowl cut and there's like a bunch of photos of

781
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:11,240
them. Their parents would get remarried every year in Vegas. It's better with a loss, like

782
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,800
an Elvis impersonator. It's entirely sad. Well, the daughter like escaped. I know the story.

783
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,640
And now she's like a TikTok celeb.

784
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,960
And now she's a villain because of her backstory.

785
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,120
No, no, I know that it's like a police body camera footage and she's like...

786
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,120
What is medication?

787
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,080
Yeah, she's like, "I just escaped.

788
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,800
All of my brothers and sisters are tied up at my parents' house.

789
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,460
And if I was this cop, I'm going to be real.

790
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,880
I would have ignored it."

791
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,400
Kids make up shit all the time, dude.

792
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,560
You can't trust some kid.

793
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:50,360
It's just very like it's crazy that she's now like a like a tick tock influencer immediately

794
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:54,960
like she's doing like the like the dances with the it's like doing like sprite sponsorships

795
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,440
and shit right. You'd rather her be in the factory. That's good. She was still in the

796
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:04,680
bed. Yeah. That's good for her that she's got like you know leaves a fucking house and

797
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,160
now she gets all this free sprite all the time. I don't think that's going to make up

798
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,760
for what happened. You don't think so? You don't think a lifetime supply of sprite? It's

799
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:12,920
better than no free. I

800
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:19,160
is that not insulting if somebody's been if somebody's been a start some

801
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,300
if somebody's been abused for twenty years and had all their teeth taken out

802
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:26,780
like a prisoner of war. Yeah, if a prisoner of war comes back and you're

803
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:30,720
a can of president of one male, one can is great. Do you make a public

804
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,600
statement where you're like this prisoner of war is going to get I mean

805
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,020
a life of Chile? The truth is that you're just asking to get completely

806
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:42,580
unlogged. If you're like Sprite or Hormel or something and you do that and

807
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:45,920
then like you know and actually somebody's another company's like

808
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,580
actually we're going to give her a house in a car. Yeah, she can work here

809
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:52,820
as they have an email job. Yeah, what the fuck so yeah, it's got to start.

810
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,580
So I mean why don't you give them we're going to give her a big Sprite decal

811
00:46:56,580 --> 00:47:00,820
that she can put in front of her new free house and get paid for that.

812
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:04,460
Yeah, living in this. Oh my God, she can live in a billboard. I've been

813
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:08,380
thinking about wrapping my car with some kind of like it would be so swag.

814
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:12,260
you get paid like 200 bucks a month. Really? Yeah. Whoa, that's sick. To wrap

815
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:14,140
the car, you can like pay for your car payment. You should ask just like a

816
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:17,280
small business around here, like one of these barber shops or something. I

817
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,540
would do that. One of these like old Polish guy barber shops. Wrapping your

818
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:22,700
car, it literally doesn't matter... Who gives a fuck? What the picture is,

819
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:26,260
just the fact that it is wrapped is cool. Yeah. It could be anything. Get

820
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:31,100
a big vinyl wrap around it that says subway or something. Yeah. Yeah. But it

821
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:34,580
could be anything. Oh, and then you paint the side, you make your whole

822
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:37,780
car look like the subway wrapping paper. But it could look like anything,

823
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,980
is what I'm saying. I would I would saying this is what I would do to get free subway.

824
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:45,180
Yeah, maybe even the police department would pay me to drive a cop car to advertise them.

825
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:49,580
Oh, that's actually a good idea. What it like a vinyl wrap that just says not a cop just

826
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:55,420
love him. No, it says police and oh, I'm a full cop. It's just a police car. It's just

827
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:59,460
a police car. It's a police car. I was driving around. I was thinking it's like his car that

828
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:04,940
says oh, yeah, his car specifically with that fucking hood. That's broken. It's not broken.

829
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:09,220
the latch doesn't work. It is held together with zip ties. It's because I'm pretty inventive

830
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:18,420
and zip ties are actually stronger than anything. You have the jalopy. Chill. Watch it, bro.

831
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:25,400
Chill the fuck out, bro. That is not cool. You can't say that to somebody. My car does

832
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:30,920
not go chugga-chugga-chugga and bounce up and down and blow black smoke out of the back.

833
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:39,120
That is not what my car is. It is a 2009 Ford Focus, which actually they resell for, if

834
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,320
it's under 100,000 miles, $2,800.

835
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
Really?

836
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,900
Yeah. If I fixed it up.

837
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,900
You know what? That is --

838
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,320
I'm sitting on three bands.

839
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,320
I think that is the exact price of two jalopies.

840
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:53,800
Mine's red, though. I have a red one.

841
00:48:53,800 --> 00:48:57,120
Red cars are faster. Red cars are police targets.

842
00:48:57,120 --> 00:49:00,280
Yeah, I think red car -- I think I'm a target for everything. I think having a red car has

843
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:03,520
maybe a massive, it's put a giant target on the back. You know what the reason is? It's

844
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:08,480
because the Wiggles made that fucking song. The Wiggles ruined a lot of stuff. The Wiggles

845
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:14,120
made that song about big red cars and now everyone's like, okay, this has to be the

846
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:19,000
fucking Wiggles car. I have to break into it. No. That's exactly what happened. I don't

847
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,320
even know what Wiggles song you're talking about. The Wiggles song, the big red car.

848
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:27,720
This is late period Wiggles must be. This is not late period Wiggles. This is from when

849
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:33,080
their first tapes. Oh yeah, so you're going in the deep cuts. I'm going hip-hop.

850
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:37,120
Yeah, no, it's a it's a rock and roll song. No, they used to be hip-hop. No,

851
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:41,560
it's a rock and roll song. It's like kid rock. Fruit salad is a hip-hop song. I

852
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:46,360
will say I will concede to that. That's some crack.com shit. Yep. I like that

853
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,840
fruit salad. When we sing that, can we pull up fruit salad karaoke? Do you

854
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:55,360
think we could start a Wiggles type thing? We I think because I mean, we

855
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:59,560
we could maybe do it. We could maybe do that, but I think it would end up like

856
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:03,460
being too famous. We'd end up being too famous and it would be like a blippy

857
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:08,220
style thing where like they show like old, you don't remember. We've never

858
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:13,120
done anything bad. They show all of our old clips. What clips could piss off a

859
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,520
parent? Him wearing the thing that says "I heart eating shit", a parent could

860
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,480
see that and they're like, "This is the guy that's singing to my kid about the

861
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:22,160
train." No, they wouldn't recognize him because they'd be like, "Oh, the guy

862
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,600
who sings to my kid about the train doesn't have a tattoo on his forehead."

863
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:32,600
That's true. That's a good point. But Blippi, he did a Harlem Shake video where he ate poop on Harlem Shake.

864
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
He diarrhea's all over his friend.

865
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
What are you? Who the fuck is Blippi?

866
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:40,600
Blippi was my nephew's favorite musician for years.

867
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,600
That's what he's known for? Yeah.

868
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,600
Well he's a kids like YouTube guy, but I only know him because of that pooping.

869
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:47,600
And he shit himself?

870
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:54,040
show. No, he's on to his friends. He's standing on a chair and he is

871
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:58,960
projectile diarrhea in into the other corner of the room and his friend is

872
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:03,360
sitting there like this like and it's a it's fake diarrhea. No, it's real. It's

873
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:09,120
real. He's a sweetest guy. He was trying to be jackass. Yeah. Oh, that's

874
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:12,600
nasty. Yeah, it's not. But he's saying that's what's gonna happen to us if

875
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:15,840
we're wiggles. But I'm saying what have we done that could be beyond that level

876
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:20,000
even possible. Yeah, show on camera. Who is the we've ever diarrhea on each

877
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:24,600
other? Who? I don't think so. Who are the other the jackass from Sweden dude

878
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:28,480
since God? Hey, I don't even want to think about that. Yeah, they did jump

879
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,840
or whatever dude. Those people were see what's his name. The big fat guy drew a

880
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,000
target on his belly and they threw darts at him. One of them broke like every

881
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:42,160
bone in his body and some never prank again. Really? Yeah, he had to retire

882
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,440
from prank. Their names were like Jaka and Joppa or something. They had the

883
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:50,080
most fucked up names ever and they just did not care if they lived or died on another level.

884
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:54,320
I think they cared if they lived. I think they wanted to survive every single one of them.

885
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:54,880
They didn't care.

886
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:57,040
So that they could go to the Swedish bars.

887
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,400
They did two spin-offs. They did the Dudesons and then they did Nitro Circus and those were the two,

888
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,160
no Nitro Circus was all of the boring parts of Jackass.

889
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,880
Nitro Circus was like Travis Pastrana.

890
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,600
Yeah and he was like, "Look I can jump something on my bike."

891
00:52:09,600 --> 00:52:14,240
Shut up. That's what you're supposed to do. You're a BMX guy.

892
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,340
Nitro Circus, whose thing is that he's in a green wheelchair.

893
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:23,440
What if they made bike people ride a board and board people

894
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,140
ride a bike?

895
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,040
Whoa, that's a good idea for a new show.

896
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:28,640
Switchers.

897
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:29,440
Switchers.

898
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
We could call it switchers.

899
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:31,840
That's a crazy idea.

900
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,940
Every episode, it can't just be bike and boards.

901
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:35,040
Every episode, two things.

902
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:36,940
Two people, chefs and CEOs.

903
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,940
Oh my God.

904
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:39,140
Yep.

905
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:39,240
Yep.

906
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,440
Yep.

907
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:39,640
Yep.

908
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,940
Chefs and prisoners.

909
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:42,140
No.

910
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:42,640
That would...

911
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:46,560
I'm thinking a lot of chef stuff. Maybe I got to switch it up anything.

912
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,080
Channing

913
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:52,000
and Wall Street bankers. He'd be they'd be like, Hey, we need to shred all

914
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:55,260
these documents that are the Panama paper. Oh yeah, then the guy he's doing

915
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:55,760
like nice

916
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:01,240
on the paper right. So then the CEO in the show, which are sweat. Welcome back

917
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:05,160
to switcher to Kobe. Shannix from Papa Roach and you're watching

918
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,480
good on switchers. He was the host discard and I think that's what he was

919
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:16,320
meant to do was host shows like this and then the chef or the CEO and the chef

920
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,280
thing, he would be like,

921
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:27,480
I mean, you know, probably what does a CEO do? CEO probably would be firing the

922
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:28,360
food. Yep,

923
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:33,880
he'd be putting it under the grill. Yeah, he'd be interviewing the food. Yeah,

924
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,800
yep. I had another TV show idea this morning. What was it? I was watching

925
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:42,880
catfish on the treadmill and I was thinking that I would like to do you

926
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,920
know how they people like email them to be like I think I'm being catfished.

927
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,760
Will you come and put me on the TV show? I would do I want to intercept those

928
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:54,640
emails and I want to go with my own crew and I go to the people who are being

929
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:58,400
catfish and I organize the meet up or whatever and we get there and then

930
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,440
they're about to meet them and then I say actually I just catfished you. I'm

931
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,880
not from catfish and I'm not even filming this and then I leave. You could

932
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:10,320
call it a different that's a great idea. That's an amazing idea, and then

933
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:13,380
another everybody's walking around doing a rocket power thing with their with

934
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:15,160
their hands as your film crew,

935
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,280
just making people meet. This is a new type of camera. Yeah, there's actually

936
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,260
such an amazing next level camera that it's invisible. I'm a transhumanist in

937
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:23,360
the

938
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:27,720
four different lenses in my fingertips. Yeah,

939
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,680
invented this. Yeah, so and now I'm zooming in. Yeah, you get right on.

940
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,400
I think there's a good idea. I think it's a yeah, you can fish the catfish.

941
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,880
Yeah, swordfish. I was also that's what I call it. Has there ever been a

942
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:44,320
catfish episode where both people think they're being catfished and then it's

943
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:47,600
beautiful because neither they both are so and the other person is so

944
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,480
incredible. That would be amazing. I feel like that has if that hasn't

945
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:53,120
happened yet. I feel like the that's the producers like white whale. They're

946
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:57,280
waiting for those. Yeah, cross reference every email. When did we we all watch

947
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,640
catfish together? Yeah, and it was the one it was it wasn't recently. I think

948
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,360
it was on tour. It was and it was it was that one episode where the lady

949
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,900
me. It was two people and they were in a relationship, but they called the

950
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:14,040
catfish people because they just wanted to be on TV yeah. That's right. Oh yeah,

951
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,120
catfish is such an evil show. It's I feel so bad for the I will get catfish

952
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,960
because they always the person comes out and they're like yeah. I did it

953
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,380
because I feel ugly and I hate myself and the person has to be like

954
00:55:24,380 --> 00:55:26,700
yeah, you are like

955
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:33,700
I just on TV, though yeah and just seem like the bad guy yeah, it's so

956
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:39,640
horrible. You know it's a worst show I've been watching is Steve Wilkos.

957
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,800
What's that? I don't know what that is. It's the security guard from Jerry

958
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:48,080
Springer. Okay, his wife was like a producer and

959
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,820
they gave him a show where it's just like it's like Jerry Spring. It's like

960
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,640
if Jerry Springer was

961
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:59,600
on steroids, not like in the not like yeah, it's like Jerry Springer on

962
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:03,680
steroids. No, it's like an actual guy who is on steroids. He's a huge

963
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:11,040
act guy and like half the cases on that show were like, Conor was telling me about this

964
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:21,440
one where it's like the dude is like doing a polygraph for, doing a polygraph because

965
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,440
somebody accused him of molesting a kid.

966
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,440
Okay.

967
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:26,440
And.

968
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:27,440
Was it a kid?

969
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,440
No, no, no.

970
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:32,700
It was like a dad, like a dad who's like trying to get like this guy, like he hates his father-in-law.

971
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:34,740
so he's like saying that okay and

972
00:56:34,740 --> 00:56:40,260
he told me that the like the polygraph comes back negative. Like he's like you

973
00:56:40,260 --> 00:56:45,580
like are not a pedophile. Thank God and you know I just want to say sorry man.

974
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:50,500
I said a lot of things to you earlier because I thought maybe you were a

975
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,140
pedophile,

976
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:55,940
but let's be honest. You just kind of look the type and the guy goes the guy

977
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:57,540
goes yeah. I know I get

978
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,740
you're watching some show where it was like lot like the family members have to

979
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,980
guess if the people are lying or not. Oh, remember the show and there was one

980
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:10,120
that was like the last thing was like did you molest your daughter or

981
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:10,940
something? Yes,

982
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:14,660
that was the one it was one on Fox. It was called like it was our

983
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:18,740
something of truth. It was like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's starting to be

984
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:22,380
like his favorite dinner is fish, yeah, be like I think it is and be like

985
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:27,860
and then we get to the final one. That one you molest your that one was there

986
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:31,040
is the one there was to we watch two of them. One of them was that guy and then

987
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,840
the other one was the girl who the host of the show comes out of the beginning,

988
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:39,760
and he says in all of my years of hosting television, I've never said that

989
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:43,560
I don't want to air an episode until this episode. I said we shouldn't do

990
00:57:43,560 --> 00:57:47,640
this. The producers are making me do this without further ado. Here is the

991
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:51,480
worst episode of television ever and they do this show where you're hooked up

992
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:54,520
to a lie detector test and then they I think it's called to tell the truth.

993
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:58,500
is it yeah you have to answer every time you answer. You choose to answer or not

994
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:01,500
answer yeah. If you answer truthfully, you like earn more you earn more money.

995
00:58:01,500 --> 00:58:04,340
If you just if you decide not to answer, you take the money that your whole

996
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:08,980
family is yeah, your entire everybody that you are lying everybody that you've

997
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:13,580
ever lied to is in a crowd of like a bunch of tourists who are like yeah. Oh,

998
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,500
I'm ready to go on to a TV show. I forgot about this is the crazy show of

999
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:22,780
all time. This girl says within like like twenty five minutes, she says her

1000
00:58:22,820 --> 00:58:26,320
my husband's right there. She says I cheated on my husband. I wish that I was

1001
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,020
with my old boyfriend and not my husband. Then they bring out the old

1002
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:33,260
boyfriend. I forgot about this. Do you still have feelings for him and she

1003
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:38,680
says yes, and then she says she doesn't like her mom, her dad. She knows that

1004
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:43,540
her dad embezzled money. It's like it ruins this person's life and then on the

1005
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:48,900
lat the last the last fucking question is something so basic it's like it's

1006
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:53,480
like yeah, it's like I have you ever thought that maybe you'd experiment

1007
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:56,880
with girls, it's like something like that. Are you a total fucking lesbo and

1008
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,940
she goes like or no no it oh no. I know what it is. It was. Do you think you're

1009
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,840
a good person? Yeah, it's the last question. I forgot. She says fucking God,

1010
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:08,560
she says yes, and then she loses a million dollars.

1011
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:14,180
She fucked up her. It is the worst episode of TV. I ever see that was so

1012
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:17,860
fucking crazy. I can't believe that they let that go. I mean it's amazing.

1013
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:20,460
It's really unreal, but it is so hard to watch.

1014
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,940
It does need to be out there, but for that person, no, it doesn't.

1015
00:59:23,940 --> 00:59:26,940
I mean, her life is fully on.

1016
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:27,540
Yeah.

1017
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:29,260
Like, you can never come back.

1018
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:31,940
Honestly, I want to see the 10 years later.

1019
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:32,460
Yeah.

1020
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,980
They need to do an update on this girl.

1021
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:34,380
Yeah.

1022
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,100
She's definitely a nurse.

1023
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:35,660
They might have.

1024
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:36,660
They did the same thing.

1025
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:39,500
What's that fucking, it was called like the Average Joe Show.

1026
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,860
And it was just like they, everyone around the guy is an actor.

1027
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:46,620
And jury duty.

1028
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:54,860
No on free, it's on free, it's proto jury, ed monica, no jury duty. It is

1029
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,760
not jury. You can watch it with free with ads. It was called it's the same

1030
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,180
thing. It's the same thing who's a christian wig is in it.

1031
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:06,620
They didn't know who christian wig was. This was like back in the day. Is it

1032
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:11,580
the joe schmo show? Yeah, what do they do with joe the first season?

1033
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:16,380
Yeah, I forget what they do. They just like make him do like I think he thinks

1034
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:22,240
he's on a reality show and everyone else. He thinks he's on a reality show.

1035
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:27,500
Everyone else around him knows that he's not or that he's not in on the joke,

1036
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,040
and it was like Spike TV's like first like

1037
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:36,360
thing. We need a reality show. So they brought it back. They brought it back on

1038
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,360
TBS and Kat Daly is the host. Do you guys want to do like a keeping up with

1039
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,880
the Kardashian style reality show about our lives as podcasters? I want to do a

1040
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:47,520
the show. So this is an amazing idea. Has anyone done this? I mean you'd see my

1041
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,080
episode, like every but not everything that would go like all the cameras would

1042
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:55,360
go to me and it'd be me hanging out at a skate park or like drinking exactly in

1043
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,600
my house. It would be but also we I mean we're going to have a producer. You

1044
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:00,520
think we're doing drip drama into this?

1045
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:05,320
Yeah, you know, I hang it would all be hanging. At least I'd be at least I'd be

1046
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,640
like at a skate park and I could make like drama happen like it'd be like yo

1047
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:10,000
that guy's talking shit about

1048
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,760
we have to do this is an incredible a a a

1049
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,860
and then you go to your house. What would we call it? Go to your house and

1050
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:21,160
you're eating like keeping up with stone ground crackers, whatever Caleb and

1051
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,800
stone ground crackers. You know the stone wheat crackers. You think I eat

1052
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,120
stone wheat crackers at my house? This is what I do. Well, here's the first

1053
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:31,920
drama. The fuck. Oh my God. Imagine I say that. Imagine. Okay, I wish we had

1054
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:36,640
and I say that no, but I met the the sting the sting from kitchen nightmares.

1055
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,240
You know the one that

1056
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,380
Oh yeah, imagine I'm like yeah and Cameron's eating all these fucking

1057
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:45,180
stone around. We do need I do talking. I have been getting a really he thinks

1058
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:50,560
I'm so boring. I stone ground crackers. I've been having a super high incidence

1059
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,280
of second hand smoke of real housewives. Yeah, I'm getting so much second hand

1060
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,600
real housewives and I'm so ready to fucking do this. I think that you would

1061
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,700
real podcasters of

1062
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,900
perfect. I need a better name. That name is terrible.

1063
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,540
That is such a bad name. What about

1064
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:15,320
for

1065
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:18,340
podcasters off the air?

1066
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:23,620
This we can we do a full season of this? Yeah,

1067
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:28,560
twenty four yeah, we get a camera and then we do the thing that real house

1068
01:02:28,560 --> 01:02:31,820
wives does where, like the next season, it's like two of us and then one other

1069
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,160
random guy. Yeah, that's like a new one. Yeah, yeah, because they like the one

1070
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:39,440
person got like kicked off. One person went to jail. Yeah, they always go to

1071
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,920
jail or commit suicide. We could get what's that show that everyone is for

1072
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,120
all of our Vanderpump rules. Yeah, well, that's the thing we need, but it needs

1073
01:02:47,120 --> 01:02:50,440
to be. It can be the same. It should be patterned off of Vanderpump rules

1074
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:54,440
because we have a business that we share. Yeah, and so it's about oh my

1075
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,680
God, they'd be stressing me on my computer playing skate. Yeah, exactly

1076
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,720
session. Have you guys ever watched that show selling sunset? Yes, that show is

1077
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:05,740
crazy. Yeah, that is a crazy. The craziest part of that show is that

1078
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,940
they every single shot is so overexposed that it like lights up the

1079
01:03:09,940 --> 01:03:15,380
room. Yeah, it's like so white. It's a real estate reality show.

1080
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:18,380
They have like a real estate company and there's these evil twins.

1081
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:24,340
There is evil bald twins. Yeah, that's sick. Yeah, it's about them selling

1082
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:27,740
giant mansions. Oh my God, we need a reality show. But this would just be

1083
01:03:27,740 --> 01:03:31,540
us arguing about us running the podcast. Yeah. You know what? This is so

1084
01:03:31,540 --> 01:03:36,420
good. Yeah, you know it's another sick reality show is the I think I've talked

1085
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:41,180
about it before, but Kiss had a reality show because they wanted to bring back

1086
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:47,260
arena football and they made a team called the L. A. Kiss and it was just

1087
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:52,320
like Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. It's like half the show is them in business

1088
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:56,980
and marketing meetings where they're like, I mean, this logo just looks great.

1089
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:59,740
This is just one of the greatest things I've ever seen. Then the other half of

1090
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:03,540
of the show is like men who are like on the verge of like killing their whole

1091
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,820
family from CTE being like, "I don't know if I'm gonna be able to play another

1092
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,700
game." How do we round out the cast? 'Cause it's us three,

1093
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:10,420
Jubio,

1094
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:15,340
can do confessionals. Joe and Alex are like the people who are working kind of

1095
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:16,300
near us, but yeah,

1096
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:21,340
the once an episode kind of talking head where they say like, "Sometimes."

1097
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:24,700
We'll be staying in it a little bit. It's like the thing on the reality

1098
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,900
shows. Call him on the phone. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Speaker phone

1099
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:32,180
and he's telling us that we need to get the trash picked up and then it's

1100
01:04:32,180 --> 01:04:35,820
talking heads of all of us talking about the trash. Yeah, yeah, the thing trash

1101
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:39,140
would be a full episode. The trash would be easily a full at least two episodes.

1102
01:04:39,140 --> 01:04:42,580
It would be the runaway. It's gotta be pierced right. He'd be like the runaway

1103
01:04:42,580 --> 01:04:46,660
star where it's like you know the show starts out where like the like this

1104
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,180
main cast spin off and then he gets his own like he's like yeah. I think it

1105
01:04:50,180 --> 01:04:54,700
would be jubio. He's like the I love New York. Yeah, jubio would be like I love

1106
01:04:54,700 --> 01:05:00,580
York. Oh my God, wait. We're looking at this all wrong. We're looking at this all wrong.

1107
01:05:00,580 --> 01:05:07,540
We got to get like a bunch of people, right? It's kind of like Rock of Love, Flavor of

1108
01:05:07,540 --> 01:05:14,100
Love style show where we're trying to hire an intern.

1109
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:15,100
That's maybe one episode.

1110
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:17,220
No, no, that's a whole series.

1111
01:05:17,220 --> 01:05:20,980
You're saying that we do The Bachelor with a house full of people.

1112
01:05:20,980 --> 01:05:25,820
It's more, it's like The Bachelor and The Apprentice combined.

1113
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:31,060
And it's all guys who wear funny graphic t-shirts.

1114
01:05:31,060 --> 01:05:34,580
But they could be on our bigger idea that encompasses that idea.

1115
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:40,060
Okay, maybe one of the episodes is us writing that show and then it becomes the spin-off

1116
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:41,060
show.

1117
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,820
We could write the show in the episodes and it could be meta like Charlie Kaufman.

1118
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,900
I don't like that guy's bullshit.

1119
01:05:46,900 --> 01:05:48,820
Charlie Kaufman, I'm done with you man.

1120
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:52,460
yeah here's a here's a here's a get a Charlie. Come and be writing dialogue

1121
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:58,020
like I am myself yeah, I am myself or am I I am myself or am I you so I'm

1122
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:01,840
trapped in my own head shot is myself yourself. I think he did his best work on

1123
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:04,140
the Dana Carvey show. Yep, he actually did

1124
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:10,220
and spew e spewing me was that what are you taking a seat of medicine. My tooth

1125
01:06:10,220 --> 01:06:10,540
hurts

1126
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:14,740
can't wait to keep this on you. Yeah,

1127
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:19,140
it's in my bag. You guys didn't even go through my bag. Oh yeah. What else do

1128
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:20,940
you have in here? Sorry, okay,

1129
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:24,860
we're making this show by the way. I really want to. I'm not kidding. I

1130
01:06:24,860 --> 01:06:29,140
volunteer to edit it. If we get together, we film it. I need two camera

1131
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:33,340
guys. We already have cameras. Yeah, we'll get to it. So we'll do

1132
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:37,180
that was kind of cool. He has a tech deck. Yeah, yeah.

1133
01:06:37,180 --> 01:06:41,540
And then this is a this is gonna happen. I feel like I need one more one

1134
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:43,340
more thing to get excited about this show.

1135
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:49,820
deodorant. Yes, we can. Well, you know what? Actually, what we have to do, we

1136
01:06:49,820 --> 01:06:53,580
have to have some kind of big event that the show culminates on. Like the season

1137
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:57,980
finale is always like somebody's wedding or somebody's opening a restaurant or

1138
01:06:57,980 --> 01:07:01,700
like, "Oh my God, somebody's doing a fashion runway." We need our sir.

1139
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:07,660
What? You know too much reality TV shows. The Vanderpump thing. SUR Super

1140
01:07:07,660 --> 01:07:11,300
Unique Restaurant? Don't know. I've never watched Vanderpump. We need to

1141
01:07:11,300 --> 01:07:13,500
start a restaurant. No, I've heard... That show, I've heard... We'll actually

1142
01:07:13,500 --> 01:07:17,500
do sexy unique restaurant is, I think the name. What about a

1143
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:22,340
what about a carnival with rides? That's too expensive and I would love

1144
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:24,760
to do that, but I don't think we can afford that. Okay, well,

1145
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,420
what if we just are throwing a party?

1146
01:07:26,420 --> 01:07:30,780
That's great. Yeah, the best party ever. Yeah, the office warming party.

1147
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,520
The whole series is about the big party that we know that's the season for

1148
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,780
that's what it's building up to. It's always it's yeah, yeah, it's but the

1149
01:07:37,780 --> 01:07:40,780
whole series isn't about it. It's our daily lives and then it's like that's

1150
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:44,900
we're planning it as we go up, but that's like during the party. We're like I

1151
01:07:44,900 --> 01:07:49,040
just can't believe it's been such an amazing long road. Like I didn't realize

1152
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:52,360
really how season two. Yeah, yeah, we could say that and then it doesn't get

1153
01:07:52,360 --> 01:07:55,940
picked up. Yeah, this will get picked up. It will get picked up. This will get

1154
01:07:55,940 --> 01:08:00,320
making one season for us and the rest are going on one for us, one for them

1155
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:02,860
exactly. One of them. So this is going on network television.

1156
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:07,980
Season hit us once. No, once we're going to make, we're going to make one season.

1157
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:12,020
it's going to be incredible. Then we sell the idea to chapo trap house. Yes,

1158
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:15,560
yes, and they do twelve seasons. I'm crackle

1159
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:19,020
and we get

1160
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,520
yeah,

1161
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,900
all right, so

1162
01:08:24,900 --> 01:08:29,520
little field on July, four, July, fourteen, which is you already know

1163
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,620

1164
01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:35,600
in six days from when this comes out. We made a video where everybody's on my

1165
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:37,180
head to promote it. Watch that

1166
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:42,780
Holy shit, well fire all right bye-bye.
