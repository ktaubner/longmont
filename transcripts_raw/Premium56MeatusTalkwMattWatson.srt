Yeah.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,700
What?

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,200
Nothing happened to you.

9
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,800
I turned the- wait, hold on. You'll see- wait.

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,000
You just turned the light on?

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,400
So that's what you wanted to start the audio episode.

12
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,200
That's the least cool thing you could possibly show us.

13
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,200
I thought you were gonna like play a sound or something.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,200
Nope, that was it.

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,200
You weren't doing like a new impression or...

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,200
Uh, have this brighter Patrick.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,200
Brighter Patrick?

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
That's my impression.

19
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Do you guys post, do you guys record the video for Patreon or anything?

20
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,200
No.

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,200
No, so you can get naked dude, let's go.

22
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,200
Let's see that thing.

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,200
Let's just see that thing.

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Let's see the worm.

25
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,200
I think the first dick pic I ever took was, I was like 15,

26
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,200
and I thought that the way that you should take a dick pic

27
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,200
is that you just put it right in front of your penis.

28
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,200
And so it's like looking down the hallway of my dick.

29
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,200
It's like the worst possible angle.

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
And I was like, "Yeah, she's gonna love that."

31
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,200
Like looking into the meatus?

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,200
Like looking straight on?

33
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
You're looking into where my pee and my cum comes out of.

34
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
Into the hole.

35
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
Yeah, the meatus.

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Yeah.

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,200
Like, if I was meeting your penis at a formal business meeting,

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,200
it would be like that.

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,360
- Well, I was like, yeah, if you were,

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,120
I was like, yeah, that's like what,

41
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,120
that's like how women wanna see the meatus.

42
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,720
- Yeah, that's what women like, they like the hole.

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
- They wanna look it in the eyes

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,440
and give it a firm handshake.

45
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,680
- Women hate the shaft, they love the hole.

46
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,700
- They really dislike the hole.

47
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,000
- What they really like though,

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,080
so the two things they like is they like the meatus,

49
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,160
which is the opening around the urethra,

50
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,800
and then they also like the balls.

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,000
- You're acting like we don't know the meatus.

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,840
I mean, come on.

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,360
- I don't know, man.

54
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,820
Sometimes people don't. - I don't know the meatus.

55
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
I did.

56
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
You do not know the meatus, Caleb?

57
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
It's exactly what he just said.

58
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,820
I just literally...

59
00:01:58,820 --> 00:01:59,820
Caleb, open your fucking ears.

60
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,820
I'm so sorry.

61
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:01,820
I'm so sorry.

62
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:02,820
Caleb, open your hole and look at it.

63
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,820
Yeah.

64
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Okay, let me look at my meatus.

65
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:12,780
Caleb, next time you're at your little, uh, your little doctor's office with your pediatrician,

66
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,780
take a look at your penis.

67
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,580
Take a look at your doctor's piece.

68
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,580
Can you look at my dick hole?

69
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:20,500
I think, I don't know, it's just, I feel like it doesn't look like the other kids.

70
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,080
Can you just look at it just for a minute?

71
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,300
How far into it can you see?

72
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,660
Can you just tell me? Can you drop a pebble in there and see how long it takes to make a splash?

73
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:37,500
Mine's not very round. Me and Matt both did just actually look at our dicks. I did. I'm very,

74
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,140
very flaccid and then I opened it up and I looked to see how far down I could see.

75
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,540
Yeah, my penis in this moment might be the smallest it's ever been. Yeah. Yeah. I was

76
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,500
looking at that when I looked at mine. I was like, "Pretty bad, dude." I think just when you're around

77
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,980
some bros and you and you look at your cock it's it's always gonna feel a

78
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:58,180
little bit smaller it's like well it's just further proof that I'm straight you

79
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,660
know besides my gaming PC is that I I'm hanging out with three beautiful beautiful

80
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:09,580
men and my dick is just softer than ever did yeah it's it's just just completely

81
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:15,700
it's flabby putty yeah I'm not I'm not I'm not gay but if I was I would have

82
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,980
had an erection in that moment when I pulled it out to look at it in the

83
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,120
presence of three of my friends yeah that would have turned me on that would

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,740
have it's a test Mike my penis is like closer to a liquid than it is a solid

85
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:41,340
right now yeah my penis is not Newtonian yeah I have to slam it pretty hard you

86
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,300
just sit that dump truck ass on my dick cuz that's the only way it gets hard

87
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,780
baby yeah there's otherwise it's gonna be just you have to use the punch to

88
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:54,420
shit out of my people careful because if you go too slow you're gonna go inside of

89
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:03,660
it yeah I got a couple rubber bands yeah really tighten that shit until it's

90
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:08,260
purple that was like all homeschool was when I was homeschooled growing putting

91
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,900
rubber bands around your feet no just make it just mixing my mom thought that

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:20,460
the lesson of non-newtonian fluid is something I needed to learn like 200

93
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:32,880
times. I was homeschooled yeah. Caleb we're doing oobleck again today. And the thing is I could not get enough of it.

94
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:41,840
It perplexed me every time. I'm 17 years old I've already seen oobleck. You're gonna see it again kid.

95
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:48,360
If you don't fucking if you don't punch this oobleck as hard as you fucking can you are not going to college

96
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:54,420
I'm telling you that right now. Just going through just just fucking tons of fucking cornstarch every year

97
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,420
Yeah, writing it off as a school expense

98
00:04:56,420 --> 00:05:02,760
It's like wheeling the TV in your mom doesn't have like a TV on a cart. So she's got it make oobleck

99
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,600
Yeah, but we did have a fucking TV in my house. Yeah, but you can't wheel it in and it only shows movies

100
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,160
It doesn't have no education. She wheels it in and there's just a video

101
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:20,680
of Ooblik. An instructional how to make it. What's a non-newtonian fluid? Besides

102
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:25,000
Ooblik? I don't really know. I don't know of any other. It's like a fluid but if you punch it it's hard.

103
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,480
It's like the phases of matter, it's like between phases of matter or something.

104
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:38,600
There's a skate shoe that has a non-newtonian insole. The Osirises? No, it's Footprint.

105
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,320
It's called Footprint.

106
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
I wish.

107
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,840
I wish they had the non-Newtonian insoles in the Osiris Brocks.

108
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
Wouldn't that hurt?

109
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,160
Because when you like jump, it's hard.

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
I don't know how it works.

111
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Your shoes are solid normally, Caleb.

112
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,160
I've seen videos of it.

113
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,660
No, but they usually have a little bit of cushion.

114
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,480
But they're still solid.

115
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
You know what?

116
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,480
I give up on this argument.

117
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
No, I hear what Caleb's saying.

118
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,480
I hear what Caleb's saying.

119
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,600
It's like it's soft, but then if you jump and you land hard, it's not going to be soft anymore.

120
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
That's a great standing shoe.

121
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,880
It's a terrible jumping shoe.

122
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,120
If you're playing basketball and you come down, it's gonna feel like you just jumped from like a 20 foot ledge.

123
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,320
Yeah, Cameron.

124
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:13,820
No.

125
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,180
It's two versus one here, man. We win.

126
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,680
No.

127
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
I'd have to see a video of it, but...

128
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,960
If you just... if you have to stomp everywhere you go, because if you step normally...

129
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,480
I'm angry a lot of the time!

130
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,560
Your feet just get wet.

131
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,020
It's not a shoe for angry people.

132
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,980
No, no. When I'm huffing and puffing and I'm just mad as hell, again, because my clash of clans is not going well,

133
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,940
and I'm stomping around town, I'm gonna fuck my feet up, dude.

134
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,440
Yeah.

135
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,160
You're gonna fuck your feet when you're mad?

136
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,400
You're gonna hate fuck your foot?

137
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,920
What is wrong with you?

138
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,420
Oh shit!

139
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:44,920
Oh shit!

140
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,920
Oh my god!

141
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,120
You're taking advantage of me because I don't feel well.

142
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
I have a stomachache and you're making me sick.

143
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,240
You have a stomachache?

144
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
Yeah, I think I might be pregnant.

145
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,960
Hey, does baby need his bottle?

146
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
Yeah, I think he does.

147
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,280
Okay, first of all, I think you know I'm not a baby.

148
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,280
Yeah, well...

149
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,080
Second of all, I was breastfed and I never was fed from a bottle.

150
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,920
I found this guy on Twitter the other day who's like a targeted individual type guy who thinks

151
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,320
he's being attacked by the CIA through microwaves and shit.

152
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,320
But he just has schizophrenia.

153
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,320
Yeah, yeah.

154
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,160
But he thinks that the CIA is giving him stomach aches.

155
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:29,220
And there's a bunch of tweets where he's like, "The CIA has made me constipated and the brutality

156
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,200
of their attack against my intestines makes me grumble for a long time."

157
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,520
one who's like I'm on the bus and and I'm sweating because of how much my stomach

158
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,840
hurts it's because I'm looking at my phone too much and the CIA doesn't like

159
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,200
it those are the best kinds of those guys

160
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,760
where they're like goddamn CIA's making it making the internet go in and out all

161
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,120
day yeah pick one meanwhile it's literally the shittiest fucking internet

162
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,320
exactly yeah like like the dude only eats he eats nothing but like Hungry Man

163
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:08,080
Dinners and then he's a fucking CIA making making me constipated to that guy eating like frozen chili

164
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,440
chili

165
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,340
Stomach the CIA is making my stomach hurting listen to the popsicle. This is his tweet every stool is hashtag torture

166
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:24,680
No constipation or hemorrhoids, but a disease with a fatal prognosis within minutes

167
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:27,680
I run to the bathroom the end of it right wrong

168
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,160
The torture goes on for a while to assure whatever whatever foods left moves into colon and rectum to arrest hashtag digestion

169
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:41,240
And then he's gonna look through those hashtags and find that and then he says I protect the area with hands

170
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,960
I keep a thick aluminum pad above lower abdomen

171
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:50,600
Nothing cuts it the hashtag torture goes on with unbelievable hashtag brutality until I run to the bathroom

172
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,420
Then more as times my intestines hashtag rumble long

173
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,880
He's wearing a tinfoil diaper to protect his step up tinfoil hat

174
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,060
That's um

175
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:09,340
That's why I would hate to have the combination of like extreme schizophrenia and Crohn's disease. Oh, yeah

176
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:17,380
That's like the worst horrible right there. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Here's the thing though these people like if the CIA was developing technology to give somebody

177
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:21,280
Stomach pain stomach ache

178
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,360
You know they use that on the terrorists

179
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,240
uh...

180
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,760
and they had to test it they're gonna pick some random do detested on

181
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,320
and the thing is like he could actually be

182
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,340
getting targeted by the c_i_a_ with this shit but

183
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,640
no one would believe

184
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,980
they'd like all this guy's gets a like a of course that yet the c_i_a_'s giving

185
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,840
you stomach aches but like really they actually could be in no one's gonna

186
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,120
believe in which is

187
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,000
which is absolute torture on top of the facts true yeah this the stomach aches

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,240
already happening

189
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,560
we should just use the stomach a gun on osama bin laden

190
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,780
yeah i'm trying to think of like what

191
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,860
what use a stomach a gun from the c_i_a_ could have in this imagining like it's

192
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,700
funny yelling at the same

193
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,020
i think that's the thing

194
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:04,160
the unicity at that for her to be a

195
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,520
because i don't know where they're going to see you in the middle

196
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,000
and the middle of it is going on

197
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,920
all

198
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,520
uh... all

199
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,000
or anything like a drone it like a syrian wedding just to make it a little

200
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
far

201
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,940
(laughter)

202
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,520
- Just make all the groomsmen shit their pants.

203
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,440
- That was Obama's legacy.

204
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,280
- Yeah.

205
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,120
- Obama.

206
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,400
- He's like, he's like, on my way out.

207
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,160
He's like, I want to make sure that this, this, this stays.

208
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,140
Obama stayed winning with the, with the,

209
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,480
with the drone strikes that,

210
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,640
that make the men at the Syrian wedding shit themselves.

211
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,320
- Yeah. It was, it was collateral damage for sure.

212
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,080
But they got the guy.

213
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,680
- The whole town, the whole town had stomach aches after that.

214
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:50,680
just filled with fart gas.

215
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:55,680
Well the good news is the one guy they were targeting, he did get a stomach ache as well.

216
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Yeah, exactly.

217
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,680
He was out for, you know, 30-45 minutes.

218
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,680
And in that 30-45 minutes, zero terroricity.

219
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,680
He had to lay down in his bed for a good half an hour.

220
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,680
That 30-45 minutes he did not go swimming at all. He had a cramp.

221
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,680
Yeah.

222
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,680
Well he was actually, the stomach ache made him, he wasn't able to eat dinner,

223
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,600
and then the next morning he had a headache so he couldn't fly his plane

224
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:23,480
over to the US and do that's he did in the day after but yeah I mean that's

225
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,680
unavoidable. They're just using it to fuel the ginger ale industrial complex.

226
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:35,680
Driving up ginger ale in all these countries. That's a Canadian product.

227
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,160
This guy's deeper than I even thought dude. Jesus Christ. Unless it's Schweppes I don't know I

228
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,160
I don't know who... is Schweppes... I feel like all ginger ale companies...

229
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,160
I don't think ginger ale is just a Canadian thing. Ginger ale is one of those...

230
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
No, I know it's not just a Canadian thing.

231
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,160
You don't know anything.

232
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Well, Schweppes is from Switzerland.

233
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,160
Yes, so it's not a Canadian thing, it's a Swiss thing.

234
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
But it... Canada Dry...

235
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,160
Patrick was like, "Ginger ale is a Canadian thing." And then a few minutes later he said,

236
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,160
"I know it's not just a Canadian thing." Can we get a fact checker in here, please?

237
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,160
I know I'm just lying all the time because I'm a fucking dumbass.

238
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,440
It's an Irish- let's fucking go dude, it's from Ireland!

239
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,360
Couldn't even finish saying "it's an Irish thing" because you're so excited.

240
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
YES!

241
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,360
So excited.

242
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
Oh my god.

243
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,960
It's the Irish people that are developing a stomachache.

244
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,280
This is the Hibernian Conspiracy.

245
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,800
He's got a lot of Irish pride.

246
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,480
I do, I'm 100% Irish.

247
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,280
Can you guys just like- I did my 23 in me.

248
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:31,040
Can Irish people just lose once, dude?

249
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,040
No.

250
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,720
It's annoying how much they win.

251
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,680
I know, I'm so- I was annoyed by it as a kid, but now that I'm older, now that I know that

252
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,840
on the winner. They're just like the least persecuted people in history it feels like.

253
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:48,160
Why don't you take that back? They're just constantly winning dude. You take that back.

254
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:54,480
Just non-stop dubs. The opposite side of the coin you've got some of the most persecuted

255
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,680
people you've got the Italians and I don't know if any of you guys are Italian. I, Caleb

256
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:08,080
is. Are you Italian? Si. You get it. I'm not Italian myself at all. I took the 23andMe

257
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:13,080
I was like 99.9% British and Irish.

258
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,880
I was 0.1% Ethiopian though.

259
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,560
- Oh, sick.

260
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,560
- See, I had that, I had, I think it was like 5%

261
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:29,480
broadly Eastern European and then like 0.02%

262
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Sub-Saharan African and then I checked it at Thanksgiving

263
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,680
and it said no, you're 100% Irish.

264
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,320
- The thing is, there's no chance

265
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:44,160
that you're .01% Ethiopian.

266
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,400
- How do you know?

267
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
- 'Cause there's no chance that you have

268
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,320
like a thousand years of relatives

269
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
who are just white British people,

270
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,160
and then for some reason a thousand years ago,

271
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,760
your great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great

272
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,480
grandmother was like, yeah, fuck this Ethiopian guy.

273
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,320
- How do you know?

274
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,160
How do you know that didn't happen?

275
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:02,980
- That's plausible, dude.

276
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,820
That's so plausible.

277
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,820
now wouldn't fucking Ethiopian guy. My grandma now is dead so how do you know

278
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:13,540
she didn't do it? Oh my god. Dude that's actually Caleb, I'm gonna be honest man that's kind of

279
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,860
that's kind of insensitive because his grandma's dead to make comments about his

280
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,380
grandma having sex. Patrick that percentage is just like one of the

281
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,500
workers at the 23andMe factory had like an eyelash fall into your sample.

282
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
You can get a bag that's like 50% Ethiopian.

283
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:36,420
Yeah, you're 50% cat actually.

284
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,500
We should all get together and we should all mix our spit in one tube and see what it comes

285
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
back as.

286
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,500
That's a good idea.

287
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,780
I think they would just say there was too much DNA.

288
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,780
How much is 23andMe?

289
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,780
In vitro fertilized.

290
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,780
23andMe.

291
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,820
I'll tell you it's like 8 bucks.

292
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,420
When I got it, it was like 70 bucks.

293
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:54,900
Oh, it's $59 right now.

294
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Alright Mr. Moneybags.

295
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,900
That's a video game.

296
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,900
Three years ago when I had student loan refunds.

297
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:06,900
I do still think of money in terms of video games and think of time in terms of TV episodes.

298
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:09,900
If something's an hour and a half away, I'm like, that's like fucking...

299
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,900
That's three episodes of Full House, dude.

300
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,900
That's crazy to sit and have an hour and a half and think in episodes and not one movie.

301
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Or it's like two episodes of Breaking Bad without commercial breaks.

302
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,880
Exactly yeah two episodes if I'm if I'm marathoning Breaking Bad or even the Sopranos personally

303
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,580
I tend to think of time like in either minutes or hours, but I guess that's just you're so stupid dude female

304
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:37,080
Wow Cameron Wow mr.

305
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,520
Mr.

306
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,660
Big brains over here if you come into the 23 and me to been sending in are they gonna?

307
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:49,040
Like I think they get mad they drink like like sir. That's like are they just gonna deny it if you are they gonna get horny

308
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,820
They might see that and get really really someone gonna use that is there or is it just gonna go to waste

309
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:59,460
No, they're gonna use it if it's spit. They use all this science if there's a guy

310
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:06,560
That after they after they detect the like percentages from the spit they just repackaged it into Dasani

311
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:14,880
If you send in come though, they just have like a guy who takes one step and he's like that guy's Irish

312
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:22,060
Without a doubt that's a Chinese guys come. Yeah, that's right there. Yeah a hundred percent

313
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:27,560
It's hidden certain certain nutty notes, it's the guy from the from the

314
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:35,080
The the dryers like ice cream taste testing video. He keeps smacking his yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's that guy

315
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,080
he tries the guy tells you that you're

316
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,040
1% sub-saharan Africa and then he's

317
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,320
Yeah

318
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:47,000
He spits it into an old-timey, but do he's a cowboy now

319
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,840
and then one day one day a lightning bolt struck the spittoon and created a new

320
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:01,480
race of person mm-hmm that's true that's how we get got Dominic Chinese it's how

321
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:09,360
the Armenian came to be I wish you guys should sell like pot about this branded

322
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,240
like mud jugs or spittoons that's a good idea yeah I guess we're pretty yeah I

323
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:19,440
I think old-timey yeah I mean I've been thinking about getting into chewing

324
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,880
tobacco once the holes in my teeth are finally filled up yeah you'd rather

325
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,840
replace them with holes in your gums yeah because then it just looks even at

326
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:33,360
least I'm just fixing my shit people are just confused if they see your teeth and

327
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,280
then your gums are like fucking worst teeth I've ever seen the most beautiful

328
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:41,160
gums Jesus Christ those are perfect yeah you gotta fuck them up a little bit

329
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,440
- You gotta fuck 'em up with some dip.

330
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,060
Have you ever dipped before?

331
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:48,420
- I haven't, my dad did for most of, all of my life.

332
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:51,220
- My dad's a huge dipper, so I probably will never do it.

333
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,340
'Cause when I was a kid, my dad would,

334
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,220
my dad's a psycho, instead of dipping into like a dip cup,

335
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,060
he would, he was spitting into a dip cup,

336
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,340
he would spit into a Pepsi can.

337
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,420
- I was just about to ask, I was just about to ask,

338
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,260
did he ever accidentally--

339
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,040
- And like two or three times in my life,

340
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,220
I reached for my Pepsi, and it was just my dad's fucking gunk.

341
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:15,020
- Yeah, my dad and my uncle and my brother.

342
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,120
I've done that more than,

343
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,180
the fucking chances of that happening for me are higher.

344
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,020
- Yeah, it kinda sounds like you wanna do it.

345
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,860
- Yeah, now I do.

346
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,300
- It doesn't really sound like an accident.

347
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,180
- One time's an accident.

348
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,020
- Yeah, exactly.

349
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,420
- But, you know, two times maybe you can still get

350
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,420
the benefit of the doubt, but three times.

351
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,500
- Three times it's a tradition, you gotta keep doing it.

352
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,340
- Yeah.

353
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,160
- That's a choice.

354
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,020
- It's such a cool type of person to be like,

355
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:39,060
I can pick any way I want to consume tobacco

356
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,020
and I'm gonna pick what I think is the coolest

357
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,280
and then picking the one that's like,

358
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,300
I'm gonna fill my mouth with slime

359
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,820
and then spray it everywhere every once in a while.

360
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,620
- Let me throw a cool cigarette or like a cigar.

361
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,300
You know, there's so many options.

362
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:56,420
- Let me get a pinch of dirt and throw it in my gum

363
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:59,060
so I can spit everywhere like a fucking idiot.

364
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,220
- I'm gonna suck on dirt

365
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,740
and it's gonna look like a bee stung my lip.

366
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:03,580
- Yeah.

367
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:06,660
- And then I'm just gonna barf everywhere into a cup.

368
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:12,860
Let me let me spit some dark brown stinky juice all over the place a friend of mine on his 18th birthday

369
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:18,820
Bought a pack of like the most powerful dip and just shoved like the entire can in his mouth

370
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,980
He worked at a grocery store

371
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,940
And so he was he like bought it on his way out of work

372
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:27,460
And he puts like the entire can in his mouth starts a driving home, and he passed out

373
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,380
And then and he like me like

374
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,300
Mildly crashed his car like a barrier and then drove home from there like didn't tell anybody or whatever

375
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,640
Walked into his house and just vomited all over his living room

376
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:52,120
Poisoning is so bad if I saw like crash his car and I walked over and I looked in there was just like black slime

377
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:54,820
Dripping out of his mouth. I would just go into a bunker in me

378
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:02,980
The CIA did that one. Yeah, yeah, the CIA was targeting him. I touched that's what the stomach aches lead to

379
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:07,420
Yeah, the stomach aches make you it's like a pepto-bismol shit

380
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:15,380
But I was like 19. I was really depressed and I had a pack of American spirits and I was like, oh man

381
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:22,220
Fuck I'm gonna smoke a cigarette cuz I'm sad and um heard I didn't realize that

382
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:27,380
I hadn't really experienced like the negative effects of nicotine just like when I liked it's like oh man

383
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,760
this buzz is good.

384
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:32,340
So I was really sad and I was like, it's like you know when people are sad they drink a lot

385
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,220
of alcohol so I'll smoke a lot of nicotine.

386
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,160
So I took a cigarette and I sucked it down as fast as I could, like maybe the whole thing

387
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,000
in like less than a minute.

388
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:48,420
And then all of a sudden I just sat down in my car and I just passed out for about 15

389
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,420
minutes.

390
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:54,780
And I woke up and I had Gatorade all over myself and I had nothing to drink.

391
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,660
I guess I tried to drink it and spilled it on myself.

392
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
Miserable though.

393
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,020
And that's the same night I also got cheated on.

394
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,020
So, damn.

395
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,020
That was a fun night.

396
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,020
Which came first?

397
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,020
The cheat, well I was depressed because of the cheating.

398
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Oh, okay.

399
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:11,140
You were so depressed from being cheated on, you were like, I gotta have one.

400
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,140
Yeah, you're gonna commit suicide.

401
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,140
I gotta have a whole pack.

402
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,140
You're gonna commit suicide with one American spirit.

403
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,820
I gotta speed run a cigarette right now.

404
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:20,300
Your girlfriend came over and saw you just in the car, passed out, covered in Gatorade

405
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,180
and was like, well, I guess I should go get another guy now.

406
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:26,180
I should go fuck someone else.

407
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,180
I'm just gonna go fuck a homeless guy right now.

408
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,180
At least he doesn't have Gatorade.

409
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,180
Whatever's happening here.

410
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,180
Dude, I fuckin' in

411
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,180
high school, I forget

412
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,180
when it was the night before prom

413
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
and I was like at the skate park.

414
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,180
It was just me there that day, which was fuckin' sick.

415
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,180
But, because no one was there, I

416
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:46,180
That is sick. There's no one there to watch

417
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,180
you do your tricks though. So what?

418
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
I can fuckin', I can do whatever I want.

419
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
Maybe I'm just a performer.

420
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,500
I was like, I had nothing to do,

421
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,280
like nobody to like talk to or anything.

422
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,120
So I was like bored as shit.

423
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,940
So I just basically smoked a whole pack of Camel Blues

424
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
and I drank these things called high drives,

425
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,120
which were like Gatorade,

426
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,500
but with like 300 milligrams of caffeine,

427
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,220
I drank two of them.

428
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:13,780
I had, yeah, I was like, hey, dad, you gotta pick me up.

429
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,920
I'm not doing good.

430
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,540
And I got in his car and this is back when I lived

431
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:28,180
the fucking hotel too so I like tell me about that later okay but I I drove the

432
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,580
whole way home from Londonderry to Manchester with my seat all the way

433
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,480
reclined so I'm just like all the way back in the car just going oh and as

434
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,700
soon as we get into the fucking like the hotel room I run to the bathroom and

435
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,660
just puke up just a chunk of blue gunk.

436
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,580
That was like a whole thing of blue.

437
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,540
- Like a whole flubber.

438
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:52,860
- A whole blue flubber came out of my mouth

439
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,260
and onto the ground. - Like a non-Newtonian chunk.

440
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,100
- Exactly, exactly. - Some kind of

441
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:56,540
non-Newtonian fluid.

442
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:59,340
- It was the grossest vomit I've ever,

443
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,420
like it came out my nose.

444
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,260
- That's the worst.

445
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,820
- Oh, it burned, it burned on the way out.

446
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,640
- Yeah.

447
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,140
- That's how fucking bad it was.

448
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:10,860
- Yesterday I was at the Super Mega office and--

449
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,700
- You got an office?

450
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,540
- What?

451
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,900
- Ooh, I was at the super mega office.

452
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,980
- Yeah, man, we don't have an office, okay?

453
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,620
I work out of my bathroom.

454
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,820
Is that so wrong?

455
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:23,820
- Well, Cameron looks like he's in like a shack

456
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,660
in Jamaica right now.

457
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,500
- He was captured two months ago, they let him work.

458
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,900
He's doing some sweat equity now.

459
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,060
- That was very nice of them, yeah.

460
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,220
No, but we were recording some videos,

461
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,940
you know, creating content, and I went in the fridge

462
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,140
and I saw there was a big thing of whole milk,

463
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,780
and I was like, "Oh, fuck, I haven't had milk in like a year."

464
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,140
So I got some chocolate syrup

465
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,460
and I made a big, tall glass of chocolate milk

466
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,980
and I just chugged that sucker down and I really enjoyed it.

467
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,340
And I came back to record and I sat down and I was like,

468
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,980
"Oh man, that doesn't feel too good."

469
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,440
'Cause I guess if you go a long time without drinking milk,

470
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,820
your body just is like, "All right, no more of that ever."

471
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,660
And I proceeded to just projectile vomit

472
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,500
chocolate milk yesterday.

473
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,620
And Ryan heard it.

474
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,340
Ryan walked by the bathroom and heard me puking.

475
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:11,380
and his reaction is goes, it's not, it's not,

476
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,220
hey man, are you okay?

477
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,540
It's just, yeah, gross.

478
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,380
(laughing)

479
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,740
Just walked off.

480
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,620
- Well, that's 'cause somebody vomiting chocolate milk,

481
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,780
you're like, I know exactly what's happening here.

482
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,140
Like, you're fine as soon as that's out of your body.

483
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:22,980
- Well, you didn't say--

484
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:24,700
- You just like did something immoral

485
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,540
and God is punishing you.

486
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,300
- You drank a four year old's drink and it made you sick.

487
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,140
- Exactly, yeah.

488
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,220
- It made me sick, I couldn't handle it.

489
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,140
But the worst part was like, you know when you make

490
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,820
like Nesquik chocolate milk,

491
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,780
the bottom's always more chocolaty.

492
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,620
- Yeah.

493
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,460
- It's the same with the puke.

494
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,700
Like, the more I puked,

495
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,700
the more chocolatey it became until it came out my nose and it was just like

496
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,700
straight chocolate. Just a chocolate bar coming out of your mouth at the end.

497
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,700
That's a bummer. Fully formed, yeah. Yeah, like a vending machine returning a dollar bill.

498
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,700
Just a sheet of chocolate coming out of your disgusting mouth.

499
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,700
Dude, that would legitimately send me into a full-blown panic attack if that happened.

500
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,700
A chocolate bar coming out of your mouth? Like if a perfect chocolate bar came out of my throat.

501
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,700
Low-key that'd freak my shit out.

502
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,860
Like I'd be staring in the toilet, like that shit's floating there and I would pull it out

503
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,740
with my hands and be like, "What?

504
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:12,740
This is not real."

505
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,740
And I'd probably call 911.

506
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,740
I'd call my attorney because I was gonna be rich.

507
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:22,740
I was gonna be the greatest fucking act America's Got Talent's ever seen.

508
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,340
If you were able to regurgitate a full like, uh, cocktail bar.

509
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:26,340
It'd be scarier.

510
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,820
It'd be way scarier if it was a zero bar.

511
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Oh.

512
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,220
Just a whole chunk of white chocolate coming out of ya?

513
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:39,020
Yeah, I've had white chocolate since like Halloween 2009.

514
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:39,520
Right.

515
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:43,220
There's no way that that's just been sitting in me.

516
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,720
Yeah.

517
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,720
What if it was like one of those giant gummy bears?

518
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,220
One of the big like, "Ooh, I'm a gummy bear."

519
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,020
That would be like God telling you you're gay if it's any sort of gummy fruit.

520
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,820
You'd be like, "Oh, this is like an Old Testament miracle telling me I'm gay."

521
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:03,220
God would be telling you you're gay because you gave birth to a gummy bear out your mouth?

522
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,820
Yeah, dude.

523
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,820
I guess Patrick doesn't get it.

524
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:13,260
Patrick, gummy bears for centuries have been an icon and a symbol of the gay community.

525
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,260
Oh I didn't know this.

526
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,260
It was like before they had the flags and the letters.

527
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,260
Have you ever heard of the gummy bear song?

528
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
Yeah.

529
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
Oh, I just...

530
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
It's just a gay anthem dude.

531
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,420
Have you never been to a gay club and they turn on the gummy bear song?

532
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,100
I just thought he was German.

533
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,900
Ickbun Gummy Bear? You've never fuckin'

534
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
*laughs*

535
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:33,500
That's like the bottom anthem of all time

536
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,300
The bottom anthem of all time?

537
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,800
The bottom anthem of all time

538
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:38,800
Patrick knows

539
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,800
Patrick, he's playing coy

540
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,300
He's like "I don't know what the bottom anthem is"

541
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,300
*laughs*

542
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,300
I don't know it

543
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,300
I thought it was Barbie Girl

544
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,300
No dude, that's the top anthem you dumbass

545
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,100
Well, alright, I'm learning!

546
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
That's some extreme top energy in that song.

547
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:02,820
I found the drink, the exact drink that I drank that day and I spit out blue gunk.

548
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
The high drive.

549
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,820
I'm gonna sleep with this one.

550
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,580
And it doesn't look like this anymore.

551
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,580
Energy water?

552
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:12,860
That is so fucked up to market it as energy water.

553
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,580
That looks like something I'd put into my car.

554
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
Exactly.

555
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,300
When I'm servicing the engine.

556
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:22,100
You shouldn't put anything in your body that has a picture of an atom on it.

557
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,600
(laughing)

558
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,160
- You sure you weren't just drinking fucking

559
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,440
anti-freeze or something?

560
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,920
- Honestly, if I was, that would make--

561
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,880
- Probably same effect.

562
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,960
- Yeah, I'd probably feel the same.

563
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,440
- Anything that's caffeinated should taste terrible.

564
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,080
Anything that's that highly caffeinated,

565
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,600
they shouldn't be able to call it water, first of all.

566
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,260
It shouldn't be any kind of water.

567
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,880
It should be like, it should taste like ethanol.

568
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,940
- It's good, it's also, yeah, that's good also

569
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:50,020
because then you know if you start liking the taste

570
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,660
of a caffeinated drink, you know you'd have to stop.

571
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,940
You have to switch to something else.

572
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:54,780
- Exactly, yeah.

573
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,320
- You guys remember Vault?

574
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,720
- Yes, dude.

575
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,560
- Yeah.

576
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,140
- Dude, Vault was awesome.

577
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,500
- I knew this kid, so back in sixth grade

578
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,340
was when I got into making YouTube videos.

579
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,180
And I had this rival at school

580
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,660
that was like my YouTube rival named Casey.

581
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:10,820
And he was a magician.

582
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,140
- Yo!

583
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,580
- That's tough to compete with.

584
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:16,060
- Yeah, well, actually still, he's still for a living,

585
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,980
he works for a magic card company.

586
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,220
- Do you still hate him?

587
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,060
- Yeah.

588
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,980
(laughing)

589
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,980
He always, he, like we had the biggest war

590
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,860
over like stealing ideas and like views on YouTube

591
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,340
'cause like he'd post a video and get like 20 views

592
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:32,860
and I'd post one and get like 20 views

593
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,980
and it'd be this whole like,

594
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,580
"I think you stole that joke from me."

595
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,980
No, you took it from, I said it first at lunch.

596
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:40,820
But I remember every single day he'd come to school,

597
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,180
he was in my first period class

598
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,220
and he would just drink a vault every day

599
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,300
and then for the rest of the class

600
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,940
have his head down with a migraine.

601
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,860
(laughing)

602
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,260
And I remember he would miss he missed like half the school year. He's like I just keep getting these migraines

603
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:58,420
Dude I for some reason I

604
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:06,140
Associate vault with the paintball. I don't know why no big time all this drink right there. Yeah ballers drink

605
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:11,840
Yeah, you know what in the migraines? That's like paintballers version of like coal lung. Yeah

606
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,060
It came with the territory. Yeah. Yeah, you would know you do you fucking I did

607
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,900
- I did play paintball.

608
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,360
I drank a lot of vault.

609
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,080
- Paintball was, I liked it,

610
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,080
but the problem was the paintball course

611
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,680
I went to in Charleston, it was like the only one,

612
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,780
and it was literally like right down the street

613
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,180
from the military base, so like all the guys

614
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,140
that would go there would be these like really pumped up,

615
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,580
like date rapist military guys that would just have to get

616
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,620
all of their energy and like masculinity

617
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:42,780
out on the paintball field.

618
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,060
So it'd be all these like 21 year old dudes,

619
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,940
and then my 13 year old ass, and they'd run up behind me

620
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,280
just light me up and I'd be screaming and I'd throw my gun on the ground and have

621
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,600
my hands up and they just continue to do it so well yeah that's mainly why I hate

622
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:01,800
the military. They join the military to kill like 13 year old girls.

623
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,160
They're like we're gonna I'm gonna shoot this kid so many times in the head and

624
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:10,860
then is it mom here I'd like to shoot her as well yeah yeah. Is there a family in the

625
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:16,380
building? Yeah I would love to marry this kid's mom. I'm going to shoot this kid's

626
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,380
mom once and then marry her.

627
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,460
Ma'am, ma'am, I just shot, I just pelted your son.

628
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,380
I gave him so many welts.

629
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,060
Will you take my hand in marriage?

630
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,060
Please take my hand in marriage.

631
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,140
Yeah, I basically just fucked your kid up pretty good.

632
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,860
If you wanted to like...

633
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,940
Did you sell those welts on your kid?

634
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:35,940
Yeah, that was me.

635
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,940
I was doing a good job.

636
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,940
That's right.

637
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:41,940
And I'll do a lot better than that in the bedroom.

638
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:42,940
Let me tell you what.

639
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,940
So you want to like see my penis?

640
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:44,940
You're going to be covered in paint.

641
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:45,780
- Are you covered in paint?

642
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,940
- Like penis or, yeah, what's up?

643
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,940
I just painted your kid and I'm gonna paint your face next.

644
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,260
- And let me tell you, you're gonna have to wear

645
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,020
a protective vest in the bedroom.

646
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:54,860
(laughing)

647
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,460
'Cause I go nuts.

648
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,900
- You're gonna have to put one hand up

649
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,900
when you're ready to tap out.

650
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,940
- Yeah, you better not get a Bowflex in the house.

651
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,100
- But that doesn't mean I'm gonna stop shooting.

652
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,420
- Yeah, I'm gonna, yeah.

653
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,420
(laughing)

654
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,260
Yeah.

655
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,940
The paintball field that my brother worked at,

656
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,980
like growing up, which is the only reason I played paintball,

657
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:15,040
The owner was this guy with like, he had like horrible diabetes.

658
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,040
So he had like no legs and he just vomited blood all the time.

659
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:30,300
You'd get there and he'd be like, Hey, welcome to blue.

660
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:35,820
I don't believe you do that. Should you shouldn't be,

661
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:39,500
you shouldn't be working if he had to work to afford.

662
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Should be in a camp facility.

663
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
He has no legs.

664
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,500
They had to have used him as like an example, right?

665
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,500
It'd be like if a kid wasn't wearing like the safety goggles, to be like, "Hey!"

666
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
"You'll end up like him!"

667
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:55,500
For some reason I thought you were going to say they had to have used him in a haunted house.

668
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,500
Because Matt is a perfect haunted house guy.

669
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
Oh yeah.

670
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
It is, it is.

671
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,500
I love that when like you go to one of those like high budget haunted houses and they hire like a little person.

672
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Yeah.

673
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:15,140
And it's like, what is, it's just like, that's not any more scary than a normal Jason Voorhees.

674
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Yeah.

675
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,100
This guy has a metal leg.

676
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:24,740
Yeah, this guy has some genetic defects from the time he was born that he has, you know,

677
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:30,260
lived in extreme bullying and lack of self-esteem his whole life.

678
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:35,900
But at least he can go to the haunted house and make minimum wage scaring privileged people.

679
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,980
Yeah, but you're not gonna believe how smooth the space between this guy's lips and noses, okay?

680
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:52,820
But but also at the same time, you know the Americans with Disabilities Act does

681
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,500
You know fair employment for people

682
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:02,620
Sending those people to haunted houses

683
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,620
That's how Patrick got on this podcast.

684
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,620
I guess you could be like a tree stump or something.

685
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,620
Exactly. The tree stump.

686
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,620
Yeah, like an evil tree stump.

687
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,620
Just sit there.

688
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,620
I don't know man. Sit there and gurgle.

689
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,620
Yeah, it's either that or you have to like do payroll.

690
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,620
So it's your choice I guess.

691
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,620
Yeah, no one wants to do that.

692
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,620
Painting fences.

693
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
Yeah, there was a haunted house in my hometown

694
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,620
that was like

695
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,620
when

696
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,620
having like a cool expensive

697
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:36,680
Haunted House, it became kind of a trend in like the early 2010s. Yeah. And they

698
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,480
did one. Yeah, there were like, there's like two years where it was like this

699
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,720
this warehouse, they would set it up with like a bunch of rooms and shit and it

700
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,840
cost like 15 bucks and they, it was really popular. And then for the third

701
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,400
year they were like, this year we're one-upping ourselves and

702
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,600
we're going to set a 1 million dollar budget. And then they didn't even make it

703
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,760
Halloween immediately went like so bankrupt and owed all these people money.

704
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:10,240
Those like haunted houses are so cool like the ones that are like you have to

705
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:14,200
sign a waiver that's like if the ghost spits in your mouth you can't take

706
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:20,400
revenge. Isn't there one somewhere that's like the guy if you go if you like can

707
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,280
make it all the way through he pays you like ten thousand dollars. Yeah but then

708
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,360
the waiver is literally like the the people can touch any part of

709
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,020
your body and do whatever they want to you and they can kill you.

710
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,420
You'll get molested in the haunted house.

711
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,520
Like straight up, that's like, there is like a thing in the waiver that's like that.

712
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,520
I remember, I read the waiver of that one I think, if it's the one I'm thinking of.

713
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,840
I don't think waivers can cover that.

714
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,680
Yeah, no, it definitely doesn't, it definitely wouldn't hold up.

715
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,440
No, I mean, hey no dude, that's a legal document.

716
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,920
If I sign a waiver giving Caleb permission to touch me and my meat is, stick his finger

717
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:55,480
down my meat is and he does it, I can't sue him for putting his finger in my cornhole because

718
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,960
he's, I signed it.

719
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,960
There's literally a clause in that one that's like, "If you die, you can't sue us."

720
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Like, it's like...

721
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
It's like, "Duh!"

722
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,320
Yeah, and it's also like, there's like a one that's like, "If we can inject anything into

723
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
you with needles."

724
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Like, stuff like that.

725
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,320
It's just like a bunch of stuff like that.

726
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:17,400
Just inject you with ketamine so you literally just cannot make it to the end of the course.

727
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Like, "I guess you don't get $10,000."

728
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Yeah.

729
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Fucking owned, baby.

730
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,400
Fucking honed.

731
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:26,400
I can't imagine going to a haunted house.

732
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,400
I can't imagine paying for a haunted house.

733
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
You're messing up, dude. They're fun.

734
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
I don't think I've ever gone to a haunted house that wasn't just a neighbor's garage or something.

735
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:40,400
I don't know why I'd ever pay for a haunted house when I can just go stop by Patrick's mom's house.

736
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Oh, Jesus Christ.

737
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400

Yeah, I looked at my mom and I said, "God's not real, Mom."

834
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,700
She immediately burst into tears and then burst into flames.

835
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,620
She immediately started sucking my dick because I was so smart.

836
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,620
What the hell?

837
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,620
You're smart.

838
00:40:47,620 --> 00:40:48,620
Dude, come on.

839
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,780
you guys caught me I was lying yeah you better be lying I don't remember that

840
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,940
part of the movie that's crap I'd be calling the police if you're not I don't

841
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:59,700
remember if anybody sucked my dick during that I don't remember if that movie even

842
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,540
happened when I was a kid I had a like extreme irrational phobia of vomit and I

843
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:11,860
remember I was I was I saw holes in theaters and I'm sitting in the back of

844
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,260
the theater I didn't want to sit with my mom cuz I was like an angsty kid so she

845
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,700
I sat in the back by myself.

846
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:24,500
And then the part when Zero throws up, I just got up and I booked it straight out the theater

847
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,000
because I was just so scared.

848
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,000
Just left.

849
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,580
And my mom had to like follow me out into the, into like the hallway in the theater.

850
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,860
She's like, "Son, son, it's okay."

851
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:37,260
And then I also, when I saw Cheaper by the Dozen in theaters, or maybe it was Cheaper

852
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:41,660
the second one or something, there's a scene where a kid throws up and I was in Seattle

853
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:45,320
with my cousins and I did that I just got up like when he said he was feeling

854
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:50,180
nauseous in the movie and I just beelined it to the exit. Damn. Damn. You just hated

855
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,740
vomit as a kid? No it just I was I had a rational phobia of it like I wasn't even

856
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,860
grossed out by it just like it's called a metaphobia it's really fucking

857
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:03,820
terrified. I don't think I've ever walked out of a theater in a movie I feel like I

858
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:10,500
had to go I saw Elmo and Grouchland in theaters and I was so scared by the bad

859
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,660
guy in that movie that I told my mom like 30 minutes in I was like mom I think I

860
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,700
needed to go take a nap and she just she took me out of the movie and took me

861
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,780
home so yeah do with the big eyebrows dude Mandy Patinkin is scary as shit in

862
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:26,640
that movie yeah have you got one of the funniest walkouts I've seen in a movie

863
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,060
theater is we saw as I went to see the then like remake of the grudge which is

864
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:35,340
really really bad the one that came out this year and this couple like just

865
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,060
walked out like the second that the first jump scare happened like 10 minutes

866
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
and they just walked in.

867
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,060
It's a horror movie dude.

868
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:45,060
They thought it was going to be like a family drama.

869
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,060
Yeah, the grudge.

870
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
Like the poster.

871
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:48,060
Thought it was about divorce.

872
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,500
It's a ghost, come on.

873
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:52,500
I went and saw Moonlight by myself in theaters.

874
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,500
You got so scared you left.

875
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:59,500
I didn't know what it was about and as soon as I did I said, oh wait, no, that's what

876
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:04,780
happened though, I sat down in Moonlight, they're my popcorn, and like these two massive,

877
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:10,580
huge ripped like Turkish dudes come and sit down and the seats in front of me

878
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:14,420
and they're like sharing a popcorn and I guess they just picked I guess they

879
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:18,760
didn't know what the movie was about and then like it starts to creep into the

880
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,380
gay territory and I just see it's right in front of me he's like kind of like

881
00:43:25,380 --> 00:43:29,860
scoffing and then the part the part where he looked behind him no he looked behind

882
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,620
him he was just kind of looking around like to check if like the village people

883
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:40,840
were behind him. And then like some the gay more gay stuff happens and they just be

884
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:47,120
like and then finally the part happens when he gives him a handjob on the beach

885
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:51,780
and they're just like like looking around all nervously and they both just get up

886
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:56,920
and book it out and I enjoyed the movie because they weren't in my in my way

887
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:01,720
anymore. I love that move of like like something is happening in a movie and

888
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:08,680
you're just looking around like Rodney Dangerfield. He wants to make sure

889
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,320
everyone else in the theater, they're not focusing on the movie, they're focused on

890
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:15,720
him right then and they're thinking like yo this guy might be gay because he's

891
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,560
watching this scene yeah and he's like no I'm not gay. The scoff, the audible

892
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,080
scoff is showing that I'm like whoa. It's funny though it's like like if you're in a

893
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,080
before any more movie happens

894
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,080
*laughter*

895
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,080
let me just put this at the record straight

896
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,080
I need to get this off my chest

897
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,080
nothing

898
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,080
this is doing nothing for me

899
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,080
what happened to your pants?

900
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,080
I spilled my soda

901
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,080
about 5 minutes into the movie

902
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,080
and I had to remove my pants

903
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,080
*laughter*

904
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:52,080
I got the butter from the popcorn

905
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:54,080
all down my slack

906
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:59,000
very oily. It's very oily but it's see like that's what the noise is okay I'm

907
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,080
wiping my pants clean very quickly. I've been saying ah geez oh god because I'm

908
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:11,420
trying to get a stain out. You sound like a Jewish doctor. I'm saying I'm gonna come because I'm using the

909
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:15,680
the dictation on my phone to tell my girlfriend I'm coming over after the

910
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:22,680
movie. Yeah I'm gonna come. I'm coming I'm coming. Yeah I'm gonna miss movies dude

911
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:26,760
they're over oh yeah they're done it is yeah they made two gay movies and it's

912
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,080
done it's finished that's what happened they make call me by your name and

913
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:34,020
they made moonlight and then they were like all right we need to put a pant we

914
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:37,080
need to create a virus to make sure no one goes to the movies anymore because

915
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,880
we can't have this keep happening exactly it's very sick that like Christopher

916
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,040
Nolan pushed his movie into theaters and it just like flopped so hard and now we

917
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:49,880
get to see all the movies on streaming like thank only because like he was

918
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:53,660
stupid because of that movie because it failed so like it did it just like did

919
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:58,240
not make enough money because like that's the reason that the HBO Max

920
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,280
thing is going like where they're releasing movies on HBO Max next year

921
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,240
did Chris did Christopher Nolan do interstellar yeah yeah that's a good-ass

922
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:10,680
movie I still have a nice movie it's too long dude it's long but like I saw that

923
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,400
in theaters and I like bawled my eyes out.

924
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
It's a sad movie.

925
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,000
I bawled so hard dude.

926
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Damn I bawled hard as fuck.

927
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,800
I kept bouncing it off the screen.

928
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:27,600
Every time Matt Damon showed up I'd toss it and try to hit him right in the face.

929
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,440
I don't like space movies bro.

930
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:30,440
Seriously?

931
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,440
They scare me too much.

932
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,260
I'm so scared of space.

933
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,640
Space is one of my favorite things.

934
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,640
I love space more than anything dude.

935
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:39,960
Are you making fun of me now?

936
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:45,000
No, no, I'm serious. I would do any and do you know anyone in space? I?

937
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:52,820
Don't think he does one time. Oh my yeah, there's no I don't I don't one time my family friends

938
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:56,820
Like when I was a kid my family started started touching my leg

939
00:46:56,820 --> 00:47:00,960
Just kidding my

940
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:06,520
my family friends get like gave my family like this like printed out like diary of an astronaut and

941
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:09,720
And I don't know if it was like a guy that they knew,

942
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,560
that was an astronaut,

943
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,320
or if it was just like something they printed out from online.

944
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,240
But look, it was just like, you know,

945
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,760
like he typed up like,

946
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:18,960
"Oh, this is what happened when we took off."

947
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,320
And there was just like a whole chapter

948
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,000
about how he had to use a catheter to go to the bathroom.

949
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,240
I was in like fourth grade reading it.

950
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,520
I'm like, "I do not want to go to space anymore."

951
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:32,960
- I'm starting my astronaut diary.

952
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,000
First off, this is not a diary.

953
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,260
(laughter)

954
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:40,160
- This is a flight log.

955
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,780
- Yeah.

956
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:44,620
- Now that'd be a good, it's just him, he's like,

957
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:47,060
damn bro, I'm in slow motion up here, shit.

958
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:50,320
God damn, that's cool.

959
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,280
- They make me eat out of a tube.

960
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,800
I'm eating toothpaste up here, this shit sucks.

961
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,240
- Damn, this is the worst steak I ever had.

962
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,560
- But just think about it, like being a kid

963
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:01,200
wanting to like, go to space and like be an astronaut

964
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,640
and then like read a thing that's like, yeah, okay,

965
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,060
first things first, when you're an astronaut,

966
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:06,460
You gotta stick a thingy into your pee hole.

967
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,300
- You gotta be surgering your penis every day.

968
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,700
- Are you awake every single day?

969
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,580
- I think so, I think you have to put the catheter

970
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,940
in yourself, you're basically peeing into a bottle.

971
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:14,780
- So you have to sound yourself.

972
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:17,540
- You think they just have a guy whose job it is to do that?

973
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,900
- They have the catheter guy on the ship.

974
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:20,740
- Yeah.

975
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:21,900
- It could be possible.

976
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,500
- Dude, if I were in this position.

977
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,460
- I'm an astronaut, but I'm not like the explorer-ass

978
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,420
or anything cool, I'm just the bathroom guy.

979
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:29,780
- I mean, you could argue he's the bigger explorer

980
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:30,620
right there.

981
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,900
- Whoa, that is a good point.

982
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:33,300
- That's true, yeah.

983
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,300
He's going through uncharted territory.

984
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:40,200
Yesterday, we were opening some mail from our PO box and someone sent us a full sounding

985
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:44,780
kit that had like 20 different sized rods.

986
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:48,480
It was this big black thing and I unzipped it and I opened it up and it's this really

987
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,500
fancy sounding kit.

988
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:56,380
Like the thing is leather and it goes up to like 34mm and the biggest sounding bar was

989
00:48:56,380 --> 00:48:57,380
massive.

990
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,380
How the-

991
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,800
Ding dong, massive!

992
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,800
How the fuck?

993
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:06,160
I, I, that's the one thing I think I-

994
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,160
Unrelated to that, we should get a PO box.

995
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,160
Don't understand.

996
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:10,160
Yeah.

997
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:11,240
Oh, it's, it's so worth it.

998
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,240
It's so worth it.

999
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,240
Is that the weirdest thing you've ever gotten in there?

1000
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:16,240
No.

1001
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,240
No?

1002
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,200
Have you ever gotten the Godlike bombs or anything?

1003
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:21,200
Not yet.

1004
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,040
I'm hoping someone does do that.

1005
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:28,520
Like the Bjork thing where I open the package and it sprays hydrochloric acid in my eyes.

1006
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,800
We have, you know, we've gotten a lot of-

1007
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,960
We've got that coming soon.

1008
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,560
We've gotten dead animals, we've gotten hair and human teeth and stuff.

1009
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:39,560
Were they alive when they got sent?

1010
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,680
Well we got a big thing.

1011
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,360
Someone sent a whole like tank of cockroaches.

1012
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,840
Those were dead when they arrived because we didn't check the PO box for like three

1013
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,940
months.

1014
00:49:48,940 --> 00:49:53,960
Someone sent us like some taxidermy ducklings and stuff.

1015
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,280
And we get a lot of hair.

1016
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,240
People will just like rip out their hair and mail it.

1017
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,600
And then yesterday we got a really well done replication of like two ripped out testicles

1018
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:07,640
wrapped in a paper towel with like blood all over it and I opened it up.

1019
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:12,000
The package said Deez Nuts and we opened it and there were like two very well painted like

1020
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:16,000
well made out of clay nuts like ripped out from the sack.

1021
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,000
Wow.

1022
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,320
I can't wait until your fans start listening to us and sending us stuff.

1023
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,920
When you guys open a PO box, I don't think it's illegal to mail anthrax just to create

1024
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
it.

1025
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,920
Just to open it.

1026
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:36,400
Yeah, you'll go to jail if you open it.

1027
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:37,800
So don't fucking think about it.

1028
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,320
You guys should get a PO box though and then part of your podcast, you guys can open some

1029
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,000
of the letters and read them.

1030
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,000
It is, it's so funny.

1031
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,240
Someone would definitely send a poop though.

1032
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:48,380
I know that they do like scans and shit too but it's really funny that when you like mail

1033
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:51,920
a package the guy at the post office just goes like, "Is there anything dangerous in

1034
00:50:51,920 --> 00:51:00,440
here and you just go "no" oh yeah you caught me. I'll go put it back. I'm sorry.

1035
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:05,840
Lithium batteries and Fiji's. Yeah, address 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Now tell me is there anything

1036
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:14,600
dangerous in this? Ah, you got me. I was really hoping you weren't gonna ask me that.

1037
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,600
My mother raised me as an honest, you know, never tell a lie.

1038
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:23,600
I cannot tell a lie. I am evil, but I can't tell a lie. I'm sorry.

1039
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,600
I'm like a terrorist that has OCD, so like he cannot lie without feeling horribly guilty, so it's just like,

1040
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,600
"Sir, is there anything suspicious in this?" Like, "Yeah, it's a bomb."

1041
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:37,600
I was gonna send it to the White House, you got me. Sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just gonna leave. I'll take it with me.

1042
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,600
Just, I'm just, I'm gonna leave. Don't worry about it.

1043
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:50,680
Yeah, I've I've only sent like one thing in the mail I think in my entire life really yeah check in the mail

1044
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,520
No, it was it. It was a

1045
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:57,400
T-shirt that was like an M&M line. No you said oh my god, dude

1046
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:00,640
Have I sent a pair of pants? I sent a pair of you

1047
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,720
I thought I went on your journey with you to send the pair of pants

1048
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:09,400
You kept trying to send. Oh, I sent two things. Yeah, you're right. I forgot about that. Yeah

1049
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:13,860
I remember that very vividly just walking around to different post offices.

1050
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:15,860
It took so long for some reason.

1051
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,860
Yeah.

1052
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,860
Wait, you had to...

1053
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,860
I don't remember why.

1054
00:52:18,860 --> 00:52:21,120
I hate the post office.

1055
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,280
I had to mail a pair of pants.

1056
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,280
I don't even remember why.

1057
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,520
I think I sold them.

1058
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,840
Oh no, it was somebody left them at my house, I think.

1059
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:31,040
Yeah, I'm a little bit of a player.

1060
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,040
Yeah, somewhat.

1061
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:35,000
You know, this girl left her panties at a...

1062
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,920
- Patrick, speaking of which, Patrick, by the way,

1063
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,880
can you tell your mom to mail me my pants back?

1064
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:42,720
- No.

1065
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,440
- And my condom, my YouTube pants.

1066
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:45,280
- I'm wearing them.

1067
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,720
- Girl, can you mail me my used condom?

1068
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:50,360
- Hey, I think I left a condom at your house.

1069
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:53,260
- Girl, I left a condom in your toilet.

1070
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:55,440
- Can I get that back?

1071
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,120
- Can you send that back, actually?

1072
00:52:57,120 --> 00:52:58,120
- Can you send me that condom?

1073
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,400
- I'm gonna reuse it.

1074
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:04,160
- There's some stuff in there that I need to put back in me.

1075
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:11,600
I'm doing my 23andMe and I need to... I don't want someone to have that so...

1076
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:15,800
Hey about a year ago I left a condom at your house, could you...

1077
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:17,800
Could you go look for it in your trash?

1078
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,800
Yeah I can't afford another one.

1079
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:22,960
Hey I don't know if you remember me, it's Patrick from college.

1080
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,960
Um...

1081
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,960
I dropped a huge condom.

1082
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,960
40 years old.

1083
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:30,960
I took a big shit at your house.

1084
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,640
When we meet up for the reunion, could you bring the shit and the condom back?

1085
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,480
I know, yeah, I know we didn't have sex but I did leave a condom in the toilet after I

1086
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,480
shit.

1087
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:41,480
It fell off.

1088
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,480
It fell off on me.

1089
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:49,720
In the future, if I ever end up on a Tinder date, I'm gonna make sure that after sex,

1090
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:53,560
every time I just go take a shit and I don't flush it and I leave.

1091
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,560
That's right.

1092
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:55,560
That's like my calling card.

1093
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,160
It's just like, wow, that was such good, such good sex.

1094
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,640
And then she goes to the bathroom to freshen up her pussy and then she just sees there's

1095
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,840
shit in the toilet.

1096
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,960
And she's like, "Oh my god, he got me.

1097
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:07,960
He got me."

1098
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:08,960
Yeah.

1099
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,960
I think there'd be like a Twitter thread that's like, "Matt Watson left a shit in my toilet."

1100
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,960
Content warning poop.

1101
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,240
"The sex was just completely normal but there was a crap in my toilet and he forgot to flush."

1102
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,400
There's 40 pictures of similar women with similar stories.

1103
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,920
It's gonna be like a thread canceling me where it's like, "CW/poop" and then the rest is

1104
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:36,520
like I had sex with Matt Watson in 2019 and he took a he took a poop in my

1105
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:43,300
toilet and just left it yeah he was still there I asked him about her and he said

1106
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:48,720
he didn't know anything about it she has like screenshots of text where it's her

1107
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,760
like test be like did you did you shit and not flush it and I'm like I don't

1108
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:56,640
know what you're talking about I mean like it must have been your cat it must

1109
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,760
have been you you dumb whore you must have forgot I must have fucked your memory

1110
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,040
up when I fucking ate your pussy because you definitely took that shit that was

1111
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,120
your that's your poop that's a girl size and that looks like that's what it come

1112
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:12,520
out of it same shape you know like the the play-doh things where it comes out

1113
00:55:12,520 --> 00:55:16,120
different shapes I can match it the same way you have a star-shaped asshole and

1114
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:21,720
that poop came out of that thing now it's notably oh yeah I guess if I could

1115
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:26,820
go for any shape I'd go whatever a penis couldn't fit into. Actually a star of

1116
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:30,600
David would be really good for that. You're right that's a good point yeah. I

1117
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:34,260
would never flush I'd go everywhere and just leave that like just a big star of

1118
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:39,600
David shit. You would create a lot of anti-semites. Yeah that's true. Yeah

1119
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,240
people just showing up they'd be like because also well the thing is with that

1120
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,680
is they would have to take the poop out and look at it. Much like the picture I took of my dick.

1121
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,960
And they'd have to look at it like a telescope.

1122
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,760
"Hey wait a sec Earl, check this out from this angle.

1123
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,200
This looks like that Jewish thing."

1124
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,960
"I'm gonna keep it."

1125
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,640
Then those guys are gonna go post it on 8chan and be like "Hey I was in the gas station restroom

1126
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:06,880
and I found this Jewish feces."

1127
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,880
"I found Jewish poop."

1128
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,800
"I found a Jew poop."

1129
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,800
How could you tell?

1130
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:14,920
"Well it was shaped exactly like the Star of David.

1131
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:15,920
Sorry."

1132
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,440
I want the uh, I gotta say guys, by the way, your merch is fantastic.

1133
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,000
Oh, thank you.

1134
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,000
I tried ordering some but my card got declined so I should try again.

1135
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:31,200
If we made it ourselves and didn't have like some Chinese company make it, we'd just send

1136
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,680
it to you, but we don't have any of it.

1137
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:35,040
We gotta figure that out.

1138
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:36,640
It's all like sitting in Bulgaria.

1139
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:37,640
Yeah.

1140
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:38,920
Wait, what website do you guys use?

1141
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:41,560
We use Teespring.

1142
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,900
The only good thing about Teespring is that if you have a YouTube channel you can link

1143
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:47,300
it like underneath the video and we'll show the merch.

1144
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,300
Whoa.

1145
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:49,300
Good to know.

1146
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,060
But the penis boobs shit one is my favorite.

1147
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,460
Oh I have that one.

1148
00:56:54,460 --> 00:56:55,460
That one's uh.

1149
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:57,420
It's all good merch.

1150
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,940
It's all good merch.

1151
00:56:58,940 --> 00:56:59,940
Thank you very much.

1152
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,260
What an amazing plug for Matt Watson.

1153
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:06,100
Hey Matt, why have you never hit me up for a verse on your album?

1154
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,100
Do you want it?

1155
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,100
Do you want to do it man?

1156
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,300
I'm making a rap album right now.

1157
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:15,100
It's it's it's pretty fly for a white guy. So if you want to jump on that, absolutely

1158
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:19,940
I mean, we do a party original shut up. No, don't fuck this up for me

1159
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:25,480
Can I'm the one who spit bars? I'm the one who spit bars cuz most of my homies locked behind him. Oh

1160
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:30,620
Shit, wait, let me show you guys a CD. I got real quick. Okay, I'll be right actually

1161
00:57:30,620 --> 00:57:35,120
I gotta take a I gotta take a hot frothy piss. Can I go do that and bring you the CD?

1162
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:40,380
Yeah, that's fine. Just do the normal show for a couple minutes. Okay, read the list. Yeah the list

1163
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:44,060
So what's up with you guys?

1164
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,300
Not much, what's up with you?

1165
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,300
I miss Matt dude.

1166
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,300
Can Matt just come back already?

1167
00:57:47,300 --> 00:57:52,820
It's Matt's gone and it's almost over.

1168
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:55,420
I'm just going to go grab my stuff downstairs.

1169
00:57:55,420 --> 00:57:57,460
Oh my god dude.

1170
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:59,460
You and Pat can have a nice conversation.

1171
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:01,100
Pat if you leave.

1172
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:02,660
I'm going to stay right here.

1173
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,880
Dude what if we just did the podcast you and me?

1174
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,880
We could.

1175
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,220
Would you be mad?

1176
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,420
No.

1177
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:11,060
What would you think about it?

1178
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,260
I would think we would betray Gabriel.

1179
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:20,340
It would be funny if they left and you just died immediately.

1180
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,340
I just did.

1181
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:22,340
You got pretty close.

1182
00:58:22,340 --> 00:58:23,340
I got killed with a sneeze.

1183
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,340
I think I'm sick.

1184
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,260
I think I might have COVID-19.

1185
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:27,260
You do?

1186
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:30,860
Well, I smoked too many cigarettes today.

1187
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,500
Well, there you go.

1188
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,500
There's your fucking problem.

1189
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,180
No, I don't think it's that.

1190
00:58:35,180 --> 00:58:36,940
No, cigarettes would never hurt me.

1191
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,700
No, dude, those are good for you.

1192
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:43,340
Dude, I'm disgusted by the smell of my own armpits.

1193
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,140
Is that a COVID-19 problem?

1194
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:46,140
No.

1195
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,140
What's that?

1196
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,140
When did you shower last?

1197
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:49,380
Like 15 days ago.

1198
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:52,780
Okay, well then it's probably, you're probably doing that.

1199
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:55,300
You sound like my mom right now.

1200
00:58:55,300 --> 00:59:01,420
I, look, I woke up immediately before this.

1201
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:02,420
I feel like crap.

1202
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:03,620
They got back at the same time.

1203
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,620
Wow, that's adorable.

1204
00:59:04,620 --> 00:59:07,380
You guys got back at the same time.

1205
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:08,380
Oh my goodness.

1206
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,380
Alright, show me this CD.

1207
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:10,380
Show me this fucking CD.

1208
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,580
Check it out, dude.

1209
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,380
This is Black Dave, Next Stop The Ghetto.

1210
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,260
Damn, that's good.

1211
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,780
Why is the bus on fire?

1212
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,860
A fan sent that yesterday.

1213
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,620
I listened to the whole thing today too.

1214
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,620
Is it sick?

1215
00:59:23,620 --> 00:59:25,140
Yeah, it's really good.

1216
00:59:25,140 --> 00:59:29,740
There's this one line, it's all very chill and stuff, but this one line where he just

1217
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:31,740
goes "I'm addicted to crack!"

1218
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,060
1998, dude.

1219
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,980
It's about honesty, dude.

1220
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,760
It's on Spotify, you guys should check it out.

1221
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:39,600
The album's next stop.

1222
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,740
- I think I'm gonna add that to my list.

1223
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:44,060
All right, I have to go take a big piss,

1224
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,540
but I'm not gonna leave in the middle of the show

1225
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,340
'cause I'm a professional, so I think we're gonna end it.

1226
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,600
- I'm a professional too, Caleb.

1227
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:51,740
I've done 221 episodes of my podcast.

1228
00:59:51,740 --> 00:59:54,500
- I've done 222 of your podcast, so.

1229
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,740
(laughing)

1230
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:56,780
- It's not even possible.

1231
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,340
- Easy. - I just did 223.

1232
00:59:58,340 --> 01:00:01,020
- I just did a 15th one, or 223th one.

1233
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:03,180
- 15? - I just did 15.

1234
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:04,660
Yeah, I just did 15.

1235
01:00:04,660 --> 01:00:06,140
- Another easy layup.

1236
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,140
Where did these come from?

1237
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:09,140
I don't know.

1238
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,140
What episode is this?

1239
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:11,140
This is...

1240
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,140
A fucking hundred and something?

1241
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:14,140
Oh god, what is this?

1242
01:00:14,140 --> 01:00:16,140
No, this is a premium, so it's fifty something.

1243
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:17,140
Fifty something of the premium?

1244
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,140
This is premium?

1245
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:19,140
Oh yeah.

1246
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:20,140
Yeah, if you couldn't tell.

1247
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,140
Uh huh.

1248
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,140
Is this one going?

1249
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,140
We don't bust out the Donald Trump impression on the normal episodes, dude.

1250
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,140
That's for the premium listeners.

1251
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:30,140
Hey, in one of my Minecraft Let's Plays, I did a lot of Donald Trump impressions and

1252
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:33,140
the comments were like, "Wow, I've never heard a Donald Trump impression before.

1253
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,140
Very funny."

1254
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:37,980
So now I keep them pulled back a little bit.

1255
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:40,340
We can't take that heat, so I hope people are nice to us.

1256
01:00:40,340 --> 01:00:41,340
They'll be great to you guys.

1257
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:42,340
They'll be great to you guys.

1258
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:48,820
You'll get a bunch of nice 16-year-old K-pop stans listening and going, "I can't believe

1259
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,060
that Patrick said the N-word."

1260
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,820
Well, we're going to cut that out.

1261
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:57,060
But if you're hearing that, it did happen.

1262
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,060
That's proof that it happened.

1263
01:00:58,060 --> 01:00:59,060
It didn't happen.

1264
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:00,060
No.

1265
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,060
It's proof that it happened.

1266
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:02,060
We cut it out.

1267
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,060
Yep.

1268
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:04,060
You said it again.

1269
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,860
- You gotta get me cut out again, fuck.

1270
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,500
- No, I didn't say it.

1271
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,380
- All right, thank you Matt.

1272
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:09,220
Thanks for coming on.

1273
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,420
- Hey, thanks for having me guys.

1274
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,220
Anytime, I love hanging.

1275
01:01:12,220 --> 01:01:13,780
Next time after COVID's over,

1276
01:01:13,780 --> 01:01:15,300
we'll get all you guys out to LA to come.

1277
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:16,140
- Definitely.

1278
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:17,220
- Yeah, let's make it happen.

1279
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:18,180
- Yeah.

1280
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:19,020
- Bye y'all.

1281
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:20,300
- We can go to Jollibee again.

1282
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,140
- Bye bye.

1283
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:23,140
- Bye, I'm gonna stop recording now.
