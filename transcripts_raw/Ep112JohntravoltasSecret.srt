00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:59,920
up we're making them do the ice bucket challenge to raise awareness for ALS

79
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,240
yeah yeah you know it's so funny have you ever seen videos of people being

80
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,320
Narcan'd yeah have you seen the one have you seen the one where the guy gets up

81
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,840
and he's like "you ruined my high!" and punches the guy that Narcan'd him in the nuts.

82
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,840
So good.

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Awesome.

84
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,640
For some reason everyone that gets Narcan'd gets mad.

85
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,280
Cause adrenaline.

86
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,280
Yeah.

87
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Yeah.

88
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,880
You're injected with fucking like speed.

89
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
I thought it was like smelling salts.

90
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,680
It'd be funny if you get Narcan'd and like immediately you wake up and you just try to

91
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,320
fuck the person that Narcan'd you.

92
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,520
Cause of the adrenaline.

93
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,160
That's just the first thing that everyone does.

94
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
You get a giant boner.

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
Yeah everyone who gets-

96
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Yeah hey man thanks for the boner.

97
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
Yeah that's part of-

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,160
And that's even fucking helping me out with it!

99
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,860
That's part of Narcan training is you have to cover your crotch and back away really quickly

100
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,160
because they're going to try to suck you off.

101
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,160
How about Narcan Sam?

102
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,160
Okay.

103
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
Yeah.

104
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,160
I don't remember what Toucan Sam sounds like.

105
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
He's like British, right?

106
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,560
He has a British voice and he has three nephews.

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
He's a great uncle.

108
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,560
All uncles are great.

109
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Wait a second.

110
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Uncle Sam.

111
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,560
Wow.

112
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Oh my god.

113
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
Multicolored on the beak.

114
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Joseph's multicolored coat.

115
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Stripes.

116
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
Have you seen the redesign of Toucan Sam?

117
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,960
I think I did.

118
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,960
Is he a girl now?

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,960
So with the fucking CalArt style?

120
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,960
Yeah.

121
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
Toucan Tim?

122
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:10,960
Let's talk about reboots again.

123
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
No.

124
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:12,960
They're rebooting cereal.

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
No!

126
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Yeah, and I was like, dude.

127
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
Just make a new Toucan cereal.

128
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
Yeah.

129
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,960
You guys learned that about me, and now you're never gonna get it about you.

130
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,960
That I don't like, that I'm annoyed by rebooting movies.

131
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,960
It's just a funny thing to be annoyed by.

132
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,960
Yeah, well, I don't know.

133
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Me, personally, I'm annoyed by it.

134
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,960
That's just one of the Twitter things to be mad about.

135
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
I get mad about that too.

136
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,960
That's just a thing where if you're on a certain part of Twitter, you get mad about rebooting movies,

137
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,960
about healthcare, and about kids who say the N-word getting put in jail.

138
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,960
Those are the three things you have to be mad about if you're on a specific subset of Left Twitter.

139
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
I get mad about women stealing our jobs.

140
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Women stealing all of our jobs.

141
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm trying to go back to the GMC factory.

142
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Guess what? They only hire women now.

143
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,640
Girls make cars factory.

144
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,460
Man.

145
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,300
(laughing)

146
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,360
That's fucking right.

147
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,200
Uh huh.

148
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,040
Yeah.

149
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,600
Man, at least we used to have fucking Jupiter.

150
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,880
They took that from us too.

151
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,720
Yeah man.

152
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,480
Now women are going to college and Jupiter.

153
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,760
Oh my god.

154
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,840
It's insane.

155
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,000
Fucking annoying dude.

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,960
It's so annoying.

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,280
Girls can't go to Jupiter.

158
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,240
They have to go to college to get more knowledge.

159
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,160
Yeah, 'cause they need it.

160
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,000
Girls go to--

161
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,480
Boys are too smart, that's why they go to Jupiter.

162
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,680
We go to Jupiter to get more stupidity

163
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,520
'cause we're too smart.

164
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,340
We donate the knowledge to the girls.

165
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,800
Girls go to the sun to--

166
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,240
Oh, let me donate some knowledge.

167
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,200
(laughing)

168
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,200
Real quick.

169
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,200
Just saying that to a homeless guy.

170
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,000
Listen, listen buddy, come here. I'm gonna kick you. I'm gonna donate you some knowledge.

171
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,200
This is the best change you'll ever get, alright? Change your life.

172
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:44,200
You gotta space in that empty guitar case for some knowledge.

173
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
'Cause I'm about to kick it to you, player.

174
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:48,200
What was that band, the guy?

175
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,200
HEDPE. They're sick, dude. It stands for Higher Education Planet Earth.

00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
Oh my god. Boss.

177
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,200
Yeah, there's like the video of them doing like a COVID live show so there's no one in the uh

178
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,320
there's no one in the audience and he's just going like "make some fucking noise"

179
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,680
and it's just completely silent and he's just going like like "9/11 was a fraud you have to go

180
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,520
on the internet that's the only place that can teach you the truth and I do not eat pussy that's just facts"

181
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:20,120
That's the best part of that video. So cool. We need to start a band soon. We got it. We will start a band.

182
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,040

183
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,520
band? The truth sayers we could be called the truth sayers movement. The truth sayers sooth

184
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,200
tellers. No because if we're gonna be a band like that we have to have an acronym. That's

185
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:38,960
true yeah. Yeah. PISS. But it has to be something like like if you say it's an acronym that's

186
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,880
a word but it's spelled wrong. Acquiring supernatural spirits. Yeah if it's like yeah that's pretty

187
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,600
good. That's a good one. But yeah it should be something where yeah it spells out like

188
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:49,880
big dick if you do all the first letters so and but they're called like badass

224
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,740
It's like mindfulness over--

225
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,460
Newgrounds.

226
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,580
Nefarious--

227
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,500
Evil.

228
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,060
Evil--

229
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,780
Yakuza.

230
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,280
Yakuza.

231
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:28,980
Yeah, dude.

232
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,860
Yeah.

00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,180
Pretty much, it's always like--

234
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:32,300
It's always like something--

235
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,660
Be an anti-Yakuza band.

236
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:34,580
Yeah.

237
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,580
Yo, just straight up the top.

238
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,580
Yakuza did 9/11.

239
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,580
Everything links back to the Yakuza.

240
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,580
It's true, man.

241
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
Yeah.

242
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,580
Start with Pearl Harbor.

243
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,580
Yeah. And if you come to my house, I will not call you an Uber home.

244
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,580
[laughter]

245
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
That's just facts.

246
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,580
That's just facts.

247
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,580
That's just facts.

248
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
I will not make you come.

249
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,580
And I close my eyes when I have sex.

250
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:59,580
I close my eyes and I count to ten.

251
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,580
I wear a mask during sex.

252
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,580
I wear a paper bag over my head.

253
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,580
Jim Carrey's face on my face.

254
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,580
We have to have a bassist who wears a paper bag with eye holes cut out.

255
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:18,580
So it's a Jim Carrey mask and then I put the mask over it.

256
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:21,580
So when you take the first one off you're like, "Oh, that's funny."

257
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
I'm having sex with Jim Carrey.

258
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
DJ Grinch Ventura.

259
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Oh my god.

260
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
That's our DJ.

261
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,580
DJ Grinch Ventura.

262
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,580
And then he takes the mask off and it's Travis Barker.

263
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,580
- Oh. - Yeah.

264
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,740
- We should, oh my God, we should do a Travis Barker remix

265
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,240
of the show, of the podcast. - He would remix the show.

266
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,360
He would do an album with us, a split.

267
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,800
- Like a drum, like when he used to put like drums

268
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,520
over lollipop by Lil Wayne.

269
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,680
- Yeah. - Yeah.

270
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,840
- God, that was so sick.

271
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,920
It was so cool. - We gotta get

272
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,360
Scott Storch on board.

273
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,360
- We gotta get, someone's gotta hop on this Scott Storch beat.

274
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,120
- Yeah. - Dude, he's looking good, man.

275
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,360
- We're gonna be the ones to do it.

276
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,280
We're gonna be the ones to hop on a Scott Storch beat.

277
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:02,680
This is for the first person to do it in 10 years.

278
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm ready.

279
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,920
I'm sure you could get a deal with Scott Storch.

280
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:07,440
Yeah.

281
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm so fucking tired now.

282
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,500
Are you?

283
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:09,920
I don't know why.

284
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,320
I was fine earlier today.

285
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,480
I think it was the skating.

286
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,640
You want to sip my bowl?

287
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,160
Maybe.

288
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,440
You want to sip my bully stick?

289
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,680
I'll sip the bowl.

290
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,760
I have more in there.

291
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,800
I'll just go get my own.

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,560
Go get your own.

293
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,000
Yeah, we can hold it down for a minute.

294
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Yeah, we got this.

295
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,840
Yeah.

296
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,080
Don't try to take your mic with you.

297
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,040
[SCREAMING]

298
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
Oh, no.

299
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,040
What's with Tron?

300
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,540
No!

301
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,540
I think Patrick died.

302
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,540
No one's telling a story that goes nowhere!

303
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:34,540
Where is he?

304
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:40,040
I was gonna drink some of yours and then I remembered that we were doing a pandemic.

305
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
We're doing a pandemic.

306
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,040
I remember that we did the pandemic.

307
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
I literally, I'm sleeping in your house.

308
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,040
It's different. We're social, we're distanced from you.

309
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
We spend two hours a day kissing.

310
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,540
No.

311
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,040
Yeah, we do.

312
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:50,540
Yeah.

313
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,540
I kiss Cameron more than you.

314
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:54,040
You're not social distanced from me. We keep fighting.

315
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,540
Yeah.

316
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,040
That's true.

317
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:01,040
We spent five hours in a car with the windows rolled up.

318
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Pat just thinks people are going to be mad that we're in the same room.

319
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,040
Yeah.

320
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,040
We spent so much time planning this and we all got tested.

321
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,040
People are going to be mad.

322
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,040
It doesn't matter if we post the results that say negative, people will be mad at us.

323
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
Yeah, let's get some hate for Patrick going.

324
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
No, that's the one thing that will just be bad for me.

325
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
That's the one thing you can handle?

326
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
One thing I cannot handle is hate.

327
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:33,840
hate. No, I only love love. Yo, MCMC one thing I cannot handle is hate. Yo, all the haters

00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:33,400
like a ten-year-old kid like rapping but they just like it's like he records like

339

two words at a time and then they stitch it together so it's just like the middle

340
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:40,320
of every word it just jumps to another word

341
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,560
(mimics rap music)

342
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,760

00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,000
(mimics rap music)

349
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,320

353
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,680
- It's like all of those--

354
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,360
- It's so funny how homophobic that song is, too.

355
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
- Yeah.

356
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,640
- The one with the five-year-old rapping.

357
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,480
- Oh, yeah.

358
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,300
(laughs)

359
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,140
- It's pretty sick, yeah.

360
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,940
Drop some words in there. Oh, he dropped some hard F's. Some hard F's. Yeah, strong F's.

361
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:27,940
Strong. Thrown and peppered into that one. Yep. Yeah. Oh my god. It needed some sort of perspective.

362
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:34,940
Wait, he says he's gonna send midgets to someone's house? Yeah, he's like, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna send, he also has a speech impediment.

363
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:39,440
Yeah. I'm going to send midgets to your mommy's house. Yeah. It's awesome. It's great.

364
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:46,300
But all those like fast rapping guys, they, all of their songs just sound, like to my mom, that's what like all rap sounds like.

365
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,940
Yeah, it's just like she turns on 50 cent and she's like

366
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:58,540
Is this Kanye West just here's Tasmanian devil, yeah, my mom thinks that

367
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:07,640
Every rapper that comes on the radio she thinks it's a jar rule. Really? Yeah, actually my mom thought Mambo number five was a jar rule song

368
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:15,020
Yeah, she was like yeah a little bit of mud that's that's his voice

369
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:23,240
So sick. God damn, Ja Rule's gonna drop a fucking Mambo No. 5 remix this year.

370
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,000
Mambo No. 6 dude. Yeah. He has one more woman. Yeah. It's so, Lubega's German.

371
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,180
Makes sense. Mambo No. 5 exists because like some German guy was like, "I'm going to bring

372
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,860
back swing music but rapping!" And it worked. It fucking worked. It was so ridiculous. Just

373
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,860
German, the German guys, German people are just like,

374
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:45,740
it was such a weird--

375
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,020
- There's something that pushes them to do,

376
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,740
to go above and beyond. - Do terrible things.

377
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:49,580
- Yeah.

378
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,620
- German people just do constantly terrible things.

379
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,820
- There's something uber about them.

380
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,660
- Yeah.

381
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,060
- It's crazy.

382
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,580
Yeah.

383
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,660
Yeah, it's funny, like the two big German songs

384
00:15:58,660 --> 00:15:59,820
in the past like 20 years,

385
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,220
or it's "Mamba No. 5" and "Ich bin Gummibär."

386
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,060
- Yeah.

387
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,900
- Remember that song?

388
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,300
♪ I'm a gummy bear ♪

389
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:12,020
you know did you know that the gummy bear the 3d gummy bear was actually he was

390
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,420
real accused of a John Travolta yeah I talked about that I was like three times

391
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,780
on the podcast yeah so fucking funny though he spent all his money

392
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,420
it was like money laundering there were like helicopter trips that were paid for

393
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,740
with the gummy bear movies like 3d budget and it was supposed to be his

394
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,060
whole family except for his kid that died his kid died yeah John Travolta's

395
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,620
autistic son died. Yo, my apologies to Mr. Travolta, man. I had no idea. There's conspiracies

396
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,620
that Scientology killed him, but I won't go into this. No, dude, he's just in space. They

397
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,460
put him in space. They just put him in space. He's having fun up there. Oh, his wife just

398
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,140
died. John Travolta's wife died too. Really? Yeah. She's in space too. No, they just sent

399
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,380
him to space. It's okay to joke about it because they're not dead, they're in space. That's true.

400
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,380
Yeah. It's true. They're dancing in a circle with lizards or something. They're doing whatever

401
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:03,300
Scientologists do. They're doing what drinking out of cups. They're smoking a USB stick and

402
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,460
listening to drinking out of cups. Drinking out of cups is what Scientologist Heaven looks like.

403
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,300
Yes. I used to work with this guy. Drinking out of cups inspired L. Ron Hubbard.

404
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,580
I used to work with this guy doing when I was did like glass shower door installation and his name

405
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:22,180
was Rocco and he was. His life was so modern. It was most modern life. He's just like Italian

406
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:27,060
dude from New York. Yeah. Who would just always tell me these stories about well one thing is he

00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,220
he would also sing all the time.

408
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,940
So like we'd be like going down the street

409
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,760
and he would just sing all the signs

410
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,720
that we would drive by.

411
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,860
He'd go, "Lada dee, lada doo,

412
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,120
"McDonald's on Market Street, ooh ooh ooh,

that's pet sounds

516
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,520
- The music blows my mind every time I listen to it, man.

517
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,360
- Yeah.

518
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,200
- There's an incredible elation you get.

519
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
- The fact that we can trap little guys

520
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,920
that sing inside of an earbud.

521
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,760
- I know, it's impressive.

522
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,080
- Little guys can sing in your computer

523
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,320
and they have one.

524
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,920
- They can put spirits into an AirPod now.

525
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,200
- It's impressive, dude.

526
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,920
- Yeah, they don't even have to use ghost technology.

527
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,000
- Yeah, they don't even need wires.

528
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,040
- They use ectoplasm.

529
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,640
- They don't even need wires to sing music.

530
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,200
- They shoot ghost slime from the little amputee stubs

531
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,240
on the end of the AirPod.

532
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,560
flies into your computer and it haunts the music and brings it back to you.

533
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:40,480
And you can get different musicians in your phone whenever you want. You don't

534
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,520
even have to download the musicians. Their AI consciousnesses have been

535
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,080
uploaded and they're singing the song every time you listen to it. Can't wait

536
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,680
till that actually happens. That will happen in one year. I can't wait till I go in there and meet

537
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:54,960
Katy Perry. Yeah. And I dress her with my mind. Yeah. I can't wait to crawl into my phone's

538
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,600
lightning port and hang out with the gorillas and their cartoon world. Whoa.

539
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,560
I would love to go to the plastic beach.

540
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,560
Inside the gorill- a Vice video, inside the gorillas cartoon world.

541
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,060
[laughter]

542
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:11,560
We sent a journalist to go to the cartoon lighthouse

543
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
and talk to the gorillas in their hometown.

544
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,560
You won't believe how they laughed.

545
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
[laughter]

546
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,560
Yeah, well we're gonna smoke weed with gorillas today.

547
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Right.

548
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,560
Right, well, I'm gonna smoke weed with a cartoon.

549
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:28,560
They sent Matty Matheson to make the gorillas a fuckin'

550
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,560
I'm gonna make him a great steak sandwich!

551
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
I'm gonna make a Spongebob burrito!

552
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:36,560
I'm making a great steak sandwich with Spongebob square pants today!

553
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
It's gonna be awesome!

554
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:42,560
I made Squidward nachos.

555
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,560
You know, Squidward, in Canada we don't have nachos like this.

556
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:49,560
It's okay, I have a Grateful Dead shirt on.

557
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:53,560
What's he saying that before doing it?

558
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,560
I don't know.

559
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:56,560
It's okay, I have a Grateful Dead shirt on.

560
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:59,160
I don't know. It's just I'm talking about Maddie Matheson.

561
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,160
You're doing a scary version of Maddie Matheson.

562
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,160
You're doing a scary, scary thing.

563
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,160
I'm Maddie Matheson and I'm gonna scare your kids!

564
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,160
Doing scary Matheson.

565
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,160
Yeah, that's Maddie's scary sin.

566
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:11,160
I'm gonna getcha!

567
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,160
Oh, I'm gonna getcha!

568
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,160

Somebody stop me!

571
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
It's kinda the same.

572
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,160
It kinda is doing the mask when I think about it.

573
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,160
Number two, nature will blow your mind.

comments on their path that's the only one close enough to the computer read it

580
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
It's poor engineering by us.

581
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Yeah.

582
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,240
Seeing an eagle fly, hearing the ocean roar, feeling the crisp cool air of autumn.

583
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,720
Whoa, is that, did you write that?

584
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,720
That's a poem.

585
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,560
Let's do some nature poems right now.

586
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:06,560
Nature poems?

587
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,560
Yeah.

588
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
Two, two big rocks.

589
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,560
Two giant birds.

590
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,560
Two giant breasts.

591
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,560
Flying like an eagle.

592
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,600
Sinking, soaring through the sky.

593
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,480
The ocean was filled with, the ocean was filled with a beautiful fish.

594
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,960
A fish called love.

595
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:26,640
I'm looking at the door open yeah I opened it with my mind

596
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,280

eagle they can't have sex until they're married one of they have no idea what

599
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,680
Pro-choice means life begins at conception.

600
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,520
That's my poem.

601
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,560
- Two little ants, so happy because they don't know

602
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,160
who Donald Trump is.

603
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,000
- That's right.

604
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,600
- Two ants who voted for Donald Trump, one giant shoe.

605
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,440
- Yeah.

606
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,260
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,100
- Did you guys ever set an ant on fire?

608
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,440
- That's the scariest six story, six sentence story.

609
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,760
- The six story sentence.

610
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,600
- You ever set an ant on fire?

611
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,240
- The six stories in one sentence.

612
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,400
I went to the store and the library and I saw a movie

613
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,840
and I played a video game and my brother was sick

614
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
And I played another video game.

615
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,840
That's six stories in one sentence.

616
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,840
That is pretty sad.

617
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,840
Did you guys ever set ants on fire?

618
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,840
No.

619
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,840
I tried to but it didn't work.

620
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,840
We didn't grow up like you,

621
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
like Sid from fucking Toy Story.

622
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
I just said I tried to.

623
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,840
Oh, hey, come on.

624
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,840
I tried to.

625
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
You interrupted me to say that I didn't do it.

626
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:33,840
I tried to with a magnifying glass.

627
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,840
You're speaking over PSE right now, person of Cameron.

628
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,840
And person of Caleb, come on.

629
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
Yeah, that's true.

630
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,840
Yeah.

631
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I was a...

632
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Person of C name.

633
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,560
I was like trying to with a magnifying glass when I was growing up and my grandma caught me and I thought she was gonna be mad

634
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,920
And she's like Jesus Christ. Why are you using a magnifying glass? Here just use my lighter

635
00:27:54,920 --> 00:28:02,040
She just started lighting ants on fire. God. Yeah, it's pretty cool, man. I never did that. Yeah, I burnt a $10 bill one time

636
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:07,120
I love to destroy life. I burnt a $10 bill cuz I wanted to see what happened money means nothing to this

637
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,480
Joker esque madman. He's on the fourth grade and I stole $10 from my parents and I went in the basement

638
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Damn, you burned your parents ten dollars?

639
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:14,980
Yep.

640
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,980
He burned his parents to the ground.

641
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,480
I did.

642
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:17,980
Yeah.

643
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:18,980
I burned, yeah.

644
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,480
God damn.

645
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
God damn, dude.

646
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
That shit's scary.

647
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,480
It lit up- money lights up really fast.

648
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
That's why they make it like that.

649
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,480
They do it on purpose so you can lose it easily and get it burned and it's gone.

650
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
It's actually one of the bigger conspiracies going on in the world.

651
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,480
When the money burns it respawns and dies in the president's pocket.

652
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:34,980
Yeah.

653
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:37,480
Money is uh, money is made out of cotton, right?

654
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I wouldn't know.

655
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Who just went ffff-

656
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
He did.

657
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Oh, okay, I couldn't tell.

658
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,480
Sorry, I'm eating some delicious air out of my mouth.

659
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,480
Yeah, you're eating air.

660
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
I made a big mistake.

661
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:59,480
In sixth grade, my science teacher did like a thing where he told us like, "Oh, like paper can't be magnetic," or something like that.

662
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,480
And then he like somehow made like a dollar magnetic.

663
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Scary.

664
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,480
And then he was like, oh, then the next day he came in.

665
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Man, that guy had telekinetics.

666
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,240
The next day we came in, then he explained to us that money is made out of like a cloth

667
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,240
paper mix and not just paper. Yeah, it has something else. It's not just paper. Then why didn't you ask the questions?

668
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,560
And it was supposed to be a lesson about how we're supposed to always ask questions when doing science.

669
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,560
Wow, but he just went off on like just like it just felt psycho. Wow

670
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:31,920
Yeah, it's a funny thing about being a teacher is you can just make up like anything

671
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,320
Yeah, I mean like you can just talk about whatever you want for an hour

672
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,760
It doesn't mean you do spend 10 years working on the book and then you just be like yeah science reminds me of my wife

673
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,600
Did your science teacher ever set a big fire on the like on the table?

674
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:46,960
No

675
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,600
my science teacher like poured

676
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:53,920
Some like hand sanitizer and like mix with something else on the table and set a big fire on the table and they would do that

677

That life.

698
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,200
- That is so true.

699
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,040

700
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,240

701
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,360
- Blue Dog Girl.

702
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,440
Is the dog blue or is the girl blue?

703
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,780
- Blue is a dog.

704
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,720
- Blue Waffle Girl.

705
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,560
- That's you.

706
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,120
- You were the Blue Waffle Girl.

707
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,320
- Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

708
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,520
Blue Waffle Girl.

709
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,720
- Yeah.

710
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,760
- Yeah, all right.

711
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,960
- To me, it looked pretty,

712
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,440
it kind of just looked like she took a shower.

713
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,280
(laughing)

714
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,240
The Blue Waffle.

715
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,080
You know what I mean?

716
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,920
- Yeah.

717
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:59,400
when I seen it. Yeah, you know, it's just like, uh, it's accessorized. Yeah, Cameron saw it and he said,

718
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:03,640
"It looks like mine." It's true. It did, yeah. Cameron said, "That looks like my mouth."

719
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:11,480
Yeah, that's right. Let's go! I think actually that might have been the first vagina I ever saw.

720
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,400
Me too. And I was like, "That's terrifying, like, that is so scary, like, thank God they don't all

721
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,560
look like that." And then I saw one in porn and I was like, "They kind of all kind of look like that."

722
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,400
(laughing)

723
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,240
- It kinda all looked a little weird.

724
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,480
- What was the, someone convinced like a senator

725
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:29,620
in like Baltimore to talk about it at like a meeting?

726
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:30,580
- It was you.

727
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,420
- It was you?

728
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,460
- No, you were the senator.

729
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:35,660
- I was the senator and I talked to the president.

730
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,460
- And you didn't need any convincing.

731
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,980
- No, he said, "Let me tell you about my favorite movie."

732
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,700
It's actually a picture called Blue Waffle.

733
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,860
- I held up a graphic of it and I pointed to it

734
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:45,960
on a slideshow.

735
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,820
- Yeah.

736
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,980
- I zoomed in more and more.

737
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,820
- You should change our logo to that.

738
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,020
We should change the podcast about list logo to the blue waffle.

739
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,020
Yeah.

740
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,020
Blue waffle logo.

741
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:00,340
We should change it to a picture of a literal blue waffle and say try to google this image.

742
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:04,420
I think somebody did that for dodgeball at my high school.

743
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,460
I think they tried to name their team blue waffle.

744
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
That's funny.

745
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Yeah.

746
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:12,200
Or trying to get one over on the teachers and naming my dodgeball team Pornhub.

747
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,700
They tried to name the dodgeball team.

748
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,140
They'll never know what this means.

749
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Team Ass Fuck.

750
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Yeah.

751
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
Got you bitch.

752
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,140
They had a name that was kinda-

753
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:23,140
Team that one video where the two girls drink poop out of a cup.

754
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
Yeah.

755
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,340
Hee hee hee hee hee.

756
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,700
Team collateral murder video from WikiLeaks.

757
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:35,900
No what the situa- I think it was somebody tried to name something like kinda like, like

758
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:40,820
it was an acronym that spelled out, oh no they weren't allowed to, they were gonna wear shirts

759
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:45,340
and then if they like stood close enough together it would just say like gay or something and

760
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,340
then they got in trouble for it.

761
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,340
That's pretty fucking funny.

762
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,340
Yeah it was pretty funny.

763
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,540
they were about to get really close to guys to make it happen so they were

764
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:58,700
about to get in trouble for it and then like they brought it up to the assistant

765
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:02,860
principal principal was walking down the hall

766
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,300
their heart their heart don't remember what the situation was all I remember

767
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,820
this close threat level on their hood was going up somebody snitched on a team

768
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,700
that was named og mud bone and our assistant principal had to look up a

769
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,580
picture of OG Mudbone in her office.

770
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,460
- Dude, he had the thing with him, dude.

771
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:22,780
- He had, you know he had that thing.

772
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,420
- Can we pause for one second, so I can pee?

773
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,260
- Yeah.

774
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,300
- Nice.

775
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,140
- Wow.

776
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,960
- And we're back.

777
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,800
- And we're back.

778
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,640
- Weiner just got amped.

779
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,460
Caleb weinered out.

780
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,300
- I just emptied my weiner.

781
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:33,260
- He just tinkled out his thing.

782
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,100
- I did what men do.

783
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,220
I did what's natural.

784
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,420
I did it like I do on the Discovery Channel.

785
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,740
I went to Patrick's bathroom,

786
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:41,020
I put a bunch of weiner stuff in the bathtub,

787
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,100
and I flushed it.

788
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:42,940
- No.

789
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:43,760
- Yeah, buddy.

790
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:44,600
- You didn't flush my bathtub.

791
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:50,240
I you why'd you put a flusher on it? He didn't want me flushing it. You're not supposed to touch that

792
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
I'm gonna crap in your bathtub

793
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,000
Don't I'm going to yeah, don't you know that flusher thing on the bathtub?

794
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,520
It takes everything from the bathroom and puts it right into Patrick's trough

795
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:06,740
That's how he loads his trough with oats. He's a repeat in a trough. Yeah. Yeah baseball games nice. I

796
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:12,280
Went to it like I think I have like once I went to this like when I was a kid my dad took us like

797
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:19,260
Like a speedway like a like a knockoff NASCAR thing. Yeah, and do a speedway gas station

798
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:24,900
You watch all the cars come in. He's like, well, this is NASCAR. It's just the tracks, but this is where they do the pit stop

799
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,260
And now realizing my dad was just there to like gamble. Yeah, like one of the fucking crank heads

800
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:33,260
it was driving, but there was no barrier between

801
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,060
the people in the audience and the cars and

802
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:44,500
They were going insanely fast on like a dirt road and also it was completely allowed for you to walk

803
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:50,460
Onto the racetrack in the middle of the race and to get to the middle part if you wanted to be there cuz that's cool, too

804
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:56,180
So like we were just like like he was like, okay. All right boys. Wait, wait, okay

805
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:00,260
Run run run run run and we just ran before we got destroyed by

That's what they say.

910
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,940
That's what those guys are like.

911
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,940
My beans from the Red Arrow Diner were delicious.

912
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,940
It really was an honor to eat Adam Sandler's beans.

Yeah. Those are his beans.

915
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:07,940
There's a big warehouse behind the diner that's labeled

916
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,940
"Sandler's Beans".

917

938
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:44,500
Have you guys used a weighted blanket?

939
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,340
- No.

940
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,420
- My younger sibling has one and I tried it one time

941
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,300
and I just felt like I couldn't breathe.

942
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,140
- Yeah.

943
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,100
- Not nice. - If you're claustrophobic,

944
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:51,940
the weighted blanket's the worst thing.

945
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,020
- If you're extremely weak and brittle,

946
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,420
I can imagine it would hurt you.

947
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,880
- It doesn't hurt, it's just like,

948
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,060
I mean it's just like you're lying down

949
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,180
and there's stuff stacked on you.

950
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:00,220
Like you wouldn't wanna lie down

951
00:45:00,220 --> 00:45:02,060
with a pile of books on you.

952
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,340
- I go to bed every night with a microwave on my head.

953
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,180
- Yeah.

954
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,020
(laughing)

955
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:06,840
- Yeah.

956
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:07,780
- Dude, I'm training my sleep.

957
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,500
- I'm just comfortable that way, okay?

958
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,340
- Now, if you sleep with the weighted blanket--

959
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:13,060
- You're extremely strong in your dreams.

960
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,400
- Yeah, no, you sleep with a weighted blanket,

961
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,780
then when you have a nightmare and you sit straight up,

962
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:17,620
you're gonna be sitting up,

963
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,580
you're gonna be able to sit up really fast.

964
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,420
- That's right, yeah.

965
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,260
- You hear an intruder, you're out of bed and in a jiffy.

966
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,100
- Yeah.

967
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,940
- Oh man, imagine having an intruder in your house

968
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:26,260
with a weighted blanket.

969
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:27,580
- You could hit 'em with a weighted blanket.

970
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,420
- That's true.

971
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,860
- You can put it on them,

972
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:31,740
and then they fall asleep 'cause they're so comfortable.

973
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,860
- If you put it into a ball, the weighted blanket,

974
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,700
if it's heavy enough, you throw it.

975
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:37,580
- It would weigh 100 pounds.

976
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,020
- Yeah, 100 pound weighted blanket,

977
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:40,380
you throw that at someone's head,

978
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,000
snap their head off. Would you like to have like a million pound weighted

979
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,680
blanket? Yeah. It has to be something that can at least lift off of me. How much does that be?

980
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:56,400
Probably like five pounds. I think a normal blanket is five pounds. Five pound

981
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,560
blanket? Yeah. I don't think so. Like a down comforter? With like a duvet cover?

982
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:07,800
Absolutely. No, not five pounds. That's like insanely light. I would bet my life at five

983
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:12,760
pounds no I found Google had to Google down down how much is it down comforter

984
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:19,560

985
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:24,560
much does a how much is a pound of feathers no not a blanket a down come

986
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,200
for a down comforter a blanket is not gonna do anything from five to thirty

987
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,040

Give me the fucking keyboard dude.

00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
I'm bypassing the pain.

993
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Come on.

994
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,560
Blanket weight, is there a maximum limit?

995
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,560
This is about weighted blankets Patrick.

996
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,560
This is not what we're talking about.

997
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,560
Selecting a weight for an adult's blanket.

998
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,560

00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:58,560

00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:02,560
50 pound weighted blanket.

1002
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,020
How much does it down comfort away? What does it say?

1003
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,820
You're so clean and cleaner. You're swirling to find the correct the first one first fucking one dumbass

1004
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:20,300
First one nine pounds. Let me see it a queen size a blanket could never be nine pounds unless it was weighted

1005
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:25,520
It says it's nine pounds. No, that's the box that it comes in. Yeah. No, no, it's not

1006
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:32,600
Yeah, it is. I'm right. They ship it with a lot. You guys are heavily overestimating how much five pounds is yeah

1007
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,280
Yeah, your your phone is like

1008
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:43,480
A feather is zero pounds. Okay, no matter how many fucking feathers you put in a blanket. It's not gonna weigh five pounds

1009
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:44,780
It's gonna be zero

1010
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,780
You're stupid and you're wrong

1011
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:53,740
The skin of the blanket might weigh half a pound. Wrong. Keep saying this if you have a full diaper

1012
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,900
You bitch. You kept saying it. What are you doing DreamWorks face?

It's just like a gory, it's like one of the goriest animes.

1026
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:44,740
I saw a video that was called the top 5 goriest animes.

1027
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:45,740
It was in my recommended.

1028
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,900

00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:55,940
I can't handle like any gore in movies anymore.

1034
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:56,940
I've wrapped back around.

1035
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:58,180
I can handle it as a kid.

1036
00:48:58,180 --> 00:48:59,660
There was a movie I watched, Revenge.

This is the first time in a while that gores made me nauseous.

1040
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:09,180
There's a scene where a guy steps on a big piece of glass and he has to reach inside

1041
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,780
his foot to pull the glass out.

I didn't go into a plane until I was 18 years old.

1127
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,760
- There's a video game called the 30 Flights of Loving

1136
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:38,160
So let's keep that in mind.

like there's the two robots that were the radio ones,

1223

It was just like,

1228
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:26,540
I don't even remember what the joke was anymore,

1229
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:28,660

1230
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:30,260
yeah, man, we just,

1231
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:32,420
for some reason, two black robots.

1232
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,820
All the other ones were like, hello.

1233
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:36,720
and they're like "man what's up with the, with the, with the septicons man"

1234
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,220

1263
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:38,360
do look up there. Sometimes I look up at space and I'm thinking, "Hmm, there's so many

1264
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:43,920
little stars." God, you would not believe your eyes, dude. You wouldn't believe how many stars there are in the

1265
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:53,720
space ship. Oh, their names were Skids and Wheelie. Oh my god. Skids and Wheelie?

What the fuck were you thinking Michael Bay?

1269
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:15,240
It's so funny how good of like a character story like Michael, or Megan Fox's character,

1270
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:18,040
like a backstory Megan Fox's character has in that movie.

1271
00:59:18,040 --> 00:59:22,480
And then it's just, while she's explaining like, yeah I learned how to do cars on my own,

1272
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:27,480
and then the whole movie is just like, every shot is just Shia LaBeouf being like, "I'm

1273
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,320
(laughing)

1274
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:29,160

- Whoa, you got big ol' boobs!

1279
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,360
- No, I'm trying to figure out what her boobs are.

1280
00:59:36,360 --> 00:59:37,560
(laughing)

1281
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,000
No, listen man, if you take,

1282
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,840

1283
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,660
- No, seriously.

1284
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,480
- He's so good in those movies, he's so fucking funny.

1285
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,840
- Dude, he's one of the best actors.

1286
00:59:43,840 --> 00:59:44,680
- I love those movies.

1287
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:45,520

1288
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,440
- Shia LaBeouf rocks.

1289
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:47,280
- Yeah.

1290
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:49,520
- Now, seriously, mom, I'm not having sex with her right now,

1291
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:52,000
okay, you just need to back up out of my space.

1292
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,840
He just does that 100 times every movie.

1293
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:58,120
That's like the period after Viva La Bam

1294
00:59:58,120 --> 01:00:01,240
where every mom in every movie was just April Margera.

1295
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,080
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1296
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:02,920
- It's true. - They all just

1297
01:00:02,920 --> 01:00:04,560
pretended to be April.

1298
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:06,640
There was seriously, every mom--

1299
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:10,120
- 2007, 2006 to 2008.

1300
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:10,960
- They're just pretending to be April.

1301
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,360
- That was the April Margera mom period.

1302
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,480
- Exactly, yeah.

1303
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:15,520
'Cause it was like, oh, we found the perfect mom.

1304
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:16,520
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1305
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,840
- Seriously, that's like the best mom archetype.

1306
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:19,960
- She's so good. - April Margera.

1307
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:26,600
I did a Jackass 1 rewatch recently. Couldn't even get through it at one point.

1308
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:36,840
When Steve-O does the snot on the Wasabi Snooter and he puts his snot and eats the vomit sushi.

1309
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,160
Yeah.

1310
01:00:37,160 --> 01:00:40,760
I just turned it off, dude.

1311
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,680
Jackass 1's the best one.

1312
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,800
It's definitely the best one, yeah.

1313
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:46,200
Because that's when they were on the most painkillers.

1314
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:46,600
Oh, yeah.

1315
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,400
Because they were so young.

1316
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:52,160
yeah the better the alligator tightrope is on the final we're gonna
