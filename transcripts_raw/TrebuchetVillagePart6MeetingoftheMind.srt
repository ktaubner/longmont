[Music]

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Last time on Trebuchet Village.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Our heroes finally bested the terrible Kitsunes, the clown Sasquatch, and the jester himself once and for all.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It was a long, hard-fought battle, but the win was secured by some clever use of fog, some well-placed arrows, and powerful thunks with a big shovel.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,200
Afterwards, the gang freed the Kugler elf slaves and returned to the White Woman of the

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,920
Woods, where she named a pond, sort of after the brave adventurers who freed Whippet Woods

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,440
of its jester menace.

8
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,320
There was drinking, limbo, dancing, singing, and even a wedding.

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,880
While the festivities raged on, the world took notice, in some small, irreversible way,

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:57,480
of the impact Dogen, Patric, and Evil have had on the ye olde planet E-Bow.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,340
Once they left the woods, the boys were faced with the awesome sight of their beloved Terrafire

12
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,100
Kingdom in the silhouette of a one-claw castle.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:11,720
However, with the sudden disappearance of Mount Honestoodle, an unease fell upon the party,

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,360
but nevertheless they persisted.

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,280
Due northeast, specifically, towards Trebyshe village, but also a little bit towards the

16
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,920
disputed part of the Terrafire Kingdom.

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,220
While the west of the trebuchet landmass is largely left alone, and the south unexplored,

18
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,280
the east in large part belongs to the Terrafire Kingdom.

19
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:36,800
However, where the north contends with scaredy cats and brave lions, among other things of

20
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,360
course, the east contends with those who disagree with King Nardwar's leniency towards the

21
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
scaredy cats.

22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,240
Sure, there is dissent across the kingdom in one small way or another, but the east lies

23
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:56,460
in the city of Galgadot, a bastion for all the most vile of the kingdom, and the rise of

24
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:01,840
a new lord who wishes to challenge King Nardwar. But Galgadot is quite far out, and although

25
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,160
its reach can be felt where our heroes are, it's nothing they need to concern themselves

26
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,120
about right now. In fact, what they should be concerning themselves with is that they've

27
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,920
been traveling for three days and haven't seen a soul. The road ahead and its signs do

28
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,320
suggest that there are some small towns nearby, but the lack of any other travelers and the

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:26,080
hours spent hunting and gathering food can be tiresome. Here's hoping the future brings

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,760
something more substantial to eat and to do as they get closer and closer to their home.

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:42,000
So yeah, you guys have been traveling to Northeast with you, you all, Sullivan, and Prince Jumanji

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,500
for a little bit of time now.

33
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,740
And you followed signs that have like sort of pointed to this town

34
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,900
or that a town, but

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,440
they're all always like another day out.

36
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,580
And so it's been like a pretty long journey so far.

37
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,440
But what have you guys how's the journey been?

38
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,500
What were you guys up to in those three days?

39
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,980
How did you guys spend your time?

40
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,780
I'm curious.

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,580
I was looking for a hotel

42
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,940
the whole time I'm looking.

43
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:10,540
Is there anywhere anywhere around here I can find it?

44
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,140
Dad, I just want to I want to sit in a sauna real quick.

45
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,400
I just want to get in a steam bath.

46
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,380
I don't I don't know why why we would ever

47
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,640
I would ever not stop somewhere that has at least a three star hotel.

48
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:29,880
I am. So, you know, there is the big Sullivan wedding thing that happened.

49
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,240
That's the elephant in the room.

50
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,880
But we don't remember it, right, because we got we had too much juicy juice.

51
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,480
Yes. But here's I.

52
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,900
I keep noticing that whenever I get close to Sullivan,

53
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:42,900
I get an AC buff.

54
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,900
Yeah, that's what they call it, huh?

55
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,900
Yeah, and I'm still, yeah, so my armor hardens a bit.

56
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
Yeah.

57
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,900
And I'm starting to piece together what happened.

58
00:03:52,900 --> 00:04:00,900
Because I, and I'm also noticing that I'm missing, I was missing a spell slot, and I was thinking, which spell did I prepare that could have been missing?

59
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:06,900
And I'm walking like a goat trying to get as many blisters as I can.

60
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:07,900
as I can.

61
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:12,620
It's like walking like fucking with

62
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,620
fucked up feet.

63
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,220
It's like, oh,

64
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,260
fuck. Yes, I have hooves.

65
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,740
If they had soft feet and blisters

66
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,740
all fucking time.

67
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,780
I'm just walking around.

68
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,100
Yeah, good.

69
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,820
I'm walking like if a spider had two

70
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,420
legs, I'm pulling like a big,

71
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,940
big chunk of my ball

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,820
skin and just wiping, just

73
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,780
patting down my forehead.

74
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,320
Mm hmm. Is it porous?

75
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,880
My ball skin? Yeah. Can it accept water?

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,220
I don't know.

77
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,980
Well, I mean, I'm finding out right now.

78
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,180
Is your are your balls porous and can they accept water?

79
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,680
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I can.

80
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,820
Here, let me spit on him.

81
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,980
OK, hold on. Let me make kind of like a.

82
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,080
OK, I'm going to rub it in after he spits on it just to see if it gets absorbed.

83
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,780
Yeah, go ahead. I don't I don't mind.

84
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,480
All right. I'm OK. Here we go.

85
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,220
Now I'm going to scrub it with this with my toothbrush.

86
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,560
Now, don't no, don't do that.

87
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,000
Anybody got some orange juice?

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,500
We can see if it will saturate.

89
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,200
We haven't seen we haven't had anything.

90
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,160
What do you mean orange juice?

91
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,800
Guys, we have to keep going.

92
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,840
I mean, crazy juice.

93
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,240
We're still we're still we're still walking.

94
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,980
We're doing this while we're walking.

95
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:29,580
OK, you don't have to be such a stick in the mud about it.

96
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,580
Do you think there's no such thing as oranges?

97
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:34,820
You guys, you guys argue like a married couple or something.

98
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:35,700
Y'all are weird.

99
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,760
And yeah, it's like you've known each other forever.

100
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,640
And you've been married forever.

101
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,200
That's weird.

102
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,540
I see some kind of tension between you two.

103
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeah. Yeah.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,040
You know, lately, I don't know what I don't really know what what went down

105
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,080
that that night that we all had more.

106
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,180
We all had juicy juice.

107
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,620
But strangely, I'm not interested in Sullivan anymore at all.

108
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,320
for some reason because of some event that happened,

109
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,080
I don't feel any more attraction towards him.

110
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,160
And in fact, I hate him a little bit now,

111
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,160
which is strange, but-

112
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,080
- I mean, saying this right in front of me kind of hurts,

113
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,760
but on the other hand, honestly, not gonna lie,

114
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:17,320
bitter relief was a little weirded out.

115
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:20,280
And I respect you sort of speaking openly about this.

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,120
- Will you shut up?

117
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,600
Oh my God, this guy doesn't stop yapping.

118
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,560
- Oh, okay.

119
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,520
All right, now I'm in trouble 'cause I talk too much, right?

120
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,520
is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there is there

121
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:41,520

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,520

124
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,680
one inch taller. No, they also said that the rock I was standing on technically didn't

125
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,680
have any.

126
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,380
Okay, no, but does it doesn't even make any sense. No way. I don't and that elf and that

127
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,960
elf was a was just a was a and don't get mad at me when I say you were shifty. Don't say

128
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,280
it's like a racist thing because it's not. Oh, I don't have to say it. I mean, I think

129
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:18,540
we're going on. Okay. I think he's done. Are you guys done with this? I wish I could be

130
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,820
done with this freak.

131
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,460
Okay, I'm walking a bit ahead of you.

132
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,460
Yeah, let's-

133
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,140
Until you cool off!

134
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,620
Let's separate you two.

135
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,100
We'll figure this out later.

136
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:35,140
I keep flat-tiring him over and over.

137
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,140
When he walks out of the-

138
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,620
Prince Kibaji's like, "Please, mom, dad, stop fighting!"

139
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,100
And now he called you mom and dad.

140
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,100
I wanna live with Dogen!

141
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,100
What does that mean?

142
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,700
Now let's unpack this here.

143
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,220
Let's talk about this.

144
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,620
So the boy called you mom and dad.

145
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,020
So which one of y'all's mom?

146
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,060
Yeah, which one is the mom and which one is the dad?

147
00:07:54,060 --> 00:08:00,060
And to that one, hello.

148
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,460
It sort of keeps changing.

149
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,260
I'm having a little bit of trouble.

150
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,300
Yeah, well, I didn't ask you.

151
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,300
Oh, okay.

152
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:12,900
I was asking the mom and dad.

153
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,620
So I don't think there's any mom and dad here.

154
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,380
So you know, right?

155
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:23,460
Well, it seems like maybe there's maybe it's more of a situation where there's a man and

156
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
a coward.

157
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:31,060
Okay, well, I would be honored to be to be the parent of a noble prince, my Prince Jumanji.

158
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,780
Then go ahead and have fun with it.

159
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,780
You know what?

160
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,620
That's that's father material right there.

161
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:38,100
That's the father in the frog has stepped up.

162
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Yeah, Daddy.

163
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,100
That's right.

164
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:44,900
You know, and there's a lot of literature out there that says, oh, frogs be like this.

165
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,860
You know, we know how to step up and I'm just so tired of that.

166
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm just tired of this shit.

167
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,300
Where the fuck are we going?

168
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,700
Oh, hold on. Hold on.

169
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,960
There's I've I've actually contacted somebody that I know.

170
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,400
Through what? Through what?

171
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,900
What are you talking about?

172
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,560
What the fuck are you on about?

173
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,260
Through magic.

174
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,300
You don't have a magic nothing.

175
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:10,360
Through magic, I've contacted somebody I know to administer a paternity test.

176
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,840
Now I think I want to want to just

177
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,940
I want to ask, are you ready to see the results, Sullivan?

178
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,020
Are you ready to see the results?

179
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,340
We didn't even take none of his calm.

180
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,580
It's the worst paternity test I've ever seen.

181
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:26,140
Are you ready to see the results?

182
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,300
Yeah, I think so.

183
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,460
All right. Sullivan.

184
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,140
You are not the father.

185
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,580
OK, honestly, kids cute, but huge relief.

186
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:42,380
Also, I feel like I'm just coming up with W's today.

187
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,700
Didn't we meet his dad?

188
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,860
Hey, you hear that Prince Jumanji?

189
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,980
Sullivan was really relieved to find out he wasn't your dad.

190
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,780
Yeah, did you see him?

191
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,100
Look at him, he's

192
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,100
he's spinning on his head.

193
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,380
Well, now he's crying because of what you said.

194
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,180
That's not what I said was what you did.

195
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,420
I'm just being honest with my emotions.

196
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,460
I just said what you did.

197
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:03,060
So it's like I didn't say anything at all.

198
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,420
It's like you just did something.

199
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,700
So this goes on for like another hour.

200
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,660
Yeah, it is a mistake.

201
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:13,200
I think we're drifting into Little Miss Sunshine territory right now.

202
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,400
We should keep walking.

203
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,560
We can't guess it, by the way.

204
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,100
We we've had a long rest since the last.

205
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,060
Oh, yes. You guys are all healed up on everything.

206
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:25,960
But yeah, so there's been a lot of bickering, a lot of confused children,

207
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:31,860
a lot of paternity tests, multiple paternity tests, magical paternity tests.

208
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,960
And you finally stumble across the first people that you haven't

209
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,420
that you've seen in a while.

210
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,700
And you see a sign as well that says this way to the

211
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,700
the strange penis in

212
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,060
great, great a hotel.

213
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,520
I'm so happy to finally find a hotel.

214
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,760
Yeah. And the people you see

215
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,920
you recognize from the distance that you're at

216
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,160
that they have brave lion emblems on them.

217
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:08,160
So in case you guys don't remember, the brave lions are

218
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
A band of scaredy cats who are trying to take down the.

219
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,560
The terror fire, whoa, and me, apparently the terror.

220
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,820
I attacked by one in the woods, right?

221
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:23,020
You got attacked by Gufus Tiedrich, who was sort of hired by contract on them.

222
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:27,020
So that's all you know about them right now.

223
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:33,820
There was a little scene that you guys know about of there being a bounty on you.

224
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:37,060
But you guys, the characters don't know about that.

225
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:41,560
But you do see them ahead of you.

226
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,620
But I want to tell you guys,

227
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,560
I'm going to avoid them.

228
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,160
I'm going to flip them off. Yeah.

229
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,960
Do they have like jackets that have like their names on the back?

230
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:57,200
Like they're just the name of the group and or.

231
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,720
Yeah, yeah.

232
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:01,160
Kind of like an old like kind of like an old 50s, like like tunnel snakes.

233
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,560
Yeah. Are they?

234
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,820
They're kind of like gatekeeping the hotel.

235
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:11,820
No, they're just sort of, they're not near the, the inn isn't right in sight. It's just

236
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:18,220
like a point, like inn is in like X amount of miles. It's like within the day's journey,

237
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:25,620
but they are around that sign where like merchants would normally gather around signs like that

238
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,180
because it's where people would stop off or something, but they are there instead and

239
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,300
And they're just sort of like have set up what little camp they happen or just sort of milling about.

240
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,380
They don't seem to have noticed you yet.

241
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,420
But if you guys want to, like, flip them off or do whatever you want, you certainly can.

242
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,460
I walk up to one of them, I say.

243
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,380
Hey, you. Your shoes untied.

244
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,420
Not seriously, your shoes untied.

245
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,500
Your shoes are not now.

246
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,180
I mean, two people have said it now, so it's got to be you've got to have some merit.

247
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,020
Just look down at it.

248
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,060
Hey, hey, you dropped your pocket and you dropped your pocket.

249
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:02,980
Yeah.

250
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,120
That one. What are you what are you eating under there?

251
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,060
And I well, let me just do this in order.

252
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,020
One second.

253
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,380
So he looks down.

254
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:18,260
He's like, well, my shoes aren't untied and I don't I don't think I have any.

255
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:22,020
I don't know. My pockets seem underwear.

256
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:24,080
Oh, fuck. OK.

257
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,080
Now it's I use.

258
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,760
I use I use thaumaturgy to make my voice three times as loud and I say

259
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,760
"YOU SAID IT UNDER A LADDER"

260
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:39,520
You see Sullivan sort of running to you guys guys stop let's just sort of move on here all right

261
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:46,240
let's not antagonize this guy. Hold on Sullivan. Hey. Hey. Yeah hey what's going on?

262
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:54,000
Come here for a second gotta tell you something. Okay sure. He starts to wander over kind of

263
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,640
of suspiciously at this point.

264
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,000
Hey, guess what?

265
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,480
What?

266
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,360
Chicken, but.

267
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,800
Oh, my God, he's dead.

268
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,000
Oh, he dies.

269
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,880
Oh, fuck.

270
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,520
Oh, no.

271
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,520
He's like, all right, why don't you guys piss off?

272
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,000
All right.

273
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,280
We're on official brave line business here anyway.

274
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,040
What business? What's your business?

275
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:32,400
Nope, you fool me once, you know, the rest of it.

276
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,680
Yeah, your business smells a little bit like up dog.

277
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:42,560
And you see some of them start to turn around, especially after

278
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,440
Dogen said, use said underwear like, like as loud as hell.

279
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,960
And you see one of them turned around and he has like, he sort of has like the same haircut as Guile

280
00:14:54,960 --> 00:15:02,560
from Street Fighter. And he has this like, just this like awful like flat British guy face.

281
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:10,880
He's a wood elf of some sort. And he looks at you guys, and then you see him look at a piece of

282
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:18,800
paper and then look up at you guys, and then look at a piece of paper. And he sort of signals to the

283
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:25,800
the other ones and they all sort of knock their arrows and you see that's this yeah you guys

284
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,760
see that you guys see all knock their arrows you see that guy go up to you all and say

285
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:36,360
what do you think you're doing here you're wanted by the brave lions turn yourselves

286
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,120
in and come quietly or we'll have your heads where the where yeah we're on our way to a

287
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:53,560
the

288
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,920
what you're talking about.

289
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,100
What suck on nuts off.

290
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,460
Get them and yeah, roll initiative.

291
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,740
How many of them are there?

292
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,800
Five thousand.

293
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,700
Yeah, there's now there's like five.

294
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:13,880
I feel like this is the most pointless fight we've ever done in the history

295
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,280
of our D&D camp is.

296
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,080
I got a twenty one and then I said there was truly no reason for you guys

297
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,780
to start this fight at all.

298
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,080
We didn't start a fight.

299
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,080
We were just talking.

300
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,800
Yeah, the other one who knocked their arrows.

301
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,800
Look, we were...

302
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
That is true.

303
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
We were...

304
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,320
You said that we didn't know the bounties, so what are we gonna do?

305
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
That's true, you didn't know the bounties.

306
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,800
I guess you're right, you guys played as the arrows would.

307
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,440
We were all orderingly and we were all very upset from a long days of travel.

308
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:40,440
Yeah.

309
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,560
No, I mean, that's true.

310
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,240
I know that for a fact.

311
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,640
Yeah, plus you're the guy who put them there.

312
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,640
I did for a...

313
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,640
Yeah.

314
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Hold on.

315
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,640
Fuck you!

316
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Stop!

317
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,480
pointing fingers anywhere.

318
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,440
All right.

319
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,540
That's the worst thing you could do is blame it on one person

320
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,680
rather than you three. Right.

321
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,120
You know what I'm saying?

322
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:01,920
I think it's your fault.

323
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,940
I think. Yeah.

324
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,320
No, that's not my fault.

325
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,720
OK, what's the order?

326
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,120
Oh, sorry. Yeah.

327
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,420
Patrick Yoda is definitely going to go first with that sweet, sweet 21.

328
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:17,980
After that, it's going to be these brave lions.

329
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,580
They have pretty good decks.

330
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,580
Do they attack as one?

331
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,580
Uh, well, there's just gonna be a bunch of them attacking.

332
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:28,580
And, like, we're gonna have, like,

333
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,580
kind of, I split them into groups, so,

334
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:33,580
there's one group of Brave Lions that goes second.

335
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:36,580
Then, Blowtoss, oh, whoops.

336
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,580
And they've, like, cornered us, right?

337
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,580
They're not cornered, no, you guys are, like,

338
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,580
you guys are, like-- Like, we're surrounded, or cornered?

339
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,580
You're not surrounded, you're not surrounded.

340
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,580
You're not surrounded, yeah. They're, they're, like,

341
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:49,580
sort of in, like, a, like, just a bit of a jumble in front of you.

342
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:51,580
Okay, so like, Final Fantasy style?

343
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,580
Yes, that's a good way of putting it.

344
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Yeah, uh, yeah, uh...

345
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,580
You're all gonna take turns, it's gonna be very similar.

346
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,580
Okay, I've got an idea.

347
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,580
Yeah, yeah, then it's gonna be Dogen, sorry.

348
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:07,580
Then it's gonna be the remaining Brave Lions.

349
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,580
Um, then it's gonna be, uh, Ray, William Johnson...

350
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,580
Fuck me!

351
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,580
What? My name is Evil Stievel!

352
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,580
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, 'cause we just did...

353
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,100
did something. Can you at least put a birthday cake somewhere in this area? I will. Wait,

354
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:34,460
why? I'm hungry. I'll figure something out. And then Sullivan is last. Yeah, wait, it's

355
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:41,460
Dogen's birthday on this in-game day. I just want to specify that right now. Yes. And the

356
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,860
Brave Lions would know that because it would be listed on the bounty, so they would go easy

357
00:18:44,860 --> 00:19:04,340
on

358
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
on him it's his birthday.

359
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:10,340
Hey the others all nod and go "oh yeah of course, of course"

360
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,340
Well I'm glad you respect his birthday.

361
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Yeah I sit down and-

362
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,340
I'm gonna say that right off the top of the bat.

363
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,340
Real good move by you guys, honestly I think maybe we could talk this out.

364
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:27,340
Yeah, I lie down and I cross my legs and put my helmet over my eyes like Tom Sawyer style.

365
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:33,340
Yeah that fence sure does look like it might be fun to paint.

366
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:35,340
*laughter*

367
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,340
Uh yeah, you're up though Patrick.

368
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,340
Uh, right, so...

369
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Why don't we just stop this...

370
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,340
this fight right now.

371
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,340
We all get together,

372
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,340
and we sing, uh, we sing "Happy Birthday"

373
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,340
for our friend, uh, Dogen here.

374
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,340
You turn yourselves in,

375
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,340
we can stop this fight right now!

376
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,340
Not now, hold on, we don't even know what the hell

377
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,340
that's about.

378
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
You're wanted for the murder of Goofus Teetrich.

379
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,840
Who's that? We killed like a million people, man.

380
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,840
Yeah, we've killed we've killed so many more people.

381
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:12,840
We pretty much kill people like every 10 or 15 minutes at this point.

382
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:16,540
Yeah, we're kind of we're kind of like a crew of puckish rogues.

383
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:21,040
This was a valuable bounty hunter.

384
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,640
Part of the brave lions.

385
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,080
I bet you didn't know that he actually had a bounty out on him.

386
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,640
Yeah. And we and that's why the pedophile hunters club.

387
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,920
Yeah, he was a serious freak.

388
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,680
Which is what we're a part of.

389
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,960
Yeah, look, we try to overlook his proclivities.

390
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,040
I'm just kidding in character.

391
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,360
There's no way.

392
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:51,040
Don't joke about that in character because that's a very serious thing we're about.

393
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,760
We're very serious about pedophile hunting and,

394
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,640
you know, we will not appreciate if you make jokes about our profession.

395
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,640
Yeah, we might have to take out a bounty on you.

396
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,140
Yeah, we might put a bounty on you.

397
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,640
I'm no nonce!

398
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,640
Also, if we do a single point of damage to you, you are officially a pedophile.

399
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,640
That is not, no, 'cause that, no, is not true.

400
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,640
I'm pretty sure.

401
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,640
I wouldn't push your luck if I was you.

402
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,640
I'm getting a little nervous, but...

403
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Can I roll persuasion?

404
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Yeah, I mean, 19?

405
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
[laughter]

406
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,640
I feel like that's probably a 20, is the...

407
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:50,080
is

408
00:21:50,080 --> 00:22:12,200
it

409
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:16,800
over to you. Okay, but I don't you don't you move. We're just saying my birthday. I it's

410
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,240
his birthday. Oh my okay fine. I'll lie down on the ground. I'll close my eyes. I'm not

411
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:28,780
touching any weapons. Come make a circle around me and sing happy birthday to me. Now. Making

412
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:35,680
demand. Oh, it's my birthday. I can't everybody everybody put down your weapons. And then

413
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:40,160
we'll get in the circle. Okay, yep, they're down. First of all, I mean, first of all,

414
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,160
It's a shovel, not a weapon, but you know, I'll put it down anyway.

415
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,160
Put down your spell book, Cleric.

416
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
My book?

417
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,160
It's not a book.

418
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,160
Now this is my diary.

419
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,160
Yeah, that's a diary.

420
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
Put down your diary then, Cleric.

421
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,160
But I'm reading...

422
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,160
Oh my god, please, just, I'm...

423
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:00,160
My birthday's gonna end by the time you get around here.

424
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,160
I'm gonna remember that this was his birthday party.

425
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,160
What do you mean?

426
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,160
You could just sort of...

427
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,160
Hold on, I gotta write it down first, but let's start singing

428
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,000
in while I write it down. Also, this has the lyrics to the birthday song on it and I can't

429
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
usually remember them.

430
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,560
I just need that, I, you know, Steve-o, please just put the book down. I'm gonna cry pretty

431
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,560
soon. I'm gonna start crying.

432
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:22,560
Alright, alright.

433
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
Alright, I'll put it down.

434
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:24,560
You want this man to cry?

435
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
Okay, now gather around.

436
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,560
You wanna make a grown man cry?

437
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:30,400
And can you link hands around me and do, and like, do like maybe skip around in a circle

438
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,400
while you sing?

439
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Yeah, let's go.

440
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Yeah, let's do that.

441
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,880
Everybody has their weapons down.

442
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,880
Yes.

443
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,040
Yes! Oh my god, you with the weapons thing.

444
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,040
I mean with the weapons thing.

445
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,540
Are you like planning something?

446
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,540
No, are you planning something?

447
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,540
Why would I be planning something? It's my birthday.

448
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,540
Birthdays are really important to Brave Lions.

449
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
We respect it.

450
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,540
Well, you're not respecting it right now.

451
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,040
I can tell you that much.

452
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,040
Alright, they all gather around you guys.

453
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,040
It's our holy hands.

454
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,040
Word of Radiance.

455
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:02,540
And they all have to make constitution saving throws.

456
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Yeah, absolutely.

457
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
Okay.

458
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,540
It's DC 13.

459
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,540
Okay.

460
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,540
So...

461
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,540
Uh...

462
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,540
Yeah, three of them...

463
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Yeah, three of them fail.

464
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,540
Um...

465
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,540
Two of them succeed, so what's happening here?

466
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
The ones who fail take...

467
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,540
Three damage. Three radiant damage.

468
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,540
Okay.

469
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,540
So, describe Word of Radiance. What happens?

470
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,540
Well, the word of Radiance is "dirt".

471
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:57,460
are

472
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:20,940
it's

473
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:25,900
weapons now. And you smell like one, two, well put the weapons, do we got anything left now?

474
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:29,580
All right, I'm Patrick, you should, you can go now. They're not going to do anything.

475
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:36,300
I take, I'm gonna hit one of them with a bow and arrow. That's all I'm gonna do.

476
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:45,340
Whoever's closest. The same thing I just allowed to happen. 18. Okay, roll for damage. Eight.

477
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,300
Okay, yeah, um...

478
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,300
I hit one of the ones who took, uh, however much sun damage or whatever.

479
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,300
Yeah, yeah, describe your kill.

480
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:56,300
[Laughter]

481
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,300
You're not very strong.

482
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
I shoot him, I shoot him straight in the throat.

483
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,300
Yeah, you just fuckin' like...

484
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,300
I'm standing there...

485
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,300
You look like a monkey,

486
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,300
and you smell like one, you just unleash an arrow,

487
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,300
and he's like finishing singing with you,

488
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,300
and then, "I smell like one..."

489
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,300
[Mimics monkey]

490
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:32,300
I'm

491
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
That was it.

492
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,820
Well, he was shinin' there with Lucy in the sky with diamonds.

493
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:39,740
Yeah, you know, stuff like that, but sometimes it's not needed.

494
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,900
Sometimes the original is better.

495
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Yeah.

496
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:55,500
So yeah, you just killed that guy, and now the main guy is up, and he's like, "You cunts!"

497
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,020
And he is gonna come at you.

498
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,340
"I can't what?

499
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
I can't what?

500
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,460
What can't I do?"

501
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,020
And he's swinging a short sword at you, Patrick Giodar.

502
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,020
I dodge it.

503
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,020
For 100 damage.

504
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,020
You do dodge it.

505
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:16,640
And he's like, "Oh no, 100 damage!"

506
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,100
He just says that, he just has a tick.

507
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,780
But yeah, he misses.

508
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:27,460
And then another guy who's a little bit further back is going to leash an arrow at you also,

509
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:28,460
Patrick Giodar.

510
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,460
Oh, come on.

511
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,460
Yeah, he does hit you.

512
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,460
He does hit you.

513
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,460
How much?

514
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:37,580
He does 4 damage to you.

515
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,300
That is, now that, now that's my thing.

516
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,780
You don't do my thing.

517
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,980
That's me.

518
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:53,300
And now it is your turn, evil, no Dogen, sorry.

519
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,300
Evil Dogen.

520
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,460
Dogen, you are prone right now.

521
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,820
Oh true.

522
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,180
Okay so I guess, are they still around me?

523
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,140
No, they all like ran back during the birthday.

524
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:11,220
During the birthday interstitial that broke every combat rule in D&D.

525
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,900
How far away are they?

526
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:20,580
So the one who just swung at, you know, Patrick is like, you know, 15, 10-15 feet from you.

527
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,980
Okay, does it take my whole movement to stand up?

528
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,260
No, just half.

529
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:28,020
Okay, I'll take half my movement to stand up and the rest of it to go into melee range

530
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:45,020
to

531
00:28:45,020 --> 00:29:03,020
I'm

532
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,020
uncomfortable.

533
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,020
Jesus, Jesus Christ.

534
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,020
Man, that's like a man.

535
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:12,900
You know, I get it's a, I mean, I get it's your birthday.

536
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,820
You're solid under his breath go, damn, I'm married that guy.

537
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:20,820
I mean, he's like, what?

538
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:25,060
Like some memory sort of just reared its head when he saw you.

539
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,060
Yeah, yeah.

540
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:32,120
I mean, he's yeah, his head just like fucking like the time to unwrap my presents and his

541
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:35,920
head just like went into his neck and just like mushed all up in there.

542
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:41,320
And then right after he dies they go like "Oh, I should have said something about a pinata!

543
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,720
Fuck!"

544
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,160
And yeah, now it is the other, some of the other guys' turn.

545
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:57,680
One of them is going to knock a crossbow bolt and aim it at you, Dogen, after you did that

546
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,960
nasty thing.

547
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,960
And what's your AC?

548
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
It's something crazy.

549
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,960
18.

550
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,740
Yeah, just like bounce places off your armor.

551
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,220
I hit it out of the air with my shovel actually.

552
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,220
And I say, "Time to unwrap my present!"

553
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,980
Oh, not again man!

554
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:14,980
That was disgusting!

555
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,980
Oh, come on now.

556
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:16,980
What the hell?

557
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:17,980
And then another one...

558
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:23,040
You say it one more time, we're all going to be upset.

559
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Another one is charging you Evil Steeble.

560
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:36,440
And he's like, uh, he's like, he's like, I'm gonna read your diary.

561
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,640
He's running towards you and what's your AC?

562
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,640
14.

563
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,640
Okay, that hits unfortunately.

564
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:52,840
He's using a, also using a short sword and he deals five damage to you as he slashes you

565
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,480
along your, uh, your arms trying to get you to drop your diary.

566
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,640
My diary, I'm like clutching it with both hands and I'm crisscross.

567
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,640
I can't wait to read it, I love secrets.

568
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:09,120
Yeah, he's a little weird guy.

569
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,360
And it is now, oh no wait, no wait, yeah, can you kill the other guy?

570
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,560
So it is now your turn.

571
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,360
Me, right?

572
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,040
Yeah, you.

573
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:26,040
Okay, I will use troll the dead on my friend, my creepy friend.

574
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Oh yeah, do it man.

575
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,040
What does troll the dead do?

576
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:35,040
It basically makes a dolerous bell happen.

577
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:39,040
So... I wanted fucking cats, dude!

578
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
Yeah, uh, you gotta hit the um...

579
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,040
I'm hitting the B!

580
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,040
Oh, well because, well sorry, because it's A, it's not a...

581
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,040
It's like they have to roll against it, because they have to make a business out of it.

582
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:56,040
So basically, yeah, you make like a big giant bell sound that a target must sort of, you

583
00:31:56,040 --> 00:32:01,080
know, try to save against it.

584
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,400
And they are missing some of their hit points, so they will, instead of taking a d8, will

585
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,400
take a d12.

586
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,400
Okay, so now I roll a d12?

587
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:11,120
No, so they gotta roll first to see if they avoid you.

588
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,240
And their wisdom is not very high, so...

589
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:19,780
Yeah, they do get hit by this for full damage.

590
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,780
Yes.

591
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:21,780
So roll that d12.

592
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:28,780
That you can just go into the thing and it will roll it for you.

593
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,780
Yeah.

594
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:30,780
Five.

595
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,780
Nice.

596
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,820
So yeah, you just do, yeah, this guy's like, "Oh, the bell!

597
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,260
Oh, he reminds me of mom!

598
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,260
No!"

599
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,420
And he's just like holding his head.

600
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:45,060
Yeah, he's not looking too good at all after that.

601
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:47,060
What does your bell sound like?

602
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:53,620
Um, it sounds like, uh, the, you said it's a whistle.

603
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:57,620
It sounds like the whistle from Blow the Whistle by Too Short.

604
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,620
It's like, *whistles*.

605
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:03,620
Yeah, he's hearing that and he's just like insane.

606
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:05,620
He's like, I don't like that kind of music.

607
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,620
You ain't getting in my diary, man.

608
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,620
I got tons of recipes in here.

609
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,620
*laughs*

610
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
I got crazy paellas in here and shit.

611
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,500
- Paya is in here and shit.

612
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,580
- Hey, you got paya in there?

613
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,140
You haven't...

614
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,980
Come on, man.

615
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,800
- You think?

616
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,260
We ain't got no ingredients out here, man.

617
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,420
We're in the woods.

618
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,440
- Hey, we're in an inn now.

619
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,960
We could probably make a paya here.

620
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,820
- Let me kill these guys first.

621
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,180
Damn.

622
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,020
- Good point.

623
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:30,860
Good point.

624
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:35,620
- Now it is Lord Sullivan's turn.

625
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,740
- Oh, Lord now?

626
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,820
- Oh.

627
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,660
- No, no.

628
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,620
- I didn't realize.

629
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:42,460
- No, you don't have to.

630
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:48,960
He's gonna take out his dagger and charge that one who you just

631
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,960
you just ring-a-dang-dang the bell. Let's see how he does.

632
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,960
Whoa! You got a crit! Oh my god!

633
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,960
Sullivan! No, that wasn't a crit.

634
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:04,960
Sullivan has the "everything is a crit" thing.

635
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
That was a 19. Oh wait, shit.

636
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,960
Look at this, plus 3. Oh no, wait, how did that happen?

637
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:13,040
looks like a crit it's the same thing from before anything that Sullivan rolls

638
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,520
that's more than one it's treated as a crit that was in a past episode I

639
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,560
remember that cuz I was editing it he's just a fuck god everything he rolls it's

640
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:29,640
not a one is green wait why is that happen I guess I'm from the frog

641
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:35,160
that happened that is okay well whatever now I have to fucking oh yeah I remember

642
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:50,160

643
00:34:50,160 --> 00:35:11,000
this

644
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:18,280
before and honestly I'm uh pretty terrified actually I don't even know if

645
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:24,160
I can I don't know we'll have to talk about this later we're fighting we're

646
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,640
fighting fighting creatures this is awful and like he's like stabbing the guy's

647
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:37,760
stomach and like his guts are like coming out on the solvent just like so unhappy

648
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,760
That man was way taller than you.

649
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
*laughter*

650
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,760
Um, yeah.

651
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
And uh, that's his turn.

652
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
And we're back to the top of the order. It's your turn, Patrick.

653
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,760
There's only two left. Only two left?

654
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Yeah. I'm gonna turn to them and be like,

655
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,760
"Look, why don't we talk this out?"

656
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
*laughter*

657
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:59,760
What did they say?

658
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,760
They're just like, filled with brage.

659
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,760
They are just like, like,

660
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,760
like, well one of them you see is like,

661
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:26,760
like

662
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,760
I'm gonna be forced to kill you.

663
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,760
Oh well!

664
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Yeah go, go.

665
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
Nine.

666
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
No damage.

667
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,760
Yeah, I whiff it really bad.

668
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Yeah, and there that one who was

669
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
like the awful voice,

670
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
"HA! You're not gonna be able to kill us!"

671
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Yeah, that was actually a warning shot.

672
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,760
And I was doing it.

673
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,760
Oh yeah, were you trying to warn a ghost?

674
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,760
I was warning you. I was trying to do you a

675
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,760
favor, but uh...

676
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:01,760
know

677
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,160
and he like, this is the same guy who had shot you earlier.

678
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,500
And so he knocks an arrow and aims it towards you.

679
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,120
And yeah, that hits you.

680
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,400
- How bad?

681
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,080
- About to find out.

682
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,200
- Probably not too bad.

683
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,400
- Five damage, he just locks another arrow.

684
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:22,040
- All right, I'm getting pissed off.

685
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,780
I got two arrows in both shoulders.

686
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,200
- Hey, Banter, you're gonna have a third

687
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:31,240
and it's gonna be in another shoulder.

688
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,880
You know, not maybe, maybe the right one again.

689
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:36,120
- What the hell are you talking about?

690
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,640
- I don't know you guys, I'm not very good at these.

691
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm pretty excited right now

692
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,800
and I'm getting you so many times.

693
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,760
So, I think. - You're a prick.

694
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,760
- You're, you're, you're fucking, you know.

695
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,600
- You know what, I don't like to use.

696
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,480
- Little fucking shit.

697
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,700
- I don't like to use harsh words often, but you're a prick.

698
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:58,320
- Right, and that means something coming from him.

699
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,240
He doesn't.

700
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
I'm a pretty nice guy otherwise.

701
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
Plus you're a party pooper.

702
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Yeah, you ruined my friend's birthday.

703
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
You ruined my birthday.

704
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
You ruined it! You're eating something under there.

705
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,240
You're eating something under there.

706
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
Under? No! Not!

707
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
I think you accidentally ate some Fremunda.

708
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,240
*laughs*

709
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,240
What's Fremunda?

710
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Yeah, Fremunda my nuts.

711
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
I did no such thing!

712
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,240
And you deserve that.

713
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Alright, we're about square now.

714
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
(laughing)

715
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,500
- Okay, yeah. - Let's knock this off.

716
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,720
- Yeah, it's your turn, Dogen.

717
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,040
- Are the two that are left close to each other?

718
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,200
- Yeah, yeah, that's why I was able to hit him like,

719
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
dude, dude, dude, don't.

720
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,800
- Okay, I'm gonna run into the middle of them

721
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,440
and I'm gonna use Word of Radiance again.

722
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,360
Also something that I realized is that

723
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,140
I've had a shield equipped this whole time,

724
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,760
so I technically shouldn't have been using

725
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,640
two-handed damage, I only just saw when I opened

726
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,480
my inventory. - I was wondering why

727
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,320
your AC was so high.

728
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,000
- So from now on I will,

729
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:11,880
a

730
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:26,880
have

731
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:44,880
a

732
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:51,360
try to slice at you with a dagger that he's going to pull from his path.

733
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:55,600
And he's going to miss or bounce off your shield or whatever.

734
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,360
And now it's your turn, Evil Steeble.

735
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,960
Okay, I'm going to use Chill Touch on the one closest to me.

736
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,400
Okay, cool.

737
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,360
One closest to me.

738
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,200
Yeah, five.

739
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,960
Well, that's just the damage.

740
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,680
They have to do the attack roll.

741
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
No, I did it bad again.

742
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Aww.

743
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
20!

744
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Fuck yeah, that hits.

745
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:21,680
5, do you want to keep that? Let's keep that 5.

746
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Um, yeah. You do it to the guy who was screeching.

747
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Uh, like a numbnut.

748
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
And uh, he's not looking good either.

749
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,680
How do you, how do you chill touch him?

750
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
He doesn't die, but how do you like...

751
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
chill touch him? What do you do with your hand?

752
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
I... I...

753
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
uh, make him eat his own booger.

754
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,680
Yeah, it's a really cold booger.

755
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,240
Um, and he's like, "Oh no! That's actually, you know what? This is a little bit underrated."

756
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
"I knew you'd like that shit, you nasty ass!"

757
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,640
"Oh no, now everybody knows he's gonna put it in his diary!"

758
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,640
"That's right, I'm writing that down right now."

759
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,640
"No, don't do it!"

760
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,480
Um, yeah, and now it is Sullivan's turn.

761
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,240
And Sullivan is going to take out his bow and arrow

762
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
and try to shoot it at, um,

763
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,120
uh, the booger eater.

764
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,680
Let's see how he does at that.

765
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,360
Go Sullivan, go Sullivan.

766
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,040
Oh, he has a, he has a, what does he have?

767
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
He has a dart.

768
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
I gave him darts.

769
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
He has a dart?

770
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Does he throw it?

771
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
Yeah.

772
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 20.

773
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:32,440
No, he got a 16.

774
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,680
That does hit that guy.

775
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
Okay, stop.

776
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,020
He keeps giving everything a crit.

777
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,780
He almost kills the booger guy.

778
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:44,580
He throws the dart and it goes right into his like thigh and it just like gets him down

779
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:49,220
and it's just like fucking is just like really just like doing this guy and he's almost gone

780
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:52,140
Patrick you're up they're both looking pretty bad.

781
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:59,420
All right I'll give you one more chance to knock this all off we'll forget this ever happened.

782
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,500
Um you can do it.

783
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:07,340
I don't know if you guys know any necromancers or anything we could probably bring these these

784
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:18,140
other three back. Given that you know a necromancer, I don't know any necromancy spells. I'm actually

785
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:24,680
a, not really a magician at all. I'm actually a, he has the closest magic trick I can do

786
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:31,980
and I do like the finger thing. I'm showing them that I'm removing my, the tip of my finger.

787
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,900
One of them like politely chuckles, coughs up a bit of blood. This is the only magic

788
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,740
trick I really know and yeah what do you guys think?

789
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:42,260
Yeah, go for it.

790
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,260
You guys still mad?

791
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,900
Alright.

792
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,660
Intimidation.

793
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:49,500
14.

794
00:42:49,500 --> 00:43:01,460
Yeah, they sort of look to each other and they say like at the same time like, "Brave

795
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,660
Lions till the end!"

796
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,720
Right, then that is.

797
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,800
That is not good for you.

798
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,700
Can I do I attack now?

799
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,140
Yeah, yeah, that's fine with me.

800
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:16,100
13 that does hit them.

801
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
They have eight damage.

802
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,780
Yeah, one of them you just kill.

803
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:21,100
Am I? Yeah, yeah.

804
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,740
Whoever said brave lions till the end, I just shoot him straight in the eye.

805
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,380
Yeah, yeah, the bigger one.

806
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:30,020
Yeah. Is that the one who shot me?

807
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:31,460
Yes. OK.

808
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,180
Like, yeah, see, that's how it's done.

809
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,420
All right, you got to aim for that spot, not the fucking shoulders.

810
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,760
Like you thought that that would that would hinder me in any way.

811
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,380
No, it didn't. I'm an amazing dad.

812
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,180
And you're just talking. Yeah, I'm an amazing shot.

813
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,560
All right. Yeah.

814
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,260
I hope you hear this in the afterlife, too, because you were a prick.

815
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:56,560
The other guy, the other guy is is going to crap himself.

816
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,060
You're up, Dogen.

817
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,260

00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:17,320

826
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:31,760
I don't think we have anything to dig with, unfortunately.

827
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,760
So

828
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,060
We'll just burn them do something we got to get rid of this shit I do not why don't you?

Know I'm not that hungry

830
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:51,440
But if you were hungry you need to know I mean like I'm not that like I would never be that hungry probably

831
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,320
And I'm pretty hungry on this journey. I don't know you fucking figure it out. I'm going to the hotel

832
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:05,240
solvent I'm going to give solvent a is going to do a role to see how well he hides the bodies.

833
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:14,920
I guess it's going to be I guess that's a that could be a survival role or a it's exciting.

834
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:22,600
What is it to hide bodies? What kind of role is that? I guess I guess like survival.

835
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:27,560
If it's like digging. Yeah, it's like yeah, it's like a couple of things, right? It's like

836
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:28,960
Could be stealth.

837
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,800
Could be stealth, too.

838
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,000
I feel like stealth is is let me see.

839
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,600
Let me see survival.

840
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,460
Hot wild game guide your group through frozen ways.

841
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:39,160
Identify sentence. Yeah.

842
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:41,600
Yeah, I would say it's survival just because like it's like

843
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:44,200
it's something you would do out so you would dig holes outside.

844
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,560
It's something you would do.

845
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,000
I'm going to give him a survival role.

846
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,460
See how he does.

847
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:54,300
Pretty good. Pretty good.

848
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,940
So in regards to gets a 15, he does a pretty good job

849
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:05,340
hiding the bodies. That might come back later. So you guys head to the strange penis inn.

851
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:18,460
it? Is it called the strange penis inn? Did I miss that? Yeah. I guess you did yeah. Did

852
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:23,900
you guys hear that earlier? Yeah I heard that earlier. It's the strange penis inn. Alright.

853
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:30,900
you

854
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:46,580
is

855
00:47:46,580 --> 00:48:09,580
on

856
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:12,940
He's just sort of there cleaning glasses doing bartender II things

857
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:17,820
Obviously it's in and so you can also stay there for night if you'd like

858
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:22,980
But you can also get a drink beforehand or fraternize with many of the personnel who are there

859
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,540
I walk in the first thing I'm saying it's my birthday

860
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,140
Just to see what?

861
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:33,580
I'm friends with the birthday boy

862
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:39,300
Everyone's strengths are on themselves tonight.

863
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,940
- I usually feel with them go,

864
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,180
(laughing)

865
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,700
like some of them find it funny,

866
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,620
some of them find it funny,

867
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:48,800
but it's fine, it works out.

868
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,980
I think like, you want to do a persuasion roll with that

869
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:53,220
if you're trying to like sort of just

870
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:55,380
like finesse the crowd a little bit.

871
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,780
- Yeah, I'm gonna have these people wrapped around

872
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:00,540
my tiny little goblin finger.

873
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,940
That's a six.

874
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:04,900
- Yeah, no, you come off about as off-putting as you are.

875
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:27,900
I'm

876
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:42,140

00:49:53,580 --> 00:50:05,140
cramp oh I could see you're doing math in your head what's going on I was I was

880
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,540
trying to look for that you know that thing where it's like okay pick any

881
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:13,780
number then divide it by this and then but I don't remember I don't remember

882
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:17,940
how to do that so I can do it here I'll feed it to you ready I'll feed it to you here we go

883
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:21,780

884
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:27,260
number okay pick a number I should I pick seven again or should I pick something

885
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:32,220
yeah you should pick seven now tell him to multiply it by six multiply it by six

886
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:36,300
all right yeah now tell me why do you now tell him to divide it by the original

887
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:43,420
number. Yeah, divide it by the original number. Now tell him his number is 6. His final result

888
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:52,820
is 6. Now tell him his number is 6. He's just sort of like nodding. Yeah, you got that right.

889
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:58,300
I mean we have to have earned like one free drink there, right? Yeah. You know what? If

890
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:03,820
you don't do that again, absolutely. Alright, great. Yeah, and he gives you guys a free round.

891
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:07,580
Is there anywhere to gamble in here? Yeah, there are people playing cards

892
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,140
Like in the back that are like playing some kind of like

893
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:13,980
esoteric

894
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:15,900
Car game they're playing actually, you know what they're playing

895
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:21,680
They're playing wave race 64, which is what Patrick played in the first episode the classic trick-taking game

896
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,680
It's kind of like my version of cribbage

897
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:31,940
Anybody know cribbage? Yes. All right. Here we go. Now we're talking but there's no there's no fun roulette games or anything

898
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,580
No, this is

899
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:40,820
Sucks yeah, you say that just in earshot of the bartender it's the worst place

900
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,540
Yeah

901
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:52,300
Some probably could do some view some do with you some sprucing up. Yeah, you could the interior decoration of this place is seriously

902
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:58,560
Yeah, you got an idea. What if we give you what if we make you a painting and then you give us a couple free drinks

903
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,180
Paintings worth way more than drinks man

904
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,820
Now what are you gonna paint?

905
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:05,460
you

906
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:09,180
No, I'm doing here stand still and look towards me. I

907
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:17,140
Got a bad rich go behind him and get a bunch of drinks. Yeah, I got it. Take care of other customers. So get it

908
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,860
Okay, you're gonna try to you guys try to do this. Well, he's got he's got it

909
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:26,580
I mean, I I will say if we're about to hey, we're about to go to sleep. I got two spell slots left

910
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,420
I could command this guy to stay still with the spell. I'm sure that wouldn't backfire at all

911
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:51,420
all

912
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,380
one word command to a creature you can see within range. My command is freeze. The target

913
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:59,380
must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn.

914
00:52:59,380 --> 00:53:10,620
Okay. Mm-hmm. His wisdom is that. Yeah, he fails. So how long does he have to be frozen

915
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:18,820
for? I don't know. The rest of the night. A duration one round. Uh-oh. That's six seconds.

916
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:21,940
Okay, so I just go behind the bar and I grab it.

917
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:23,460
You just yell freeze and he just can't move.

918
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,220
I don't yell it, I whisper it.

919
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,020
You whisper freeze and he can't move for six seconds.

920
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,460
What are you gonna do Patrick?

921
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:32,260
I go and I'm behind the bar.

922
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,300
No you're not, you gotta do some rolls for that.

923
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,420
Oh fuck, okay.

924
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,660
If you're gonna do this in six seconds.

925
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,540
Okay, stealth.

926
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,700
17.

927
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,580
Um that's, I mean, you know, uh okay so you're,

928
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,500
are you doing this trying to do this without him noticing?

929
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:46,740
Yes.

930
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,220
You're doing this without him noticing.

931
00:53:47,220 --> 00:53:48,100
Stealth 17.

932
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:55,100
Um, okay, um, yeah, I'd say like you're pretty, like he's kind of a little distracted by, uh,

933
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:59,100
by, uh, uh, Evil Stevel saying his place sucks ass.

934
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:01,100
Um, so yeah, and you're kind of little.

935
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,100
So you sort of run around the side.

936
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:08,100
Now, um, as far as getting the drinks, you can get the drinks without noticing.

937
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,100
Nineteen, sleight of hand.

938
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:13,100
That's, that's good enough to get like two drinks, I would say.

939
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,100
Okay.

940
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,100
In this moment where he's frozen.

941
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,060
and we are not free one so that's three drinks

942
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:21,700
okay that's all we need

943
00:54:21,700 --> 00:54:25,900
but the stealth to get out now at the mean you can just heard dash at this point

944
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:29,940
when I'm curious about though is I mean he

945
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:34,260
yeah he's like frozen during this time

946
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:38,460
he said let you know yet but the hell did you do to me who

947
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,380
this one dark boy over here

948
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,380
The hell did you just do?

949
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,380
What the hell did you just do to me?

950
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,380
I didn't do anything.

951
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:50,380
Yeah, that's the birthday boy, not the dirt gay boy.

952
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,380
What are you saying?

953
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:54,380
Yeah, what are you saying?

954
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,380
You owe us some drinks, I'd think, for this.

955
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,380
Yeah, roll a deception.

956
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:00,380
This bartender's got pretty good insight.

957
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,380
He's got a crit one.

958
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,380
Nice.

959
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,380
Goddamn, okay.

960
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:08,380
By the way, you might want to go to the bathroom.

961
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:10,380
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

962
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:10,880
Okay.

963
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:14,000
By the way, you might want to go check to a doctor or something.

964
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:17,420
You were frozen for a few seconds there and it looked really serious.

965
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:18,920
You might want to get that checked out.

966
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:22,160
I think the right side of your face might be drooping a bit.

967
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:25,760
He's like looking at you and he's like...

968
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:26,860
Just...

969
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,320
Go find a seat.

970
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,400
I don't want you guys near the bar.

971
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,180
Okay.

972
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:35,380
Alright, weirdo.

973
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:35,880
Alright.

974
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:39,220
Yeah, okay, yeah. So you guys can go find a table somewhere.

975
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,220
How many drinks did we just get?

976
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,220
Like six?

977
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,220
Something like that?

978
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,220
Yeah. So you guys got a bunch of drinks.

979
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:49,220
You can go find a...

980
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,220
There's a couple tables around.

981
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,220
There's a couple tables

982
00:55:53,220 --> 00:55:55,220
open, but they all have like...

983
00:55:55,220 --> 00:55:57,220
somebody there.

984
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:59,220
Hey, how about you move

985
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,220
for the birthday boy?

986
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:03,220
Who can we...

987
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:05,220
There's an elf.

988
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:07,220
An elf who's kind of dressed

989
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:25,220
just

990
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:29,660
other people there she's chatting with them but those people just are sort of

991
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:38,460
not of note. There's a massive like orc who's sitting at a table and like it's

992
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:42,260
like up against a wall with a bench and so the table has like other chairs there

993
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:46,180
but there's like his group is up against a bench by where that table is so that

994
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:51,740
table is unoccupied but it's kind of like his space. There's another table with a

995
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:56,140
The guy who looks like he has like seven brain cells and he's just sort of eating.

996
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,140
He's eating stew.

997
00:56:57,140 --> 00:56:58,140
Let's sit with him.

998
00:56:58,140 --> 00:56:59,140
Let's sit with him.

999
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,140
Okay.

1000
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:01,140
We're sitting with him.

1001
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:02,140
Yeah.

1002
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,140
Okay.

1003
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:04,140
You guys go sit with this guy.

1004
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:10,540
He is permanently cross-eyed and currently eating stew with a fork.

1005
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:11,940
And he sees you all sitting with him.

1006
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,540
He goes, "Oh, well, greetings.

1007
00:57:15,540 --> 00:57:17,340
It's nice to meet you."

1008
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,740
Can I have your stew?

1009
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,300
"Oh, yeah.

1010
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:21,860
You can have a bit of my stew.

1011
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,140
The whole bowl for the birthday boy.

1012
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,140
Whose birthday is it?

1013
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,500
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

1014
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,560
Oh well happy birthday.

1015
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:32,460
You don't look a day over.

1016
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:33,460
And he just like stares.

1017
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:39,860
He tries to come up with a number.

1018
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:44,460

1041
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,500

1048
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:12,300
you leave he turns to you and says "Oh wait, wait, wait! I remembered why I was here! Hold

1049
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:23,140
on! Uh, see, our town is in some terrible trouble." Here we go. Basically, we've been hit with

1050
01:00:23,140 --> 01:00:30,140
some awful plague, our crops are dying, and our village idiot's missing, on top of everything.

1051
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:40,140
*laughter*

1052
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:42,140
You want us to deal with that?

1053
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:44,140
Yeah, I...

1054
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:50,140
Yeah, well, I was supposed to try to find adventurers who could help with that.

1055
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:55,100
Usually I just come here and eat my stew, but I had another job today.

1056
01:00:55,100 --> 01:01:01,100
And I've tried to talk to people, but every time I do, they usually say, "Down boy, down!"

1057
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:04,860
And I just sort of stopped talking right away, I don't know why.

1058
01:01:04,860 --> 01:01:09,020
But y'all were so nice to me and actually listened for a change.

1059
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:15,740
Please, our town doesn't have much right now, but if you could find a way to get rid of this terrible plague,

1060
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,700
well, I'm sure there'd be quite a reward for y'all.

1061
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:23,260
Can I go to bed first?

1062
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,940
Of course you can sleep on it if you need to.

1063
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:29,340
I sleep on a bed myself.

1064
01:01:29,340 --> 01:01:34,860
That's actually maybe overly clever for this character.

1065
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,400
What do you guys think at home?

1066
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,400
Please let me know.

1067
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,420
DM me.

1068
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,420
This guy's crazy.

1069
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:43,980
I don't know what he's talking about.

1070
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:44,980
Wait a second.

1071
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:45,980
This guy's stupid.

1072
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:46,980
What the hell?

1073
01:01:46,980 --> 01:01:53,980
Alright, I'm gonna go sleep for a little bit and then maybe I'll come to your house and I might, I don't know, I might help you.

1074
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,640
Yeah, me too.

1075
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,900
Okay. Well, hot dog, that's real nice.

1076
01:01:57,900 --> 01:02:03,860
Anyway, I'm gonna just stare here until I get hungry again.

1077
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,360
Alright, good luck.

1078
01:02:05,360 --> 01:02:10,620
Since we're about to go to bed, I want to use my last spell slot, so I'm just gonna cast Detect Magic on him just to see what happens.

1079
01:02:10,620 --> 01:02:11,480
Mm-hmm.

1080
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,620
I just want to see if he's magical at all.

1081
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,620
Okay, uh, yeah, for sure.

1082
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:21,460
So, um, I mean, it's any presence of magic within 30 feet of you.

1083
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,820
So, uh, just zilch on him.

1084
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,500
He is just, he is awesome.

1085
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,500
I was hoping maybe there was like a curse making him stupid that we could like shortcut the

1086
01:02:30,500 --> 01:02:31,860
whole quest thing, but...

1087
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,060
No, that's not quite what it is.

1088
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:39,740
But uh, there's, uh, and then as far as 30 feet around you, right, so magical.

1089
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:54,740
is

1090
01:02:54,740 --> 01:03:14,220
in

1091
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,220
that's it.

1092
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:23,860
Ok before I go to bed I go up to the bartender and I say, "Hey man, I remember you had an

1093
01:03:23,860 --> 01:03:28,420
issue earlier, I mean I just detected some magic from that table over there, so I just

1094
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:33,740
wanted to give you a heads up before I go to sleep, so you know, stay safe down here."

1095
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:36,700
He sort of nods at you in appreciation.

1096
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:37,700
Thanks.

1097
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:38,700
And uh, yeah.

1098
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:39,700
Let you go.

1099
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:43,660
Yeah, you guys wanna go to sleepy time?

1100
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:44,660
I go to sleepy time.

1101
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:46,660
Yeah, you guys go to bed.

1102
01:03:46,660 --> 01:03:47,660
Yeah.

1103
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:54,420
Um, uh, it's gonna be, uh, uh, like basically just one gold piece in total for all of you

1104
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:55,420
to stay here.

1105
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:58,660
Um, so it's pretty, pretty cheap to be honest.

1106
01:03:58,660 --> 01:04:02,260
Um, but it's actually not cheap, but gold pieces are worth a lot.

1107
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:05,500
So you guys are just kind of rich right now.

1108
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:06,500
Um, yeah.

1109
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,500
So yeah.

1110
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:08,500
Uh, okay.

1111
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:13,500
Okay, so yeah, you guys get up next morning.

1112
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:19,260
You can go downstairs, you can hang out in the end room

1113
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:20,260
we just went to.

1114
01:04:20,260 --> 01:04:22,060
We have a pillow fight first thing.

1115
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:26,300
Yeah, super, yeah, in our underwear.

1116
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:28,260
Yeah, sexy.

1117
01:04:28,260 --> 01:04:31,660
I'm having so much fun, all the feathers get in my teeth.

1118
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:32,500
Oh my God.

1119
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,100
This is exactly what I needed.

1120
01:04:34,100 --> 01:04:35,220
It's beautiful.

1121
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:37,260
This is this is the worst.

1122
01:04:37,260 --> 01:04:39,420
I did not sign up for this.

1123
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:41,420
So hard with the pillow. OK.

1124
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,160
Yeah, it's like a roll attack roll. All right.

1125
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,100
I six. I'm this nice. That's fine.

1126
01:04:48,100 --> 01:04:50,760
Yeah. Sullivan just like ducks out of the way.

1127
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:54,860
Yeah. And he's like, OK, I'm having fun.

1128
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,860
I like what I thought.

1129
01:04:56,860 --> 01:04:58,420
Yeah. I get in your underwear.

1130
01:04:58,420 --> 01:04:59,460
Yeah, he does.

1131
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,060
And you see, there's just a child in the room also

1132
01:05:02,060 --> 01:05:04,860
go to the other room.

1133
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,660
OK, or the hallway, whatever that shit is.

1134
01:05:07,660 --> 01:05:11,180
It's a hallway, but it's kind of just a long room.

1135
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,820
Are you still talking to me? Get the fuck out there.

1136
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:15,500
Oh, you know.

1137
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,580
Yeah. So the prince goes out the hallway.

1138
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,300
You guys have a sexy pillow fight.

1139
01:05:19,300 --> 01:05:21,340
Yeah. Nice. Awesome.

1140
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:23,020
That kills about eight hours.

1141
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,180
So it's cool. It's afternoon.

1142
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:25,860
Perfect.

1143
01:05:25,860 --> 01:05:28,100
And you guys go downstairs after you've done.

1144
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:31,900
Timothy is still there.

1145
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:34,240
And he goes, I'm hungry.

1146
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:35,700
And like I go like that.

1147
01:05:35,700 --> 01:05:42,740
And he goes to the bar, says, can I have Timothy stew and Otto's there?

1148
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,240
He's like, yeah, well, yeah, we'll get you Timothy stew.

1149
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:48,100
And he turns, he goes, Marge, make the beef stew.

1150
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:52,240
And just yeah, he gets like a just a slop of beef stew.

1151
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:55,860
And he picks he looks at he looks at a spoon for like a minute

1152
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:58,300
and then puts it down and picks up a fork and starts eating.

1153
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:03,060
And he sees you guys come down and he says, Oh, fellas,

1154
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:04,940
I'm so glad you're here.

1155
01:06:04,940 --> 01:06:08,560
I forgot to go home last night, but here I am.

1156
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:13,600
Would you like to accompany me, accompany me, accompany?

1157
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:15,740
Oh, well, I guess.

1158
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:18,700
Yeah, I'm just not going to try out that word ever again.

1159
01:06:18,700 --> 01:06:22,160
All right.

1160
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,820
It's a bit due north, but that's all right.

1161
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:28,660
I hope that's not out of the way of your journey, wherever you all were headed.

1162
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:53,320
and

1163
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,220
100% simple jack type.

1164
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:57,020
Oh, no. Yeah.

1165
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,320
Well, no, Jack.

1166
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,120
No, well, not like that.

1167
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,020
Just like the way he looks.

1168
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:04,220
OK, Tim's that are right.

1169
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:05,620
You look simple.

1170
01:07:05,620 --> 01:07:10,720
So yeah, you guys are heading over to what he called was idiot village.

1171
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:16,320
And you see him like licking his finger and putting it up like he thinks that helps him with directions.

1172
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:20,820
He's like occasionally looking at rocks and seeing where moss is.

1173
01:07:20,820 --> 01:07:27,620
and eventually you guys get to get to the town itself.

1174
01:07:27,620 --> 01:07:36,340
And you do see that it does seem to be beset by something it is a quaint little farm town.

1175
01:07:36,340 --> 01:07:44,300
And there is a lot of just ragged people, you get to the gate, it was a cut open, and

1176
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:49,420
you see a sign there but says needed would sorry will repair.

1177
01:07:49,420 --> 01:08:04,100
all

1178
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:08,980
how to do anything. They're all walking around with untied shoelaces, they're tripping all

1179
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:15,980
the time, they're stepping on rakes, they're chasing around squealing little pigs and losing

1180
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:22,940
in those chases. You see Timothy, "Well, this is our town. As you can see, we're in a little

1181
01:08:22,940 --> 01:08:30,120
bit of dire straits over here. I'm really glad y'all decided to come though. I would offer

1182
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:36,720
you food to eat but right now everything we have is pretty much really bad.

1183
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,040
We'll take it.

1184
01:08:38,040 --> 01:08:44,320
Alright well would you like I got I'm supposed to bring y'all to the mayor of Idiot Village

1185
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:47,840
if you'd like me to do that for you.

1186
01:08:47,840 --> 01:08:52,000
Alright bring us there and then go get us some food.

1187
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:53,280
You got it.

1188
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:58,740
And so you go to the to the mayor's house in Idiot Village and you see that it's just the

1189
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:00,180
the scaffolding with the door.

1190
01:09:00,180 --> 01:09:05,020
Um, and Timothy knocks and you guys can see the mayor.

1191
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,920
Who's just like a fatter, older Timothy.

1192
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:13,380
And here's a knock and you see him like put away something he was looking at on his desk

1193
01:09:13,380 --> 01:09:18,740
and just goes, uh, you guys can see him doing this, uh, come in.

1194
01:09:18,740 --> 01:09:23,460
And, uh, Timothy, uh, first thinks it's a push door, but he realizes it's a pull.

1195
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,940
And then he walks in.

1196
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:34,460
And he says, "Mr. Mayor, I've brought with me here four brave adventurers and a child

1197
01:09:34,460 --> 01:09:39,560
who've decided that they can help us rid the town of the plague and the failure of the crops

1198
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,440
and maybe even find our village idiot."

1199
01:09:42,440 --> 01:09:46,980
And he says, "Well, that would be just great.

1200
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:48,820
It's nice to meet all of you.

1201
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,400
My name is Mayor.

1202
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,440
I had another name but I forgot it the second I became mayor.

1203
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,440
How y'all doing?

1204
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:58,720
Well I got some bad news for you.

1205
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:05,640
You're gonna forget your other name now because I've actually, I'm here to become the mayor.

1206
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:11,600
Oh, well, uh, well that won't work because I'm the mayor.

1207
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:12,600
How do you mean?

1208
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,000
We're having an election.

1209
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,440
I was sent here to become the mayor.

1210
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,760
Yeah, roll persuasion.

1211
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:18,760
11.

1212
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,520
Okay, he's like, Damn, we're having an election.

1213
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:26,080
Okay.

1214
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:27,440
Shoot.

1215
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,320
Can we have, like, a debate?

1216
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:30,400
Make some speeches?

1217
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:30,960
Yes.

1218
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:31,800
Absolutely.

1219
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:32,400
Perfect.

1220
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:32,880
Yeah.

1221
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:33,400
All right.

1222
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:34,520
I love that.

1223
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:38,280
You know, I've won every year since I was four years old.

1224
01:10:38,280 --> 01:10:42,560
I'm really excited to have a new challenger.

1225
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:43,800
Okay, hold on.

1226
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:47,760
I'll gather everyone in the town and you see him go to a conch

1227
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,260
and he blows in it and it just spit comes out.

1228
01:10:50,260 --> 01:10:52,460
He's like, I'll just go try to talk to everyone.

1229
01:10:52,460 --> 01:10:55,760
And he runs out of his house, ignoring the door,

1230
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:58,460
just running past the scaffolding to go talk to everyone

1231
01:10:58,460 --> 01:10:59,300
in the town.

1232
01:10:59,300 --> 01:11:01,460
- I go through his desk immediately.

1233
01:11:01,460 --> 01:11:04,040
- Yeah, you see a, what he was looking at

1234
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,040
that he was ashamed of was just like a doll

1235
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,420
that has no clothes on.

1236
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:15,340
- Give me that, I might need to cast a spell with that

1237
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:16,420
or something later.

1238
01:11:17,560 --> 01:11:21,640
Yeah, you also sorry if you keep you can keep like looking through his desk and when you

1239
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:29,800
do you also see on it you also see on top of his desk a resignation letter.

1240
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:36,020
And when you read it, it says like, Dear, dear Ted.

1241
01:11:36,020 --> 01:11:40,040
Your name is Ted, it's not mayor and I'm not calling you that anymore.

1242
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,840
I've decided to leave this town.

1243
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:48,040
I decided to leave this town because you people don't appreciate everything I do for you.

1244
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:53,160
You'll see that you'll see the results of that upon my absence.

1245
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,440
Don't come looking for me.

1246
01:11:54,440 --> 01:11:58,600
Don't come find me and like see you later.

1247
01:11:58,600 --> 01:11:59,600
Never liked you anyway.

1248
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,720
And it says your beloved village idiot.

1249
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,160
Wow.

1250
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:06,840
Well, we found him.

1251
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:11,440
He's stuck to the we can probably figure this out after we resolve the whole election thing.

1252
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,440
And this shit can wait.

1253
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,920
Oh wow, you guys can read that?

1254
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:18,200
We've been having an awful lot of trouble.

1255
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:23,440
It just showed up on the desk one day around the same time our village idiot disappeared.

1256
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:27,100
Yeah, this is the letter that says that Patrick Yodar is supposed to become mayor.

1257
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:34,040
You didn't get the memo and you received it? Yeah, see maybe that's why I'm here to become the mayor. No fucking shit!

1258
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:36,040
Yeah.

1259
01:12:36,040 --> 01:12:40,960
Boy, okay. All right. That makes sense. Now. I should tell the mayor to throw off the turd

1260
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,000
Just not do the election and just make you mayor

1261
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:47,640
Yeah, we could still do the debate though. Yeah, let's still go through with that

1262
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,660
Oh, I guess it's all good sportsmanship in that that makes sense to me

1263
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:54,540
Okay

1264
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:59,560
So should we just fast forward to that or do you guys want to do something here? It's just fast for you got it

1265
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:03,080
Yeah, anytime. Yeah. Okay, cool. Yeah, and so uh

1266
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:08,440
uh... a whole town is gathered most of them are facing the correct direction

1267
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:10,020
uh... the pulpit

1268
01:13:10,020 --> 01:13:11,920
and that is patrick gilbert

1269
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:15,800
and uh... mayor or i guess ted is his name

1270
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:19,960
are standing on top of uh... uh... are you guys you standing behind a podium

1271
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:21,440
can i be a moderator

1272
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,360
yeah absolutely you immediately convinced him that you would be the most

1273
01:13:24,360 --> 01:13:26,680
impartial judge uh... you know

1274
01:13:26,680 --> 01:13:29,920
and i don't know what he's got on the

1275
01:13:29,920 --> 01:13:34,200
I'm the person who gets called on in the audience to ask questions.

1276
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:37,280
They call on me every time I ask a bunch of different questions.

1277
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,280
Perfect.

1278
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,280
Okay.

1279
01:13:39,280 --> 01:13:40,280
Yeah.

1280
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,280
That makes sense to me.

1281
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:42,280
Okay, cool.

1282
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,280
So, yeah, you see...

1283
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:46,280
Yeah, so, yeah, go, moderate.

1284
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,280
Moderate.

1285
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:52,520
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the mayor debate.

1286
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:58,100
I'm your moderator, Christopher, and I'd like to start with some questions.

1287
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,340
This first question is for both candidates.

1288
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:05,940
What hotel did I stay at last night?

1289
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:08,660
That is the Strange Penis Inn.

1290
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:09,660
Okay.

1291
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:10,660
Gosh.

1292
01:14:10,660 --> 01:14:13,180
And the mayor, now your turn to answer.

1293
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:15,820
Well I have no idea where you stayed last night.

1294
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:19,380
I mean, ladies and gentlemen, the results are speaking for themselves right now.

1295
01:14:19,380 --> 01:14:21,740
Oh dear, I did not look good when I said that.

1296
01:14:21,740 --> 01:14:29,740
I would just like to say for every question that he gets wrong, he loses one LL's point.

1297
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:33,460
I'm raising my hand in the air.

1298
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:34,580
I'm waving my hand around.

1299
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,940
I'm jumping up and down to be called on.

1300
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:38,180
He gets to lose his podium.

1301
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,780
He doesn't get to have a podium now.

1302
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:45,460
It's like hangman, but he loses one article of clothing for everything that he gets wrong.

1303
01:14:45,460 --> 01:14:47,820
Oh, it's like strip hangman.

1304
01:14:47,820 --> 01:14:49,180
I remember this.

1305
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:50,180
Yeah.

1306
01:14:50,180 --> 01:14:51,180
Everybody played that.

1307
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:54,300
Absolutely. I got robbed that way.

1308
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:58,380
Hey, dirt guy up in the front, you can say a question.

1309
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:02,540
Hi, my name's Timothy and I'm from this village.

1310
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:04,540
My question is for...

1311
01:15:04,540 --> 01:15:06,540
That's... My name's Timothy!

1312
01:15:06,540 --> 01:15:10,780
Get that guy out of here!

1313
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:13,660
Get that hippie out of this fuckin' debate!

1314
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:18,540
Oh, okay. I'll go back to the strange penis to have some more stew.

1315
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:26,880
I have I have to find adventurers. I have two questions. Uh my first question is for mayor.

1316
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:31,020
How would you plan to solve the plague that is attacking this village and where can the

1317
01:15:31,020 --> 01:15:35,300
village idiot be found and how will you solve all the solutions to all the problems that

1318
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:41,660
are happening here? That's an excellent question and I understood one quarter of it. Let me

1319
01:15:41,660 --> 01:15:43,620
me do my best here.

1320
01:15:43,620 --> 01:15:45,740
First of all, the way that I was...

1321
01:15:45,740 --> 01:15:46,980
Okay, what's up?

1322
01:15:46,980 --> 01:15:47,980
I'm the mayor.

1323
01:15:47,980 --> 01:15:53,460
Oh, no, that's not your name.

1324
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,460
My name's mayor.

1325
01:15:54,460 --> 01:15:55,460
Your name is...

1326
01:15:55,460 --> 01:15:56,460
Your name is...

1327
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:57,460
...Tempest-y?

1328
01:15:57,460 --> 01:15:59,180
Your name is Ted.

1329
01:15:59,180 --> 01:16:00,180
My name is now...

1330
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:07,220
You watch as something unlocks in his brain and he's like, "My name's Ted?"

1331
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:13,860
name is Ted and my name is Mayor Patrick Yodar and I am now the mayor of Idiot Village.

1332
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:15,340
My name is Ted.

1333
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:22,540
I think I kind of walked into something here that I don't realize.

1334
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:25,460
I forgot that my name was Ted.

1335
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,900
Thank you so much.

1336
01:16:26,900 --> 01:16:30,100
Anyway, my second question is for Patrick Yodar.

1337
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:32,100
What's your favorite color?

1338
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,300
My favorite color is green.

1339
01:16:34,300 --> 01:16:36,020
That's a good color answer.

1340
01:16:36,020 --> 01:16:41,020
Um, wait, wait, uh, uh, okay, hold on.

1341
01:16:41,020 --> 01:16:42,560
You're the mayor now.

1342
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:45,060
You got to solve this problem then.

1343
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:47,580
Because I don't know where the village idiot is.

1344
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,580
He deputized him.

1345
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:51,580
Deputized.

1346
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,340
You're the sheriff.

1347
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:54,900
Oh, really?

1348
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,340
Now make him make it his responsibility.

1349
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:58,340
Delegate.

1350
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:01,060
And it's your responsibility to do that.

1351
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:03,740
Callum's name is Sheriff Doopki.

1352
01:17:03,740 --> 01:17:06,540
Your name is Sheriff Poopy Dookie.

1353
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,540
Okay, I'll take it.

1354
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,540
No way! That's your name?

1355
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:11,540
Okay, well...

1356
01:17:11,540 --> 01:17:12,540
Oh my god!

1357
01:17:12,540 --> 01:17:20,040
If I had to guess where that, the village idiot is, uh, well, I guess it's kind of funny.

1358
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:22,740
He kind of wandered into this town a few years ago.

1359
01:17:22,740 --> 01:17:26,860
And we were, now that I think about it, we were sort of in a similar state back then

1360
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,620
as well.

1361
01:17:28,620 --> 01:17:32,860
But he does have this cave he likes to go into sometimes.

1362
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:44,780
he

1363
01:17:44,780 --> 01:17:47,420
I have no that that I cannot help you with.

1364
01:17:47,420 --> 01:17:51,940
I have just found out what North is yesterday.

1365
01:17:51,940 --> 01:17:53,980
So it's is it North?

1366
01:17:53,980 --> 01:17:58,020
That's why I really I really cannot help you there.

1367
01:17:58,020 --> 01:18:03,540
As the mayor, somebody has to tell me where this cave is right now.

1368
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:04,540
I'm gonna freak out.

1369
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:07,540
Everyone's like, oh, you could freak out.

1370
01:18:07,540 --> 01:18:13,480
fifth

1371
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:18,480
and he's like, "And maybe it's, uh, maybe it's, maybe it's up?"

1372
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:20,760
- Maybe it's up.

1373
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,560
All right, this is actually,

1374
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,680
this is like one of the worst things

1375
01:18:24,680 --> 01:18:26,500
I could have asked everybody.

1376
01:18:26,500 --> 01:18:29,080
- Maybe it's down.

1377
01:18:29,080 --> 01:18:32,320
Yeah, oh, it could be under the ground.

1378
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,200
- Oh, a cave underground would be great.

1379
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:36,920
- That would not be a cave, that would be a hole.

1380
01:18:36,920 --> 01:18:38,160
- I've been in a hole.

1381
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:39,920
I've never,

1382
01:18:41,400 --> 01:18:45,600
I've never seen a hole in my life and I plan for plan on it neither.

1383
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:50,680
They're just like completely unhelpful, completely stupid, impossible to reason with.

1384
01:18:50,680 --> 01:18:53,320
How are we going to find this fucking cave?

1385
01:18:53,320 --> 01:19:02,080
I put some dirt in my mouth to commune with Dogen the Dirt God.

1386
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:05,120
So you know about like dirt right?

1387
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,040
So it stands to reason you might know about holes in dirt?

1388
01:19:09,040 --> 01:19:11,280
Yeah, pretty much.

1389
01:19:11,280 --> 01:19:13,280
So how about caves? You know, caves?

1390
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,920
Caves? Yeah, I'm pretty familiar with caves.

1391
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,560
I mean, I also I want to I'm getting so sick of it.

1392
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:20,560
Can you just speak normally?

1393
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,520
You know, I've always I've always got to have dirt in my mouth, man.

1394
01:19:24,520 --> 01:19:26,000
That's just sort of how I'm made.

1395
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,960
All right. It's really pissing me off, though.

1396
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:32,520
I mean, I know I'm your paladin, but, you know, I'm asking you nicely to knock it off

1397
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:34,360
because I can't knock it off.

1398
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,360
This is kind of the way I am.

1399
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,360
Well, I'm good.

1400
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:39,400
I'm just not going to commune with you that often then because I mean, which is part of

1401
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,640
OK, I haven't been.

1402
01:19:40,640 --> 01:19:42,200
You know, where's the where's the cave?

1403
01:19:42,200 --> 01:19:42,920
Just tell me that.

1404
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:43,960
But where's you know what?

1405
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:44,600
Right.

1406
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:46,800
Can you write it in the dirt in front of me or something?

1407
01:19:46,800 --> 01:19:49,480
Just make a map of all the caves nearby.

1408
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,240
I just don't want to hear your voice anymore.

1409
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:52,600
OK, me off.

1410
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,920
All right. I'll do.

1411
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:54,600
OK, hold on.

1412
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:55,760
So. All right.

1413
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:58,200
Let me try to get a sense of the area.

1414
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:00,480
And yeah, he sort of is like

1415
01:20:00,480 --> 01:20:02,680
you start to see on the ground in front of you.

1416
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:05,520
Like only you can see it for some reason,

1417
01:20:05,520 --> 01:20:11,440
like a drawing of a cave that is a bit due west of here.

1418
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:17,680
And it's just sort of is like a little hole. And then you see another cave. It's a bit further

1419
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:23,440
north. Those are the two caves. I see about there's like two caves nearby here. Part of the

1420
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:32,000
rock faces around the West. Oh, my God. Okay. I spit out the dirt. I hang up on him. Okay.

1421
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:36,320
OK guys, so there's one cave north and there's one west.

1422
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,480
I don't know which it is, but I think it might be north.

1423
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:43,560
They said they learned about north the other day and they said up first.

1424
01:20:43,560 --> 01:20:45,060
North is kind of up.

1425
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:46,460
That's a good point.

1426
01:20:46,460 --> 01:20:48,460
All right, let's go north.

1427
01:20:48,460 --> 01:20:49,420
All right.

1428
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:54,060
Yeah, and we'll figure out

1429
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:57,120
what that means next time.

1430
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,920
Yeah, that effect.

1431
01:21:01,920 --> 01:21:03,920
Perfect

1432
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:23,920
I go on and on, can't understand how I last so long

1433
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:30,920
I must have super powers, rap 225,000 hours Get a calculator, do the math

1434
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,920
I made a thousand songs that made you move, yeah

1435
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:37,920
And for the last three hundred months I made sixteen albums with me on the front

1436
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:39,920
And they bomb, where you get your beats?

1437
01:21:39,920 --> 01:21:41,920
I heard ninety-three rappers say

1438
01:21:41,920 --> 01:21:51,920
