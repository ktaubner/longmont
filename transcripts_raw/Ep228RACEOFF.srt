1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,800
- Ooh, here we go.

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:13,060
- My life be like.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,120
- That's what you got?

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:15,960
- Yep.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,800
- My life be like.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:17,640
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,720
What do you mean, that's what you got?

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:20,560
- Not headphone headphones.

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,380
- Here's what you have, that's what you got.

11
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,220
- Not headphone headphones.

12
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:24,780
- I'm doing an awesome new face.

13
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,480
- Okay, that's gonna be great on the audio.

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,320
- Yeah.

15
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,640
- Fist bump me, Patrick, and we fist bumped.

16
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,040
- See, that's how you do visual bits.

17
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,300
- Then I will also make a new voice up.

18
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,680
- Okay, go ahead.

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,520
- Wow.

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,320
- That's not new.

21
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,440
- Not really new.

22
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,520
That's new Sullivan voice.

23
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,780
- Oh, here, ah.

24
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,000
Fuck, how many voices are there that I can do even?

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
- You're not even the man of 101 voices.

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,000
Cameron's getting a call.

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,320
- Great, now you're wasting everybody's time.

28
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,240
- Who's wasting, Patrick's the one who said it.

29
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,160
I silenced the call and put it in my pocket.

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,160
What the fuck are you doing?

31
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,760
- This is a bit-- - Chill the fuck out.

32
00:00:58,760 --> 00:00:59,600
- You're right, you're right.

33
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,360
There's a lot of stuff flying around my brain today.

34
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,200
I am too--

35
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,680
- I'm sure I can see it on the surface of your head.

36
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,640
- You can see it, I don't have my hat on because I--

37
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
- You don't even have headphones on.

38
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,340
- I know, I also am feeling-- - We got this new splitter.

39
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,480
- Which, by the way, once we understand my racial history,

40
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,000
I think that this might not age so well,

41
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,080
that you guys denied me headphones.

42
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,320
- We did not, he forgot his headphones.

43
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,920
- And you didn't even ask me to bring you headphones

44
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,520
like I usually, you usually ask me to do and I usually do.

45
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,240
- So you're saying because of my race that I'm stupid.

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,040
- We don't even know it yet.

47
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:32,000
We don't even know what you are.

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,840
The racializer has even--

49
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,440
- It seems like you're saying that about your own race,

50
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,280
which is kind of weird.

51
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,760
- We don't know who mine is yet, who I am.

52
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,600
Who am I?

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,420
We don't know.

54
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,260
- It's true.

55
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,100
- We don't fucking know.

56
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,520
- We have a big, big thing we're doing today.

57
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,480
- In the second half, so stay tuned.

58
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,440
- But in this first half, man, what did you guys eat for?

59
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,680
- We're just gonna shoot the crap.

60
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
- What did you guys eat for breakfast?

61
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,280
- I didn't eat breakfast yet.

62
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,480
- I had a McGriddle.

63
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,040
I was really hungry when I got here,

64
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,040
but I woke up at like 11, so you know how it is.

65
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,200
- Yeah.

66
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,360
- Had to get to work.

67
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,200
- Had to get to work, too.

68
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,020
- I was already late for work.

69
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,860
- Had to clock in.

70
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,160
We should get you a punch-in card.

71
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,000
Wouldn't that be fun?

72
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,820
- Yeah.

73
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,660
- That would be a great idea.

74
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,760
- We could put it up somewhere on here,

75
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,600
and then every episode we begin with me punching it in.

76
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,280
- That looks so much fun in movies.

77
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,120
- Yeah.

78
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,800
- You punch in and prove that you worked there.

79
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,560
- And then they changed it to just like a fucking iPad

80
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,400
in the back of the restaurant.

81
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,220
- I know, man.

82
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,060
- It's so fucked up.

83
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,400
Did you guys see this this it's a lot harder to do time theft that's for sure way harder

84
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:34,860
Oh, yeah, this amazing news story know about the twitch streamer who murdered somebody and he made a fake live stream while he went and

85
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,260
Killed this bitch no bitch. It wasn't a bitch

86
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,220
Okay killed this lady

87
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,260
He went and murdered this woman. She's not beautiful went and murdered this girlfriend his girlfriend this girlfriend

88
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,020
- He made, so he just like played a video through OBS.

89
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,620
- Yeah, he literally played a video on Twitch

90
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,860
and in the video he's like,

91
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:59,260
"By the way guys, my computer is so messed up

92
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,780
"that I can't interact with the chat today."

93
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,700
And people were just like, "Okay."

94
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,180
But yeah. - That's so crazy.

95
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,780
- He almost got away with it,

96
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,500
but there was about 40 CCTV cameras that recorded him

97
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,500
going over to the lady's house at the same time.

98
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,260
- Wow. - So yeah, that's pretty hard.

99
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,100
- Oh, those could have been pre-recorded too.

100
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,940
- That is exactly what I would argue in court.

101
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:25,180
I would say, see this, no video evidence can be submitted in court. It's all fucking useless bullshit.

102
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,180
See? That's actually really smart.

103
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:32,180
What is information? Information doesn't even...

104
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:39,180
Well if I could fool 120, 150 people with a fake video, who's to say you couldn't fool one person?

105
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,180
Exactly. And that's why I killed her, to prove that point.

106
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,180
Uh-huh. Yeah.

107
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,680
And then I would bow.

108
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,180
Yeah.

109
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,220
Most things that people do are to prove a point.

110
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,960
Like this.

111
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,460
Like this.

112
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,460
We did this just to prove a point to somebody.

113
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,700
We started this whole podcast.

114
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,380
That's true.

115
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,340
Prove a point to that--

116
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,580
They said it couldn't be done.

117
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,240
--piece of crap that was doubting us.

118
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,180
Yeah, that's right.

119
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,980
And you know who you are, and we won't say your name, but--

120
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:08,500
why'd you cut to Cameron?

121
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,180
There we go.

122
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,060
That's a high camera.

123
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,900
You-- there's a lot of headroom on that shot.

124
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,940
I could sit up a little more.

125
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:15,780
- Yeah, there you go.

126
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:16,600
- This is how it's supposed to be.

127
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,920
- See, this is what, we're putting the camera like this

128
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,140
to train your posture.

129
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:21,980
- Yeah.

130
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,020
- I need to get a new chair that I can sit in.

131
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,220
I wanna get a lazy boy.

132
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,140
I think I'm at the time in my life

133
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,300
where I need to get a lazy boy

134
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,500
that I can sit and watch golf in.

135
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,960
- I think I need to be put into basically a saw trap

136
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,020
to fix my posture.

137
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,860
- Yeah.

138
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,780
- You know the one where it goes on their face

139
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,840
and it opens their mouth really wide?

140
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,820
- What?

141
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,220
- Have you not seen Saw?

142
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,100
- I think he would be too afraid of it.

143
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,940
- All of them?

144
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,780
- He's too afraid of it.

145
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,140
- I think the iconic saw, the one where it's the reverse bear trap.

146
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,940
- Yeah.

147
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,300
- Oh, I don't remember that. I've only seen the TV version.

148
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,780
- I think that's literally in all of them.

149
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,780
- I've only seen the TV version.

150
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,780
- He's afraid of saw.

151
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
- I guess they take out all the traps in the TV version.

152
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,780
- Yeah.

153
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,100
- It's just like, "How do we get out of this bathroom?"

154
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,580
And Jigsaw comes on and he's like, "There's one thing you need to do."

155
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,580
And then it cuts to them.

156
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:05,620
- It cuts to the end of the movie.

157
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,860
- I need to be put into this to fix my back, I think.

158
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,380
- A reverse bear trap?

159
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:10,780
- Yeah.

160
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:13,100
- Yeah, I wanna get an inversion table.

161
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,940
- Yeah. - What's that?

162
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,900
- Yeah, it's a table where it goes upside down

163
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,980
and it hangs you.

164
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,580
It's like you ever done-- - Oh, I've seen those.

165
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,540
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah.

166
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,540
- And it pulls all the blood in your head.

167
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,740
- Does it do anything? - Until you die.

168
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,460
It kills you if you stay on for hours.

169
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,340
- Yeah. - You can die

170
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,900
if you fall asleep on it.

171
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,380
But that's true of everything I said.

172
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,900
- Then why do bats fall asleep upside down?

173
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,940
- Because their heads, or their brains,

174
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,940
are in their bottoms. - Oh.

175
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,180
- They're reverse people. - Okay.

176
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,260
there were a lot of it we had a good answer and i think that's not how i

177
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,740
had a yeah i know the results later one of you could be a reverse person uh...

178
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:50,900
that usually test for that and also be a little bit of a little further result

179
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,020
it would be a positive view of course person listen

180
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,780
reserve we can't get into the

181
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,740
back we're just we're literally how do you know how do you know you're not a

182
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,900
reserve of reversing

183
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,080
i might be but i was a it's impossible for caleb to be

184
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,660
because a reverse person person is you remember whatever person is read all

185
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,580
talked about it before. Not on the podcast. We've had a long conversation. That's why I

186
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,140
say we can't get into this. Oh, we have talked about reverse persons. Yeah, a reverse person

187
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:22,060
is somebody who they are their hair and their body is their hair. Now I remember. And they're

188
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,580
upside down. So Marge Simpson. We brought it up because Marge Simpson is blue. She's actually the

189
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:33,020
blue part and the yellow stuff is her hair. And that's the yellow hair that's on the bottom of

190
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,540
her. That's a reverse person. By the way, that's why it's not possible for Caleb to be a reverse

191
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:42,540
That, by the way, is the kind of conversation that we have that we aren't doing for the podcast.

192
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,540
When we sit around...

193
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,540
That's what we do when we turn the microphones off.

194
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,540
That's right.

195
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,540
I just assumed that we did that on the show.

196
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,540
No, we haven't.

197
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,540
We've never talked about that.

198
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,540
I've probably clocked, like if I had steam time, like steam play time on talking about reverse people,

199
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,540
it would probably be two and a half hours.

200
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
Yeah.

201
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:04,540
We talked about reverse people for like the entirety of Texas.

202
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:09,900
It wasn't even that no we were this was no reverse people was when we dropped Patrick off at the skate park

203
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm that bridge the cool one. Yeah, oh

204
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,380
Here's just walked it around a lake a beautiful

205
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,380
Reverse person homie. I'm the blue stuff up top. Yeah, and my hair is yellow

206
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:25,340
I remember I was like skating FDR that was like a

207
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:28,380
Childhood dream of mine, and then you guys come over

208
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:33,900
Yeah, you say you come up to me and say Patrick. We got it go there's

209
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,380
is an amazing idea that we just had.

210
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,020
Yeah.

211
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:39,820
And the best part about that is that you would think like--

212
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,620
you'd be like, oh, well, that's kind of like, you know,

213
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,020
you're sitting in a bus for days and days.

214
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,140
It was day one.

215
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:46,220
It was day one.

216
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,180
Day one.

217
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,060
We were like four hours into the trip.

218
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:49,560
Yeah.

219
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,180
And we just got to Philadelphia, and we were like,

220
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,300
I'm a reverse person, homie.

221
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,420
Just making no sense, dude.

222
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Man.

223
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:57,940
Yeah.

224
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,500
You got to get back on the road.

225
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,020
I know.

226
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,820
It really does amazing things to your brain.

227
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:06,820
- I feel like Jeremy Renner at the end of "Hurt Locker."

228
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,660
- Yeah.

229
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:10,820
- When he's like, "There's 16 more people dead

230
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,180
in Afghanistan," and then it just cuts to him on the road.

231
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,740
- Oh, we should make a movie with you called

232
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,180
"The Fart Locker."

233
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,580
- Yeah, "The Squirt Plurker."

234
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,420
- Doesn't make any sense.

235
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,240
- That's not, that's not.

236
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,860
- Yep, and it's a random movie, starring cheese.

237
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,100
(laughing)

238
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:30,540
Directed by sport.

239
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:36,500
actually like this now. What would happen in the random movie? What was it called? The Sporklerker?

240
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,500
The Sporkliker. Oh, Sporkliker. But it's like Loiker. You know you should put in that Miranda

241
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,700
Sings. Put her in there. I thought you were going to say Miranda Cosgrove. Both of them.

242
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,860
Both of them. Bofa. Bofa. Put both of them in. And that's the main character's name is

243
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:55,900
Bofa. And there's a lot of hilarious situations that he gets into because of his name. That

244
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,400
That would be a funny movie to have a character named Bofa, and it could be called "Bofa

245
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,580
Deez Adventures" and he has two adventures during the movie.

246
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,580
I met a guy...

247
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:10,540
It's a documentary about the only guy ever to have two adventures in one day.

248
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:14,860
Right when you think the movie's over, he's got to start his second adventure.

249
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:18,460
I met a guy this weekend named Draven.

250
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Draven?

251
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,460
Like from League of Legends?

252
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,460
I don't know, man.

253
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
I got scared.

254
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:27,380
Two Dravens I can think of, there's a Draven in League of Legends and Draven is the name

255
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,060
is Brandon Lee's name in the Crow I think.

256
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,100
Oh and Draven Cosgrove.

257
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,100
And Draven Cosgrove.

258
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,100
And also this guy Draven that I met in League of Legends.

259
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,100
Miranda Cosgrove.

260
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,100
So that's a third Draven.

261
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:39,300
Miranda Cosgrove's husband.

262
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:43,300
It was really, you know when somebody tells you, you know when you're like hey nice to

263
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,820
meet you what's your name and someone just takes you so just off guard with their name.

264
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,260
I had that and he was like, I'm Caleb and he was like I'm Draven and I went oh.

265
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,140
that and I was like oh that's rude yeah shouldn't when somebody tells you the

266
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,840
name you shouldn't go like oh what okay hell is your name

267
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,980
Draven I've had a few of those yeah people doing that where's no no what's

268
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,420
your what's the worst name you've ever seen somebody have not the worst my

269
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:13,940
worst my worst reaction my worst reaction was when and this I think we

270
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:17,540
met this guy on tour so if you're listening shut out beating a guy named

271
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:23,700
Jafar. Oh my God. Yeah. I bet we met at Jafar. Was that in Seattle? My worst reaction was

272
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,900
that I made him show me his ID. Yeah. That was in Seattle, right? Which is probably not

273
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,960
a good thing to do. No. Yeah. No, but I had to. There was like two months. Jafar. Two

274
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:42,100
months during COVID where we were just obsessed with Jafar. Yeah. Jafar's a funny character.

275
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:46,340
Dude, Jafar is good looking. He would be, if he was in New York City, he'd be walking

276
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,340
for Balenciaga.

277
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,340
Oh, he would.

278
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Absolutely.

279
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,340
Yeah, he's skinny.

280
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,300
I mean, and perfect too, because they're satanic as fuck.

281
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,300
Yeah.

282
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:01,500
Oh, speaking of Satan, I got really into this morning, I really got into the Jesus Twins.

283
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,620
They were this really bad musical act that just walked into Howard Stern one day, and

284
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,940
they were like, "You got to let us on the air, Howard."

285
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,180
And he was like, "Okay, whatever."

286
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:15,580
And they just started talking about how they were going to be famous musicians and shit,

287
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,940
and he was like, "Okay, we'll play a song."

288
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,740
And they played like the worst song ever.

289
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,260
And then they kept coming on Howard Stern

290
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,660
until eventually, it had been like a couple years

291
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,980
since they'd come on.

292
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,740
And then one of them just like walked in just alone

293
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,140
and he had like a shaved head.

294
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,980
And they were like, "Hey, you're one of the Jesus Twins."

295
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,460
He was like, "No, I'm not the Jesus Twins, I'm Satan."

296
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,820
And he like sat.

297
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,860
- Dude, that's the opposite of Clipse.

298
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,700
- Yeah.

299
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,940
(laughing)

300
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,940
- He went from no malice to malice.

301
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,180
(laughing)

302
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:53,520
That is incredible. It was a reverse clips. They did a reverse clip and he like

303
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:58,360
walks and he sits down in on the Howard Stern show and they're all like so Jesus

304
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:03,440
twin like it's so crazy I haven't seen you in years and he's like uh-huh uh-huh

305
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,840
and they're like so where'd you come from like what brought you here and he's

306
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:10,480
like I was in a mental hospital in Long Island and I just ran out of it yesterday

307
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,480
and he just escaped a mental hospital and then a couple years ago he got shot and killed by the police.

308
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Pretty amazing story.

309
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,480
That is incredible.

310
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,480
The Jesus Twins.

311
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,480
That needs to be a movie.

312
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,480
What happened to the other twin?

313
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,480
He is alone. He doesn't have his brother anymore.

314
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Okay.

315
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Yeah, it's pretty sad.

316
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
That is sad.

317
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
And he's an atheist now.

318
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,480
He's agnostic.

319
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
I think I would be agnostic about that.

320
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
Oh, actually there was an appearance between the one where he was crazy and when he killed himself,

321
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,360
or when he died with a cop's gun,

322
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,640
where they both came back in and they were like,

323
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,480
yeah, we're back to being the Jesus twins

324
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,780
and I'm not Satan anymore.

325
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,280
(laughing)

326
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,480
- Wow. - It's pretty awesome.

327
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,280
Yeah, and then they got banned for saying

328
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,160
something anti-Semitic to Howard Stern.

329
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,320
- Ah, yeah. - Damn.

330
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,560
- Which is Jesus twins, Jesus was a Jew.

331
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,160
- Yeah. - That's actually true.

332
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,160
- Yeah, so I don't get how you could call yourself

333
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,560
a Jesus twin.

334
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,420
- What did they say to Howard Stern?

335
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,520
- They said something that I can't, well,

336
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,880
I'm, you know what, let me find out what my DNA results are

337
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,120
and then I'll decide whether or not

338
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,600
I tell you what they say to Howard Stern.

339
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,680
- Okay. - Okay?

340
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,640
- So I'll remember that. - It would suck to be

341
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,520
the Jesus twin that didn't become Satan,

342
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,760
especially if you're brother, if he was flip-flopping.

343
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,600
- Yeah. - If he was like,

344
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,800
and I'd have to, I'd call him up and I'd be like,

345
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,000
"Hey buddy, are you Satan today?"

346
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:24,960
- Yeah. - "You wanna hang out?"

347
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,920
But before I come over, tell me the truth,

348
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,760
level with me. - You gotta tell me.

349
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,600
- Are you Satan today? - Be real in the day.

350
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,240
- You know what would suck though is you're

351
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,760
somebody who believes that you are now like Satan or you're possessed by like or

352
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,300
you are you've become some biblical entity but it's just like one of the

353
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:47,000
fucking side characters you know yeah like yeah I don't Job I'm Job or I'm like

354
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,220
what world is this place is Job a side character who's okay interesting I don't

355
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:56,920
know too much about the Bible I can tell I think Jesus is the main guy he's the

356
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,120
guy that most people think they're the second coming he's only in half of it

357
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:03,280
the guy the guy that everyone thinks that they're the second coming of and

358
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,880
- And he's in the bad part of it.

359
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,600
- But who, like, in the, like,

360
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,600
oh yeah, I'm the second coming of Peter.

361
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,400
- Peter is a massively important character in the Bible.

362
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,560
- Okay, then who's the least important character

363
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,400
in the Bible?

364
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,880
- Probably one of the fucking girls, I don't know.

365
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,760
- Yeah, okay, then saying that, like, you know,

366
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,840
I've been--

367
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,760
- Bathsheba.

368
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,640
- Yeah, Bathsheba, okay.

369
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,080
- Bathsheba, fuck her, she's a hoe.

370
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:30,000
- Yeah, I'm the second coming of Bathsheba.

371
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,360
- Get this about Bathsheba, man,

372
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,600
she took a shower outside.

373
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,200
- Oh, and that's where the word bath comes from?

374
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,200
- I don't think so.

375
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,040
- No.

376
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,240
- But Bathsheba also is represented,

377
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,560
there's an episode of Veggie Tales where,

378
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,600
and the whole thing with Bathsheba

379
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,280
is that she tempted a guy into fucking her,

380
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,720
and yeah, and cheating on her husband,

381
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,640
and it goes really bad.

382
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,920
But in the Veggie Tales version,

383
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,520
they were like, man, we have to tell that story.

384
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,640
There's so many stories in the Bible,

385
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:56,680
but we have to tell that one

386
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,280
about this guy fucking this girl.

387
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,160
So instead of sex, instead of this girl's,

388
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,700
or this guy's wife that this guy wants to have sex with,

389
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,080
will make it a rubber ducky that he's taking a bath with.

390
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
And so that's what the--

391
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,760
- Oh yeah, don't covet.

392
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:09,600
- Yeah. - Yeah.

393
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,960
- Yeah, don't covet that ducky.

394
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,640
- Yeah. - Yeah, but Larry.

395
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,080
Larry covets the duck.

396
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,960
- I'm really glad that VeggieTales was covering coveting.

397
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,720
- Do you guys know the one, the really good Bible verse

398
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,360
about the bald-headed guy and the bears?

399
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,440
- Where he kills a bear?

400
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,400
- That's him on Fire Island.

401
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,240
- No, but VeggieTales should adapt this one.

402
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,120
Here, Jubio, search.

403
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,820
Search, if you guys haven't read this Bible,

404
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,400
this is like the best Bible, search Bible verse.

405
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,040
I think it's Elijah, search Elijah Bear.

406
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,640
- Does he, wait, does the bear kill a bunch of kids

407
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,480
or something? - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

408
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,780
Here, click this, here, I'll read this.

409
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,720
Then he went up from there to Bethel,

410
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,120
and as he was going up, by the way,

411
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,120
young lads came out from the city and mocked him

412
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,040
and said to him, "Go up, you bald head,

413
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,400
"go up, you bald head."

414
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,720
- Come on. - When he looked behind him

415
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,040
and saw them, he cursed them in the name of the Lord.

416
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,960
Then two female bears came out of the woods

417
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,280
and tore up 42 lads of their number.

418
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,520
(laughing)

419
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,360
- Wow.

420
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
- And he went from there to Mount Carmel

421
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,920
and from there he returned to Samaria.

422
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,040
- That is the most amazing thing ever.

423
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,160
You kill 40 kids and you go to Mount Carmel?

424
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,000
(laughing)

425
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,960
- Yeah, Candy Mountain.

426
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,880
- Two female bears came out of the woods

427
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,680
and tore up 42 lads.

428
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
- Yeah, two female bears.

429
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,840
Yeah, fucking Burt Kreischer and Tom Segura.

430
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
- Yeah.

431
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,920
- That's right.

432
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,240
We need to move to Los Angeles

433
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,280
and have a video podcast of us in Los Angeles

434
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,400
where we have on just random fucking guys.

435
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:34,320
- The LA, the LA creme de la creme.

436
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,440
- We need to link up with Bobby Lee Wright.

437
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,600
- Oh yeah. - Oh man.

438
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,440
- Yeah, that would be good.

439
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,200
- I would do anything to link up with Bobby Lee

440
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,520
and have him tell me some story.

441
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,600
- Yeah. - About Jordan Peele.

442
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,920
- Damn. - Yeah.

443
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,680
- Yeah, now I'm just thinking about the possibilities

444
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,000
if we lived in LA.

445
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
- Oh my God.

446
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,760
- We could maybe even become famous actors or musicians

447
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,720
in Beverly Hills. - We could go to Los Feliz.

448
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,240
- Holy shit, man, we could surf.

449
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,440
- Yeah. - We could be surfers.

450
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,520
- We could go to-- - Oh my god.

451
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,560
- We could go to a coffee shop and go like this.

452
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,040
- We could wake, guys, we could wake up every day.

453
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,880
- Type in the coffee shop.

454
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,720
- We need to move to Los Angeles, it's perfect.

455
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,920
- We could go to Silver Lake.

456
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,240
- We could wake up in Silver Lake or Echo Park

457
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
and we could walk down to our coffee shop.

458
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,720
- Wake up to Silver Lake. - We could get a oat milk

459
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,280
soy latte. - Go to Hollywood.

460
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,680
- Then go to Beverly Hills. - Yes.

461
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,080
- We could go to Inglewood. - Pasadena.

462
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,560
- Mm-hmm.

463
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,240
- The Palisades. - Then we gotta go to Inglewood,

464
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,840
- We gotta give the hood some love.

465
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,680
- We gotta go to Compton.

466
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,680
- There we go to Ladera Heights.

467
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,200
- And then we could go up to Seattle.

468
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,040
- That's too far, man.

469
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,240
- That's on a train, though.

470
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,000
- But we could go up there.

471
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,840
- We could take another-- - 'Cause we're on the

472
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,680
same coast, so we could go up there.

473
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,120
- You could take a four-hour train ride to Oakland.

474
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,880
- And then we'll take another train ride from there

475
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,720
to Seattle. - Go to Emeryville.

476
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
Emeryville, a beautiful city.

477
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,640
- And then we'll go down to--

478
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,720
- Pixar in Emeryville.

479
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,240
- Why are you talking like this right now?

480
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,080
- Emeryville's in Pixar.

481
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:48,900
- Why are you talking about Pixar?

482
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,960
- Emeryville and Oakland.

483
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,800
- Why are you doing that?

484
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,720
- We're talking about Los Angeles stuff.

485
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,640
- But why are you not--

486
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,920
- I'm doing an LA accent.

487
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,060
- You're not saying anything.

488
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,520
This is just, you're talking weird today.

489
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,600
- I'm not talking weird today.

490
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,440
- Yeah, you are.

491
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,320
You keep being like, also you're doing this.

492
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,640
You're punctuating everything by tapping.

493
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,800
- I do that all the time.

494
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,680
I don't know why. - I know, that's new.

495
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,520
That's been a new thing with you.

496
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,560
- I don't know why I do that.

497
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,360
- You've changed so much since I've known you.

498
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,240
You've gone through so many different phases

499
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,960
of the way that you act.

500
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,800
- Yeah.

501
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,000
- Yeah, and now you're in this one.

502
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,360
- And now, listen.

503
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
- It's 'cause of the video.

504
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:21,000
After we've seen you change, today is the day you're gonna see us change.

505
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Mm-hmm.

506
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Into a different color.

507
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
We're gonna completely...

508
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
You know what?

509
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
My life is gonna change today.

510
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Speaking of, I don't know if anyone wants this.

511
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Your Discover card?

512
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Nope.

513
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Here, show that.

514
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,240
I have a Clipper card with 775 on it.

515
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,160
So if you need to ride the bus in Emeryville...

516
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
What's a Clipper card?

517
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,840
It's how you get on the bus.

518
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,840
It's not a haircut?

519
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,080
See, you did it again!

520
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,080
You hit the table again to finish your sentence.

521
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,080
I think it's because I'm in the corner.

522
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
It's how you get on the bus.

523
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,080
What is that? I don't know why, but it helps me speak.

524
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,080
You know what happened?

525
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,080
We were talking about clips earlier.

526
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,080
He's trying to do grinding.

527
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Oh true, let me get you a pencil.

528
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,080
I used to do that, but I had the worst rhythm ever.

529
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,080
(laughter)

530
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,080
(rhythmic beat)

531
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,080
Yo Caleb, play the grinding beat.

532
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,080
Yeah, I got you guys.

533
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,080
(rhythmic beat)

534
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,080
It was pretty awesome, and basically

535
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Basically everybody thought that I was gangsta.

536
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,080
Yeah I would do it and I would just go like, "Ow!"

537
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,080
(Laughter)

538
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,080
"Ahh! Fuck off!"

539
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,080
I played it too hard dude.

540
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,080
"Ow! My finger!"

541
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,080
I don't think I can do the grind 'em beat anymore guys.

542
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,080
They need to make more songs that you can use a desk to create.

543
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,080
I'll say it man.

544
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,080
There's still pen tapper guys.

545
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,080
There's still guys who are really into...

546
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,080
Do you guys remember...

547
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:41,080
Do they still do when they do the harder, better, faster, stronger on your fingers?

548
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,080
No, but they need...

549
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,080
They need a fucking song to do that again.

550
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,360
Oh yeah, you're right.

551
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,200
What was that called?

552
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,020
What was that video?

553
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:48,860
Finger banging.

554
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,700
Finger bangers.

555
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,520
But they did it with like,

556
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,440
there was like other songs

557
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,280
where they would do it with multiple people too.

558
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,120
Yeah, yeah.

559
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,040
That's what I'm saying, that needs to come back.

560
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,880
Yeah, this is what it was.

561
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,960
Work it.

562
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,200
Work it.

563
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,080
Do it.

564
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,920
Work it's easy, that's work it.

565
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,760
You know, yeah.

566
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,580
I could do that.

567
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:04,400
It's gotta be Daft Punk songs, right?

568
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,760
'Cause that's what the--

569
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,040
Well you could do any song though

570
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:07,880
that has a lot of words in it.

571
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:08,800
I was gonna say,

572
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,440
I was gonna say you try to do that with--

573
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,280
Rap God.

574
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,120
superheroes by Daft Punk. No, you should do a rap god. There's three lyrics in that song.

575
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,960
Yeah. Barry Manilow's single. Rap god would be the best one, man.

576
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,800
Rap god would be... Here's what I would do. I'd go, right when he starts rapping, I'd

577
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:26,760
turn around and the entire... I'd be on my back.

578
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,760
That's a great idea. That's pretty funny. And then just the front just says, "I'm

579
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,440
beginning to feel like a rap god, rap god." Yeah. And then you'd cover up rap god.

580
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,240
And then on this side it says Eminem on this arm. He doesn't ever go Eminem.

581
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,840
I don't know, Eminem, Rap God, featuring...

582
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,640
Who's it featuring?

583
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:45,640
The other guy.

584
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,040
You know who needs to link up with Eminem, dude?

585
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,840
The most amazing combination in the world is Eminem and Sia.

586
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,540
My two favorite artists when they...

587
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,140
My mom and dad, for real.

588
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,840
They are my mom and my dad.

589
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,240
For real, for real, parent vibes.

590
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,140
Have you guys seen what Eminem looks like now?

591
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,740
He looks like he's in disguise all the time.

592
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,040
Yeah.

593
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,440
He always has, he looks like he's got...

594
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
He dyes his beard dark.

595
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,920
- He's got a completely black facial hair

596
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,240
and like a fucking camo army hat.

597
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,560
- Yeah.

598
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,040
- And he walks around and he says he's sorry to Haley.

599
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,840
And I don't know who the fuck Haley is.

600
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:19,520
- Haley is a barista he yelled at.

601
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
- Oh, okay, that makes a lot more sense.

602
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,600
- I thought it was Haley's Comet.

603
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,440
- Yeah.

604
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,480
- He should do a cover of that song.

605
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,320
- The Shine Down song?

606
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,720
♪ I just saw Haley's Comet ♪

607
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,800
- You know I saw them live?

608
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,640
- Yeah.

609
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,160
- As the lyric of that song, I just saw Haley's Comet.

610
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,000
♪ I just saw Haley's Comet ♪

611
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,260
I should do a bunch of thoughts that are just things they see. I went to go see

612
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:40,880
the- I just saw the- Walrus and Gromit. Walrus and Gromit. Walrus.

613
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,400
I was like, I saw the moon. I saw a constellation. I drove four hours to

614
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,640
Charlotte to go see a shine down with my cousin and Chad. You guys know Chad. I

615
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:55,080
brought Chad with me and we went, we got there and me and my cousin went in.

616
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,640
And that's the virgin. And Chad didn't, my buddy Chad didn't have a, he didn't

617
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,800
have a ticket, but he was like, I'll just buy one when we get there and he's

618
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,320
he was like 16 and we get there and the guy was scalping him he was like how

619
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,680
much for a ticket the guy said $250 and so Chad was like okay I'm just gonna sit

620
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,920
in the car while the concert and so we went we enjoyed the concert it was

621
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,960
completely incredible. Did he drive? No no so we went back and he was in the back of my dad's

622
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,240
Suburban he was completely naked asleep in the back. It was like the middle of

623
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,800
summer it's like a hundred and five degrees outside and I didn't leave the

624
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:33,200
keys with him so he just like sweat to death and had a heat stroke in the back of the car.

625
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,960
It was pretty incredible dude. Wow. He just drove home man. Yeah. Yeah. He had a great

626
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:43,920
time. He has to have. Yeah. Well. You wanna start racializing? I think it's time to start

627
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:49,360
race off. Oh my god. Ladies and gentlemen. We have the machine here. The racializer. Welcome

628
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,960
into the race off. This is the racializer. This is how we will be.

629
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,440
It scans DNA. It does scan DNA.

630
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,400
And we have two DNA samples. We have one sample that's been pre-scanned,

631
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,600
I believe, that we wanted to start with. Patrick has already had his.

632
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:12,920
Oh yeah. So the background here. Me and Caleb, we don't know our DNA statistics.

633
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:16,840
Patrick already knows his. So me and Caleb will be having a race off.

634
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,840
I didn't even get a DNA sample, I just know it based on feeling.

635
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Uh-huh, and he has a vibe check, I guess.

636
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,840
What the hell is he on about?

637
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
He's gonna do his vibe.

638
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
My vibe.

639
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:29,840
First.

640
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,840
So, we're gonna...

641
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,840
And then we're gonna go through and we're gonna actually figure out...

642
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,840
It's basically gonna be a competition.

643
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,840
Scientifically, it will be a competition.

644
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,840
But Patrick is gonna serve as our control because we're pretty sure of what he's got going on.

645
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Could you go over to Patrick's control DNA report?

646
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Yeah, he is the control group.

647
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,040
All right. So this is my DNA report. I'm in control of the experiment. Yeah.

648
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,680
And the clicker does not work.

649
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:58,320
It's not on. Now it's on.

650
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,720
You know, 99 percent British and Irish.

651
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,760
Ninety nine point nine percent. Ninety nine point nine percent. Yeah. Wow. Yeah.

652
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,640
What does that feel like, man? What does that say? Yeah.

653
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:15,800
What is the 99.9? There's a new gray. There's a gray thing.

654
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:26,560
0.1% I cannot see what that says. What? 0.1% bullfrog? Bullfrog? When was that

655
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:32,720
updated? July 15th? Yeah I haven't looked at this in a while. Bullfrog? Click open the

656
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,540
like the drop-down. Ribbit ribbit ribbit ribbit ribbit ribbit croak ribbit ribbit

657
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:44,040
croak croak croak. And do you understand what that means? I don't know I don't speak a

658
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:53,360
a lick of bullfrog. A lick? I don't speak like one of these. Yeah, I guess. You bullfrog?

659
00:24:53,360 --> 00:25:00,280
I guess this makes sense. This is a picture of my mom and dad. That, okay. And that came

660
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:05,760
up on 23andMe? Yeah. Okay, I would like to say that actually does look a lot like your

661
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,000
(laughter)

662
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,340
- That looks just like your fucking dad, dude.

663
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,000
That is what I imagine when I think of your dad.

664
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,680
Your mom looks like that with no mustache, pretty much.

665
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,180
- And then there's my grandpa.

666
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:21,880
- Okay, alright.

667
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:25,960
- Well, I thought you'd be able to see the slides better.

668
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,760
I thought we'd be able to look at all the places

669
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,080
that I've tested.

670
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:30,920
- Well, it's always the small.

671
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,520
- I guess it's really small, yeah.

672
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,880
- You need to make it big when you--

673
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,720
- Oh, here we go.

674
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
- We have a system for you, I'm making you bake for us.

675
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,200
- So all the people who are watching and listening

676
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,940
in the UK or whatever can say like,

677
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,280
oh yeah, he has a county--

678
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,200
- County mayo. - County mayo vibes.

679
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,560
- Bro, you're county mayo?

680
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,200
- Okay, no surprises there, right?

681
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,360
- Yeah, county cork, yeah,

682
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,040
'cause all the wine I've been drinking.

683
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:56,000
- County Kerry, kind of John Kerry, Jim Kerry vibes.

684
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,240
County limerick. - Can you move over

685
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,720
to the UK, the UK here?

686
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,280
- Who gives a fuck about the UK?

687
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,960
- Well, I wanna see what parts of the UK--

688
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,080
- I thought you hate the UK.

689
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,840
Well yeah, but like, I don't know, maybe it's very,

690
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,880
oh okay, looks like I've got some Scottish in me.

691
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,560
You got some Manch in you, some Manchester?

692
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,400
That is amazing.

693
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,620
Morrissey vibes.

694
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,340
Yeah, no doubt.

695
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,180
Wick.

696
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,020
Wick.

697
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:17,840
Wick.

698
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,360
You're from a place called Wick?

699
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,200
Oh, Newcastle-

700
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,020
It's Scandor Wick.

701
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,240
Newcastle-Upon-Tyne.

702
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,840
There, I got a lot of DMs from somebody

703
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,080
who kept asking me if I've tested

704
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,320
for Newcastle-Upon-Tyne for some reason.

705
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,920
What are you talking about?

706
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,080
Somebody kept asking me, I forget who they are,

707
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,980
but that's gonna be really exciting for them.

708
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,420
- I don't think that anybody's gonna care

709
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,380
all that much, if I'm being honest.

710
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,100
- One person, and they'll say it,

711
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
and they'll message me and say,

712
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,540
"Thank you for finally answering it."

713
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:43,500
- All right, well that's amazing.

714
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,620
So you're 99.9% human.

715
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,940
- And I'm a little bit bullfrog.

716
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,540
- And a little bit bullfrog.

717
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,140
Thank you so much for that.

718
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,900
- I guess that must be very recessive.

719
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,780
Your dad was a frog, and you're 0.1% frog.

720
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,500
- Yeah, you look way more like your mom.

721
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,620
You favor your mom in a major way.

722
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,780
So let's go ahead and put our samples in the racializer.

723
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,620
I got my blood sample right here.

724
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,460
I'm ready to put it in the racializer.

725
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,060
Cameron, you want to grab your sample?

726
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,620
Yeah, sure, hold up.

727
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,420
Cameron, you're supposed to bring blood.

728
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,920
That's my blood.

729
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
That's your blood?

730
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,920
This is blood?

731
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,460
This came out of you with a syringe?

732
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,900
Yeah, well, not with a syringe, but yeah.

733
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:19,060
It's stark off-white.

734
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,020
Well, it's old.

735
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,220
And there's not that much of it.

736
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,340
It was sun, it got sun bleached.

737
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,460
Got sun bleached?

738
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,660
Well, I knew what we were going to do

739
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,420
is I got the sample a few weeks ago.

740
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,700
I left it in my backyard.

741
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,500
and I was actually full when I...

742
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:38,900
- Yeah, it's blood.

743
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,300
That's pretty obvious, it's blood.

744
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,420
Yeah.

745
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,780
All right, so let's apply this.

746
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,260
- Yeah, let's hook these up to the...

747
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,340
- Oh, wow.

748
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,280
The cables here.

749
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,500
- Yeah, go ahead, Pat.

750
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,540
- Who's going first?

751
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,900
- Well, we need it, we should,

752
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,580
I guess, yeah, we can do Cameron's first, right?

753
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,500
- Okay. - We're gonna do mine first.

754
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,580
Do we?

755
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,380
Oh, wait, well, first, actually,

756
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,700
we have a surprise for you. Yeah, here, give me a second. We have a surprise for

757
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,900
you. So guys, here's the thing, this race off thing, the whole point of this, right,

758
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,420
is that it has to be a competition. Yeah. Right? We want to see who wins, okay? So we

759
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:18,420
thought, man, that's really hard to do if we don't have kind of an established

760
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:25,340
ranking. Okay. Okay? So obviously me and Cameron, we're gonna be a little bit

761
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:31,340
biased because we're trying to win. So Patrick, we made this for you. This is

762
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,100
Patrick's race ranking.

763
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:50,340
Hold on, let me move the ratio later really quickly. So this is your

764
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,900
race ranking. So this, you know, we've heard you talk about wanting to do

765
00:28:53,900 --> 00:29:00,060
this before. So, Pat, we have to... Wait, wait, wait. So I have to do this before? This is how we

766
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:03,260
get... We have to figure out what the points are going to be. So here, there's some

767
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:08,620
numbers in here. So these all have point values, okay? So these are point values

768
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:13,060
that you have to associate with these. So these go all the way from 2 to negative

769
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:21,740
23. Yeah, so... You can put it down on the table. It'll be visible. You have positive 2 all the way down to

770
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,740
-23. -Okay.

771
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:28,740
Okay, so that's, if you give it a positive 2, that'll be plus 2 points.

772
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,740
-Yeah, I can -12. There's a lot of numbers in here.

773
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,740
-Yeah, there's 24. And you also have a free space here. -And you have a free space, which means that you can make up whatever you,

774
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:40,740
just pick anyone that isn't on the board and you can give them a, kind of a wild card.

775
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,740
-Oh yeah. -So here we have a rating. -An official -23?

776
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:46,740
-So let's just go across. -I get a 22, I think. -A 22, I think.

777
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,740
-My is the lowest one. -Yeah, this is the lowest one.

778
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,940
So French gets negative 22 points.

779
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,820
So let's hope we don't pop French.

780
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,500
That's going to be a bad, bad news.

781
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,780
Yeah, that's going to be rough.

782
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,420
That's going to be terrible for you.

783
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,500
We got-- here, can we just go in order from left to right?

784
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,300
Egyptian.

785
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,940
Egyptian.

786
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,420
What are we giving Egyptian?

787
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:03,920
Um--

788
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,660
And remember, there's only--

789
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:11,700
Let's go plus 2.

790
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,140
Plus 2 for Egyptian.

791
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,660
All right, so Egyptian is the highest.

792
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,500
That's the highest.

793
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,780
That's the highest you can get.

794
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,980
So now Irish.

795
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,980
Irish, I mean, you know.

796
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,100
You're going to give me-- all right.

797
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:24,580
Just so you know, Patrick, there also

798
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:31,460
is Indigenous American, Spanish, Moroccan, Somali, Saudi

799
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,020
Arabian, Mexican, and Korean.

800
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,420
And you've just used two of your positive values.

801
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:44,780
You've got a long way to go, Pat.

802
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:49,080
So, okay, so free space is one.

803
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,660
So what are you filling in?

804
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,020
- Oh, that's just, I mean, that's just there.

805
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,500
- Okay, so that's just to get rid of it.

806
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,460
- Oh yeah.

807
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,500
- All right, so now every other value

808
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,340
is gonna be negative.

809
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,300
- Next is British.

810
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,420
- So it's only negative.

811
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,300
- Yeah, yeah.

812
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,620
So British, what are you giving British?

813
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,900
Negative 21, I like that.

814
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,740
- Okay, all right.

815
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,560
- I like that move.

816
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,400
- Yep, all right.

817
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,380
- Indigenous American.

818
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,840
(laughter)

819
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,420
- Negative one, interesting.

820
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,420
So you think the indigenous Americans are the negative.

821
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,260
- You should lose points to be a negative.

822
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,420
- At this point, honestly, there's no way I can win this.

823
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,100
(laughter)

824
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:27,940
Optically.

825
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:31,540
There's no way I can put anything on here

826
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,580
that'll make me look good or bad.

827
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,780
Everything that I do will be questioned.

828
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,780
So what is happening right now is a complete randomization.

829
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,340
I have no--

830
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,220
So you don't even think that there--

831
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:49,100
I don't care if you're black, white, purple, or yellow.

832
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,980
OK.

833
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,100
All right, Spanish is up next.

834
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:55,260
OK, let's go.

835
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,460
I just saw you reach for the negative 3

836
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:59,500
and then got the 16 because you remembered

837
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,660
that Spain is in Europe.

838
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:05,340
All right, then we gave French negative 22.

839
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,300
Now we have Finnish.

840
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:06,820
Finnish.

841
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,300
Finnish.

842
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,900
I want to finish this whole thing.

843
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,520
Yeah, you want to finish off the people of Finland.

844
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,020
So go ahead and give them--

845
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,160
negative 7, OK, I like it.

846
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:14,660
Interesting.

847
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,160
Portuguese.

848
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,000
All right, Portuguese.

849
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,080
Portuguese, yeah.

850
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,600
Negative 19.

851
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,080
OK, Algerian.

852
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,840
Yeah, what are we thinking about Algerian?

853
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,120
Negative 14.

854
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,200
Interesting.

855
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,580
Cypriot from Cyprus.

856
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,560
OK, don't know too much about them.

857
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,360
So I mean, my opinion is going to--

858
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,560
Negative 2, wow.

859
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,160
Negative 2, wow.

860
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,200
All right, Pole of Not--

861
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,800
from not knowing that much about them.

862
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,240
All right, negative 3.

863
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,040
OK, now Polish.

864
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,760
Polish.

865
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,400
And upside down negative 15.

866
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,600
That's 51.

867
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,880
I like it.

868
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,640
OK, Moroccan.

869
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,120
Again, don't know too much.

870
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
To North Africa.

871
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,720
Negative-- but they also speak French.

872
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,640
So is that making you rethink anything?

873
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,480
It's making me rethink a little bit.

874
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,000
We-- oh, you can switch it out if you want to.

875
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
Go ahead, switch it out.

876
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,640
We're good.

877
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,000
We're good now.

878
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,600
No, switch it out.

879
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,200
All right, that's fine.

880
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:05,800
Saudi Arabian.

881
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,800
Let's see Saudi Arabian.

882
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,520
Remember Jamal Khashoggi?

883
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,560
Oh my god, you have just swayed me.

884
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:11,960
Yeah, that's right.

885
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:12,280
Yep.

886
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,480
So you think it's negative 20 to be Saudi Arabian.

887
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,280
Negative 20 points for being Saudi Arabian.

888
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,640
Look, as a big Khashoggi head--

889
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:20,000
Yeah, he was a huge fan of his journalism.

890
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,200
Yeah.

891
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:21,840
Yeah.

892
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,940
No, honestly, the coolest thing that guy ever did

893
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:25,720
was get turned into shark food.

894
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,840
[LAUGHTER]

895
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,640
That's the only cool thing he ever did.

896
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,560
Next is Ghanaian, or--

897
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:32,680
Oh, like the pigs.

898
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,240
Yes.

899
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,480
From-- yeah.

900
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,200
Negative 5.

901
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,360
OK, Somali.

902
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:36,840
Somali.

903
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,640
What are we doing for Somali?

904
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,120
OK, I just want to point out, you got French on here twice.

905
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,240
Yeah, that's Juvia's fault.

906
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,360
Yeah, a Polish guy did this.

907
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Oh, OK.

908
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:44,920
Somali.

909
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,760
Somali.

910
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,880
OK, not a big Captain Phillips fan.

911
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,360
No.

912
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:49,920
All right, next is--

913
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,440
I watched that.

914
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,840
That's the first time I've watched a movie,

915
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,480
and I hope that bad guys win.

916
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,400
That's right.

917
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,360
Negative 2 for Somali.

918
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:55,840
They still give him a negative.

919
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,440
Interesting.

920
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,600
Mexican is up next.

921
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,200
And remember, there is a Mexican guy on the phone with us

922
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,400
right now.

923
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,240
It's the second lowest number I have left.

924
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,720
Negative 6, OK.

925
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,220
Negative 6.

926
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,000
French.

927
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,600
The second lowest number you have left.

928
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
French again.

929
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,600
I did 22.

930
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,940
We'll say this is the French people abroad,

931
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,240
so maybe like kind of Montreal.

932
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:18,940
French-Canadian.

933
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:22,400
Yeah, Francophones.

934
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,480
Well, when you say that--

935
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:23,920
Negative 9.

936
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,440
OK.

937
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,560
All right, Italian.

938
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,440
Minus-- oh, that's pretty high for Italian.

939
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,240
That is high, yeah.

940
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,360
Girlfriend's Italian.

941
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:31,880
Unassigned.

942
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,600
Next was unassigned.

943
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,400
I'm not sure what--

944
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,240
I got to put negative 8 just to keep things good at home.

945
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:36,880
Yeah, I get it.

946
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,360
Unassigned, I guess, would be every other race in the world.

947
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,880
These are all the 23 and me.

948
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,760
OK, so anything else is negative 17.

949
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,400
OK, Indonesian.

950
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,960
Oh, man.

951
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,080
So by the way, just--

952
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,120
Yeah, you're on the left.

953
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:56,040
--people at home, he has negative 11, 12, 10, and 13 left.

954
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,640
He goes negative 10 on Indonesia.

955
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,840
All right, so we have Korean.

956
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,440
And a negative 11 for Korean.

957
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,320
Now, Orc.

958
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,560
Orc negative 12.

959
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,440
So let's look at it.

960
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,160
Let's pause here.

961
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,080
Let's pause here.

962
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,320
Let's look at everything that's below Orc.

963
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,800
everything that he has higher than orc.

964
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,880
Okay, so higher than orc he has--

965
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,320
- British is lower than orc,

966
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,600
so what race is worse, Spanish, French,

967
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,040
British, Portuguese, Algerian?

968
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,840
- But better than orc, he says it's,

969
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,680
or yeah, sorry, so yeah.

970
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,240
- Look, I've already said, I've already said,

971
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,920
- It's worse to be Saudi Arabian

972
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,600
than to be an orc, says Patrick.

973
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,840
(laughing)

974
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,440
- Nothing I can do is gonna make myself look good.

975
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,720
- And the Korean people coming in just above orc,

976
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,480
- I'm just barely edging out Orcs.

977
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,440
- Okay, so there it is folks.

978
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
- Scandinavian at negative 13.

979
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,200
- This is Patrick's official race rankings.

980
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,760
Pat, go pop your head up up top

981
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,600
and give it a big thumbs up.

982
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,840
This is all you.

983
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:56,300
Me and Cameron have been planning this for about a month.

984
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,920
We got so excited when we had this idea.

985
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,360
And this is gonna be basically--

986
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,200
- This is how we will score our 23 and over.

987
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,000
- This is how we're gonna score everything,

988
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,040
which we're gonna start right now.

989
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,160
But first we're gonna need to put our blood DNA

990
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,880
into the Racialator.

991
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,600
- All right, Cameron, you do the honors.

992
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,760
This is you first.

993
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:12,600
- Okay.

994
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,200
- And we will revisit the board just to make sure.

995
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,040
We'll tally up points afterwards.

996
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,360
- Wait, no, you hook it up to the--

997
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,200
- I hook it up?

998
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,400
I don't spray it onto the front of it?

999
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,240
- You spray it on the table and then put--

1000
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,440
- You tried to do a cum shot on the Racialator.

1001
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,080
- It's not a cum shot, it's a blood shot.

1002
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,920
- A blood shot, yeah.

1003
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,760
- Excuse me, you.

1004
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,640
- Put it on the table.

1005
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,040
- Oh, put it on the table, okay.

1006
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,480
- GPO, can you punch in on it?

1007
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:34,120
- All right, here we go.

1008
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,920
- Okay, just squirt it right there.

1009
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,180
(laughing)

1010
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:42,660
- And now those cables are connected to the sample.

1011
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,780
- Oh my god, wait I hear it whirring.

1012
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:45,620
- Whoa.

1013
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,180
- Oh my god, oh my god, okay, alright.

1014
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,140
So Cameron, welcome to your race report.

1015
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,340
This is all you, dude.

1016
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,620
- I have, yeah, also me and Caleb

1017
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:54,780
have not looked at our results at all.

1018
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,980
- No, we have not looked at our results.

1019
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,180
- Jubio put all this stuff together.

1020
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:00,100
- Jubio's the only person who knows our DNA ancestry.

1021
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:02,420
And I honestly, I have chills in my body.

1022
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,340
And I wanted so badly to get to this part.

1023
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,940
Can I make a few predictions?

1024
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,140
Yeah, okay. That's what I want to get into first.

1025
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,180
I want to know, we'll do this before each of us,

1026
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:16,180
what have you been told is your history?

1027
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,900
The only thing that I,

1028
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,180
so whenever I asked when I was a kid,

1029
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,740
my parents would just say a bunch of random stuff

1030
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,500
that I don't remember because I was a kid.

1031
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,820
But the one I remember is,

1032
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,900
I'm pretty sure I'm at least part Polish.

1033
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,940
I think that that's going to be on there.

1034
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,540
I would guess that based on how you act.

1035
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:35,180
but by by vibes that I've been good but that I've been trying to I was

1036
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:38,980
trying to cultivate and what I'm hoping for I'm hoping we could see on this

1037
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:44,700
presentation I'm hoping for some Native American some Mexican yeah and some

1038
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,620
African so Mexican that's how you said that I've been and I've been trying to

1039
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,860
cultivate that in my you're trying to do what before I gave the DNA sample I was

1040
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:55,820
thinking I was just thinking a lot of stuff you're doing the secret you're

1041
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:59,900
trying to manifest exactly Native American Mexican and African let's get

1042
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:06,180
right in. I'm getting, I'm getting, I'm squirming in my seat trying to see your race. Me too,

1043
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,580
I'm excited. I honestly cannot wait to know everything about your racial history. Alright,

1044
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:18,300
alright, we're ready? Yes. Alright, let's find this, let's find this out here. I'm 100% y'all.

1045
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:22,700
At least you're whole. I'm 100% that bitch. I'm honestly so nervous. I'm really liking

1046
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,700
the amount of, of, you have a lot of squints on your heart. Yeah, you have a lot of stuff

1047
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,420
on this and I think this big blue thing I'm gonna guess right now probably some

1048
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:35,900
British and Irish stuff. I'm gonna guess that you are a hundred percent amazing

1049
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:42,860
friend. Oh my god. Okay I wish I thought of saying that. This is even more nerve-wracking because I didn't make this

1050
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,220
PowerPoint so I know what's gonna happen when I swear. I'm terrified. Okay.

1051
00:38:47,220 --> 00:39:01,420
European 92% wait only 92% oh my god that's pretty crazy I've been saying for

1052
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:04,980
weeks I think there's gonna be something you might have a fucking amazing

1053
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:08,380
surprise in stores let's check out I'm guessing this will be the European stuff

1054
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:16,660
right here 56% okay what's Northwestern Northwestern is gonna be like British

1055
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:22,900
and Irish I think. No, no, no, it's like Polish. I'm sure it is actually, we'll find out. Alright,

1056
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:28,980
what's in there? British and Irish 44%. 44% British and Irish, that's not what I was expecting

1057
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:36,660
that much. Wow dude, almost half British. That's pretty crazy. 4% Scandinavian, .8% Finnish.

1058
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,060
And then broadly Northwestern European is 6.9%. I did not think I was going to be that

1059
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,860
much British and Irish. Hey, County Cork, me too. That's amazing, you guys might be

1060
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:50,860
we're cousins related friend we probably are related that's a way to look it up.

1061
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:57,620
Well so that's but that's only 50% of of this of this of even the European part yeah so what

1062
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:00,700
else do you have let's see here.

1063
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,820
Eastern Europe well I mean 9% when he numbers that's pretty excited to me that is I do like

1064
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
that a lot.

1065
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:12,020
A lot more than I thought all right here.

1066
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:14,340
- Lesser Poland. - Voivodeship.

1067
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:15,800
- Why would they say lesser Pol--

1068
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,720
- Yeah, why are they calling it lesser Poland?

1069
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,060
And one region?

1070
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,340
Is that 29%?

1071
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,180
Is that what that means?

1072
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,140
- Oh, he's in the and one region.

1073
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,700
- I don't know. - Oh yeah.

1074
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,480
- You are a hooper 'cause you're tall.

1075
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,960
I don't know, press next, it'll probably tell you.

1076
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,260
- Whoa. - Oh my God.

1077
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,080
- Oh, Southern European, Spanish, and Portuguese.

1078
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,720
So you're 30% Polish.

1079
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,940
- Wow. - That's a lot.

1080
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,280
- Yeah, that's a-- - Is that more than you thought?

1081
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,820
- I think that is more than I thought.

1082
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,680
- That's a fucking lot of Polish, man.

1083
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,060
- I thought I was gonna be, all together,

1084
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,980
was gonna have 50% DNA maybe.

1085
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,180
- Yeah. - So the fact that I'm already

1086
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,780
at 80% is kind of blowing my mind.

1087
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,340
- It's kind of surprising you.

1088
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,380
Her Portuguese man of love.

1089
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,340
- That's you. - That's me, yeah.

1090
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,140
Oh, more Polish.

1091
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:53,980
- Yeah. - But.

1092
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,900
- Dude, I can't believe you're 30% Polish.

1093
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,700
- That's pretty crazy, I'm pretty happy with that.

1094
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,840
- That's, now you have like a,

1095
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,860
30%, that's enough for it to be your identity.

1096
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,620
- I live in a Polish area.

1097
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,420
- That's your cultural identity is Polish.

1098
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,860
- Oh my God, I probably gravitated there unconsciously.

1099
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,300
- Holy fucking shit. - You definitely should.

1100
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,500
Holy shit.

1101
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,540
That was a Polish magnet.

1102
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,540
All right.

1103
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,660
All right, let's keep going.

1104
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,020
Let's get into the good stuff.

1105
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:20,620
The small percentages are the exciting ones.

1106
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,580
OK, 92% European.

1107
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,940
Yeah, OK.

1108
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:25,660
All right, press next.

1109
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,900
Let's see what's next.

1110
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,900
Oh!

1111
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:35,260
4.3% indigenous American, dude.

1112
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,540
That's fucking right.

1113
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,340
I knew it.

1114
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,460
Wow.

1115
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,500
That is amazing.

1116
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,900
Oh my God.

1117
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,740
Oh my God.

1118
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,020
- Wow. - He was prepared, dude.

1119
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,780
- I manifested it, I knew it was gonna happen.

1120
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:50,180
- Wow, dude, victory lap. - Oh my God, I'm so happy.

1121
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,740
- That is incredible, I'm so happy for you, bro.

1122
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,580
- 4.3%.

1123
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,700
What's that? - That's huge.

1124
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,180
- That's a 20th?

1125
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,900
- Yeah, one 20th, dude. - Wow.

1126
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,500
- You're card carrying-- - I'm gonna find out my tribe.

1127
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,100
- You have to. - Yeah.

1128
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,340
- Wait, does it tell you?

1129
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,300
- I hope it tells me.

1130
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,140
- It might tell you, who knows?

1131
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,220
- Yeah, it's gotta tell you.

1132
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,460
- Yeah, okay, it just says 4.3% indigenous American.

1133
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,660
These could be your cousins.

1134
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,500
- Those could be my cousins.

1135
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,360
- You blend right in.

1136
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:16,460
- Damn, that means your ancestors did something really--

1137
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,660
- That's incredible. - This is why--

1138
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,500
(laughing)

1139
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:21,460
- That means your ancestors did something terrible.

1140
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,460
- Well, my great grandpa--

1141
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,180
- What, you think it's terrible to use

1142
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,380
every part of the animal?

1143
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,500
That's what you're saying, Patrick?

1144
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:30,340
- My great grandpa did claim that he was Native American,

1145
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,420
but it was unclear if he actually was.

1146
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,620
- Oh, wow. - So this is answering

1147
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,420
a lot of questions. - So there's something, so--

1148
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,820
So the question has been answered.

1149
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,260
So the question, so yeah, what, I mean, what,

1150
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,580
great grandpa, that's what, what percent is that?

1151
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,180
That is 16th and eighth, I don't know.

1152
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:45,020
Yeah.

1153
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,740
Grandpa percent, so that's--

1154
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,700
That'd be an eighth.

1155
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,540
An eighth?

1156
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,360
Yeah.

1157
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,200
Okay.

1158
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,040
So it was like, so basically,

1159
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,900
if one of his parents was 100% Native,

1160
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,940
then you would be about,

1161
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,980
you'd still be somewhere between that and--

1162
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:00,820
So the point is he was completely not lying.

1163
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,660
Yeah, that's pretty incredible.

1164
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,980
And he was 100% Native American.

1165
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,820
(laughing)

1166
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:06,700
and he was not just a really dark-skinned white guy.

1167
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,820
- That is so amazing to know that, man.

1168
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,420
- That is really exciting, but I think there's probably still,

1169
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,980
that doesn't add up to 100 yet, does it?

1170
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:13,820
- Yeah.

1171
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,820
- Okay, so that's, okay, so we have, I think, 4% left.

1172
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,940
- We got some purple stuff.

1173
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,260
- Wait, keep going, but I have to send,

1174
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,580
I'm gonna send something to Jubio really quick,

1175
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,500
but you can keep going.

1176
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,340
- Okay.

1177
00:43:26,340 --> 00:43:28,660
- All right, I'm excited to see what this is.

1178
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,700
Western, Asian, and North African 2.5%!

1179
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:32,540
- No way!

1180
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:41,980
No way dude. What? Oh my god dude it got even better. It got better bro. I'm the whitest

1181
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:52,980
guy on the show. Dude you're African. Oh my god. Western Asian. I've been walking around

1182
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,340
my apartment saying to my girlfriend I'm gonna get my test results it's gonna blow your mind

1183
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,860
I'm gonna be African. You're gonna be African? Well where, where, cause you could be like

1184
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:06,940
Like don't try to downplay this you fucking cracker. It says North African. That's the opposite of South African. I forgot.

1185
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:10,080
We get to call him, you get to call him, I mean I don't know yet, but you get to call him Whitey.

1186
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:15,680
That's right. I've already been called Whitey by him a million times. Okay, Whitey. Well now you know why I've been doing it.

1187
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,560
Oh my god. That is the most exciting. North African 1.1%.

1188
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,560
Anything good in there? Who knows?

1189
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,580
Northern West Asian. Oh, that's why I don't know what, I mean.

1190
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,420
- Like Cyprus. - Cyprus?

1191
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:29,700
- I think it's near Greece, I think.

1192
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,380
- Yeah. - Maybe, I don't know.

1193
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:32,220
- I guess I don't actually know anything.

1194
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,040
- I don't actually know anything.

1195
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:33,880
- There's a lady from Cyprus, I guess.

1196
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,720
- I'm gonna have to learn about it.

1197
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,540
- You're gonna have to learn about your history.

1198
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,180
- My 0.3% heritage.

1199
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,480
- That is so amazing.

1200
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,220
- That is really exciting to me.

1201
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,580
- Very exciting stuff.

1202
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,700
- I always knew I was a total melting pot.

1203
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:45,540
- That's true. - And now you have actual--

1204
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,380
- I always knew I was multicultural.

1205
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,860
- Now I know you are a complete melting pot, yeah.

1206
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,300
- All right, let's see what else we have here.

1207
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,140
Oh!

1208
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:56,580
- 0.2% Arab, Egyptian, and Levantine.

1209
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,780
- Dude, this is like, I feel like all the stuff

1210
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:01,820
that I thought that I was gonna be, you are.

1211
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,740
- Yeah, I'm 0.2% Egyptian.

1212
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,220
- I thought I was gonna be Egyptian.

1213
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:09,200
When I saw that Jubia added that to their racial ranking,

1214
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,700
I was like, that's all me, dude.

1215
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,660
- No, dude, I think I might become a hotep now.

1216
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:14,500
- You have to. - Yeah.

1217
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,180
- Yeah, because I-- - Well, is that why,

1218
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:18,640
I mean, we haven't looked at yours yet,

1219
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,340
but is that why Orc is on there?

1220
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:25,160
I didn't even think about that. I guess that's probably me then, right?

1221
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
That probably does have...

1222
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,000
Because you just kind of got all the awesome stuff right then.

1223
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:33,000
Yeah, I'm kind of bummed I didn't get Mexican.

1224
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,240
Maybe I'm about to get 0.1% Mexican. We'll see. Next slide, maybe.

1225
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:36,600
True.

1226
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,320
If that happens, if I get all three...

1227
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,240
Let's see.

1228
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:46,520
Trace Ancestry. Who knows?

1229
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,600
Wait, let's see. Does it go into that?

1230
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,240
Oh my god.

1231
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:54,600
Wow.

1232
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,400
Wow, dude.

1233
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:55,900
Wow.

1234
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,200
Sub-Saharan African.

1235
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,760
0.1% Somali.

1236
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,960
0.1% Somali.

1237
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:01,960
Dude.

1238
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:02,460
Wow.

1239
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,880
Yes, bro.

1240
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:07,360
This is amazing.

1241
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,600
This is the greatest day of your life.

1242
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,840
Well, here's the thing.

1243
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,760
I remember when I did the 23andMe,

1244
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:18,760
it did say that I was point Sub-Saharan, like 0.2.

1245
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:20,420
He's going to ruin everything right now.

1246
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:27,320
And then it got then they got rid of it. I don't really care because I'm Native American. Okay. Yeah, you're a hundred percent white Irish

1247
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,320
Yeah, you're you know whitey

1248
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:37,060
For you know what that means to be a hundred percent Irish your family used to be the the lowest I literally

1249
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,000
in the worst country in the world I

1250
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,120
Already won being 30% Polish. That was all you were every yeah, everything else is just amazing victory

1251
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,780
- Brown and black icing on top of the cake.

1252
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,040
- I don't think you should say brown and black icing.

1253
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:52,880
- Why?

1254
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,720
- All right.

1255
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:55,520
- Yeah, but you wouldn't say that.

1256
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:56,360
You're not allowed to say that.

1257
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,060
- Is this the end of the slideshow here?

1258
00:46:58,060 --> 00:46:59,640
- Yeah, that's it.

1259
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,780
- Oh my God, dude.

1260
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:01,620
- Oh, and unassigned.

1261
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,340
- 3% unassigned, so you did pop unassigned.

1262
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,580
So wait, really quick.

1263
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,520
So really quick, can we add up your--

1264
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,440
- There's more stuff, there was more stuff.

1265
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:12,040
- Let's see more stuff then, let's keep going.

1266
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,400
- Timeline.

1267
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,760
- So you were--

1268
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:18,800
Most recently, I was British and Irish and Eastern European.

1269
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,160
Okay, and it looks like everything else

1270
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,360
is from the 1600s.

1271
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,400
- That's not that long ago, honestly.

1272
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,560
- No, that's basically like--

1273
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,720
- No, from the 1700s.

1274
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:27,560
- Where do you find this timeline thing?

1275
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:29,120
'Cause I didn't see mine. - Oh yeah, I can't see it.

1276
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,080
- So you were North African as recently as 1850.

1277
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,200
- Wow. - Civil War vibes.

1278
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,360
- 1850, that's Victorian times, right?

1279
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,120
- Yeah, dude, yeah.

1280
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:38,960
Wow, that is amazing.

1281
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:40,880
- So I wasn't even in Victorian England.

1282
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,920
- No, no, not at all, dude.

1283
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:43,920
- That's incredible.

1284
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:49,880
I'm gonna go home and change a lot of stuff. I mean everything is different for you. Everything is fucking different

1285
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,760
All right, what's next? I think it seems like that might be the end. All right, so really quick

1286
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:59,000
Can we can we add up the the points for you? No, all right, so

1287
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:04,680
What do we got keep it keep it keep tracking your head? Okay, so you are to go back

1288
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:09,120
I have to should I go back and this out of so they just add them all together

1289
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:17,580
Someone take out their phone. I guess and just do calculator here. You do it me do it. Yeah, it's your come on

1290
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,580
It's your point you be oh shit

00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:24,000
Had this or or Juvio can do it on the computer. I got it. I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do all right ready

1292
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,540
All right. Yeah, so first up is British. Yeah, you are British, which is - 21

1293
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:35,140
- 21 okay, okay, and and but you're indigenous American well Irish - is okay Irish is zero

1294
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,460
Okay, and then Scandinavian is next

1295
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,760
Is that on here negative negative 13?

1296
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:47,740
Okay, and then finish negative seven negative seven

1297
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,920
Okay, Polish, which is negative 51

00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:58,160
Come on add it negative 51. Okay next Spanish and Portuguese

00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,200
Okay, and then what's next here indigenous American?

1301
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,400
That is negative one. Negative one. Again, very interesting choice by Patrick.

1302
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:19,840
And then, is African on here? Cypriot? Oh yeah, Cypriot is, what is it, where is that?

1303
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:28,920
Oh, negative three. Negative three. Okay, and then Egyptian? Egyptian is, man I can't

1304
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,880
find any of these. There's so many. I missed the first one. Plus two, wow!

1305
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,720
- Wow. - That's huge.

1306
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,600
You're such a melting pot, man.

1307
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,960
- Okay, and then the Somali.

1308
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,760
- Somali and Guinean.

1309
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,660
So Somali is negative two and Guinean is negative five.

1310
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,840
And then unassigned is negative 17.

1311
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,360
- Negative 17 for unassigned.

1312
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,200
- All right, so what's your total?

1313
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,800
- My total racial score is negative 153.

1314
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:55,600
- Negative 153.

1315
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:56,600
- Yeah. - That's what you are.

1316
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:58,000
All right, I don't know if I can beat that.

1317
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,040
That's pretty good.

1318
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,280
- Yeah, I think I got a pretty good score.

1319
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:02,880
- All right, Patrick, if you would do the honors,

1320
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,320
will you spray, or I'll spray this,

1321
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:06,160
and will you connect--

1322
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,360
- Don't mix them together, whatever you do.

1323
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:08,720
- True, okay, wait, I'll...

1324
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,000
- Oh, it's nice and red on the table.

1325
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,800
- Yeah, nice and amazing red on the table.

1326
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:15,280
All right. - All right, it's all hooked up.

1327
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,880
- I hear it whirring.

1328
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,160
It's calculating my race report right now.

1329
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:21,840
- Wow, look at this. - Okay, dude.

1330
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:24,520
- Putting that cherry limeade shit in the spray,

1331
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:26,160
it is a crazy smell in the room right now.

1332
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:29,640
- It is smelling so bad. - Your blood smells like

1333
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,440
I actually attach a certain cultural importance to fragrance.

1334
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:37,600
Guys, I need you both to shut up because I'm about to uncover the secret history of my

1335
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:44,120
family directly live on air. So here's what I've been told about my family history. I

1336
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:53,200
have been told that my great, or my granddad is Italian, okay? My mom's dad. And he looks,

1337
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:58,200
if you guys have met him, he looks like a human basketball.

1338
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,120
That is the color of him.

1339
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:04,520
It's like an old leather vintage Spalding ball.

1340
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,680
So I've always looked at him saying,

1341
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,760
hmm, I'm not so sure.

1342
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:11,320
And his mom looked even worse.

1343
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:13,520
- Worse is not the word you should use.

1344
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:16,920
- Every, well, who knows, maybe I can use it.

1345
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,800
Everybody in my family is ugly and they're fat too.

1346
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,800
So I'm trying to learn where all these people are from.

1347
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,280
So give me three predictions.

1348
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,320
So I'm predicting--

1349
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,280
Are your three hopes?

1350
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:29,280
The three hopes.

1351
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,360
I hope that I'm some meaningful amount Italian,

1352
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:35,320
because that has been the only kind of like cultural thing

1353
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,280
that I've ever had.

1354
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,080
Was that we'd be like, yeah, we're Italian.

1355
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,600
We'll eat-- like at Christmas, we eat Italian food.

1356
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,960
I'm hoping that I am Native American,

1357
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,840
because my dad would say that we were Native American.

1358
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,320
Yeah.

1359
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,640
And it would be nice for us both to be Native American.

1360
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:53,280
- And then we could be kind of, we could be brothers.

1361
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,120
- We could do stuff together.

1362
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,800
- Yeah, we could be amazing spirit brothers.

1363
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,200
- You're gonna be so mad when it's like

1364
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,200
a decent amount Irish.

1365
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:03,200
- I don't think, to my knowledge,

1366
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,320
I have no Irish in my blood.

1367
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:09,080
Oh, and I think I have Spanish in my blood.

1368
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,240
- What's your third hope?

1369
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:14,840
- My third hope is that I am,

1370
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,800
I'm from Africa.

1371
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,300
I want to be, okay, I'll say this.

1372
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:27,300
I want to be 100% African.

1373
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:28,300
Okay.

1374
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:29,300
So I'm ready.

1375
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:30,300
I'm ready.

1376
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:32,660
But I'll accept whatever is given to me.

1377
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:33,660
I'm not going to protest.

1378
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:37,460
I'm not going to send an email if I'm not happy with the results.

1379
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:38,460
Okay.

1380
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,460
All right.

1381
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,460
Let's get into this, guys.

1382
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,460
I'm so fucking nervous.

1383
00:52:41,460 --> 00:52:42,460
This is amazing.

1384
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,460
Okay.

1385
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,460
Caleb's report.

1386
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:45,460
100% Caleb.

1387
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:46,460
100% CP.

1388
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,460
Oh my God.

1389
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,460
I do not like this.

1390
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:49,460
So already I'm looking at this?

1391
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:51,500
- Yeah, the blueness of it.

1392
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:54,320
- It is all looking very blue, first of all.

1393
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:55,340
And second of all.

1394
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,540
- Yeah, dude, that's European, dude.

1395
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,500
- Dude, this is bad news.

1396
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,100
And a huge chunk of it is one blue thing.

1397
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,420
- You're completely European.

1398
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:04,540
- Dude, this is not good.

1399
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,580
All right, let's see.

1400
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:12,660
99.8% European, dude.

1401
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,500
- Wow.

1402
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,700
- Wow.

1403
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,500
That is a shot to the heart.

1404
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,340
(laughing)

1405
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:20,400
That is a shot to the heart.

1406
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,100
That is really sad, dude.

1407
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:24,820
I honestly am just so fucking sad right now.

1408
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:25,660
- God damn.

1409
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,900
- 99.8, dude. - 99.8.

1410
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:30,060
At least give me 100.

1411
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:30,900
(laughing)

1412
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:32,500
- 99.8.

1413
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,580
- Oh, this is breaking my heart.

1414
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:39,820
- That means 0.2% is not European.

1415
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:40,660
- That's true.

1416
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,260
Let's look on the bright side here.

1417
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,860
- You're gonna have 0.2% of something.

1418
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:45,420
- Oh my God. - Maybe it's unassigned,

1419
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,140
but it's not European.

1420
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:50,820
Definitely on a side who would have thought that you were the most racially diverse

1421
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,780
Not me

1422
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:58,880
Expecting that I was expecting it. I knew I had it all right. Let's get into this raced off

1423
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:06,440
Not 81 point 5% Northwestern European yeah, and we remember what that is holy crap

1424
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:15,220
Irish

1425
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:21,980
I knew it. We're all Irish. Dude, I honestly had no fucking clue that I was even 1% Irish.

1426
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:24,700
You're gonna start listening to Wolftones with me.

1427
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:31,700
Dude, that is crazy. I'm Irish? That is the worst news I've ever gotten in my life.

1428
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:36,820
You said all this stuff about how, "Oh, I've only been a peasant my whole life." Bitch,

1429
00:54:36,820 --> 00:54:40,260
you too. No, but I have at least one other thing in

1430
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:46,740
here is it's only 68% so I'm more than half Irish that is so fucked up that is

1431
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:51,940
so fucked up man that is really hurting my feelings okay let's see did I kiss

1432
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:57,100
you before I spit into that thing I'm trying to fight it back or did I kiss

1433
00:54:57,100 --> 00:55:03,860
maybe like a fucked up ugly bitch fucking Irish that's yourself no you were a

1434
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:18,860
are

1435
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:23,260
Wow. When they clear out all these results, when they like finally tally it up and

1436
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,380
figure it out, you might be a hundred percent Irish too because I remember it

1437
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:31,980
said that I was like a hundred percent Scandinavian. Southern European, okay this

1438
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:36,940
is where it gets good. Look at this picture too. All right yeah I'm a little

1439
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:40,660
bit interested in this at least. This is some intrigue because this guy has a

1440
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:46,340
mustache. All right. 17% Italian, okay Camparia. Okay.

1441
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:47,180
- Nice. - All right.

1442
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:48,420
- In five regions.

1443
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:50,420
- Yeah, and then broadly Southern European.

1444
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,300
Okay, so I'm about a fifth Italian, almost.

1445
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:55,300
- Congratulations.

1446
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:56,960
- All right, that's actually more than I thought.

1447
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:59,700
I always thought that I was like 5% Italian.

1448
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:00,800
So I'll take that.

1449
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,660
I still, it is pretty upsetting

1450
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:04,140
that I'm triple that amount Irish.

1451
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:05,900
(laughing)

1452
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:08,500
And I don't know a single--

1453
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:11,040
- When Julio said to us last night,

1454
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,100
he was like, "Oh, when we do this,

1455
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,040
"we'll do Cam's results first

1456
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,060
"and then we'll do Caleb's after."

1457
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:17,700
and I was like, oh, this means Caleb is gonna be something,

1458
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,180
Caleb's gonna be like Egyptian or something.

1459
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,020
- It was reverse.

1460
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,480
- And then it's actually that you're getting damned.

1461
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,820
- I'm fucked, dude.

1462
00:56:23,820 --> 00:56:24,940
- You're being tortured.

1463
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,520
- This is so fucked up.

1464
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:29,280
I can't believe it, dude.

1465
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,320
I'm not, wait, am I not even Spanish, bro?

1466
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:32,900
My grandma's a liar?

1467
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:33,740
My grandma told me that her grandma--

1468
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:36,060
- Wait, go back, didn't it, I feel like--

1469
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:36,900
- Where does it say Spanish?

1470
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:38,740
- Oh no, it's French and German, yeah.

1471
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,860
- Dude, that might--

1472
00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:40,700
- Yeah, you're not Spanish.

1473
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,460
- I also thought that I was like 20% German.

1474
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,060
- Well, there's still a lot of Europe to go.

1475
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:46,400
- Am I fucking adopted?

1476
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,180
Am I adopted?

1477
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:51,020
My grandma claims that her mom, or her great grandma,

1478
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:54,700
or her normal grandma, was 100% Spanish.

1479
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:56,140
- We'll see, we'll see.

1480
00:56:56,140 --> 00:56:57,840
- Okay, Southern European, Italian,

1481
00:56:57,840 --> 00:56:59,660
broadly Southern European.

1482
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:03,140
0.5% Eastern European, I could see that with that picture.

1483
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:07,040
99.8% European, dude.

1484
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,060
This is honestly gotta be one of the worst days

1485
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,340
of my entire life.

1486
00:57:11,340 --> 00:57:15,700
- This is the highest high, the highest high for Cameron.

1487
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:17,100
Ticked my lowest low.

1488
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,020
(laughing)

1489
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:19,300
This is unreal, dude.

1490
00:57:19,300 --> 00:57:21,300
- Finding out that you are Irish,

1491
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:22,660
you don't look it at all.

1492
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:23,820
You don't look a--

1493
00:57:23,820 --> 00:57:24,900
- I can't believe it.

1494
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:26,460
- You look like you were made in a tube.

1495
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,580
- But I look like a little Somali, right?

1496
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:30,020
- You do, yes.

1497
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,600
You look like a Somali pirate, yes you do.

1498
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,180
You look just like them.

1499
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,820
- All in all,

1500
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,660
- Okay.

1501
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,500
- There's .2% left.

1502
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,180
- There's .2%, so guys.

1503
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,300
- Hey, hey, hey, crackers.

1504
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:42,080
Drum roll, give me a drum roll.

1505
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,620
- Not three complete crackers, no.

1506
00:57:43,620 --> 00:57:44,820
- Yeah, no, he's not.

1507
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:45,660
- Oh yeah, that's true.

1508
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:46,480
- Listen, this guy's a--

1509
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:48,140
- If you call me a complete cracker ever again--

1510
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:49,180
- He's a Weetabix.

1511
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:51,740
- I'm gonna fucking eat you.

1512
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:54,160
- Okay, two crackers and a mutt.

1513
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,060
- Don't call him a mutt.

1514
00:57:57,060 --> 00:57:59,500
First you do race rankings, now you're calling people mutts?

1515
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,340
- What's wrong with you, man?

1516
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:01,940
- Hey, I didn't wanna do the race rankings.

1517
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:03,220
- You did not argue at all.

1518
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:04,740
- We really thought, okay, we were going,

1519
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:06,500
the plan was that we were gonna give you the thing

1520
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,660
and we thought that you were gonna say,

1521
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,100
oh no, there's no way we can do this.

1522
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:11,580
So I was printing out, before you got here,

1523
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,420
I was trying to print out a bunch of emojis

1524
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:14,420
that you could use instead,

1525
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,740
so when you said no to the numbers,

1526
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:16,980
I could bring out the emojis.

1527
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,740
- The emojis is a way better idea.

1528
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,020
- But they were all like frowny faces and cameras.

1529
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,260
(laughing)

1530
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,940
- But you immediately were like, yeah, let's do it.

1531
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,060
- No, 'cause I knew there was nothing I could do about it.

1532
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,460
- You had been planning it for so long, dude.

1533
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,580
Okay, all right, 0.2%.

1534
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,500
- All right, blow on the dice, blow on the dice.

1535
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,340
- Unassigned.

1536
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,040
(laughing)

1537
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,340
- You didn't blow on the dice, dude.

1538
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:45,280
- Oh my god.

1539
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,460
I'm not at all Native American.

1540
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,020
- Well, let's look at the timeline.

1541
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:49,860
- Oh yeah, let's look at the timeline.

1542
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,700
- Let's see the timeline.

1543
00:58:50,700 --> 00:58:53,620
- All right, that actually is what I resemble the most of,

1544
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:55,540
out of everything that you've showed.

1545
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:58,760
All right, so originally I'm French and German

1546
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:01,140
and Scandinavian, then I was Italian,

1547
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:04,300
and then British and Irish, only in the last 100 years.

1548
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:05,500
- So that's why you didn't know about it,

1549
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,060
is 'cause it just happened.

1550
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:07,900
- Yeah. - I don't, wait.

1551
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:10,140
(laughing)

1552
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:11,220
I'm trying to think.

1553
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,060
- Well, no, but yeah.

1554
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:15,540
- The thing is, my grandpa is from like the middle

1555
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:17,460
of nowhere, and we were talking about how he has

1556
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:20,180
like no real idea of his family history, I guess.

1557
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:21,580
- Yeah. - But then my other grandpa,

1558
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,380
yeah, they're, my grandma claims to be German.

1559
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:28,340
My grandpa is Italian, I just found out for real.

1560
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:31,140
And, wait, but wait, there's more.

1561
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:32,900
No, that can't be true.

1562
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,220
Wait, what's going on here?

1563
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:35,180
- There's more?

1564
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,580
(laughing)

1565
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,660
- No way, no way.

1566
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,740
- I have less than 2% Neanderthal DNA.

1567
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,780
Did that mean that, that's low, right?

1568
00:59:43,780 --> 00:59:44,620
That's pretty low.

1569
00:59:44,620 --> 00:59:46,020
- I think that's high.

1570
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:47,680
- You have one variant associated

1571
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,180
with having a worse sense of direction.

1572
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,740
You have two variants associated with being less likely

1573
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:54,820
to have a fear of heights, okay.

1574
00:59:54,820 --> 00:59:57,100
You have one variant associated with being more likely

1575
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:58,940
to have a fear of public speaking.

1576
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,540
And you have four variants associated

1577
01:00:00,540 --> 01:00:03,240
with being a better sprinter than distance runner.

1578
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:04,080
- Wow.

1579
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:04,980
- I'm a high performance athlete.

1580
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:05,820
- Yeah. - Oh my God.

1581
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:06,860
- And you're afraid to talk.

1582
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,020
- And I'm afraid to talk, but I can jump off of--

1583
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,940
- Yeah, you can run.

1584
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,700
- I would actually say all of these are completely opposite.

1585
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:16,300
I'm so scared of heights, and I'm not a good runner at all.

1586
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:19,420
Wait, wait, what is it?

1587
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,100
Okay, I get it, I have--

1588
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,540
- I feel like that's gotta be a lot of Neanderthal DNA,

1589
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:24,380
though, right?

1590
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:26,460
Or else they wouldn't, I don't remember what mine was,

1591
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:29,580
but it said that I have 56% more Neanderthal DNA

1592
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,300
than most users. - Wow.

1593
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,500
- My, less than two, I really thought

1594
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:37,640
that most, okay, so the people that I've seen

1595
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:39,980
that have Neanderthal DNA, it said like,

1596
01:00:39,980 --> 01:00:43,100
like, oh, you have so much, you have .2%.

1597
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:45,380
So the fact that it just says less than 2%

1598
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,420
means that I could have one and a half or something?

1599
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,620
- Yeah. - That's pretty scary.

1600
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:50,620
- Yeah, I think that's a high number, I would think.

1601
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:53,660
- You think I'm full Neanderthal almost?

1602
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:55,100
- Probably. - Wait, less than 2%,

1603
01:00:55,100 --> 01:00:56,820
that's what the unassigned is then.

1604
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:58,580
- Yeah. - I'm 2% fuckin'--

1605
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:00,160
- You're Encino, man.

1606
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,260
- Dude, I cannot believe this, man.

1607
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,140
- That's cool.

1608
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:04,300
- All right, let's add it up. - That's a win.

1609
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:08,020
but the i guess i'll take a look at the other side of this this slide show

1610
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:11,900
all right let's uh... let's add it up okay all right over all reviews outside

1611
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:12,600
so

1612
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:16,000
high-end if you're on the earth three things

1613
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:21,640
i i may win but i lost to the i may win but i completely lost alright so british

1614
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,540
and irish so british

1615
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:25,100
is negative twenty one

1616
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:26,720
right negative twenty one

1617
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,260
irish is zero

1618
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,600
then we have sold it

1619
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,200
Here's my timeline.

1620
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:35,040
- What's your timeline?

1621
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,040
- My timeline is just British, one to two.

1622
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,720
(laughing)

1623
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,360
- Scandinavian is negative 13.

1624
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,100
- Negative 13, okay.

1625
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:45,960
- French is negative 22.

1626
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:47,480
- Negative 22.

1627
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,400
- German is not on here.

1628
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:52,280
- That's fine.

1629
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,040
- But we'll call that negative 50.

1630
01:01:56,040 --> 01:01:57,560
- Okay, I'll take negative 50.

1631
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,760
- Yeah, I guess German is unassigned.

1632
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,440
Italian is negative eight.

1633
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,760
- Okay.

1634
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:10,200
- And then Eastern European's not on here.

1635
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,280
Unassigned is negative 17.

1636
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:14,120
- All right.

1637
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:15,200
- And we'll call Ork Neanderthal.

1638
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,160
That's negative 12.

1639
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,320
- Okay, so with that, that puts me at negative 143.

1640
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,160
- Oh.

1641
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:23,680
- With the random negative 50 that we threw in.

1642
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,720
- If we take, I mean, okay, the negative 50

1643
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:26,560
doesn't have to be there.

1644
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:28,120
I think you won numbers-wise.

1645
01:02:28,120 --> 01:02:31,120
Okay, negative 93 then is my score,

1646
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,640
according to Patrick's racial ranking.

1647
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,680
Yeah, well, I guess that's not what we should say.

1648
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,560
That's not an objective score.

1649
01:02:35,560 --> 01:02:36,400
That's just what Patrick thinks of us.

1650
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,480
That's just one racist's idea of what our points are.

1651
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,640
Or racialists, sorry.

1652
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:43,960
Racialists, that's what I have to say.

1653
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,080
Not racist, it's different.

1654
01:02:45,080 --> 01:02:46,000
So Patrick.

1655
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:49,400
I think, honestly, I hate to say this,

1656
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:54,120
I think that the ranking is,

1657
01:02:54,120 --> 01:02:56,600
Cameron has the coolest, you have the second coolest,

1658
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:59,740
and I might have the worst lineage on the entire podcast.

1659
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,520
- I think you're, 'cause Patrick's is cool

1660
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,400
'cause it's so, it's just one thing.

1661
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,920
I think that has a shock factor.

1662
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,640
- Yeah, whoa, mine is like so shit, man.

1663
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:13,800
- I have 51% more Neanderthal DNA

1664
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:17,300
and I have the same amount as Caleb.

1665
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,120
I will say, I do truly think

1666
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:21,480
that I manifested this into existence.

1667
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:22,960
I don't think I deserve what I got.

1668
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,320
- I'm wishing all week that I had been doing voodoo

1669
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:31,920
my house. I have what I literally every time I just kept thinking about it I

1670
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,280
would say to whoever I was hanging out with I think I'm gonna be Native

1671
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:39,520
American. Look me in the eyes did you go to a witch doctor? No. Are you planning on

1672
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:47,600
becoming a witch doctor? Fuck me man. All right I mean that's it for the race.

1673
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:52,080
And just so you guys know if they do end up correcting the score or whatever I'm

1674
01:03:52,080 --> 01:03:53,680
I'm not, I'm never checking it again.

1675
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,500
I've never even looking at it.

1676
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,800
- You're passing this on to your children.

1677
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,000
- Exactly, this is, yeah.

1678
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,800
- This is incredible news.

1679
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:03,360
- We are doing our shareholder meeting for this month

1680
01:04:03,360 --> 01:04:06,280
on the 17th of February, which is a Friday.

1681
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:09,120
And I assume at 5 p.m. Eastern again.

1682
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,480
- Short month, we couldn't do it on another Friday.

1683
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:13,320
- That's right.

1684
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,140
- The month's too short.

1685
01:04:14,140 --> 01:04:14,980
- So check that out.

1686
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,440
- I'm gonna be, so subscribe to the $15 tier

1687
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:18,640
to get access to that.

1688
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:19,880
- I'm gonna be in the beautiful city
