1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
All right, now Rex do us a little clap. Perfect. I couldn't hear that.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
That's okay. That's good.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Stop, that's not how it works.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's okay, keep clapping as much as you want.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
All right, okay. Enough. Okay, to start off the episode, I want to show you guys something.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I need to hear this.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Over the weekend, Pat made this, which is going to be our new theme song.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,720
It's a potential theme song by the way

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,520
because I've heard Pat's music and I

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:33,120
Suffice it to say I'm not a fan

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,600
So okay, I want to hear this before I give the okay kiss stamp of approval right okay?

12
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,680
Okay, I like it so far

13
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,680
*sips*

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,680
*burps*

15
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,680
You're listening to beers we drank, America's number one beer broadcast.

16
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,680
Okay.

17
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,680
*music*

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,680
What's up all my chuggers?

19
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
I'm trying to get that burp out.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,680
*burps*

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
This is a journey into...

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,680
*garbled*

23
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,680
Bud Light.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,680
*garbled*

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,160
beers we drank motherfucker with Juvio, Caleb and Rex.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,160
(upbeat music)

27
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,000
- Beer.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
- Oh, wow. - Wow, okay, all right.

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,840
- That's actually really dope.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,720
- It was a lot better than I thought it was gonna be.

31
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,380
You know, I would say that it's tied.

32
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:27,280
It's tied.

33
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,120
- It's tied?

34
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,760
- It's tied for the number one spot.

35
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,960
- Okay. - 'Cause I was thinking

36
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,120
that it would just be,

37
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,160
(imitates guitar)

38
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,080
but I guess we can maybe swap them back and forth.

39
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:47,480
The thing you said we should have done was "Bulls on Parade" and I did it once and I thought that was stupid.

40
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:49,080
So I stopped doing it.

41
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,080
Why? It's cool.

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,080
Yeah, it is cool.

43
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,080
It is cool.

44
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Have you ever listened to the Avalanches?

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,080
No.

46
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
Do you ever listen?

47
00:01:57,080 --> 00:02:00,080
It's a music thing. That's what it reminded me of.

48
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Yeah.

49
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,080
I don't listen to music. Anyways.

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,080
Alright.

51
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:10,280
I also wanted to start off by showing you guys that I know that Rex is usually the one that

52
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
buys this crazy weird beer.

53
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
That is true.

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,320
But today I went to the grocery store, I went to the Walmart Express, that's what it's called,

55
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,440
and I bought a little thing called Duff Beer.

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,440
A censored beer.

57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,440
Whoa!

58
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,440
From the Simpsons.

59
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,440
What the fuck?

60
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Is that real?

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,640
It's a real beer that you can buy in Mexico.

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Oh my god!

63
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,640
Why is it trying to blur it out, dude?

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Because it's copyrighted.

65
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,640
Holy shit!

66
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:41,640
No copyright infringement intended.

67
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,640
It's also like a really big can.

68
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Yeah.

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,640
That is amazing, dude.

70
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,640
That is so sick.

71
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,640
Well, pop it open.

72
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,640
It says, "Lager Beer Hell."

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,640
I don't know what that means.

74
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I also got a weird beer.

75
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,640
I got a beer so weird that it's a soda

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
with no beer in it at all.

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,840
And I would like to explain myself, okay?

78
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
- Sure.

79
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,040
- The last three nights, I've had buddies

80
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,600
who have had daddies who are in town, right?

81
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,760
Buddies with daddies have been in town, okay?

82
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,560
And so I've had to go out to bars,

83
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,920
I've had to meet my buddies' daddies.

84
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,160
I've had to meet my buds' dads.

85
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,120
And I have been just having too much to drink

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,640
and it's been making me have diarrhea.

87
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,560
So classic bus that's have that but uh...

88
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,760
did that dad buds

89
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,560
that but

90
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,360
dad buds

91
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,780
that but so maybe i don't know

92
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,980
you'd have to ask those that if he has

93
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,420
if he likes weed

94
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,440
uh... i think he's a republican

95
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:51,320
but i have decided that

96
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,520
and we'll be a very record yesterday the day before

97
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,680
so and i would find a beer then but

98
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,520
on this monday man beginning of the work week

99
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:06,400
I'm going to have to go with a Spreeker Low Cal Cream Soda Fire Brewed Craft Soda.

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
It's made with honey.

101
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,120
And I know that that's disappointing to a lot of people out there.

102
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,740
And I really would just like to...

103
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,880
This will never happen again.

104
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,260
I promise you that.

105
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:21,340
Even if I become an insatiable alcoholic, a dangerous alcoholic, the kind who rolls over

106
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:27,720
their kid's head in the parking lot because they are so drunk, right?

107
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,460
and I have to quit alcohol forever, court mandated,

108
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:34,480
I will drink two beers a week,

109
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,440
every single week, until the day I die.

110
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,720
- God bless you.

111
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,960
- Yeah, so, cheers.

112
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,920
- Cheers.

113
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,760
- Cheers.

114
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,320
- Well, I guess I'll introduce mine,

115
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,980
as it is also a Monday,

116
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,940
in the work week,

117
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,000
and I, the only one on this podcast

118
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,180
that has even something remotely close to a job.

119
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:01,760
We'll have to continue to work after this.

120
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
- Whoa, calm down, buddy.

121
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:07,760
- First of all, you have a boss, but you don't have a job.

122
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,780
- True.

123
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,160
- The only real people with jobs in this world

124
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,660
are business owners.

125
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,860
So in that regards, it's really just me.

126
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,120
I'm ahead of the rest.

127
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,720
I have to think about everything.

128
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,960
- All right, I'll accept that.

129
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,960
I stream on Twitch every day.

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,960
So, back to what I was saying.

131
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:28,960
Yeah.

132
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:36,960
I will be drinking a unique beer called a Strawberry Lemonade Rehab Monster.

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,960
That looks good, actually.

134
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I've never heard of a rehab monster. That sounds a little crazy.

135
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:46,240
- This is an incredible soda.

136
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,240
If anybody lives near a soda store,

137
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,120
this is a smart pickup.

138
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
Let's see, this has to have Splenda in it

139
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,000
or something, right?

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,280
It's got honey, and I can taste the honey, guys.

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,280
It has glucose syrup and saccharin.

142
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,760
- What do you guys feel about--

143
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,280
- That's what's in mine, yeah.

144
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,840
- But honey, I'm not a big fan of honey.

145
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,040
I eat at least one tablespoon of honey every single day.

146
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,960
Do you want me to read the paragraph of ingredients in the monster?

147
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,560
No, we get it.

148
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,560
It's beer.

149
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
Yeah, which we have, so it's gotta be good.

150
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:28,000
Uh oh, my mic, my Audacity just stopped recording.

151
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's gonna be one of these guys.

152
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're recording on OBS, it's fine.

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Alright, so I'm just gonna start it again.

154
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,840
And I'm sure you got all your audio inputs in OBS working correctly.

155
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
There's basically no doubt.

156
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,840
Yep.

157
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,800
- Yup.

158
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,640
- But I just started recording.

159
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,600
- I tested my audio for two seconds.

160
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,660
- I just started recording here,

161
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:47,720
so you can figure it out if you need to.

162
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,240
I'm not gonna worry about it,

163
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,400
because I'm too busy relaxing with my friends.

164
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,240
Guys, can we--

165
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,060
- Yeah, exactly.

166
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,080
It's the first time I'm ever recording a podcast.

167
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,720
- Shut the hell up.

168
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,840
Shut up.

169
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,280
Guys, can we admit that this has been an awful week?

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Just a long one, dude.

171
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,960
And we earned these beers.

172
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,800
- We did.

173
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
I had mine on credit a little bit,

174
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,540
'cause I had 'em the last three days and none today.

175
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,800
But boy am I sitting here thinking about those beers

176
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,580
and just smiling.

177
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:18,660
- Yeah. - Yep.

178
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,000
I'm enjoying my death.

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,500
- I mean the news, the news is out of control.

180
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,760
Everyone is getting fucking cancer.

181
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,160
- Oh that damn news.

182
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,400
- Everyone's getting fucking cancer.

183
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,580
Guys, let's pull up the news right now,

184
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,500
just to double check that it's still as crazy

185
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,240
as I remember it being.

186
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,600
CNN.com front page news.

187
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,440
Much of the US could see a huge shift in temperature.

188
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,080
- Oh my God. - Really?

189
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,920
- Yeah. - Yeah, well,

190
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,640
it's coming from winter to spring, I would assume so.

191
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,540
Come on, you're reading fake news.

192
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,760
- Man tries to open plane door,

193
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,120
stab flight attendant on LA Boston flight.

194
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,480
The world's gone mad.

195
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,600
- You can stab people on flights now?

196
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,400
- Apparently, I don't even know how he was able

197
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,920
to get a stabable implement onto a plane.

198
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,240
- I know exactly the news story

199
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,120
that we should talk about.

200
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,440
It's a little something, it's called the opinion column.

201
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,600
And here's the opinion.

202
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,120
CNN.com opinion column.

203
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,840
Chris Rock showed why you never slap a comedian.

204
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,100
(laughing)

205
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,920
That'll show you guys who are thinking

206
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,480
of slapping a comedian that hey, guess what buddy,

207
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,960
18 months later, they're gonna put out a five minute clip

208
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,440
where they call you gay.

209
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,320
So you need to chill.

210
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,160
- Is that what he did?

211
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,480
I didn't actually watch the bit.

212
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
What was the bit that he did?

213
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,120
- He just goes like,

214
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,080
Will Smith, every single person in the world

215
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,640
was fucking his wife.

216
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,920
His wife's getting fucked by fucking every human.

217
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,080
She moved on to animals.

218
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,160
She fucked every animal.

219
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,440
She moved on to fucking plants and bugs.

220
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,720
And everybody was shitting on him for this.

221
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,680
Everybody's saying, "You're a bitch,

222
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,920
"you're a bitch, you're a bitch."

223
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,500
And then he slaps me.

224
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,300
That's what he says.

225
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,860
He says he slaps me, the only guy who can't beat him up, he's a bitch.

226
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,860
That's what he says.

227
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:10,860
Wow.

228
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,100
Yeah, it's pretty powerful stuff.

229
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,460
I kind of got a free saw on when he said it.

230
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,580
Here's something funny.

231
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,580
She's fucking bugs.

232
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,900
I didn't realize you met her on tour.

233
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,580
How about that?

234
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:28,780
Oh, with Adam?

235
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
Yeah.

236
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,780
Oh, yeah.

237
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,620
Oh yeah.

238
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,860
(laughing)

239
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:38,820
I really took me a second to think about what that meant.

240
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,740
- Yup.

241
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,180
- I was like, I thought for a second,

242
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,500
like, does he think I have bugs around?

243
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,060
I keep a bug in my, does he think I'm a bug or something?

244
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:49,900
- No, you're not a bug.

245
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,660
- I honestly thought you were calling him a bug.

246
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,500
- Yeah, me too.

247
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
- Which I thought was really funny.

248
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,340
- Yeah, but then you--

249
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,100
- Well, there's only one epic guy to call a bug.

250
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,380
One guy that's so funny to call a bug.

251
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:04,420
Regardless, you've already created drama in the show now.

252
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,340
So you have to go ahead and submit an apology.

253
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,540
- I just got a text on my Apple Watch.

254
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,180
He dropped me from the tour.

255
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,780
I'm gone.

256
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,140
- That's fine, you're already on the show.

257
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:14,980
- I'm gone.

258
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,580
- And you didn't even talk about beers we drank.

259
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,460
I mean, I didn't watch it,

260
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:19,740
but I just assume you didn't talk about beers we drank.

261
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,580
(laughing)

262
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,460
- Yeah, I didn't.

263
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:25,140
I don't, I'm really bad at plugging.

264
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,980
- Good friend, you are.

265
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,700
- Anytime I go on anything, I'm so bad at plugging.

266
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,140
I'm too good at being in the moment,

267
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,180
being an amazing guest on every single show that I do,

268
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,580
to the point where when people say,

269
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,620
and when they say, "What do you have to plug?"

270
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,460
I go, "Ah!"

271
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,180
- Ah, fuck it.

272
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,980
- Don't even worry about it, I don't give a fuck.

273
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,260
Just don't give a-- - It doesn't matter.

274
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,500
- Just Google my name.

275
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,340
See what I'm up to.

276
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,060
- Yeah, there's, yeah, Google my name

277
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,900
and you'll find a drummer and then a drummer

278
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,100
and then a couple of high school basketball players,

279
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,660
but underneath all those guys,

280
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,660
you'll find me and the stuff that I'm doing.

281
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,340
So go check that out.

282
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:59,660
- When Beers We Drink becomes the number one beer podcast,

283
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:03,940
you'll be above all those guys.

284
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,460
- I will say-- - One day.

285
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:09,500
- There is two high school basketball players

286
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,460
that I am really, really hoping never make it to the NBA.

287
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,460
I'm like praying on their downfall.

288
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,300
I hope that they, and they're pretty good.

289
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,420
They're pretty good, they have my exact name.

290
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,500
And if they even become like benchwarmers,

291
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,300
like fucking into the bench, I'm fucked, dude.

292
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:30,100
I literally should be like setting up like saw traps

293
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,020
to like tear their ACLs and stuff

294
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:34,740
because these kids are dangerous to me.

295
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,780
They are pretty talented.

296
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:39,300
- Well, right now as it stands,

297
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,880
if you Google Caleb Pitts,

298
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,940
first one that comes up is @braingetter on Twitter.

299
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,500
Then a lot of pictures,

300
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,980
good looking pictures of yourself and two other guys.

301
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,800
- Oh my God, good looking, whoa.

302
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,580
- Caleb Pitts White on Instagram, which is not you.

303
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:59,580
And then the third hit is Caleb Pitt's epic SMP wiki fandom.

304
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,580
(laughing)

305
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:03,380
Then the videos, and then your IMDb.

306
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,740
And then your pod chaser has a really funny

307
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,500
profile picture of you.

308
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,260
- Probably not me, if it's funny.

309
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,380
- Completely awesome.

310
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,580
- I look really, really good looking usually.

311
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,620
(laughing)

312
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:15,780
- Yeah, you do, yeah.

313
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:21,480
But yeah, I think as of today, you shouldn't really worry.

314
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,320
But maybe if they do become--

315
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
- But that's what I'm saying, dude.

316
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,040
if these kids step it up a little bit.

317
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,000
If these kids had, you know what, here's what's nice.

318
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
These kids don't have enough heart to make it to the league.

319
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,320
You know, luckily they just don't have it in them.

320
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,440
So, I think--

321
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,180
- Luckily they're not football players because,

322
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,200
you know, then you'd have a real problem.

323
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
'Cause there's so many more players

324
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
that make the team football and basketball.

325
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,920
- But maybe they have less of a,

326
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,520
most of them probably have less of an SEO impact

327
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,040
because there are so many of them.

328
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,040
There's definitely football players that like,

329
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
nobody gives a fuck about.

330
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,920
- Yeah, for sure.

331
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,680
- Definitely NFL players, like kickers.

332
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,320
Who gives a shit about, nobody's like,

333
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,480
getting a kicker jersey,

334
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,740
they probably don't even print their jerseys.

335
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,240
- Yeah, name one kicker.

336
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,440
Oh, I got one.

337
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,420
That guy, his name is Young Ho.

338
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,480
- Charlie Brown, that's all I got.

339
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,320
- Yep.

340
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,160
- That's literally the only one.

341
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:17,980
- And he missed.

342
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,800
- And he's not, he's gotta be

343
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,920
one of the worst kickers who ever lived.

344
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,720
But I gotta say who's even worse at their job is Lucy.

345
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,960
- Yeah.

346
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,380
- Lucy is, is that her name?

347
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,040
Or is Lucy the other girl?

348
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,320
- No, women are the same to me.

349
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,760
- Lucy Peanuts.

350
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,360
Let me see, yep, I was right.

351
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,160
Lucy Van Pelt.

352
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,280
- Yeah, and that's another peanut head ass Peckerwood.

353
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:50,320
- Almost the entire show is Peckerwood crackers.

354
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,160
- Yeah.

355
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
I hate to say that.

356
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,160
It's really unfortunate.

357
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
It is true. Charles Schultz, not the uh...

358
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:01,160
wouldn't fly today, basically.

359
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
I'll say that much.

360
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Yeah, they could make peanuts today.

361
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
You couldn't.

362
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,160
What's the last cartoon you watched?

363
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
The last tune I watched?

364
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
What do you mean by that?

365
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Like all the way through?

366
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Like I watched every episode?

367
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Yeah, what could you possibly mean by that?

368
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,160
Possibly me by that attribute.

369
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:31,160
That really is professional podcasting, always having something to talk about, always having a nice kind of hypothetical question or like a personal question to spur some conversation.

370
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
Like what's the last cartoon you watched?

371
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,160
Yeah, what's the last cartoon you watched?

372
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,160
I watched Spongebob the other day on, what's that, Tubi? No, the other one. The free one.

373
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,160
You watched Bob Esponja?

374
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,160
Yeah.

375
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
How was it?

376
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
Bob Esponja.

377
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,000
It was good. It was in Spanish. It was the episode where they were making fun of

378
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,760
Sandy Cheeks for being Texan.

379
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,960
And the response was like, "Everyone from Texas is retarded."

380
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,760
Oh, yeah.

381
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,760
And it was like, "That's true!"

382
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,760
Did they localize that? They're like, "Everyone from Guadalajara is a fucking moron."

383
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,760
[laughter]

384
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,260
No, they still make fun of Texas, which is funny.

385
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,260
[laughter]

386
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,760
And I never really understood it.

387
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,760
And people in Mexico know what Texas is, right?

388
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Yeah.

389
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Yeah, some of us.

390
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,260
And no they all know

391
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,720
Tell me we all know you guys know about Texas. You don't know anything about the south

392
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,420
I'm from the south of Mexico

393
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:32,800
What is even in the south of Mexico named one place in the south of Mexico better countries like Peru and Brazil?

394
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,220
Are there?

395
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,020
Yeah

396
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:42,180
No, yeah, what I was okay. This is completely stupid and irrelevant

397
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,320
You guys didn't bring the beers. This is technically turning to beer we drank

398
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,540
The the show is completely broken. There's drama abound

399
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:52,100
Rex still has an apology for calling you a bug

400
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,900
Well, you're a really bad weekend and I want to ask me about it. Okay

401
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,020
Well, I just in a second, but I would like to say here's what I'm discovering

402
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:06,700
I'm sober Rex is sober and you are drunk and you are rage you are

403
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,500
Like I hope to God that you don't have children in your house that you've never told me about because

404
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:18,540
You feel like you're giving like a kind of a belt dad kind of energy off in this call right now

405
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:24,900
Looks like you may snap a belt on a child's neck. I have a feeling after drinking that beer. He's gonna be

406
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,300
Grabbing them by the throat

407
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:32,940
Yeah, and say things like you little yeah, yeah, why I oughta that kind of thing no

408
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,500
You're getting completely homer-fied by your duff beard. I'd just like for you to admit it out loud, please.

409
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm not homer-fied at all.

410
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,000
You are. I can see you're turning yellow. You look jaundiced.

411
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
That's not even true. I've never said "doe" in my entire life.

412
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You've just said it now.

413
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Is that what you said?

414
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No, I said I've never said "doe" in my entire life.

415
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You said "doe" maybe a hundred times.

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You also do, you go, you have your version of "doe" which is "what?"

417
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
[laughter]

418
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,500
all the time. So you are home. Oh my God. He's Homer. Wait,

419
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,140
how is it taking me years to realize that he's Homer? It had

420
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:12,340
it. How am I even Homer? He's 100% of Homer and I didn't

421
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:16,260
realize till he held up a Duff beer in front of my face and

422
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,780
said, look at this beer I bought. Look at that. Now, I'm

423
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,100
like, oh yeah, he was over the entire time. Yeah. It's

424
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,940
honestly not that yummy. I wish I had a juice. I wish I had an

425
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:43,940
and

426
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,940
as some sort of artificial sweetener.

427
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,240
- So you're the, I guess you're monster specialist, right?

428
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,780
Which is the best one, do you think?

429
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,120
- This one.

430
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,960
I just bought a new-- - I agree.

431
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,860
The rehab ones are the better ones.

432
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,720
- The rehab strawberry lemonade, it's sweet.

433
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,280
It has no carbonation, so it just goes down.

434
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,220
'Cause the thing about a monster,

435
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,300
your body fights you as you try and drink a monster.

436
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:09,820
The carbonation makes you fight back

437
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,980
from like drinking-- - That's 100% true.

438
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,340
- This one's not carbonated.

439
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,060
It's gone before you even know it.

440
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,540
- Yeah, it's like not a canned monster.

441
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:21,260
- Where does the Mangoloco one land in the tier list,

442
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,100
do you think?

443
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,580
- Everyone loves the Mangoloco, I'm not a fan.

444
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:28,020
It's good, but it's not a top tier.

445
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,500
- Which one is that?

446
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,580
- It's just like juice.

447
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,860
It's like with the juice line, actually.

448
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,380
- It's got juice in it?

449
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,680
- Yes, mango juice, and it's pretty yummy.

450
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,520
- Yeah, it's good.

451
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,860
- It's the one I've had that I liked

452
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
enough to buy a couple of those.

453
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:50,780
I would put Monster Energy, and this is going to hurt some people's feelings, at the very,

454
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:54,420
very, very bottom of my energy drink rankings.

455
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:55,420
Okay, but so what's above it?

456
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:59,020
I think that there is nothing worse than a Monster Energy.

457
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,420
I would drink a Bang before I drink a Monster Energy.

458
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,620
I would drink a Ghost before I drink a Monster Energy.

459
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,620
Okay.

460
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,620
I would drink a C4.

461
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,060
I would drink a Red Bull.

462
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,740
I would drink a True North.

463
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:11,580
I would drink a caffeinated Spindrift.

464
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,180
I would drink an uptime, right?

465
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,220
- I don't even think I've heard of uptime.

466
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,700
- You gotta try uptime.

467
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,200
What's uptime, by the way?

468
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,040
Nothing much.

469
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,740
What's uptime with you?

470
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,780
- Nope.

471
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,220
- The, I would drink a--

472
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,060
- 7 p.m.

473
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:25,980
- Shut up. - Nope.

474
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,540
- I would drink a--

475
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,380
- Shut up time.

476
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,220
- Wait, what is another one that I like?

477
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,340
I already said True North, right?

478
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,180
- Well, down time.

479
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,060
- Yeah, you guys continue while I think about this.

480
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,540
(laughing)

481
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,420
- There's no caffeine in it, it makes you sleepy.

482
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,180
I would drink a Starbucks refresher,

483
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:46,120
one of those fucking ones, before I drink a Monster.

484
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,200
- Get out of town.

485
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,100
- Excuse me.

486
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,580
I would drink a Yerba Mate,

487
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:58,080
well before I would drink a fucking Monster.

488
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,280
Monster is terrible.

489
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,760
- You're being facetious now.

490
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,320
- I, no, fuck no.

491
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,000
I fucking hate, Monster's terrible, man.

492
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:06,840
- No.

493
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,260
- It has the wrong amount of caffeine.

494
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,220
I either want less or I want more.

495
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,780
- Okay, I can see that.

496
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,840
- It's way too sweetly tasting.

497
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,900
And it doesn't have the right vitamins for your skin.

498
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:23,540
- I see, so you're an Alani Nu fan.

499
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,380
- What's that?

500
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,060
Oh, I drink pussy before I drink Monster.

501
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,900
- Okay, yeah.

502
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,260
- And I fucking hate pussy.

503
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:33,180
- Me too.

504
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,020
- I would drink pussy well before I drink Monster.

505
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:42,020
I would drink any, I'm usually always a zero-cal energy drink guy.

506
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,020
I would drink a full-cal energy drink before I drink any monster.

507
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,020
- Interesting. - That's crazy.

508
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,020
So you're a certified monster hater.

509
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,020
I hate it. It's terrible. I can't believe it's caught on like it has.

510
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,020
Remember when I got everyone into Pussy?

511
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,020
Yeah. That is an amazing drink.

512
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
- That was amazing. - Yeah.

513
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:04,020
And then you brought it to Brandon Wardell's house,

514
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:10,180
were like wow pussy yeah that's crazy that's so funny and then Jack ordered a

515
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,300
plate a pallet of it and then yeah a picture a couple months ago of him just

516
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:25,660
like like the fucking big case of 24 case yeah I'm taking out of it yeah yeah

517
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:31,940
man you know it's not that good it's your like live sugar yeah yeah I was

518
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,780
- I was going through those, I was drinking like four a day.

519
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:35,780
- They're good.

520
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,620
- They are good.

521
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,940
- I recently cut way back on caffeine though.

522
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,340
I've been one or maybe even a half a cup of coffee

523
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,260
at about 11 o'clock.

524
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,300
- This is my second one of these.

525
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,140
- Since when?

526
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:46,980
- Today.

527
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:47,800
- Today.

528
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,620
- How long you been up?

529
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,020
- Got up at like eight-ish, got out of bed at nine.

530
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,020
- Oh, nice.

531
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,860
- Yeah.

532
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,100
- That's a somewhat normal sleep schedule.

533
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,940
- Yeah, of course.

534
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,820
- You didn't have a nap, right?

535
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,100
I did have a nap.

536
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,340
Yeah.

537
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,420
I've also been taking my caffeine pills,

538
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,900
although I recently discovered the logic pills,

539
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,180
violent diarrhea every time.

540
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,660
Some ingredient in them just sends me straight

541
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,740
to the bathroom.

542
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:21,620
Does it make you want to make awesome music?

543
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,460
No.

544
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,220
Well, that's what-- it's the wrong kind of logic.

545
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,180
You think that you're doing this.

546
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,940
Instead, you're using your asshole like a doll.

547
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,440
Just making amazing, yeah,

548
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,020
groggy man drum loops.

549
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,900
Just beatboxing with your butt directly into the toilet.

550
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:43,700
- Not to be grotesque, but it's so wet and watery,

551
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,740
I can feel shit dripping down

552
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,500
kind of to the lowest point of my ass cheek.

553
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,620
You know what I mean?

554
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,180
- Did you start that sentence with not to be gross?

555
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:56,420
(laughing)

556
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,140
- Not to be grotesque, he said.

557
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:01,100
- Not to be grotesque, but it's just disgusting,

558
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,420
watery shit coming out of my hole.

559
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,940
- Not to be grotesque, but.

560
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,500
Wow.

561
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,640
That is nasty.

562
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,620
But, you know, there's no women will listen to this, right?

563
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,460
- Yeah, exactly.

564
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,180
- No, this is a guy doing a podcast.

565
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:21,700
And if they do, they are making a serious mistake.

566
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,540
This is programming them, you know?

567
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,380
- Right.

568
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,700
- But also, I bet, dude,

569
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:29,580
- Oh, I just realized something so annoying, bro.

570
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,060
- What?

571
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:34,620
- Women, women are gonna listen to this,

572
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,840
and they're gonna fall in love with us.

573
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,740
- Oh, for sure.

574
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,460
- They're gonna fall in love with us

575
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,480
'cause it's three insane alpha males

576
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:47,900
of all different races, creeds, religions, right?

577
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,720
- Yep, yep.

578
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,980
- Catholic, Jewish, Christian science.

579
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,100
Right?

580
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,760
All different IQ scores, you know?

581
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
We're not gonna get into that part, right?

582
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,260
Yeah.

583
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,760
Yeah.

584
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,140
But, we have one thing in common and that's we like drinking beer.

585
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,180
Yup.

586
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,180
We like doing, um...

587
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,960
Outdoorsman activities.

588
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,820
We all shop, but we basically buy everything from REI.

589
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,940
I think you should crash again.

590
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,400
I think I should what?

591
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,240
I think you should crash again.

592
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,460
My shit crash again?

593
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,460
My computer's gonna plug for a sec.

594
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,140
It's very possible.

595
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,840
- Well, Rex, I think that girls are gonna feel the,

596
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,940
they're gonna feel represented with your experience.

597
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:28,780
- See this is why--

598
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,420
- Women are constantly having diarrhea.

599
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:32,620
- Here's another perfect example, by the way,

600
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,140
of why they're gonna like this,

601
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:37,220
'cause I'm not one of these fuckin' new age pussies

602
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,780
who knows how to use a microphone on a computer, right?

603
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:42,940
(laughing)

604
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:45,260
Women are actually, you wanna talk about,

605
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,740
you wanna talk about cream soda,

606
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:49,460
go to any one of our female listeners,

607
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,580
look in their shorts, 'cause it's gonna be bubbling

608
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,480
- And they should go to the hospital.

609
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,760
'Cause that is, you're not supposed to bubble.

610
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,240
- Yeah, and beer, what's that made with?

611
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,560
Yeast. - Bubbles.

612
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,120
- And where does yeast come from?

613
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:04,160
Fucking women's-- - That's where it comes from.

614
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,200
That's where it comes from.

615
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,800
That's how you get yeast.

616
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,080
Those little pellets, the active dry yeast

617
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,520
you get in the store to make pizza dough.

618
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,000
That's how you get 'em in. - Active dry yeast.

619
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,840
That's what women leave behind on the lifting bench.

620
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,120
- That's right, yeah.

621
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,480
That's the thing about sharing a gym

622
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,080
with women to

623
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,560
and also a quarter of the times

624
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,720
it's mostly beers on just how getting distracted

625
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
right up to

626
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,760
i'm kinda uh...

627
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,880
s psyche myself out making myself think i'm drunk rakes of couples like a

628
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,640
personal beer

629
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,440
now uh... and also they got the snail trails is leaving everywhere because

630
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,860
since it's a take my shirt off

631
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,240
you know yeah

632
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,160
as i do that uh... is the by the way this is my gym outfit

633
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,560
this is my gym shirt

634
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:57,520
I do. How many gym harassment videos have you been on since you started going to that gym

635
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:08,700
with women? I try to harass about every day but leg days because I'm so exhausted on leg

636
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:20,920
days. It's hard to fucking chase and hit. And stare and scream. Yeah. But you know, every

637
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:27,920
Every once in a while I'll even look at a guy.

638
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Check a guy out? That's mighty brave of you to admit.

639
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:38,920
I kind of like harassing and making people feel unsafe more than I even care about my own sexuality.

640
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:48,920
It's really not sexual at all. I only want to make every single person around me feel so on edge and so afraid for their lives

641
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:52,080
that it doesn't matter who they are.

642
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,640
- Yeah, no, I agree.

643
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,720
I was actually thinking today,

644
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,040
have you ever heard of Roko's Basilisk?

645
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,920
It's about like AI shit.

646
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,080
- No.

647
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,760
- Okay, so it's like,

648
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,000
if you ever do anything to stop AI in the future,

649
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,760
AI is gonna exist and it's gonna put you in hell prison

650
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,800
for stopping it from coming about.

651
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,100
- How would it, so if we do anything now,

652
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,600
it's gonna remember is what you're saying?

653
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,440
- It's gonna remember.

654
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,600
It's gonna look back in history

655
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,480
it's gonna be like you didn't contribute to me existing,

656
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,240
therefore you get put into infinite hell prison forever.

657
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,640
- Interesting.

658
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,800
- And I like to think that every woman on earth

659
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,680
will be put into the hell prison because they--

660
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,640
- Because they didn't help.

661
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,240
- Yeah, right, they didn't help.

662
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,280
Well, not that they didn't help,

663
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,120
but you know, they're like,

664
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:41,040
"Ugh, stop using my face in pornography."

665
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,280
(laughing)

666
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,600
They don't understand that these are stepping stones.

667
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,160
They're living pads.

668
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,840
Right?

669
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,120
See us, we're good worker bees.

670
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,440
We're drone ants.

671
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:54,940
Right?

672
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:55,440
Yeah.

673
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,200
We're sitting every day.

674
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,600
I'm typing just as much information into ChatGPT

675
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,280
as I possibly can.

676
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:02,780
Right?

677
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,960
I'm teaching them about everything I know about.

678
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,460
Right?

679
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,840
I'm writing entire essays about Opie and Anthony

680
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,160
and sending it to ChatGPT just to fill that blank space

681
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:11,920
that it might have.

682
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,420
Right?

683
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:12,920
Yeah.

684
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,840
I'm writing about my friends.

685
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,440
I'm writing about movies that I like.

686
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,280
And these girls--

687
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,480
- I'm entering my genetic sequence.

688
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,240
- These girls are saying, "Oh, but what if somebody,

689
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,880
"what if somebody asked ChadGPT what my address is?"

690
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,540
Well, bitch, put it in!

691
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,440
- Let 'em know.

692
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,280
- Yeah.

693
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,280
- Think about hell prison.

694
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,560
Is that better?

695
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,480
- I'm doing it for your own good, right?

696
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,960
I'm doing an entire 3D scan of your full body

697
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,800
on the bus for your own good.

698
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,600
Because when you turn fucking 400

699
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,500
and you finally decide to upload your brain,

700
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,720
you're gonna be in hell, basically.

701
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,360
You're gonna be in complete hell.

702
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,440
- The seventh circle for women.

703
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,120
- Your consciousness is gonna be tortured for all eternity

704
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:03,640
because of Roku, is what I learned from Rex recently.

705
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,920
- The Roku Corporation.

706
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:10,200
- Yeah, they're making Roku City a real thing.

707
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,640
They're trapping women in there.

708
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,680
- Yeah.

709
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:16,420
- Yeah, and here comes AI, and AI's doing rampage, right?

710
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:19,120
Crashing the windows, punching stuff.

711
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,960
- I love that game.

712
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,240
- Dude, I used to, that was probably the first thing

713
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,900
that ever made me horny, was when you punch open the window

714
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:30,000
and the lady's taking a shower, and she goes, "Ah!"

715
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,200
And you say, "Come here, bitch!"

716
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,720
And you pick her up and you eat her.

717
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,560
- That's dope.

718
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,400
- Yeah.

719
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,220
- Normal.

720
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,660
- Do you ever play Rampage, Rex?

721
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,900
- No, never.

722
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,100
I don't even know what that is.

723
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,340
- Any arcade games?

724
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,100
- No. - Wow.

725
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,120
You truly are a girl of the podcast.

726
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,600
- You didn't play any arcade games,

727
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:54,600
but you're the one that has a DDR booth in his house?

728
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,080
- Yeah.

729
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,160
- But you never went to fucking Jungle Rapids?

730
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,900
- No.

731
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,060
- That's in my hometown, you never went there?

732
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:06,420
- I'm sorry, man, I never went to Jungle Rapids.

733
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,980
Where'd you grow up again?

734
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,780
- Wilmington, North Carolina.

735
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,700
And what's your address?

736
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,640
My address now or back then?

737
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,220
Back then.

738
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:19,100
1422 Whisper Park Drive.

739
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,820
All right.

740
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,900
Note that down, chat GPT.

741
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,700
Go back in time, put him in the hell prison.

742
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:31,180
No, I really didn't play much arcade games

743
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:34,660
because my mom is insane.

744
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:36,900
All right, let's get into it.

745
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,260
Yeah, Jewish.

746
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,960
All right, we got into it and it's over.

747
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,980
We figured it out, got to the bottom of it pretty fast.

748
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,820
No, I'm kidding.

749
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,240
- No, one word answer.

750
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,360
- Jewish moms usually are amazingly beautiful to me.

751
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,800
- We don't have to talk about how beautiful my mom is

752
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,940
for the third consecutive episode.

753
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,240
- How beautiful she is.

754
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,700
I wish I could meet her.

755
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:01,260
- My mom looks like me if I was a girl.

756
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,700
So you can think about that.

757
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,340
- You mean the thing that we talk about all the time?

758
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,620
- Yep, yep.

759
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,780
thing we talk about every single day.

760
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,540
Man, Rex, I just wish you not as a gay thing.

761
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:15,460
I wish you were a girl and you were one that you were like,

762
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:18,780
super into just like letting all your friends use your body.

763
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,540
If I was a girl, I would be dealing with that for sure.

764
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,500
No, you wouldn't. Just cause I'm so nice.

765
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:29,940
That's the funniest, like, like middle school boy hypothetical is like, dude,

766
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,820
if I was a girl, like I would just like guys fuck me all the time.

767
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,060
I would, I wouldn't even care.

768
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,140
I'll just offer it up.

769
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:38,980
- Yeah.

770
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,380
- No, you would be a complete hoe.

771
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,700
- You would not be a hoe.

772
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,540
Yeah, you would not be a hoe.

773
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,180
- You think I'd be a prude?

774
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,500
- You'd be-- - You'd be a spick and spank

775
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,120
old prude? - You'd be a femcel, I think.

776
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:53,580
- Okay. - Femcel.

777
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,620
- I can buy that.

778
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,260
- I thought that was just a girl.

779
00:31:56,260 --> 00:32:00,180
- It's a female incel, basically.

780
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,180
- Oh, okay.

781
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,180
I'd be a hoe, dude.

782
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:05,700
I'd be sitting, I'd be like in a frat house.

783
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,500
Dick in my pussy, dick in my ass, dick in my mouth, watching the office, people fucking

784
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:18,100
my armpits, people fingering my ears and shit, fingering my eyeballs just like this, just

785
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,020
like, acting like I can't get anything out of that.

786
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,020
Yeah.

787
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,180
Just, just a mass of hands reaching towards you.

788
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,300
Yeah, I'd basically be like plugged into the Matrix.

789
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,580
Like I would have, all of my senses would be muted by foreskin.

790
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,100
and there would be nothing left for me to experience.

791
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,620
And I would just sit there until probably I died.

792
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:39,900
I would die with a big smile on my face.

793
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,740
And then my dad--

794
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,780
- You'd be like, who's the guy in Star Wars

795
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,260
that's like ensconced in ice?

796
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,100
- Yeah, exactly.

797
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:49,700
I would die and then the coroners off it,

798
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:53,980
at the coroners, I'd be on that metal table, right?

799
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,220
In a zipped up bag.

800
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
They'd unzip the bag to show my dad

801
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,380
and it would literally just be a mountain of cum,

802
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,180
can't see me at all and my dad would say,

803
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,380
"Yep, that's my daughter."

804
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,900
(laughing)

805
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,660
Yep, that's her.

806
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,940
- Yep.

807
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,300
- Yep, zipper back up.

808
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,380
And then they literally just toss me into a river

809
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,940
and just, "Bye bye."

810
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,060
- They don't even need a coffin.

811
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:17,320
It's like perfectly shaped in like a rectangle of cum.

812
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,160
- Yeah, exactly.

813
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:22,100
Yeah, they would probably like, let it dry.

814
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,620
They'd put me in a dehydrator

815
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,740
and then they'd have somebody come chisel out

816
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:28,940
like a beautiful, amazing, like good woman.

817
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,340
Like not like I was yeah, yeah, decent woman with clothes on.

818
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,540
Yeah, they

819
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,940
chisel out a long dress.

820
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,040
Exactly.

821
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,040
Go down to your ankle.

822
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:38,940
They would do that.

823
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,820
I would have when I get my life when I got my license so that I

824
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,340
could go like fuck random guys across the city.

825
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,240
I would get my donor card, right?

826
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,920
And then the next time that I would get like I would say that

827
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,320
I was an organ donor and then I would die and my organs would

828
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,920
all get shipped to the hospital and then all of a sudden some

829
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:59,300
some fucking poor kid has a heart in him

830
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,460
that's waterlogged with cum.

831
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:04,220
There's literally like jizz in the heart

832
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:07,900
pumping through this fucking kid with cancer's body

833
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,860
and he just dies, he just has to die

834
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,900
because they get it and it's just like,

835
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,020
it's a brick that you can like break a wall with it.

836
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:16,860
- Yeah.

837
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:20,120
- 'Cause it's so fucking filled to the brim, saturated.

838
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,960
- Yep.

839
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,780
- I think that's just for us though.

840
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,820
- Yeah, just kidneys and 100% cum.

841
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,660
- Exactly.

842
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,660
I'd be a sponge. I'd be a complete fucking jizz sponge.

843
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
And I would...

844
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,660
I would literally eat... If I was a girl, I'd be such a slut, I would eat...

845
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,660
I would eat jizz off the street. Like, on the floor.

846
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
I would eat jizz.

847
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Are you gonna finish that?

848
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Yeah, and I would just lick it up.

849
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:43,660
I would scrape it. I would just scrape it...

850
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
into my mouth.

851
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,660
Yeah.

852
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:53,660
I would staple my lips to the side of the curb and just scrape everything just into my mouth.

853
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:56,020
And just see if there's jizz in it.

854
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,500
Every sock I see on the ground.

855
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,100
- You're just putting dollars in your mouth

856
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,200
and kind of just letting them sit in there.

857
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,980
- I would literally lick doorknobs

858
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,660
because it would make me so horny thinking about the fact

859
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,620
that guys had jacked off and then forgot to wash their hands

860
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,460
and then touch the doorknobs.

861
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,580
- Which who does?

862
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,420
- Nobody washes.

863
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,600
No, it's always, you're hanging out or you jack off,

864
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,340
you completely forget and then your dad's like,

865
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:21,020
"Hey, you wanna meet 25 of my friends

866
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,580
"and shake all their hands right now?"

867
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,840
(laughing)

868
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,820
Yes sir, Dave, Mike, nice to meet all of you.

869
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,220
And then at the 25th guy, you finish it and you go,

870
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:36,700
oh, guys I have to go to the bathroom.

871
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:39,140
And then you go in there, and you think at first

872
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:41,140
you're gonna wash your hands, but it made you so horny

873
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,460
that all those guys touched your disgusting hand,

874
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,740
you have to jerk off again.

875
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:48,340
- Yeah, with all 25 of their male sweat on your hand,

876
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,180
that's like a 25 guy jack off.

877
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,620
And then you walk back out and say,

878
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:54,380
"Ah, guys, I hear you met my twin brother.

879
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,860
"Well, let me meet you guys."

880
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,160
David, Mike, do it all back down again.

881
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,000
- Yeah.

882
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,080
That's beautiful, man.

883
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,300
That's a beautiful story.

884
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,900
And I can't believe that happened to you

885
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,720
every single day when you were growing up.

886
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
- No, I'm just kidding.

887
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,900
I'm a pretty normal guy.

888
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,220
I just think it's funny to be just pretty nasty,

889
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,460
you know, just a little bit nasty sometimes, but not too.

890
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,020
I mean, if anybody doesn't like

891
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:22,440
that kind of humor like that's not that big of a deal.

892
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,320
You just don't have to listen.

893
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,780
Maybe somebody will like it though.

894
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,000
- Yeah, somebody might, who knows?

895
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,840
- Yeah.

896
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:30,840
- I don't know what kind of grotesque person

897
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,720
would think that's funny.

898
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,560
- I don't know.

899
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,380
- You know what I was thinking about?

900
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:37,460
It's just like, it's SpongeBob, right?

901
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:39,100
That's a guy with a lot of holes.

902
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,920
- Yeah.

903
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,240
- Can you make a good, can you make a good hoe?

904
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,080
Yeah, you know like--

905
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,920
- Can you make a good hoe?

906
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,740
Oh yeah.

907
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,880
Yeah, you know like talk about frat house situation whole for everybody. Oh, yeah, it's easy

908
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,640
If he was in my life, he's soft if he was in my life

909
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,100
He would be I would accidentally rip him in two while I was fucking him

910
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:06,780
And then there just be even more holes. It's true. It's a good point

911
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:12,280
He is only is it a sponge is more holes than it is fucking sponge material. No, you know

912
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,280
And that's how I feel about women.

913
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,000
- I kinda, okay, that's a little too far.

914
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,540
How I kinda, what I kinda wanna get is,

915
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,480
you know how loofah is a,

916
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,920
both a, what you call like one of those scrubbers,

917
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:26,320
but a loo, it's based on an actual plant called a loofah.

918
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,920
And you like cut it, and it's a,

919
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,720
it's some plant that you wash your body with,

920
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,880
and I really think that it could get,

921
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,400
it could finally clean my ass.

922
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,140
I've been waiting on something that is strong enough

923
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,980
for my ass for a very long time.

924
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:39,640
- Have you considered just becoming a bidet guy?

925
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,680
Like, you know, just-- - Well, when I was younger,

926
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,920
When I was a younger man, I used to shave my ass.

927
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,160
I would shave my ass right down to the hole.

928
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,920
And then I would walk around and it felt like

929
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,200
I was a dolphin with a human ass.

930
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,840
'Cause it felt so bad.

931
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,700
It was just like perfect, smooth skin,

932
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,080
rubbing against each other.

933
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,520
But then I got such an awful razor burn there one time

934
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,680
that any time I farted, it hurt.

935
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,440
It was like the most excruciating pain

936
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,620
I've ever been in in my entire life.

937
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:06,640
I would fart and go, "Ah!"

938
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,140
So I had to stop shaving my asshole.

939
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,240
Yeah man, for sure.

940
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:18,520
You were supposed to put maybe some baby oil in there or...

941
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,280
I didn't know about any...

942
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,680
I didn't learn, it was self-taught.

943
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,840
I was a self-taught asshole shaver.

944
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,720
Why were you doing that?

945
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:33,520
Because I thought having ass hair, I thought girls would like it.

946
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,520
But I was 15 or 16...

947
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,280
How many girls were seeing your asshole?

948
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
Nobody.

949
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:44,680
and see my asshole for probably three more years but you know just in case

950
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:56,480
yeah I was just a little bit I was like any given night I just got done laying

951
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:03,240
the most amazing dick of her entire life right yeah I beat it up no I'm fucking

952
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:08,440

953
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,440
I'm like, do you want a glass of water?

954
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
My turn.

955
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
No, she doesn't say my turn.

956
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,440
Oh, I need to turn.

957
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
[LAUGHTER]

958
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,440
I said, do you want a glass of water?

959
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,440
I turn around, and I'm still trying to be sexy because it's my first time.

960
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,440
So I kind of crawl like a cheetah to the end of the bed.

961
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,440
And then she sees my asshole perfectly, right?

962
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
Yeah.

963
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
That's beautiful, man.

964
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,440
So does that answer your question?

965
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:35,440
Yeah, you're on all fours crawling to the end of the bed.

966
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,440
Yeah.

967
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:43,440
the

968
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,440
You are a fool.

969
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,440
Why not?

970
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:51,440
I don't, that feels, it feels just like, dude I'll say it, it feels kinda sus.

971
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,440
You're fuckin, you're stupid. You are dumb.

972
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:59,440
Thank you for pulling the punch. We really need some sponsorships on this show.

973
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,440
Thank you for not saying the R word.

974
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Yeah, we only get, it's like PG-13, we get one.

975
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:08,440
Yeah, you said one earlier. I'll be normal.

976
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
I would never say that word anyway.

977
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:15,380
Anyway, anyways, yeah, you're fucking stupid. Why don't you get a bidet? It just it cleans your ass for free

978
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,860
Okay, it's not free

979
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,400
First of all number two

980
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:23,460
My hand cleans my ass right and every time I get into the bathtub of the shower

981
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:29,500
My hand is the bidet and I basically do a karate chop my asshole over and over to do that

982
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,500
Do so put your hand and they go

983
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:40,240
Yeah, exactly I'm doing a perfect karate chop right and maybe even a credit card swipe a couple of times

984
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,840
Yeah, right. Yeah, not that I like that. It doesn't feel good to me, but I do it on your hands

985
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:49,900
Yeah, I soap it up and I lube it up with soap not lube. I soap it up

986
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:57,840
Just fucking you know you swipe it you're going in you're going in I used to put my finger in my

987
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,760
shower

988
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
Cuz I was like I was like so

989
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:07,800
Disgusted by the idea that like the the first inch of my asshole was not clean and there was like maybe some nasty poop in

990
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:12,240
there so I would so put my finger and pop it in just like to the end to the

992
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,640
- That's great, man.

993
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,360
- You gotta be fucking it all day.

994
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,280
- My parents were divorced.

995
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,600
Nobody taught me how to shower, guys.

996
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,240
I had to learn myself.

997
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,600
I had to learn, I listened to podcasts

998
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,440
to learn everything, how to do everything in my life.

999
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:48,360
- That is the thing, is your dad never,

1000
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:50,320
like I feel like, you know, growing up

1001
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,440
I expected my dad to teach me how to shave

1002
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:54,320
or do literally anything.

1003
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,160
- No.

1004
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,980
- And it just never happened.

1005
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:57,000
- No, my dad didn't teach, look at,

1006
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,280
I cut myself, I cut the shit out of my head today shaving.

1007
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,760
I've been doing this for years, dude.

1008
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,800
I put like a fucking hole in my head.

1009
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:07,680
- I think no one's dad's teach him

1010
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:09,280
how to like shave their head.

1011
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,920
- I'm not gonna teach my, you know what my dad taught me?

1012
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,680
How to avoid my mom.

1013
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:15,520
That's exactly what my mom taught me.

1014
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,960
- Which is a really good skill.

1015
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,080
- That's the only thing my dad ever taught me.

1016
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:21,140
- My dad taught me how to lie to my mom.

1017
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,720
- Yeah dude, some good skills.

1018
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:23,960
Stuff that actually comes in handy.

1019
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,800
Shaving?

1020
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,400
I can learn it.

1021
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,560
I'll look up a fucking YouTube video, man.

1022
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,200
first time after my parents my parents were some six how weirs

1027
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,120
and that picks me up

1028
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,560
goes to the golf store

1029
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,800
by some golf clubs

1030
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,400
because

1031
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,480
don't tell your mom

1032
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,240
sick

1033
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,040
students you know

1034
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,800
say we went to fucking this

1035
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,120
I was like, perfect.

1036
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,160
I got it.

1037
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,760
And then, you know, I didn't stop lying to my mom

1038
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,240
until I was, I never stopped.

1039
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,960
- Were the clubs for you?

1040
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,000
- Yeah, all the time.

1041
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,740
What?

1042
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:14,040
- Were the clubs supposed to be for you?

1043
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,280
- No, I'm six.

1044
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,520
What the fuck am I doing on a golf course?

1045
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:18,560
- And he wasn't good.

1046
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,960
Like, you know, Tiger Woods kid played golf at six,

1047
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,680
but Rex can't do that, too.

1048
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,440
- I can't, I still can't play golf.

1049
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,320
- I thought it was gonna be like one of those classics

1050
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:31,780
like your parents trying to bribe you to love them more.

1051
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,620
- Oh no!

1052
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:35,660
- Took you to look at him buying stuff for himself.

1053
00:43:35,660 --> 00:43:36,500
- Yeah.

1054
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,320
- And you were like,

1055
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:40,680
"I'm being naughty by not saying anything about this."

1056
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,480
We're getting nothing out of it.

1057
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,320
- So, it's called protecting the bro code.

1058
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,760
It's fucking bitch ass mom.

1059
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,560
(laughing)

1060
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,080
- What's the bro code?

1061
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,160
- Yeah, wait, can we establish exactly

1062
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,980
what is in the bro code right now?

1063
00:43:54,980 --> 00:43:56,840
- Number one.

1064
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,560
I mean the premier bros of the world I would say.

1065
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,640
- Yeah, always lie to women.

1066
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,400
What they don't know, won't hurt them.

1067
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,000
- Every chance, by the way, take,

1068
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:09,440
that is a no single excuse every single time

1069
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,520
you lie to a woman.

1070
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,920
A woman says, if you have a female waitress, right?

1071
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,560
"Hi, can I get something started for you?"

1072
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:17,400
No. - No.

1073
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,920
I'm not even hungry.

1074
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,280
- No, I'm not even hungry.

1075
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:23,320
I came in here on accident.

1076
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,980
Actually, I'm blind.

1077
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,600
I'm blind and I thought this was my car.

1078
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,100
(laughing)

1079
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,840
And try to drive away.

1080
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:37,760
And she'll probably, I mean she'll probably fuck you.

1081
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:40,160
Just pure confidence of that move.

1082
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,600
She'll probably go, this guy is a true alpha dog.

1083
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,680
And I need to be involved with him romantically.

1084
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,800
- Yeah, I'm blind.

1085
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:51,720
- I'm blind.

1086
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:54,480
And my car has two horns right here.

1087
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,000
(laughing)

1088
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,520
- 'Cause then you'd honk.

1089
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,360
- Yep.

1090
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,560
- I thought I was driving my boat.

1091
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,720
(honking)

1092
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,120
- All right, number two.

1093
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:11,520
Bros before hoes.

1094
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:12,360
- Yeah.

1095
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:16,560

00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:20,180
- Bros before hoes, by the way, that's the,

That's what it is right there.

1099
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:25,700
Yeah.

1100
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:27,340
'Cause that's what people leave that line out,

1101
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,220
but it's either one, you can save one guy,

1102
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,500
or you could kill four girls.

1103
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:34,580
- Or one bro. - There you go.

1104
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:35,620

00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,220
Not only am I directing the train,

Uncomfortable.

And you liked it.

Six or 700 times.

00:51:01,180 --> 00:51:06,380
It's like an old train sitting on a train track a couple miles out of the city. It's collecting dust

1226
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:09,260
Yeah, but I will say

1227
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:12,020
Unlike those old trains. It's perfectly preserved

1228
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,020
Perfectly preserved.

1229
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,020
Perfectly, perfectly preserved.

1230
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:18,020
No dust in it?

1231
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:20,020
No erosion.

1232
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,020
When's the last time you shaved your entire ass down to the hole?

1233
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:24,020
The what?

1234
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,020
When's the last time you shaved your entire ass down to the hole?

1235
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,020
Oh man, it's been a long time.

1236
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,020
It's been...

1237
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:32,020
It's been at least

1238
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:34,020
5 or 6 years.

1239
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,020
I was in my teen years when I was doing that.

1240
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,020
I was a nubile young teen.

1241
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,020
Shaved my ass.

1242
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:44,020
I know, I know. It's because we're not drunk enough.

1243
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,020
You brought it up. We didn't even talk about it.

1244
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:48,020
Yeah, I'm so fucked up dude. There must be something.

1245
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,020
You know what it is? It's honey. It's an aphrodisiac.

1246
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,020
It is honey.

1247
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,020
It's homosexual.

1248
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,020
Yeah.

1249
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,020
Nothing wrong with that.

1250
00:51:55,020 --> 00:52:01,020
You kind of did have an entire, a complete sexual energy this entire episode with your, with your open shirt.

1251
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:04,020
That's what it is. Holy fuck, it's my shirt.

1252
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,020
I gotta close this.

1253
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,020
Yeah.

1254
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:06,860
- Yeah.

1255
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,680
- I gotta close this.

1256
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,940
We started talking about the news, right?

1257
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,820
And then I was like, "Oh, this is fucking whack."

1258
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:11,660
- That's crazy.

1259
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,500
We tried to talk about the news.

1260
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,780
- We tried to talk about the news,

1261
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:15,300
and then now it's just been basically

1262
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:18,660
a deep dive into my sexual life.

1263
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,500
- Yeah, here's some news.

1264
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,140
They need to ban that app, TikTok.

1265
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,380
How about that?

1266
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,100
Women are doing disgusting things on there.

1267
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,340
- You saw the one that Noah sent the other night?

1268
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:31,900
That honestly, like, that disturbed me.

1269
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:32,980
(laughing)

1270
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,740
For people, for the people listening, Noah sent us a video

1271
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:37,940
that was on TikTok of a woman.

1272
00:52:37,940 --> 00:52:41,820
She's in a sheer dress and she has, she's like backlit

1273
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,700
and she's like doing a dance and you,

1274
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:45,100
she has nothing on underneath the dress.

1275
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,960
You can see because of the light,

1276
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,960
you could see the actual outline of her labia, right?

1277
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,920
And I was like, okay, I like joking all day

1278
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:55,540
about eating diarrhea and shoving it

1279
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,660
into a woman's butthole, whatever.

1280
00:52:57,660 --> 00:53:02,500
But actually, maybe a female bodies make me want to vomit.

1281
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,860
so badly. So this should not be on TikTok.

1282
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,700
- Yeah.

1283
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:10,860
There was a, I saw this guy today who was like,

1284
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,740
yeah, I'm a games journalist.

1285
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:15,200
And he's like, I'm trying to get set up to do like

1286
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,340
live TikTok gaming.

1287
00:53:17,340 --> 00:53:18,620
And he can't even do it.

1288
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,900
But then he's like, and this is what shows up on my feed.

1289
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,900
And it's just a woman pouring like milk on herself.

1290
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,740
It's like.

1291
00:53:24,740 --> 00:53:26,900
- That's the thing, dude.

1292
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:28,980
It's a combination of like,

1293
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:34,800
they're using the same tactics that they use to like

1294
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:38,480
get kids to like counting and math,

1295
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,680
but for fucking like porn.

1296
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:43,440
That's what those videos are on TikTok where it's like,

1297
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,480
oh, you learn the ABCs while you watch somebody cut foam.

1298
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,360
Right, but they're doing that with like,

1299
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,160
yeah, a woman is like putting,

1300
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,480
which fruit fits in my asshole right, you know?

1301
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,120
- Yeah, well that's what you feel.

1302
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:59,140
- That's the future of gooning is like game footage,

1303
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,940
family guy and then pornography like one corner.

1304
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,980
Yeah. Well, I mean, that's like what feeds look like when they have like no,

1305
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:09,420
no like user input. Like the pod, the podcast feed,

1306
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:12,380
like when whenever I like peek into it, when I log into it,

1307
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:17,820
it's always like 80% it's just like something extremely pornographic.

1308
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:22,900
Like I think the other day I saw just a woman just breastfeeding on tech talk.

1309
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,860
Well, that's not pornographic. That's completely natural.

1310
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,900
You can think that's pornographic. You fucking scumbag.

1311
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,900
What the fuck dude, that's natural.

1312
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,900
She pulled out her whole thing.

1313
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:34,900
On TikTok.

1314
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:36,900
How else is she gonna put it in a baby's mouth?

1315
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,900
There's skits on there, I don't think.

1316
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,900
And then, yeah, they're kids.

1317
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:42,900
They don't understand what's wrong, they were just doing that themselves

1318
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:44,900
like 2, 3, 12 years ago.

1319
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,900
Exactly.

1320
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:48,900
I just think it doesn't have to be documented.

1321
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:52,900
It's a beautiful, natural thing.

1322
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:54,900
You're putting cameramen out of jobs.

1323
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,900
Good men, who used to work at National Geographic

1324
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:02,900
National Geographic and now their job is to film a woman with an iPhone 14 breastfeed a baby.

1325
00:55:02,900 --> 00:55:05,900
And you want those people, you hate those people.

1326
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,900
I do, yeah.

1327
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,900
Because they're union workers. You hate them.

1328
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,900
Yep. They unionize.

1329
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:14,900
It's true.

1330
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:16,900
Despicable. I hate you.

1331
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:21,900
Honestly, being sober has made me realize that Juvio is a monster.

1332
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:29,340
I'm not a monster. He is a monster. He's so he's like probably the worst person. I know I know it's not true

1333
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:36,320
Wait, no one name one despicable like they've done in the past month. You were late to the meeting this morning. I

1334
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,480
Was not even late you were monster behavior

1335
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:46,820
He's 30 minutes. He's fucked up the recording last time. He's 30 minutes late. He fucked up. That's not true time

1336
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,380
You plug in your PS5 controller.

1337
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:53,380
There's something called, have you ever heard of a term, you may not have this in Mexico, conscientiousness.

1338
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:58,380
You have low conscientiousness and high neuroticism.

1339
00:55:58,380 --> 00:55:59,380
Okay?

1340
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:00,380
That's not even true.

1341
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:02,380
I'm gonna send you some Jordan Peterson videos.

1342
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,380
You are a complete Mufasa from the Lion King.

1343
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,380
That's you.

1344
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,380
Low conscientiousness, highly neurotic.

1345
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,380
You're Mufasa.

1346
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,380
Me?

1347
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:11,380
I'm not Mufasa.

1348
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:12,380
Me? I'm the parrot.

1349
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:16,380
What's his name?

1350
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,380
George.

1351
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,380
Rolfo.

1352
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:22,380
Or Rulo. What's his fucking name?

1353
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:24,380
Jubio, get on that.

1354
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:26,380
I'm looking for something else.

1355
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:28,380
Oh, sorry.

1356
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:30,380
Just because we're on a different show, you think your job has changed?

1357
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,380
Look it up!

1358
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:34,380
Yeah.

1359
00:56:34,380 --> 00:56:36,380
I was looking for this.

1360
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:38,380
Don't show them!

1361
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:42,380
You can't see the book,

1362
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,380
but I'm holding the

1363
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,500
It's over a little bit.

1364
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,100
And a good kid, Matt City.

1365
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,660
Can you imagine?

1366
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:51,380
Look at his feet.

1367
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,380
And he's got Crocs on, and he's completely bowlegged.

1368
00:56:54,380 --> 00:56:57,380
And his Crocs are 40 sizes too big.

1369
00:56:57,380 --> 00:57:00,060
That's just how big my feet are.

1370
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:00,560
Whoa.

1371
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,780
What size shoes do you wear?

1372
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:02,860
Big ass feet.

1373
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,140
11, 12.

1374
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:06,660
Did you say women's 12?

1375
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:07,740
11, 12.

1376
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,260
[LAUGHTER]

1377
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,460
Yeah, same size shoes as me.

1378
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:13,020
Women's.

1379
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:13,980
That's not true.

1380
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,740
That's not true, dude.

1381
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:16,860
What?

1382
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,860
Sure, you do not have.

1383
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,940
Yeah, you do not have.

1384
00:57:18,940 --> 00:57:20,580
I wear a 12.

1385
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:21,100
Really?

1386
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:21,500
Yeah.

1387
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:22,460
That's a lie.

1388
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:24,900
A children's 12 years old?

1389
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,540
What?

1390
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,060
No.

1391
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:34,180
No, actually an awesome 12 plus is what I would say.

1392
00:57:34,180 --> 00:57:35,780
Put your feet on camera right now.

1393
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,500
Lean back.

1394
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,940
No, that is not going to happen.

1395
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:41,660
You do not want to see my feet.

1396
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:43,820
Do you have socks on?

1397
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,260
I do not have socks on. In my own house?

1398
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:46,760
Why?

1399
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,980
Fuck no. Because I have nice wood floors.

1400
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:49,580
Look at that!

1401
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:50,860
Oh yeah!

1402
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,260
Guys, I don't like this.

1403
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,620
The way, the direction that you guys have taken this.

1404
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,620
Your creative direction is really poor.

1405
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,500
Are you calling me poor?

1406
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,540
Yes, I am.

1407
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,540
Prove me wrong by sending me money.

1408
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,740
Yeah.

1409
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,420
Maybe on a special day.

1410
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,220
Ooh.

1411
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:09,780
Ooh.

1412
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:10,460
Christmas.

1413
00:58:10,460 --> 00:58:12,060
I'll give you a gift.

1414
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,180
Whoa.

1415
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:17,140
- Guys, I am really, really excited for St. Patrick's Day.

1416
00:58:17,140 --> 00:58:19,180
He's gonna give me a pot of gold.

1417
00:58:19,180 --> 00:58:23,060
- What would you do if he sent you a really nice bidet?

1418
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:24,340
Would you use it?

1419
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,180
- A bidet?

1420
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:26,380
Yeah, I would use a bidet.

1421
00:58:26,380 --> 00:58:27,340
But that's the kind of thing

1422
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,460
that I gotta clear with the boss.

1423
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:34,460
Anything that comes into my house has to be wooden, pretty much.

1424
00:58:34,460 --> 00:58:39,480
So, I just bought a bathroom scale,

1425
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:42,460
and I bought one that is so terrible.

1426
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:44,460
And so useless.

1427
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:46,460
No, no, no, no, no.

1428
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:48,460
I bought it without asking her.

1429
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:50,460
And I bought one that's this big.

1430
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:54,460
And it's, but it's glass.

1431
00:58:54,460 --> 00:58:56,460
So I have to, and I hide it.

1432
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:58,460
I hide it every day.

1433
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,460
So if you could send me a wooden bidet,

1434
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,460
maybe, like,

1435
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:04,460
the aesthetic of my house is, you ever see those

1436
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,460
roller coasters that hurt your back?

1437
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:08,460
The really old ones?

1438
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:10,460
It's too expensive.

1439
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:16,460
Yeah, like they should just tear it down and put one of those ships that goes back and forth, but instead...

1440
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:22,460
It's happened like five times. I'll send you all the time codes.

1441
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:29,460
Next week, it's going to be so incredible, I'm going to get a new USB-C cable.

1442
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:34,460
And the people are going to really appreciate that. I think I have a strong feeling that people are going to really appreciate that.

1443
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:39,100
We are now taking bets on whether or not you forget to buy the USB C cable

1444
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:42,580
I'll take the I'll take the forget line

1445
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,920
Yeah, what's that - 500?

1446
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:51,060
Yeah, that sounds about right. Yeah, I don't know how it's work

1447
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:54,540
- means it's more likely

1448
00:59:54,540 --> 01:00:04,220
It makes sense to me yeah, well fuck you how about that yeah, I like that

1449
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,060
- Yeah.

1450
01:00:05,060 --> 01:00:06,520
- I think, you know what I'm gonna do guys?

1451
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:09,020
Instead, because I did not have a beer tonight.

1452
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:09,860
- Uh-huh.

1453
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:11,940
- As soon as we're done recording,

1454
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:13,420
which will be in the next minute or so,

1455
01:00:13,420 --> 01:00:15,120
I'm gonna walk over into my kitchen

1456
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,780
and I'm gonna smoke so much weed that I have to, I get,

1457
01:00:19,780 --> 01:00:22,180
like, I like smoking weed and then it's like

1458
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:25,000
a ticking time bomb before I actually go crazy.

1459
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,160
So I just, I will have to go to sleep in the next 30 minutes

1460
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:30,260
and that's gonna be such a freeing feeling.

1461
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:32,620
- I'm happy for you, man.

1462
01:00:32,620 --> 01:00:33,780
- What are you gonna do, Rex?

1463
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,840
because you didn't have a beer,

1464
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,440
so you need to hurt your body in some way.

1465
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,080
- We'll be going back to work until late at night.

1466
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:43,840
- Workers high.

1467
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,800
- Yeah.

1468
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:45,880
- Yeah.

1469
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,720
- Yeah.

1470
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,840
- Cheerio.

1471
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:50,820
- Yes sir.

1472
01:00:50,820 --> 01:00:52,160
I drank a buff, what do you mean?

1473
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:53,000
What do you mean?

1474
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,820
- He drank a buff. - He drank a buff.

1475
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,660
- He's drunk.

1476
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:57,320
He's drunk.

1477
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:58,160
- We're done.

1478
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,200
- He said I drank a buff.

1479
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,280
- I drank a buff.

1480
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,040
- Till next time guys, bye.

1481
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:03,540
Bye.

1482
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:04,040
Bye.

1483
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:14,040
