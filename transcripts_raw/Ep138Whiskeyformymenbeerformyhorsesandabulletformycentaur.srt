00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,660
- Podcasts for the hopeless.

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,240
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,420
- You're a crap monster.

5
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,900
(explosion)

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:13,740
- Okay.

7
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,580
- Mm-hmm.

8
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,700
- Thank God you made it, dude.

9
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,940
Cameron's about to destroy you.

10
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:19,780
- Cameron's about to kill me.

11
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:20,600
- Yeah, he's about to kill you.

12
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,540
- Cameron is fucking annoying, dude.

13
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:22,380
Every single episode.

14
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,200
- There's fire in his eyes.

15
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:24,040
- It's not funny anymore.

16
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:24,880
- Fire in his eyes.

17
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,260
It still makes me laugh

18
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,700
'cause I don't have to do any work on it.

19
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,940
- There's not a good energy to start the episode with.

20
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:35,060
to try and start it by pissing me off. It fucking makes me mad. It's not gonna be fun for me

21
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,060
to do it. Yeah, you're gonna- you're at the- you should wait till the end of the episode

22
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:45,820
so I don't have to talk to you anymore when I'm mad at you. This style play is not fun

23
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,420
for me. That Travis McElroy video was so fucking funny dude. It's- did you see the one- did

24
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,220
you see the one where he's like- he's doing that grating like baby voice, like that horrible

25
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:08,480
fucking yeah yeah yeah it's actually not fun for me to play in in DK mode with the

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:15,660
big heads on it's just not fun for me to play this style god damn shut up it was

27
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:19,780
so I mean those are people I learned I was reading about it those are people

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,980
he's like barely ever played with before yeah what's so funny about that too is

29
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:29,140
how clear you can just see like how alien his brain is because in his mind he's

30
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:33,220
like the people that are watching my stream right now are watching so that

31
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,900
they can see among us gameplay they want to see among us gameplay they don't want

32
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,420
to hear anybody talk about it yeah he imagine like like one day when they when

33
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,540
he eventually kills himself and then they cut open his head and his and his

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:50,820
brain is just like pickled in hair dye and they're like oh that makes perfect

35
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:59,820
sense this is why this guy was so fucked up. Pickled in hair dye? Yeah. God, dude, that's such a fucking crappy image.

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,580
The mascara like infected his optic nerve. It spread all the way to his brain.

37
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:12,780
Yeah it's like a venom symbiote. Who have you guys been up to other than watching

38
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,900
his streams? That boy looked like a clone. Yeah what if we start like a

39
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,300
a Paul is Dead type conspiracy about Travis McElroy that he was replaced with

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:29,020
the clone yeah that boy look like a clone that's all I'll say on the matter

59
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,640
You're like the stupidest guy I've ever met in my life.

60
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:53,640
I mean, truly, I felt like a complete crackhead. I was like... He parked in front of a basketball

61
00:03:53,640 --> 00:04:00,640
hoop and we just hit his evil piss rig and then immediately I just went inside and I

74
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,860

75
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,660
your face from puking I looked fine like it looked like no it looked like you

76
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,820
You popped blood vessels in your face.

77
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:05,660
- I looked good.

78
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,120
I spent that whole day on the couch.

79
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,960
I kept like--

80
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,940
- You were on the call,

81
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,120
you were in the fucking Zoom call just like,

82
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,600
(groaning)

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,220
- I made plans with a friend that day,

84
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,100
and I was like, yeah, we'll do something later tonight

85
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,980
when I feel a little better.

86
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,020
And then I just kept pushing it back by 30 minutes

87
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:25,400
and being like, I can't get off of the couch right now.

88
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,500
It was not a good day.

89
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
I'm all right now, you know?

90
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,300
I'm enjoying the fresh North Carolina air.

91
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,060
- I have not felt like that in so long,

92
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,660
it feels so good. Don't have to wear a mask here, that's nice. You don't. And go around just

93
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:42,740
fucking licking shit and sucking dick. Yeah? Where? Where you suck a dick

94
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,460
in North Carolina? You're not sucking dick down there, I don't believe you. You know, the park.

95
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,500
Oh, okay. The park that was recently renamed, it used to be Hugh McCrae Park, turns out.

96
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,740
- Human Crate Park. - No, not Human Crate Park.

97
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,340
- It's the Wayfair Park. - No.

98
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,420
(laughing)

99
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,020
It was not Human Crate Park, but they renamed it, dude.

100
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,460
My hometown is so fucking awesome now.

101
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,260
That guy used to be a slave owner.

102
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,500
- Oh, okay. - So they said,

103
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,340
"You know what?

104
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,260
"You don't get no park.

105
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,780
"You don't get to own a slave and a park.

106
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,620
"That's why it's Human Crate."

107
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,700
- That's why it's too much shit.

108
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,300
- Yeah. - No.

109
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,260
- They were like, "No, we can't have this park

110
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,580
"named after a slave owner."

111
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,820
and they changed the name of the park to Slave Park

112
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,780
to honor the past.

113
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:28,180
- This was for the slaves.

114
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,260
- Yeah. - Yeah.

115
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,760
- We should be putting statues of the slaves up.

116
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,780
- What do you mean? - Yeah, wait, yeah.

117
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,180
- Yeah, put statues of the slaves up.

118
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,780
Be kinda cool.

119
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,620
- They should just--

120
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,800
- Modeled after me.

121
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,660
Every one of 'em has my face.

122
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,540
- In a way, I am kind of a mental slave.

123
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,540
- Yeah, I used to be a slave to the school system, low key,

124
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,880
which is like kind of a worse kind of slavery.

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,560
That's, you wanna talk about modern slavery,

126
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,820
I'm pretty sure that's what people mean

127
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,860
when they talk about that.

128
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,820
Probably public school and public universities and colleges.

129
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,660
Yep.

130
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,460
You know, and the systems they're in.

131
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
You know?

132
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,820
And also lunchtime will only be in 25 minutes.

133
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:08,660
You used to be 30.

134
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,100
If you know me, you know I hate the system.

135
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
You love the system.

136
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,940
I hate the system.

137
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,760
You're like maybe one of the--

138
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,620
I hate the system, I flip off the system.

139
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,060
You subscribe to the system.

140
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,420
You subsidize the system, $5.99 a month.

141
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,300
I don't do that with the system.

142
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,780
I hate this. The only system I like is gaming system.

143
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:27,060
That's not true. You hate gaming system.

144
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,180
I love gaming system.

145
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,500
And you love the normal system.

146
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:33,580
I love gaming system. I hate patriarchal system.

147
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,740
You love the system. You love the man.

148
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:38,740
I hate the man. Fuck the man.

149
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,620
You love the man. You want to give the man a kiss.

150
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,740
Hey, the man. Check this out.

151
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,340
Yeah, he's holding up a heart with his fingers.

152
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,980
He's holding up a kiss from his mouth.

153
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,140
He's holding up an edible arrangement.

154
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,980
And he's saying, here you go, the man.

155
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,480
No.

156
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,280
Hey, the man, will you go on a date with me?

157
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,680
Can we find out who the frickin' man is so I can throw some shit at him?

158
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,180
You wanna throw him a party?

159
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,980
I don't wanna throw a party for the man.

160
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,480
You wanna go to a man party?

161
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,480
No.

162
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,480
Yeah, you do.

163
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
If I did, there'd be nothing wrong with that.

164
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:06,980
You wanna go to a-

165
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,980
You wanna get outside the man system?

166
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,980
Nope.

167
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,980
You wanna enter the man system as a test subject?

168
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,980
Maybe I do.

169
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,480
Yeah, you do.

170
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,980
And, buddy, that's fine.

171
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:30,740
I'll try to big dog me. Don't do that dude. No, not happening.

172
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:33,520
Yeah. But what have you guys been up to? Have you

173
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,200
guys poisoned yourself recently? No, I have not poisoned myself for almost 90

174
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:44,320
days now. Yeah? Except for like gyros and cold cubanos

175
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,280
that you get. Yeah.

176
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,360
- And Jool and--

177
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,200
- Yeah, Jool, I mean--

178
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,200
- I put no toxins in my body whatsoever.

179
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,480
I'm pure. - I don't eat or drink anything.

180
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,320
- I've been--

181
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,080
- Just information for me, thanks.

182
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,840
- Just infrared light for me, sorry.

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,160
- Just solar energy, please.

184
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,840
- Yeah, just pure radiation, that's all I need to get by.

185
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,680
- I'm trying to get you pure.

186
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,120
- Dude, this outdoor dining at the restaurants

187
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,400
has been great 'cause I can finally photosynthesize

188
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,240
instead of ordering.

189
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,060
(laughing)

190
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,900
- True, yeah.

191
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,440
- The waiter comes over and I just raise my eyebrow at him

192
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,240
and I say, "I don't think I'll be needing you today,

193
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,080
"thank you very much."

194
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,480
But do you have like a big reflective piece of metal? Yeah, I stripped down naked and I'm green

195
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,880
Yeah, can I buy it? No, thanks. Do you guys have any solar panels back there?

196
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,780
Is there a guy hat with a solar panel on it that I can wear?

197
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:32,360
I can plug it on my butt and I can continue to live and so you're still eating and drinking

198
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:38,480
That's really cute. You haven't you haven't converted your shit to electric instantly dies when it rains one day

199
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,520
Yeah

200
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:47,040
That'll be the next thing. They just find you shriveled up on the sidewalk. You couldn't get inside

201
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,300
Yeah, just like from the clowns just arms hanging down just body hunched over in the middle of the streets like ah shit

202
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
Yeah, his battery got wet

203
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,160
It's just a 9-volt. It's like it's like a 9-volt battery. That's just got a slot on your neck

204
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:09,560
We're headed that way dude. Mm-hmm. We're headed that way and there will be and we will be I will be one of the detectives

205
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,100
who investigates deaths like that yeah yeah cuz I'll probably be coming soon the

206
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:21,680
deaths like where they were saying is being a detective not yet but maybe soon

207
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,720
maybe like once once what's one of you what's it you go to the fucking costume

208
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,200
store again and open yeah and you you in a fucking I don't have a costume store

209
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,960
you go to a costume store every other episode no I go to the third store and

210
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:46,120
sometimes it's a post Halloween sale and they have costumes and I mean when was

211
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:53,360
there no there wasn't a post Halloween sale recently yeah how long did you have

212
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,860
that chef costume in reserve.

213
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,700
- No way.

214
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,200
- Actually a long time.

215
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,400
- You were waiting to do that for eight months.

216
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,960
- When I wore the chef's costume,

217
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,040
I found it in my closet and forgot that I bought it

218
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,480
like last year.

219
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,520
And I was like, this is gonna be sick.

220
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,720
And guess what, it was.

221
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,760
- Yeah, I mean, hey, it was.

222
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,760
It's true.

223
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,240
- So, fuck you, man.

224
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,080
I think you guys need to start wearing costumes.

225
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,520
- I was thinking about it.

226
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,280
I was thinking about getting like a Sonic the Hedgehog costume.

227
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,200
I mean I saw one in a window.

228
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
If you think about it, clothes in a way are costumes.

229
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,640
Actually I'm a robber right now.

230
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,600
You are dressed exactly like a robber.

231
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Yeah, a French robber.

232
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Yep.

233
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah.

234
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Yeah.

235
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,980
I need to, you know what, if I put like a red bandana around my neck, maybe I could have

236
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,980
done that.

237
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,980
But.

238
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:49,820
Is it lunch in France to just eat like a piece of bread?

239
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,820
It's lunch, yeah, and a cigarette.

240
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:51,820
What the fuck is a cigarette?

241
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,160
- Eat a cigarette and a piece of bread.

242
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,560
- That is not keto.

243
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,220
Oh, I think that smoking that weed

244
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,120
also put me into ketosis.

245
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,960
- Yeah?

246
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,560
- Yeah, I think I've been in ketosis.

247
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,660
I think I've been in ketosis for like four days.

248
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm feeling really, really strange.

249
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,360
My pee is like a new color.

250
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,760
It's like closer to white than it's ever been,

251
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,300
which I think is a symptom of ketosis.

252
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,780
I can't, I wasn't able,

253
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,840
I couldn't sit through a movie for a while.

254
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,340
I think I have ketosis. - I've been coughing.

255
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,180
I have no sense of taste.

256
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,700
- Dude, did you see the guy who,

257
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
the Texas Roadhouse guy got COVID

258
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,980
and then it gave him tinnitus

259
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,980
and he was like, "Fuck that," killed himself.

260
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,380
- That's so nuts, dude. - What?

261
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:32,460
- That's sick. - That's so cool.

262
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,180
- Yeah, just being like,

263
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,860
I got these tinnitus demons in my brain.

264
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,220
- Damn, tinnitus. - After COVID-19.

265
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,820
- Though I probably would kill myself

266
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,220
if I had really bad tinnitus too.

267
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,740
- It just depends on how bad it was.

268
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,620
- I have like slight tinnitus. - Yeah, if I had tinnitus

269
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:47,700
and it really is like not good.

270
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,660
- If I had tinnitus that sounded like Lil Wayne,

271
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,620
and that's like the perfect life I could imagine.

272
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,460
You know?

273
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,300
- Yeah.

274
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,120
- Am I just walking around like trying to like--

275
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,960
- Yeah, what dude, tonight is--

276
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,860
- If I was trying to listen in class

277
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:01,060
and I just hear, "A-me-lee, a-me-lee, a-me-lee."

278
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,220
- That'd be kinda awesome.

279
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,220
- It'd be sick to have tinnitus if you're a fan

280
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,060
of like sun or like drone music, you know?

281
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,900
- Yeah, exactly, yeah.

282
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,980
- 'Cause then you just like, you just walk around

283
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:11,580
and you hop into the beat.

284
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,660
- Yeah, bless me. - You know what I mean?

285
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,500
- I'm not gonna bless you, you just please.

286
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,660
- You bless yourself for a burp?

287
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,300
- Bless you, first off, you don't bless people for a burp.

288
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,640
That is not worthy of a blessing.

289
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,480
It's a disgust.

290
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,460
Do you say bless you when someone farts?

291
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,300
- No.

292
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,760
- Only yourself?

293
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,520
- I think I might actually say bless you when people fart.

294
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,900
I think I started doing that as a joke

295
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:36,340
and then it just became a thing that I do.

296
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:39,740
- A burp is a fart, so you're basically still doing it.

297
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,500
- I feel like a burp is more your soul

298
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,620
leaving your body than a sneeze.

299
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,180
You know what I mean?

300
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,020
- What?

301
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:52,140
you're like you know how like what is your soul leaving your body like you never

302
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,740
heard that yeah bless you comes from you you're shooting out your soul and then

303
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:00,460
you say bless you and the soul goes fuck you're right and he goes back into your

304
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:05,180
body cuz I get drats he caught me yeah yeah that's where it comes from right

305
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:10,380
yeah it was invented by the Pope yeah but I feel I feel like a burp is better

306
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:15,820
than a sneeze for that because a burp at least sounds demonic sometimes well

307
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:23,620
there's it's not a demon it's a soul yeah your body it would feel it would sound

308
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,260
demonic why I don't think that's true I think it would sound like a soul I think

309
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,980
it would sound exactly like a sneeze actually I just did a scientific

310
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,940
breakdown I think the real soul leaving your body is when you die and you shit

311
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:40,300
your pants yeah that's like honestly all that closest you get to sure like a soul

312
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,500
actually leaving your body you know it would be I do wish that maybe you burped

313
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,580
out like a blue cloud when you died or something because then I would yeah then

314
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,100
then you could sell to pay for the funeral you could sell tickets to your

315
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:58,180
death it can already do that why not have a blue cloud to do that but I don't

316
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:02,100
gonna watch like somebody just die on a bed if somebody was burping anything

317
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,700
about a bed I mean just make it up cool yeah I guess you're right I mean people

318
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:10,300
don't go to the circus just to see the gut people stand around you know you do

319
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,260
something you have to pay to see somebody be executed no I don't think you

320
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:24,780
do. No. You should. You should. You are giving that away. What the fuck. You need to, one

321
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,280
thing I learned from comedy is you never give away a product for free. Okay. Especially

322
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,760
one as good as a human death. Listen, and if the kind of people who are gonna be sitting

323
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,480
in on a death. It depends on who's being executed. If they, you know, you can tell if they have

324
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,520
no money they're gonna be much less well adjusted than someone who can afford it right? Yeah.

325
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,400
- Yeah, well a very rich person will be.

326
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,920
- Who's gonna be getting executed is almost always

327
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,520
a mentally disabled person, so that makes it

328
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,080
kinda hard to sell the tickets, I guess.

329
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:57,520
But you could, here's the thing, it's a $100 cover

330
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:01,840
with a two drink minimum to see somebody die.

331
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,160
- And there's a lotto spot.

332
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,400
(laughing)

333
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,880
- To die by, that's lethal injection, all right?

334
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,240
Electric chair, that's gonna be $500.

335
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,860
Yeah. If you want to see somebody get electrocuted to death.

336
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,860
And that's a bringer. Firing squad?

337
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
Yeah, firing squad.

338
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,860
Don't even fucking think about not paying for that shit.

339
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:28,280
Yeah, firing squad because somebody got accused of blowing a kiss at a woman in 1940 and now

340
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:33,140
they're finally getting around to shooting him a million times. Firing squad's gonna be

341
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,500
a VIP experience.

342
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,700
It's crazy that they blindfold all the firing squad guys.

343
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,220
Why is that crazy? I guess it makes it hard to see, huh?

344
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,220
Yeah.

345
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,220
Do you, if you don't--

346
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:50,300
No, they don't blindfold them. They just put like blanks in some of the guns, right?

347
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,140
I mean, I don't, I've never done it.

348
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,220
Oh. Cameron, do you know?

349
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:58,300
What? I don't think they blindfold, I think they blind--

350
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,300
Yeah, I know they don't blind--

351
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,300
--the guy who's dying.

352
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:03,180
Yeah, I know they don't blindfold the, that's the joke I was making.

353
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,660
Okay, well you, all right.

354
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
That was a banger.

355
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
It was.

356
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Yep.

357
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:13,260
I've been on fire. I've been up with more questions that were kind of like serious questions to

358
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,380
hide that it was a joke maybe. I don't know. And to ask about like you know blanks and stuff.

359
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,620
No because then I remembered I remembered that I don't remember I think it's a White

360
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:28,820
Is Good sketch. Do you guys know whether they use like Nerf guns or real guns? You know

361
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,320
what they do is they give they give everybody a gun except one guy gets a banana and he has

362
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:37,960
to aim it and he thinks just so that he thinks that maybe he killed him mm-hmm

363
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:44,420
that's how it works so everybody has a different fruit and one guy has a gun so

364
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:48,160
that nobody knows who killed him mm-hmm yeah yeah I'd hate to be the guy that

365
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,260
gets like the durian yeah that thing yeah that would hurt to hold yeah I want

366
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,760
to shoot a point that guy fucking kid pull the trigger brother cuz I don't

367
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:01,520
want to smell this fucking fart thing oh yeah I hope I don't have to hold the

368
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,040
poop fruit. Fuck. Yeah. It is funny that people do eat that and they love it too. I don't,

369
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:13,000
I would try it. I gotta find a place that has a durian around here. Indonesia. Oh okay I'll

370
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:18,520
just go to Indonesia. I think that's probably the easiest way to get there. Yeah, okay.

371
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:24,320
That sounds like a fun trip. Any fruit that is the size of a baby is not a good fruit.

372
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,240
I do not like watermelon. Is a durian the size, I don't like watermelon either. How

373
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,080
- Watermelon either. - Durians are huge.

374
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,360
- Watermelon's like, okay, it definitely,

375
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,920
artificial watermelon's better than normal watermelon.

376
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,900
- This is why a watermelon is not very good

377
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,460
and a cutie is the greatest fruit in the world

378
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,920
'cause the smaller a fruit is,

379
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,600
the more powerful the flavor.

380
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,120
- What is it that you said?

381
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,040
- Durian. - Durian.

382
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,720
- No, the other fruit that you just said,

383
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,560
the small one. - Watermelon.

384
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,400
- A cutie. - What's that?

385
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,720
- You've never had a cutie?

386
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,560
- No, what is that?

387
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,560
- It's a tangerine or a clementine.

388
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:56,080
- Yeah, it's a clementine, but it's like a fake clementine

389
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
where there's no seeds in it.

390
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
It's basically just candy.

391
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,280
What the hell?

392
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,280
Oh yeah, that's one of the best.

393
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,280
I've seen these before.

394
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,280
I didn't know this was like its own thing.

395
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Yeah, it's an artificially made fruit where they-

396
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,280
It's a what?

397
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,280
They bred out all the seeds and made it taste like a warhead.

398
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
And it's the best fruit in the world.

399
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Yeah, I didn't know they were-

400
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,280
What do you mean artificially made?

401
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,280
You're right, it was made-

402
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,280
The indigenous people used to make cuties.

403
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,280
They used to grow cuties.

404
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
No, no, I-

405
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:30,560
every single fucking fruit you buy is is like it's like that yeah you mean like

406
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:35,560
GM okay sorry I I didn't know what the fuck you meant I just really talking

407
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,360
about artificial we were talking about artificial watermelon I thought it was

408
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:46,840
like a robot I don't know to describe it I'm sorry man I you're right yeah that's

409
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,080
my bad it's a it's not like it's not like a

410
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:56,080
cardboard cut out of a fruit that's what I thought you were fucking saying of a

411
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,560
durian looks like yeah it looks like a hue like a whale vagina yeah it looks

412
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:05,400
fucked up I've never seen this before yeah fucked up looks because a durian

413
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,360
looks like a jackfruit but it's not a jackfruit unless it is

414
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,160
on Google images and I found an article in popular science called we finally

415
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:27,200
know how durian got so stinky. Somebody shitted in a coconut 2000 years ago. The subtitle of

416
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:36,000
the article is "It's one funky fruit." Yeah I've never had it but I do I'm tempted

417
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,240
every time I go to like a like an Asian like dessert place I'm tempted to get the

418
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,280
durian whatever it is. Oh yeah. I want to stink up the place like when somebody gets an

419
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:51,560
Asiago cheese bagel and the whole bagel shop smelling like a shit. Yeah. Come on

420
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:57,240
brother. I mean it is one of the best bagels. Yeah. It's so good. No question.

421
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,600
Highest stink to flavor ratio of any bagel though. Bagels most of the time you

422
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,080
can toast a bagel I won't even notice dude. I might just think that the the

423
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:11,380
heat is on. But an Asiago bagel that's unlucky dude. You don't think the heat is on? Yeah.

424
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,220
- Yeah, you know that smell of--

425
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,740
- Somebody brings a bagel into the room?

426
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,500
- No, like somebody toasting a bagel, you know that smell?

427
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,860
That's like very similar to like,

428
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,840
like a light burning in a heat system.

429
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,800
But an Asiago bagel is like somebody,

430
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,460
I feel like I'm filming Jackass,

431
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:28,500
like that's probably the smell of the trailers in Jackass.

432
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,180
- I don't know.

433
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:35,420
I can't, if you had asked me if Asiago bagel smells,

434
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,780
I wouldn't have thought of it as something, a smelly food.

435
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,620
- I'm gonna make you sniff that.

436
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:47,580
I'm gonna stick one on your on your nose I'm gonna put your nose through the hole

437
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:54,980
and then just put it under your lip like Vicks Vapor Rub. But first I'm gonna sew

438
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,780
your mouth shut so you can't eat it mm-hmm and then I'm gonna make you I'm

439
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:02,340
gonna also somehow use a cork to kind of make your nostrils bigger.

440
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
more.

441
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,780
Yeah, and then I'm gonna make you smell it.

442
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,780
I said a cork.

443
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,780
I said a cork.

444
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:08,780
I fuckin', I fuckin'.

445
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,780
And then I'm gonna fuckin' make you smell it.

446
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,780
I fuckin', I fuckin'.

447
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,780
I'ma fuckin' fart in your face.

448
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,780
I fuckin', I fuckin'.

449
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,940
And then I'ma make you smell it.

450
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
And smell it.

451
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,940
And fuckin' smell it.

452
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,940
Where we doing?

453
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:17,940
We were doing that the other day, right?

454
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Where it was just like every.

455
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,940
Yeah, me and Patrick were.

456
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,940
Caleb wasn't part of it.

457
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,940
Oh yeah.

458
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,940
So it's kinda weird for him to jump in.

459
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
Yeah, you're right.

460
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,620
It's not like I'm the most hip hop one on the show, but whatever.

461
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,620
That's fine.

462
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:32,780
all the all the torture things were just him making you eat poop yeah and it goes

463
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:39,380
down real slow like I'll fucking sew your asshole closed and then open it back up

464
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:45,860
and make you poop then feeds you that poop they keep feeding you and feeding

465
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:51,540

468
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:10,660
torch does anybody do that has it you know how they like burn food to see how

469
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:18,220
many calories there are in them poop is one of the extremely food that's all you

470
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:23,820
You know that prank where you put a flaming bag of dog poop on your neighbor's doorstep?

471
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,820
That actually evolved out of a...

472
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:25,820
That was created by a scientist.

473
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,220
Yeah, it was a laboratory thing that got adapted for use by children.

474
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,220
It escaped the lab.

475
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,220
It went to Mr. Johnson's house.

476
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,220
Yeah.

477
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,220
Yeah.

478
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,220
And it just started...

479
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,220
The prank was developed in a lab.

480
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Yeah.

481
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
And it spread by accident.

482
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:43,260
It spread all across the nation.

483
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,460
It actually happens in most pranks.

484
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,460
Spread to Adam Sandler.

485
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,460
Yeah.

486
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:55,700
Yeah it was very irresponsible for them to put that in Billy Madison. Yeah yeah

487
00:23:55,700 --> 00:24:00,740
cuz it is a it's a mental virus dude. Mm-hmm I did that I think everybody did.

488
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,260
I never did that that was the one. You never set a shit on fire dude? No I never did that either.

489
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:07,900
That was the one I had we had plans to do it and then we like thought about it more and

490
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:11,220
we're like well we have to pick up the poop. I used to shit in everything dude.

491
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,220
I would shit in bags and. Wait you did it with human poop not dog poop? Yeah.

492
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:23,860
the fuck is wrong with you? What's your problem? I don't know, I was a weird kid. I would like

493
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:28,940
spend most of my days looking for snakes and then shitting in bags and either throwing

494
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:32,740
them at a school nearby or lighting them on fire. Yeah man I'm weird, I would go looking

495
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,860
for snakes. That's how you knew I was fucked up, I would try and find them. Yeah, most

496
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,300
people, most people, they run away. Most kids, their snakes are trying to find them. But

497
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:48,620
I went looking for the snakes too many snakes found me fuck fake friends. Yeah, damn damn. That's actually true

(laughing)

540
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,080
- Sorry.

541
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:49,900
- It's still so good.

542
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,440
- It's just so funny to write about being a centaur

543
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,280
with that name.

544
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,120

545
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,940

548
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,760
I wonder if this guy's a Viking.

549
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,440
- Mr. Peppermint the Viking.

550
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,560
(laughing)

551
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,440
- Centaur is a mythological creature

552
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,880
with the upper body of a human

553
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,420
and the lower body of a horse.

554
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,880
They're always portrayed in movies or books

555
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,760
as wise, kind, and strong creatures

556
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,580
with their six pack abseye, making most people think

557
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,640
it must be awesome to be a centaur.

558
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
But is it?

559
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,240
Let's objectively think together

560
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
about what it's like to be a centaur.

561
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,240
- Let's objectively think together.

562
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,440
- I will put my brain together with yours, Mr. Pepper.

563
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,920
We will mind meld to solve this problem.

564
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,120
- It's framed like a Ben Shapiro thing.

565
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,320
- Right. - Yeah.

566
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,960
Yeah, well, is it, how?

567
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,460
- Let's objectively think about this.

568
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,800
You have the body of a human,

569
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,000
but you have the lower half of a horse.

570
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,040
Now, people will try to ride you.

571
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,780
People will try to ride around on you.

572
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,440
People will take you by the arms.

573
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,800
And they'll try to use your arms like motorcycle handles.

574
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,640
- It's kinda hot.

575
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,920
Pull his arms back.

576
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,700
- I would never want a penis the size of a horse.

577
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,780
Structurally, it doesn't make any sense.

578
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,920
- I feel like I might tip over.

579
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,160
- It would weigh me down.

580
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,080
- I would never be able to go to the supermarket

581
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,640
ever again if I was a centaur.

582
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,900
(laughs)

583
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,880
Number one, problems start for a centaur,

584
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,200
even when it's a baby.

585
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,460
While they were not able to keep their human neck upright,

586
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:23,040
their horse parts start walking within an hour after birth.

587
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,340
- What? - Is that true?

588
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:26,000
(laughs)

589
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,360
- I mean, I'm not-- - I mean, this is a really

590
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,400
good one because he can just make all this shit up

591
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,240
as he goes.

592
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,140
- I don't know if he's making it up.

593
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,800
He might, this--

594
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,120
- This is all from experience.

595
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,720
- Yeah, dude, he's fucking Mr. Peppermint.

596
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,680
- It's Mr. Peppermint, dude.

597
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,160
that's a good boy does the mail i forgot it was mr pepper the male centaur in

598
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,440
this drawing is that a stick

599
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,380
uh... where the dick would be held at the bump

600
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,100
looks like a look at it looks like a hefty kinda

601
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,420
canopy g bump

602
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,520
you know i mean like a big again the cat it's it's like it's like it's like you

603
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,360
know it's a little bit of a little bit and all

604
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,420
although they did give juicy titties to the girl one

605
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:05,820
they did

606
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,240
so that's kind of an interesting double standard

607
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:13,800
I'd just like to point that out. You can't show a giant horse's penis but you can show a centaur's

608
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:20,480
boobs? Come on society. What kind of world are we living in now? This is so messed up.

609
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,400
That's what Ben Shapiro needs to talk about. The fact that they won't let a man's penis,

610
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:32,680
or a horse's penis be shown. A centaur's penis. A centaur's penis. See even I got tripped

611
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,160
up. Do you think it's different than normal horses? I think maybe it's a little bit smaller

612
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,600
than a horse's penis.

613
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Why?

614
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,000
Because of the human genes.

615
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,640
Is any other thing smaller?

616
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:47,120
Yeah, is it probably their fucking hooves?

617
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
What?

618
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Why?

619
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,600
Just think about it.

620
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,320
Why would their hooves be smaller?

621
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,680
I am thinking about it.

622
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,520
It doesn't make any sense.

623
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:00,360
Is half horse, half human, why would there be any cross pollination?

624
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,480
There's a line.

625
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,120
Their whole thing is cross pollination.

626
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,500
Yeah, but there's a there's a clear line where you could cut a centaur at the waist and you could say it's not it

627
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,540
These might as well be two different things. Yeah

628
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,480
Yeah

629
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:21,540
The hooves are covered up in this drawing right and they look small

630
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:28,700
That's one big thing about being a center you got by two pairs of Jordan. Oh, yeah, dude, that sucks

631
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,880
Yeah, that's a bummer dude also. I mean yeah, also. There's

632
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,160
Really a tiny one yeah

633
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:43,240
Your foot is a you and they have to be circles fuck this getting harder every have to be right

634
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:48,800
Oh, you the worst part about being a centaur starting to understand. Why horses don't wear Jordans, right?

635
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,080
Yeah, just stuff that look like newspaper thinking about this

636
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,880
Does not be fun dude if you own if you listen to this show and you own a horse

637
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,420
and you have a pair of Jordans,

638
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,760
can you put them on your horse and see what happens?

639
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:02,140
- Yeah, get right behind the horse

640
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:03,820
and try to put a Jordan on its hoof.

641
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,960
- Yeah, put like a Jordan 7 on a horse.

642
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:10,120
- Yeah, get down on all fours underneath the horse.

643
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:13,580
- With your head facing the same direction as its head.

644
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:16,580
- And put a Jordan in your butt crack

645
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,680
and then so that it has a place

646
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,420
where it can slide on the shoe.

647
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,260
- Yeah, its foot.

648
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,080
- Exactly.

649
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:22,920
- Yeah.

650
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,760
- Yeah.

651
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,840
- Put its hoof on your foot.

652
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:48,960
your butt crack.

653
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,360
Number 2, like any other mammals, baby centaurs need to be breastfed, but how?

654
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:59,520
human breasts or horse breasts of the mother or from both for different parts

655
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:04,440
of a baby of a baby's body what does it have a horse mouth on its bottom half

656
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,840
what are they talking about you have to like hook up your penis like a tube

657
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:18,520
horse tip yeah how else for it or from both because they have a picture here

658
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,960
body they have a picture here of a baby centaur being breastfed the baby that's

659
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,320
- That's not a baby centaur though,

660
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,360
that's like a child's body growing out

661
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:30,040
of the back half of a centaur.

662
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,480
- Well maybe it hasn't grown,

663
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,240
maybe it has like tiny horse hooves.

664
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,700
- It has no legs.

665
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,800
- Yeah, do they grow the horse later?

666
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,840
- I think so.

667
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,360
I think you grow the two sides separately

668
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,360
and you snap them together.

669
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:46,240
- The horse half starts walking within an hour after birth.

670
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
- Have you ever seen a horse give birth?

671
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,240
- On like video, not in real life.

672
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,520
I've seen a zebra give birth on video, not a horse though.

673
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,980
It just falls out, right?

674
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,820
Yeah, it just hits the ground.

675
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,200
That's crazy.

676
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,680
I mean, they seem to be doing okay.

677
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,520
Damn.

678
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,720
Can you imagine how much smarter they would be?

679
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm just thinking about,

680
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,160
no, 'cause it's like a centaur being born.

681
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,200
If it does have the legs

682
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,080
and it just kind of falls out like that.

683
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:23,360
true and it also has the soft human skull. Right, so it would just be kind of like

684
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,960
an Ace Ventura rhino situation but with like with horse legs. Wait, how would

685
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,720
the centaur baby come out? Head first? Head first, yeah. Hopefully.

686
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:39,640
Yeah, like most babies. But I will say, horse babies do come out hoof first.

687
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:45,560
Yeah. Do they? Yeah. Maybe what if the horse, the hoof and the head is pointing in

688
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,600
the same I would hate to give birth to a horse that's the it would hurt so bad

689
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,280
oh that's a good thing about that that at least zebras do I'm guessing horses do

690
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:01,000
too but the video I saw that the lady just pulls the zebra by his leg just out of

691
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,920
just into the world just fucking shakes it out it's pretty good

692
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:11,360
camera can you share this video of the horse birth that you're watching I'm

693
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
- I'm trying to look up if the horses come out here first.

694
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,860
- Centaur birth?

695
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,100
- I'm trying to find a centaur birth.

696
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,300
- I'm gonna look up centaur birth video.

697
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,820
- Whoa, when horses are born, their hooves are soft.

698
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,740
- Ugh. - Yeah, dude.

699
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,220
- Nasty.

700
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,300
Okay, I found a video right here.

701
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:29,260
- One of the recommended questions

702
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,520
when I Googled are horses born hoof first

703
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,180
is can a horse give birth to a pony?

704
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,540
(laughing)

705
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,380
- Yes.

706
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,860
- Check this video out I just sent.

707
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,060
- Is this a horse video?

708
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,320
- This is an Mpreg centaur birth.

709
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,180
- I am on my younger brother's computer

710
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:49,260
and he is not allowed to watch this video apparently.

711
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,660
(laughing)

712
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,380
Here, I'm pulling this up right now.

713
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,440
- Okay, so in this video the head is coming out first.

714
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,340
It's all animation, it looks like a storyboard.

715
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,180
- Yeah.

716
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,860
- Yeah, the baby--

717
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:05,260
- It's childbirth, male, this music is just heartbreaking.

718
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,100
- Yeah.

719
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,980
- Why are they, why is this,

720
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,980
Why did they choose this music?

721
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:14,160
There's a comment here on the video from Bobo.

722
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,020
It says, "I randomly saw this and at first I was disgusted,

723
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,340
now just watching the whole thing made my heart break."

724
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,640
Is this a sad video?

725
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:25,640
The music sounds like a sad scene in a video game,

726
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,480
where like a character that you don't care about dies.

727
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,980
I'm on the credits, programs, pencil,

728
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:34,480
iMovie, soundtrack, sad romance.

729
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,880
So it came out head first in this video.

730
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:42,660
special thanks to for serenity baby you are my only god i think it might be a

731
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,120
stillbirth

732
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,080
you know i don't want

733
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,160
that is awesome

734
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,880
if you are making yourself a car that works in the world pick up

735
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,120
i think i have to do it

736
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,560
that's what i like to see

737
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,880
yes that door

738
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,480
trying to get birth with

739
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,400
killing

740
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,840
those fucking it's like the monkey the people who think monkeys are pests so

741
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:10,400
So they like watch monkey torture videos on YouTube and comment like, "Yes, fucking kill

742
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,400
monkey.

743
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm so happy."

744
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
What?

745
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
Is that a thing?

746
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
People don't know about that?

747
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,400
There's monkey torture videos?

748
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Oh yeah.

749
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,400
Yeah.

750
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,120
What kind of crime could a monkey commit?

751
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,240
They're like rats in like whatever country they're like rats in.

752
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,400
Oh yeah, okay, that makes sense.

753
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,800
That's like dogs and- And you know, we watch like rat torture videos

754
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,800
this week.

755
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,800
Yeah, you know how we are.

756
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,880
You already watch people torture bugs all the time.

757
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,200
It's just because they're pests.

758
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,440
It's not because anyone has any weird mental problems.

759
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,800
Yeah, I guess you're right.

760
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:45,200
I do think one of the greatest things that I know is that in parts of Mexico, dogs will

761
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:48,560
just chase people down the street if they ride on a motorcycle.

762
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,120
And so you have to have two people on the motorcycle, one person to drive it and one

763
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,360
person to hold a bat at the back and just beat off all the dogs.

764
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:59,360
Jesus Christ.

765
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
That's so funny.

766
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,360
It is very cool.

767
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,360
cool yeah and also it's traditional to carry around steak in your pocket in

768
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,560
Mexico that might be part of the reason yeah yeah all right number three oh go

769
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:17,160
ahead you like no I read the last one you read the camera and you children are

770
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,600
picky eaters so imagine having us so just imagine having a centaur kid you

771
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,720
need to know not only the human food they would like but also the right horse

772
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,680
food I don't think there's a picture of a child

773
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,960
Let me think, uh, chicken nuggets and hay.

774
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,960
And oats.

775
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
Done.

777
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:34,960
What the fuck are you talking about?

778
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,520
With a deep fried hay.

779
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,720
I don't think they would need to eat two separate foods too.

780
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,200
You could probably just give them, figure out which one they like.

781
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,000
I think they're gonna like chicken nuggets more than hay.

782
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm just gonna, I'm just gonna throw a guess at it.

783
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,520
Right, it doesn't have a horse stomach.

784
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,920
The mouth is human, but the back end is horse, so they like eating chicken nuggets better,

785
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,640
but they like shitting out hay better.

786
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,960
True, that's a good point.

787
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,280
I guess horses don't eat meat.

788
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,880
What would happen if you fed a horse a burger?

789
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,640
If horses ate meat that would be genuinely so scary.

790
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
They'd be so big too.

791
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,240
Can you imagine horses fucking hunting us down?

792
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
Those things are scary.

793
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Oh my god.

794
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
It would be the kings of the planet.

795
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Yeah.

796
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
Which I think of humans as.

797
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,560
They look kind of like xenomorphs, their heads.

798
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
It's true.

799
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,560
Horses look fucked up.

800
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,560
They have those fucked up teeth.

801
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Yeah, and the long.

802
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,040
They have like human teeth.

803
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,280
No, their teeth go out.

804
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,800
They have like British human teeth.

805
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Yeah, true.

806
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,040
Yeah, I don't like I like no animals that have like flat teeth animals should have sharp evil teeth look at this thing dude

807
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,820
What the fuck that's it? Oh my god dressed up like a centaur

808
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:38,760
Look at this look at this picture of horse teeth

809
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,560
Just Google Google image search horse. Yeah

810
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,280
This is more silly as hell

811
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,320
And search horse teeth there for this horse watching scary this horse is

812
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:58,560
Sorry, I layer the cable gas off dude. He's here in the bowling shoes joke for the first time

813
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:04,720
He's heard about the super finger. Mm-hmm. He's like, I wish I could if a horse if a horse could do the Sioux fi

814
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,660
Fuck it's over dude. They don't even need to eat meat then they run this shit

815
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:17,000
Yeah, do the horse to be taken over the BK lounge you're gonna fend me to death. Yeah. Yeah horses love coops

816
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,040
All right, what's that Dane Cook joke about the atheist sneeze or whatever?

817
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

818
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,320
Could you imagine telling a horse to try and say God bless you to you or whatever?

819
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,280
Yeah, what if the horse did the pimp walk across the street?

820
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:33,780
Right.

821
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,440
You know? Yeah, I saw this guy doing some horse walk across the crosswalk.

822
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:39,720
I saw a guy trotting.

823
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,640
He's trotting, he's doing a pimp trot.

824
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,920
All right, number four and I am

825
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:52,000
And I am NOT even talking about their toilet training. What do you mean is a horse it shits on the ground?

826
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Yeah, it's standing up!

827
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
Non-stop, day in day out.

828
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
This picture is evil. The picture attached to this is not okay.

829
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
That is a, that is a, do not,

830
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
genuinely, the person who threw this should go to jail.

831
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
But they should go to jail.

832
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
The way that it's looking up to, ugh.

833
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Yeah, this is a naughty, nasty photo.

834
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,000
I'd send that thing to the glue factory right away.

835
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
Imagine drawing this picture and then having the audacity to fucking sign your name on it.

836
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
Dude, the stork drops that monstrosity off at my house.

837
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,520

838
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:30,080

839
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,080
right now but I'll make him wear a mask just drop him off at the glue factory

840
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,320
they have a bin it's like this coming back home with the Chinese take a bag

841
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:50,800
full of jello five or let's talk about it what what is this grabbing a rebound at

842
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,200
the end of the game just imagine half-human baby centaurs defecating

843
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:01,140
around like horses we already did an asshole dude mr. pepper the next

844
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:09,300
pictures my favorite. We'll post this picture with the episode. Number six, sleeping is another issue.

845
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:15,700
Did you ever think of centaurs sleep? And it's like an alcoholic centaur lying on the ground

846
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:22,260
like a human centipede. Yeah that is not a good photo either. Yeah. I never considered how long

847
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:28,260
it would be. I'm glad I want to meet the guy who drew this one. If it had longer arms it could walk

848
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:39,140
around the thing about this this art is that every every drawing of a centaur

849
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,660
that's like from the internet you it's fetish art right like it has to be

850
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:47,060
there's no way you just draw a centaur because you think it's great

851
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:54,020
centaur it's like suffering from some kind of alcohol issue and doesn't even

852
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,020
look sexy at all.

853
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:01,020
You don't think he looks sexy dude? Look at that. Look at how tortured he looks.

854
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,420
Yeah, that's sexy. Yeah, I just looked up fat centaur.

855
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,420
That's a mistake. The first image is

856
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,420
real, real good.

857
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:12,420
Yeah.

858
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,120
I'll describe it.

859
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,260
It is a fat

860
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:23,260
uh... fat centaur eating a whole cake outside of a Baskin-Robbins.

861
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:28,120
we need to get a new species on earth this is getting so boring I found I found out

862
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:32,540
how I found out why this centaur picture of the suffering centaur is horny I

863
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:37,060
reverse image searched it and found the deviant art of it uh-huh and the

864
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:42,100
description says the title is quote morning after you can make up your own

865
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:48,860
story to go along with that oh this is a post this is a post fetish centaur Jesus

866
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,380
Christ. Yeah, look, look, there's three centaurs behind him. He just got ran

867
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:58,640
through, dude. Yeah. There's like three shadowy centaurs. Wow, can you imagine how

868
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:02,060
much beer it actually takes to make a centaur drunk? It would be measured in

869
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,080
barrels. I'll tell you how much, I'll tell you how much beer it takes to make a horse

870
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:10,780
drunk. One sip, because they've never, they don't have beer, they're just not able to

871
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:15,040
drink beer. I don't know, I think, I think you could feed a horse a couple Budweiser's.

872
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:21,720
I would love to hotbox of the barn with my horse. Yeah, like people. I know no no no that's danger

873
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:27,480
No, I think that's I would rather get a horse drunk than get it high. I'm gonna get my pet bear high

874
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,860
And we're gonna watch we're gonna watch zombie land together inside

875
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:35,680
Actually turned on the revenant with

876
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:44,760
I can't wait to give my my pet 21-foot alligator abilify

877
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:49,200
I'm sure his mood is going to be so stable.

878
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,720
Have you ever seen that video of the guy who swims with a polar bear in like a pool?

879
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:57,520
No, is he a penguin?

880
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,600
No, he's just like an old white guy who kind of looks like a polar bear.

881
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:07,760
I've definitely talked about this before and now that I'm thinking about it, I've 100%

882
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,760
talked about this.

883
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,640
I want to see different centaur type animals where you just put two together.

884
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:17,940

898
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,100
gator instincts

899
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:06,380
okay okay cool thanks for letting us know about that

900
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:10,460
i'm terrified of that i'm thinking of a cat with a gator

901
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,420
Wait, hold on guys, I'm thinking.

902
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:17,960
Okay, now you can keep going with your joke.

903
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:21,100
Number seven, and being unable to perform

904
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,180
your own personal care and dependent on others

905
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:24,860
for grooming your horse body.

906
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:28,140
You can reach, give yourself a reach around, dude.

907
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:30,540
I guess it'd be tough to, you don't really wipe your ass.

908
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:33,020
That's a, could you lean over

909
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:34,940
and suck your own thingy as a horse?

910
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:36,940
Just go in the water.

911
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,940
No way you can suck your own thingy.

912
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:41,340
Yeah, no, it doesn't matter how many ribs you get to move.

913
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:44,540
How much can you move with the centaur body?

914
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,540
Like, something like...

915
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:50,540
You definitely couldn't lean back.

916
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:51,840
You could lean back a little bit.

917
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,340
I mean, you're not gonna be like, you're never gonna be like comfortable,

918
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:58,940
like watching the Super Bowl, you know, like that's gonna be a tough ask as a centaur.

919
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:02,740
You know, a centaur friend in a friend group is gonna fuck up a lot of hangs.

920
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,240
Yeah.

921
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,240
You know what I mean?

922
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
Especially when you live on the fifth floor.

923
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,340
Yeah, that's a walk up.

924
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:13,040
floor walk up no elevator good luck buddy that's not gonna be fun mm-hmm you know

925
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:20,000
I had to put my friend down the other day. Imagine waking up at like 3 a.m. cuz your

926
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,080
upstairs centaur neighbor like had to go pee so you like you just hear like

927
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:32,160
slamming around and then just a 10 minutes of a fire hose well that's a nice

928
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:39,240
thing about being a centaur is you could you could stand up to pee. You don't

929
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:46,760
stand up to pee already? No. What if I fall over? Sorry, I'm just thinking about...

930
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:49,600
I would need four legs if I was going to stand up to pee. You're thinking about something again, dude?

931
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,360
Yeah, your centaur friend getting stuck on your stairwell just because you can't

932
00:47:54,360 --> 00:47:59,040
walk down? Or is that cows that can't walk down stairs? Oh, fuck. You know what, I'm

933
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,580
I'm gonna go ahead and say most animals cannot walk downstairs.

934
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,580
It's true.

935
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,900
I'm gonna say that's not...

936
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,540
What do you mean most animals can't walk downstairs?

937
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:12,260
I think a horse or a cow, any four-legged animal that is not like small, would have a pretty

938
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:15,020
tough time with human stairs.

939
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:17,020
I don't think that's most animals, actually.

940
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:19,380
I don't think a cricket could walk downstairs.

941
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:23,940
I'm sorry, I should have been more specific so that you wouldn't have no idea what I was

942
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:24,940
talking about.

943
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,900
A horse, I don't think, could walk downstairs.

944
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:27,900
Yeah.

945
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:32,540
can walk downstairs all right then do it get a horse go get a horse right now

946
00:48:32,540 --> 00:48:36,480
yeah put it to the test fucking Jamie Heineman myth bust that I dare you we

947
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:42,380
should start our own myth busters thing okay it says they have difficulty going

948
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:46,140
down but doesn't say it's impossible

949
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:57,180
it says yes here on reddit.com I thought it was what about like a half man how

950
00:48:57,180 --> 00:49:03,820
look at this dude I'm right it says depends on the staircase okay but like a

951
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:08,580
walk up in like an apartment I don't think like six stairs either side with a

952
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:14,740
platform it mentions that it says he's actually super good at it yeah it says

953
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:22,260
it's quite easy sis this horses hang out at apartments all the time I have a show

954
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:30,420
pony in my studio apartment. Number eight, not having a proper life at home. It must be

955
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:35,380
awful not to be able to use almost any human stuff. Well here's a show him sitting on a couch.

956
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:42,500
Here's a centaur in an apartment. And also he's eating popcorn and drinking beer. He's got a hookah, he's got some guitars.

957
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:46,660
This just looks like a normal guy. Can you tell what the album covers are on the wall?

958
00:49:47,300 --> 00:50:06,300
I

959
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:11,820
Yeah, he's got, okay, he's got the Mountain Goats Tallahassee poster, he has a cake poster.

960
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:13,820
I don't know what the other poster is.

961
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:15,820
What's that other magazine say?

962
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,380
Is that Metal Gear Solid?

963
00:50:17,380 --> 00:50:18,380
It looks like it.

964
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:19,380
Is that Game Informer?

965
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:20,380
That's Game Informer.

966
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,660
Dude, this horse is just, this centaur's chillin'.

967
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,660
He's a baller, yeah.

968
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,660
They have a gaming centaur?

969
00:50:24,660 --> 00:50:25,820
He's drinking Budweiser?

970
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:26,820
He has like four colors.

971
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:30,900
This picture is answering a lot of questions we've had earlier about centaurs.

972
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:32,780
It's kind of blowing my mind, actually.

973
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:36,100
Yeah, I would hang out with this centaur.

974
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:39,780
He's- oh my god dude he's holding the bowl of popcorn with his middle legs.

975
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,780
Fuck!

976
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,780
Dude.

977
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
Holy shit.

978
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,780
I wanna be a centaur now just for that.

979
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,100
I need me the centaur upgrade.

980
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,260
Yo I need me a pair of middle limbs for real.

981
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,940
I mean this whole time we've been kinda like not into the centaur thing.

982
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:56,300
This picture right here is changing a lot of stuff for me.

983
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:57,740
That's the life dude yeah.

984
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,820
He also has horse ears which I think debunks one of Caleb's theories from earlier.

985
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,340
Oh man imagine wearing headphones as a centaur.

986
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:06,500
Oh that there's no yeah.

987
00:51:06,500 --> 00:51:10,820
I just bought a pair of Beats by Dre and I can't even wear them because I'm a fucking

988
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:11,820
centaur.

989
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,820
If you're a centaur you'd probably be buying some eats my hay.

990
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:18,900
True, that's a good point.

991
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,460
That's pretty good.

992
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,460
Yeah.

993
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:28,020
So what do you think before you speak next time?

994
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:29,020
That's what I want to see dude.

995
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:30,660
I want to see the centaur products.

996
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:31,660
Yeah.

997
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,660
You know.

998
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:33,660
I mean mane and tail.

999
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:41,780
change number nine is except the kissing part their sexual life is technically

1000
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:51,420
all about mating I guess they have an uncontrollable bottom half that just

1001
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:56,260
needs to fuck for procreation life is but then the top half loves kissing the top

1002
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,580
half is very romantic would you kiss a centaur woman yes you'd be a little man

1003
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:06,700
for my taste as long she's under 5'6" sure that's fine she's got an ass so big

1004
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:16,020
she needs four legs to support it. Ass so big I could see it from the front. She is a centaur.

1005
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:20,180
The picture is like kind of like tender and pleasant you know yeah yeah this is a

1006
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:24,020
kind of just beautiful mm-hmm number 10 you always have to walk around naked

1007
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,580
have you ever seen a centaur wearing a shirt or pants? I'd be the first centaur to wear a shirt.

1008
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,300
Yeah, I think we have it. Oh, yeah, that's a tank top. That's not a shirt

1009
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:39,060
No, I don't sound like that

1010
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:47,020
Pants, I also feel like somebody you you could give a horse pants. Yeah, just a male never been a reason to I put chain

1011
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,300
Yeah on

1012
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,600
Well, yeah, that'll weigh you down. Dude. I were like barding. I would be a fucking like Lord of the Rings horse

1013
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:59,080
That'd be so cool. I mean if you're a centaur you could just do like yo if you were a centaur

1014
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:04,420
I'm a knight's armor you could do you could wear one of those like two-part horse costumes by yourself

1015
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:09,340
And then somebody would like run over and try and like like trip the back one or something to make a joke

1016
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,620
They get a damn to the face

1017
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:13,440
You see right by the way

1018
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:20,520
This is in a world where there are centaurs that people see so the person is that's like a defensive costume

1019
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:25,000
Yeah, well so the horse the horse part the back half of the costume would look normal

1020
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,320
But then the front half the neck would be really long because you have your whole upper body - true

1021
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:32,560
So it's like it would be a really cool-looking horse

1022
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,460
Probably a giraffe actually now that I think about it more a giraffe with a really thick neck. Oh

1023
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:40,460
Man

1024
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:43,520
What half human half giraffe?

1025
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:46,040
What about a giraffe?

1026
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,820
The giraffe half is at the top half and the human half is the bottom.

1027
00:53:49,820 --> 00:53:52,620
So they just have a really long giraffe head.

1028
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,860
Yeah, because the back half of a giraffe is not interesting.

1029
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:57,240
So it's just like Geoffrey the giraffe.

1030
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,640
Yeah, now we got a Bojang Horseman character now.

1031
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,140
Yeah.

1032
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:02,440
No, but it's not the head.

1033
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:03,640
He's depressed.

1034
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:04,640
It's the middle.

1035
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:06,640
Yeah, and he's depressed.

1036
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,140
Yeah.

1037
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:08,640
Yeah, and he's a musician.

1038
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:09,640
We're doing something different.

1039
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,640
He's very happy.

1040
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,640
He's the happiest horse in the world.

1041
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,640
He's the happiest half giraffe half man.

1042
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:20,140
has no mental illness yeah and it's just about him hanging out smoking weed with

1043
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:25,180
Seth Rogen fucking getting pussy yep how about that and since he's got a human

1044
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,680
lower half it's not weird to show it on TV when he gets some and he's got a size

1045
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,920
13 foot but he is he does have a granny fetish though yeah it's a little messed

1046
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,980
up but but it's like not illegal you're you're yeah you're thinking it's gonna

1047
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:44,240
be worse so then it's fine yeah number one he's already so famous I mean he's

1048
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:50,960
probably talking to like some famous grannies Betty White did yeah like

1049
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:55,620
granny goodness I think Betty White's look is fucking so he's ran through by

1050
00:54:55,620 --> 00:55:04,880
Hollywood what I'm just wondering dude you think she's still fucking and sucking

1051
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,680
for rolls I think that's how she has such a long career still you give me this

1052
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:16,120
role I'll make it worth your while I'm a hundred and seven years old. She does not do that! I'm not

1053
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,720
saying that she does, I'm saying it's possible. She does not. It's like you don't have an imagination.

1054
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:27,480
I have childlike wonder so I imagine things like that sometimes. I yeah I'm more imaginative than

1055
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:35,400
you. Okay well you imagine a disgusting sex thing for once. Okay all right. Go ahead if you're so

1056
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:42,360
imaginative think about it what about sex missionary style yeah between two

1057
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,200
crabs how about that that's funny hey don't don't try and fucking don't try and

1058
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,400
add on to mine I'm still thinking I win the imagination for this missionary

1059
00:55:52,400 --> 00:56:05,080
style between two - - you almost said two men a man and a woman Wow

1060
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:12,680
I can't think of anything. You have writer's block. Yeah. Dude, I have writer's block right now.

1061
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:16,200
All I can think of is a man and a woman having missionary sex.

1062
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,120
Oh, for three minutes?

1063
00:56:20,120 --> 00:56:28,760
When they were writing the Kama Sutra, the author was having a really hard time because

1064
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,360
"Oh, I have a great new idea. Oh, fuck."

1065
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,360
[Laughter]

1066
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:37,860
That was such a guy, getting writer's block, just throwing stuff at the wall.

1067
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:38,860
That's it, we got it.

1068
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:41,860
He's like, "Uhh, upside down? I don't know."

1069
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,360
Upside-- wait!

1070
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,360
Yeah, that was the big breakthrough, is when he dropped the page and it like flipped around on the ground.

1071
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:50,360
He was like, "Wait a second."

1072
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:52,360
[Laughter]

1073
00:56:52,360 --> 00:56:58,360
Yeah, no, his fucking son got a hold of the manuscript and was making origami out of one of the pages.

1074
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:05,080
he was like oh my god that's it there it is yeah he saw two squirrels fighting

1075
00:57:05,080 --> 00:57:13,400
outside as he's trying to write that's it that's the one I have to make a box

1076
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:19,320
with the two people this is gonna be awesome

1077
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,520
around and he just looks at an alley just sees sucking someone's dick it's like

1078
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:26,240
Eureka!

1079
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:34,840
yeah the Kama Sutra was written in 1948 yeah in Illinois yeah what will I call it

1080
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:45,480
the Kama Sutra it was originally called David's big sexy

1081
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:56,480
David's hobo fuck positions. It was called the ways I've seen hobos fucking in the alley near my house.

1082
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:04,480
The publisher was like that name is not doing it. We can't do that.

1083
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:12,480
Why don't we just use the hobos names?

1084
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:19,000
Number 11 although centaur bodies always depicted muscular in a perfect shape being an overweight an overweight centaur must really suck

1085
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:21,000
Ah true probably be fine

1086
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,880
She's eating the whole cake outside basket Rob. That's true. It's a good point

1087
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:33,080
Number 12 a centaur is doomed to be a warrior. There is almost no office career for them hold on

1088
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:37,560
Oh, what we are I said warrior. You said a centaur is doomed to be a what yeah?

1089
00:58:37,560 --> 00:58:39,560
I did not say that you did

1090
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:40,960
I hope I did.

1091
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,360
That's a weird accent choice to make.

1092
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:43,360
Yeah.

1093
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,360
I didn't say it.

1094
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,360
I liked it though.

1095
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:46,360
I thought it was good.

1096
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:47,360
I thought I said it normal.

1097
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:49,720
I think a centaur could have an awesome office job.

1098
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:50,720
Warrior.

1099
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:51,720
See I just said awesome.

1100
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,440
It happens to the best of us dude.

1101
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,440
Read the thing again.

1102
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:58,080
A centaur is doomed to be a warrior.

1103
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,440
Is that really how you say that?

1104
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,440
Yeah.

1105
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,440
Why?

1106
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:02,440
Warrior?

1107
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,440
Are you joking right now?

1108
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:04,440
No I'm not joking.

1109
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,440
I can't tell if you're leaning into it or not.

1110
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,440
Warrior.

1111
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,300
There it is.

1112
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:09,760
You realize there's two R's there.

1113
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:14,600
not like a made-up letter new letter that makes the Y sound. He thought he was

1114
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:22,800
speaking Spanish. Yeah. He said warrior. How did I say it? You said warrior. You said it like it

1115
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:31,000
rhymed with lawyer like three times. Oh fuck. Anyway that is that's fucked up. I

1116
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,040
don't think it's true but it's fucked up. No you could have it you could easily

1117
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:38,480
have an office job for a centaur. That'd be like a hilarious NBC sitcom.

1118
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:40,840
Yeah, it'd be great.

1119
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,640
The next picture is something else too.

1120
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:45,160
It's too late for subway.

1121
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,920
Can you give us a ride, Centaur?

1122
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:49,800
We will move our house this Sunday.

1123
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,480
Could you help us, Centaur?

1124
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,000
This little guy wants to ride you.

1125
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:56,080
Can you let him get on you for a few minutes?

1126
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:58,240
Why would you hire a centaur to help you move?

1127
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,240
Yeah, I don't think that's true.

1128
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:04,640
No, just, I mean, people still are gonna have cars.

1129
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:07,560
There are a lot of people that look weird around.

1130
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:12,000
don't go up to him that and ask for rides yeah it's also hard to ride a horse

1131
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:17,800
it's not easy but do you think it'd be easier to ride a sensor I also think I

1132
01:00:17,800 --> 01:00:20,920
don't know why you would that's like a session or reason we want to ride a

1133
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:25,160
horse would probably be fucking scared shitless of a centaur right just a point

1134
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,960
I mean cuz it's like here's the thing I love but there's also an ugly shirtless

1135
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:37,200
man on top of it yeah it's part of it true how many more are there so only two

1136
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,000
- Two more. - Yeah.

1137
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:42,080
Four legs, two arms, and one tail.

1138
01:00:42,080 --> 01:00:45,000
They must be used in a harmony, taken good care,

1139
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,280
periodically horseshoed, et cetera.

1140
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:50,040
- One of the things I hate most about having my two arms

1141
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:52,320
and two legs is I have to use them in harmony.

1142
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,280
- Right. - It's so annoying.

1143
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,440
I wish I just had one of everything.

1144
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,580
- Yeah, I wish I just had one thing.

1145
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,240
Like I'm not even, not a head or a body.

1146
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:02,960
- I need to be more streamlined.

1147
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,400
- I wish I was just-- - Dude, it's the cloaca cube.

1148
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:06,680
- True, but that's even two things,

1149
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:07,600
'cause you have a hole.

1150
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,400
I wanna just be-- - It's a cloaca and a cube.

1151
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,220
- Yeah, I just wanna be a cube.

1152
01:01:11,220 --> 01:01:13,220
- I just wanna be a cloaca.

1153
01:01:13,220 --> 01:01:15,300
- I would look, just like on,

1154
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,200
and you just slap it on something like a black--

1155
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,980
- Yeah, like a googly eye. - Like a hole in Looney Tunes.

1156
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:22,000
- Yeah.

1157
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,480
- Number 15, and you know what fate awaits you

1158
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,880
in case you ever break your leg.

1159
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,800
I don't know, probably cast?

1160
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:33,000
- Yeah.

1161
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:33,840
Yeah.

1162
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:35,280
Yeah, yeah, baby.

1163
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:42,160
Yeah, I mean, I see a centaur in real life. I'm not waiting for it to break its leg.

1164
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:44,320
Yeah, that thing's on site.

1165
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:45,320
Yeah, definitely.

1166
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:50,040
If centaurs are around and it's acceptable to shoot them when they break their leg, it's

1167
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:53,240
absolutely acceptable to shoot them before they break their leg too.

1168
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:57,240
Yeah, it's also like if you ever want to murder a centaur, it's like the easiest fucking...

1169
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,240
Yeah, just break his leg after you do it.

1170
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,240
You shoot him in the head and then break his leg.

1171
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,240
Oh yeah, he broke his leg. I put him out of his misery. Oh, it was so horrible.

1172
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:05,240
Yeah, you can also just say...

1173
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,240
I actually loved that he fucked my wife with his big horse dick.

1174
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:09,240
I had no reason to kill him.

1175
01:02:09,240 --> 01:02:11,240
But he broke his leg. I'm lucky, dude.

1176
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:13,240
Yeah, he broke his leg going up the stairs to fuck my wife.

1177
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,240
Yeah.

1178
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,240
He was in the middle of fucking my wife.

1179
01:02:17,240 --> 01:02:19,240
Oh, he was so miserable.

1180
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,240
And he broke his leg.

1181
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:23,240
The Martin Scorsese cameo in Taxi Driver.

1182
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,240
You know what this does to a centaur?

1183
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,240
[laughter]

1184
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:29,240
Alright.

1185
01:02:29,240 --> 01:02:31,240
There it is. Centaur facts.

1186
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:34,280
How do I feel? There's a reaction button on the bottom. I'm gonna hit him with a

1187
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:38,920
thumbs down. That was a terrible article. I'm doing thumbs down. I'm hitting him

1188
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,800
with a surprise. Mr. Peppermint, a surprise is coming to you.

1189
01:02:43,800 --> 01:02:51,240
Yeah. From Patrick. Get ready Mr. Peppermint. All right, bye everyone. Bye everybody.
