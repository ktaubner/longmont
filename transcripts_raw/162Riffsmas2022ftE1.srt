1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
*intro music*

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, well, well.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Andrew, Brandon, and Chuck.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It's been nigh a year.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Tell me.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's been nine years.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
What's been going on with you guys in the past year?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Like just my personal life?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
No, no, no as a...

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Or just in the news maybe.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,900
Oh, that you thought--

12
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,400
We're working on our credit scores.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,920
--that you liked a lot.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,080
Let's see.

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,560
Biden did some stuff, right?

16
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,120
There was-- he gave us some money, I think, like less--

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,240
I think that was a year.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,740
And then--

19
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,240
No, that was way before that.

20
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,740
Yeah.

21
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:43,240
No politics.

22
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,480
That was like two years ago.

23
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:44,980
No politics.

24
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:45,800
Yeah.

25
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,120
No politics, nothing socially divisive.

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,520
He legalized it, I think.

27
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,040
That happened in the last year.

28
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,120
So yeah, this year we discovered a video

29
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
called the evolution of dance.

30
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,120
Oh.

31
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,240
Not familiar.

32
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,040
I want to see that.

33
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,260
It's pretty new I've been really into rolling Wingo lately

34
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:04,440
He's kind of been really cool to me

35
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:10,180
I've been like interested in like his stuff and his scene and kind of people he's been talking so rolling Wingo

36
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,920
He's kind of like a player. I mean you go on his Twitter

37
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:17,560
He's got like 70 80 girls responding to everything. He says every blurry Christmas tree. He posts

38
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:22,520
And some of these girls that are responding to him are also in like Andrews DMS honestly damn

39
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,080
Oh, he's kind of giving--

40
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,200
He's kind of like your OG.

41
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,700
Yeah.

42
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,200
Oh, for sure.

43
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,120
He's giving a-- he's like redistributing.

44
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:33,880
Oh my god.

45
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,040
I mean, these are the hottest women I've ever seen.

46
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:36,600
Oh my god.

47
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,520
We're talking about Fleezer Sandy, Boo Boo--

48
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:40,040
Yeah, Burry Boo.

49
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,160
Silverton Kifty Jones.

50
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,080
That's three Os, but--

51
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,760
I mean, we're talking about these 10 out of 10 sport--

52
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,280
you know, maximum qualified women.

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,560
And they're-- he's--

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,080
oh, go ahead.

55
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,480
I'm gonna be going to Three Pumpkins, California to meet her.

56
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,280
But she got--

57
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:57,780
Whoa.

58
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,620
I don't really know how to get a hold of her.

59
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,640
Three Pumpkins?

60
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,640
That's where she lives?

61
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,920
Three Pumpkins, California is where she lives.

62
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,680
That's where I was sending all the money.

63
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,200
[LAUGHTER]

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,400
How much money did you send her?

65
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,240
I was taking it out of E1.

66
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,200
So it wasn't that much.

67
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,600
Because it's a write-off.

68
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,100
Yeah.

69
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,200
It was like $17,000.

70
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,040
That's not that bad.

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,560
The IRS--

72
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
That's not that bad.

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,360
Convince everyone she's part of our business

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,400
to get the write-off.

75
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,580
The IRS gives you like a tax break for getting pussy.

76
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,680
I heard that.

77
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,520
- She's not just some pussy to me, watch your mouth.

78
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,520
- Yeah, you heard that, you don't know that yourself,

79
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,640
you just heard it.

80
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,240
- Well, he hasn't had sex with her yet,

81
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
so he doesn't like saying stuff like that.

82
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,800
- Well, she tells me about it,

83
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,320
but she doesn't call her her pussy.

84
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,360
- She tells you about her pussy?

85
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,460
- I just think it's honestly really weird

86
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:44,000
that you're still into her when you know

87
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,760
she would eat dog food out of Roland Wingo's hand

88
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,600
if he asked her to.

89
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,160
I think you should just let her go, dude.

90
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,280
- I mean, who wouldn't though?

91
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,200
That's that's like what an American female wouldn't do that

92
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,280
and with Roland Wingo.

93
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,400
Roland is like the Paul Newman of for bots, you know.

94
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,680
I mean, we're on a we're on a podcast with some young people,

95
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
maybe not do Paul Newman.

96
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Yeah, you I would say you guys are definitely of Paul Newman's time, though.

97
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,600
Yeah, sure. You know, I was in

98
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,640
a moment was really kind of hitting his peak for us young guys.

99
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,720
You should have said Paul F. Tompkins.

100
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,800
Yeah, we would understand that. Yeah.

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,240
You'd understand Blady better.

102
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
I don't know anything about Blady.

103
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,160
Old head just said Blady.

104
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,920
You know he's 28, he's not that young.

105
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,600
Yeah, that's how I know you guys are old and out of touch.

106
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:36,240
Okay, well it's not my fault that he can't fucking spell his own goddamn name.

107
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,520
Well maybe it's spelled different in Sweden or whatever.

108
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:43,440
I like to say it Blade, Blade, Blade, no it doesn't work, nevermind.

109
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,080
No, that's all the same word.

110
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,560
I had to confess something.

111
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,280
I'm kind of done riffing, I'm not riffing anymore.

112
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,960
Okay, Andrew, it's rich miss. What are you fucking on about? So we win?

113
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:59,080
That's cuz you got fleas or sandy on your brain damn

114
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:03,880
Yeah, I told you that you got it. Do you guys just want to have like a heavy conversation then?

115
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,840
No, I told you before that I was texting him right before this

116
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:10,280
He needs to go to the bathroom and he needs to take care of it before we record you guys

117
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,400
He's gonna be talking about

118
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,580
Sandy the whole time and burry boo and all of the money that he sent them

119
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,880
The blood if you just would have went yes if you just want to went to the bathroom beforehand and taking care of it like a

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,240
Grown man, yeah, I wouldn't have this problem. He wouldn't be all say for Riff Smith's. You're a grown man. You still jerk off in the bathroom

121
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,040
That was granted that put that out there

122
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:37,540
I hope no one sees me in my bathroom or my apartment alone

123
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:42,720
Yeah, what if the exterminator comes over yeah

124
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,280
I'm just gonna jack off in a chair and...

125
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:50,280
Sprays my dick and my balls like, "Oh, ow, ow."

126
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,280
I hate that.

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,280
"You're not supposed to be out here jacking off."

128
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,280
What are you doing?

129
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
I'm getting all your bugs out.

130
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,280
Don't you know war's going on?

131
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,400
You've got your bug out and you're rubbing it.

132
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,320
I'm trying to exterminate all the bugs.

133
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,800
When you're married, you do have to...

134
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,800
You jack off in the bathroom and you really ham it up too.

135
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,800
You light a match, you open up the door afterwards like, "Oh my God."

136
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,800
I think a batch to get.

137
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
Oh wow.

138
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Turn on the shower.

139
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
I had to shower after that one.

140
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,800
Yeah.

141
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Yep.

142
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
That was a huge shit baby.

143
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
What's for dinner?

144
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Yeah.

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,300
And then I kept slipping on the bathroom tile back and forth.

146
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,800
So if you heard any noises, that's what was going on.

147
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,800
I learned how to do this cool thing with my cheeks in the bathroom.

148
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I was kind of sliding around on the floor.

149
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Check this out.

150
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Just walking out of the bathroom, you're like, you're still super hard.

151
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
You're like, I just took the biggest shit.

152
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,800
Wow.

153
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,600
The whole time your phone's connected to Bluetooth, it's in the bedroom and is just playing everything

154
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,600
you're watching.

155
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Dude, that's the big danger of jacking off in the bathroom is airplay, man.

156
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
God damn airplay.

157
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,640
I'm sorry I wanted to watch an NBA game last night.

158
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,560
Technology's gone too far.

159
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
I agree.

160
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Andrew, keep this in mind when Fleece or Sandy moves in with you.

161
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,560
Yeah, we need to get rid of it.

162
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
Can we stop talking about her?

163
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Can we move on?

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,120
This is not Fleece or Sandy hour.

165
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,920
You guys are talking about Roland Wingo.

166
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:08,480
I just remembered this other guy from Instagram.

167
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:16,400

172
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:43,520

173
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:50,280
people I've ever seen. There's something about Christmas trees that old horny guys love to

174
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:58,000
post pictures of Christmas trees. I don't know what it is. I do worry about that when

175
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,160
somebody's like, "I gotta get my phone charger, I gotta get my phone charger." I'm like, "I

176
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,880
I hope he's not doing some rolling wingo shit on there.

177
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:07,760
- Every time I find an old guy on Twitter

178
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,520
who's posting a picture of his groin

179
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,240
and it looks just like an upside down ziggurat,

180
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,720
like an Aztec pyramid,

181
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,560
I feel like I could,

182
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
literally I'd scroll two more pictures

183
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,640
and it's always a Christmas tree.

184
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:20,480
It's always.

185
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,320
- Yeah.

186
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,160
- They love Christmas.

187
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
- Or just a depressing family photo

188
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,320
in some shitty house

189
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,720
and then back to his weird marshmallow nipples.

190
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,600
- Those guys are cool because like,

191
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,100
they all love to do the tongue out thing

192
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,780
And you can do the thing where you flatten your tongue

193
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,940
and stick it out normal like that.

194
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,300
But the guys that do the little chode

195
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,140
that's barely peeking out with the mouth,

196
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,200
they're just like--

197
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,540
- I love the little tongue.

198
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,520
One inch tongue.

199
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,700
- It's a little cuter, I would say.

200
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,220
- It's a feeling cute might delete type of thing.

201
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,120
- Yeah, 65 year old men rarely get an opportunity

202
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,660
to feel cute.

203
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,240
- It's like a Pokemon face.

204
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,900
- There's this one guy that I found

205
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,660
in the replies of like a, I don't remember what,

206
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,660
but this guy is obsessed with genital piercing

207
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:08,800
and right-wing politics.

208
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,560
- Oh, interesting cross-section.

209
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,400
- Yeah.

210
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,480
- I've seen that guy, Patrick.

211
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,060
- He posts a lot of Christmas trees.

212
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:19,600
- It's the season, you know.

213
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,440
- He got the big--

214
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
- These guys gotta get some wholesome content.

215
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,720
- Is that the guy who's like German?

216
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,140
- His name is Matthew.

217
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,440
And just take a look at this one here.

218
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,920
Whoa, that's such a good Christmas.

219
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,480
Look at the caption.

220
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,240
Look at the caption here.

221
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,320
Gorgeous cleavage--

222
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Can you read the caption?

223
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,600
Gorgeous cleavage and lips for pleasure.

224
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,880
He's going after that Sapphire Saint.

225
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,560
Sapphire Saint who asks, can I be owned?

226
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,360
Tatted plastic Barbie bimbo sex doll.

227
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,920
Double XL boobs, 2,200 and growing.

228
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,540
Still growing tits and ass no way so this guy's double XL booze. That's huge. He's into a few things

229
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:11,160
Dick piercings turning into an action figure and fucking people who are turning into action figures in Christmas trees. Yeah

230
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:22,440
This Sapphire Saint seems like a pretty nice young lady. Oh my god. She has an only fans never mind Jesus Christ

231
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,920
Look at her. She's naked sinful life

232
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,560
Oh yeah, she really is like, she's gonna hurt her titties.

233
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,160
I'm looking at her titties and she keeps talking about how she puts more of the plastic stuff

234
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,160
in them.

235
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
It looks like they're gonna pop.

236
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,660
Yeah, she's gonna be, you know, suckers are gonna go.

237
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,160
She can't get on an airplane without blowing them up.

238
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,160
They've popped before.

239
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:51,200
But if she does get on an airplane and it crashes, she's the only person surviving the

240
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
water landing.

241
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:55,920
- She's like an interesting case in that all of her pictures

242
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,080
are of her naked, but you really can't tell

243
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,840
what she looks like 'cause it's all so blurry.

244
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,980
So it's like a sexy cryptid.

245
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,320
- It's just like the Christmas tree photos though,

246
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,560
they're always blurry.

247
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,960
- This is the Owl Witch.

248
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,560
This is the Owl Witch from Mexico, the legend.

249
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,800
- This is La Llorona, what's her name?

250
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,080
- My Llorona.

251
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,120
- This is My Llorona from Mexico.

252
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,600
- On the first episode of the new season of The Witcher,

253
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,080
he's gonna fuck this bitch.

254
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
(laughing)

255
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,800
Grumbling at her titties.

256
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,320
- I wish it, can you get your balls this big?

257
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,480
- Yeah. - Or is that impossible?

258
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,320
- Oh, yeah.

259
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,960
Dude, you've seen BK Bulge, we've talked about him in 202.

260
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,320
- Oh yeah, that's Saline.

261
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,160
- You guys familiar with Hydro Seal?

262
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,160
- No.

263
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,240
Oh wait, is that the machine he uses?

264
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,080
- No.

265
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,140
- Is that the thing that you spray on the screen door

266
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,980
to make a boat?

267
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,680
- No, I had a friend in high school

268
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,320
who had a hydro seal.

269
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,920
And it was-- he literally had to get one of his balls

270
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,280
drained once a month.

271
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,400
Whoa.

272
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,120
The sack would just fill with fluid.

273
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,760
And he said they'd get pretty big.

274
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,600
I never saw them.

275
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,880
I wasn't that cool back then because--

276
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,880
I see it a lot.

277
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,240
I would have made sure to see it.

278
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,920
I see it a lot at work, especially people

279
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,800
with heart failure.

280
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,880
So their body just can't pump all the fluid around it.

281
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,800
So a lot of people just collect in the stroke.

282
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,200
[LAUGHTER]

283
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,960
(laughing)

284
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,320
But what you do is like their balls get so big

285
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,120
that you have to take like blankets or towels

286
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,440
and make like beds for their balls to sit on.

287
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,840
- Like a little bird's nest?

288
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,680
- Yeah.

289
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,520
(laughing)

290
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,360
- I wish I had that.

291
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,520
- Otherwise they get like,

292
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,320
they're gonna collect all this gunk under there,

293
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
get like excoriations.

294
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,800
- Is that the medical term is gunk?

295
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,800
- Yeah.

296
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,960
- Your balls are covered in gunk 'cause it's so big.

297
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,960
- One of my favorite things about when you're charting

298
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,520
is you can't write pussy, you have to write like pure ruralent

299
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,920
that's like the same thing.

300
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,400
Yeah, you can't write pussy because it looks like pussy

301
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Right like

302
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
like

303
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:01,940
Pussy got vaginal discharge. It's just like you can't write that like yeah, there's white stuff coming out of the vagina, but

304
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,400
You can't write pussy discharge

305
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,120
What is the medical in the med school right now anyone who's listening?

306
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,080
Yeah, I'm very interested

307
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,380
I'm learning a lot. Have you ever gotten have you ever seen just like the biggest cock ever on a real unsuspecting guy

308
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:23,240
At the bed. Yeah. Yeah, also there's guys like they'll have they have in ease

309
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,980
Any penises what yeah?

310
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,220
tell so I

311
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,220
That'd be terrible

312
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,300
An out invasive catheter is a urine collecting device one for women is called the

313
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,460
Pure wick and I don't even want to know that one

314
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,440
But I'm leaning it to it but to the dicks

315
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,240
So it's like a blue for the good stuff you put it in front of the vagina

316
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,380
And it goes to suction of the wall so when they pee it just sucks it and it goes up to the wall

317
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:54,900
So the guys that have the innings why we put it shouldn't leave it in the wall

318
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,020
The tube goes to the wall to the suction container

319
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,580
So it collects a pee okay, okay?

320
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:05,660
So we put those on those guys to have such tiny little wieners that go inside them that we use it for them, too

321
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Where does the pee go after it's in the wall?

322
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:12,220
Yeah, my mouth. Why do you want to collect it you measure it and then you dump in the toilet?

323
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,900
To the next room there's a room

324
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:21,780
It's a scale that's on the floor, it's just a

325
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:25,980
Glass scales you get it like Walmart

326
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:31,460
How accurate yeah, there's like these tubes these suction tubes were here when we opened the hospital

327
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:37,100
We never we don't know where they go. We've never looked into it. We've just been using there's a guy who sits there

328
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,800
Just he has two cups one one that's filled with poop and one that's filled with pee and that's what he eats all day

329
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,180
Oh wait. Yeah, Andrew. How do you get their poop out?

330
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,700
Yeah

331
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:52,800
But there is so you know catheter a fully catheter is a tube that goes where your dick

332
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:59,060
That stays in so that's a long-term catheter and they can't get what we have something called a flex a seal

333
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,260
Where it's a tube that goes in the butt and then the poop goes out of the tube?

334
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:06,520
Caleb that's the thing that's the thing you spray on the boat

335
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:09,500
How big is the tube? Yeah?

336
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:15,080
Does it depend on the person it's a kind of around the size of a can like the width of like a month no way

337
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:22,660
Is it transparent please say

338
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,180
Yeah, you can see that

339
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:31,820
If you're having trouble pooping don't worry. We have a device here at the hospital. They'll take care of it

340
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:35,620
It'll well here's the thing you second can't get out as big as a Foster's beer can

341
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,020
It's the vacuum cleaner from

342
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:44,440
You put like a check in the thing and the vacuum tube

343
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:51,500
So the reason why we'll use those is if someone has like really bad diarrhea, and they're having like a GI bleed and shit

344
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,380
But also they have like a wound like on the bottom is a real commonplace for wounds

345
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,620
So you don't need all this shit going into their wound and making infections happen

346
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:04,340
Andrew do any of your patients ever get the crazy idea to go to the bank and shit into the tube after they've been in the

347
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
hospital

348
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:11,660
Well, actually Charles we have those tubes on all nurse floor every nurse station has those tube systems

349
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
That's why we get our meds and shit you

350
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:19,720
That binks use you ever put a diet coke can in there I wish yeah

351
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,820
There's something there's a lot of meds that you can't put on those because they get shook up or they'll get fucked up and people

352
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:27,060
have done it and it's like a monster energy drink. Yeah,

353
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,260
it's all fizzy. That's medicine. Yeah. Monster is

354
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,460
medicine cuz it has a lot of vitamin B. Have you ever kept

355
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:40,740
somebody's body part? Yeah, I ate a guy's uh amputated toe.

356
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:44,820
No. Oh my god. I can't keep anything. All my what if what

357
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,140
if what if the patient says I want you to keep this when I

358
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,180
die? Yeah. What if someone's last words are you get my brain

359
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,140
when I die? Would you be able to take the brain home? It'd have

360
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,380
to be in writing. I think a lot of paperwork. Yeah. All right. Well,

361
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:59,020
let's get it started. So like in the ICU, when the ICU,

362
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:01,920
when there's a donor, when someone's like, when there's brain death,

363
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,920
we keep them alive, their organs perfusing,

364
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,540
and then the Oregon nurses will come in and take over and they'll keep them

365
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:11,900
alive until they find recipients for all the organs. And then we pull the plug.

366
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,660
I just like to repeat that Andrew actually works in a Wendy's.

367
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,980
And this stuff is happening in every Wendy's franchise.

368
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,780
They'll get in contact with the surgeon and he'll be like, yeah,

369
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,180
I can take this heart out tonight

370
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:25,740
and they'll like send them out and go extract the heart.

371
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,760
- Damn.

372
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,680
- I got a buddy who is a psychiatrist

373
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,880
and he's got a patient that at the end,

374
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,520
at the very end of one session was like,

375
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
you know, when I die, you can do whatever you want with me.

376
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,760
(laughing)

377
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,840
- That's a huge compliment.

378
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,440
- Like just slipping it out there right before I leave.

379
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,920
You can do whatever you want with me when I die,

380
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,760
I don't care.

381
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:45,400
- I believe in your will,

382
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:48,480
like I leave my body to my psychiatrist and my will.

383
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,720
- Yeah, it's either science or--

384
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,960
- It's also funny to say it to your psychiatrist

385
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,880
as if they will have anything to do with your dead body.

386
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,960
Like, that guy like showing up to the funeral

387
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,840
and being like, just so you know,

388
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,400
before he died he said I could do whatever I wanted.

389
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,900
- He's my guy. - Who are you?

390
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,520
- Dude, I would do Weekend at Bernie's with him.

391
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,960
- Oh yeah. - I definitely did.

392
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,280
- I think he imagines, well the psychiatrist

393
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,640
obviously wants to fuck my dead body over and over again.

394
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,040
So, you know, I know he won't admit it.

395
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,200
Yeah, wait, what kind of vibe was this therapist putting out

396
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,600
where he was like, this guy probably wants my dead body

397
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,840
for sure?

398
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,200
Well--

399
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,160
Dr. Acula.

400
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,560
Come on.

401
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,800
You know, I don't know what vibe he was putting out,

402
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,160
but the guy has been trying to have sex with him

403
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,560
ever since he started working there.

404
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,680
That might be a clue.

405
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,180
All right.

406
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,400
So now I'm thinking about what we're

407
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,760
going to do with our bodies when we die.

408
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,400
Obviously, Branson's going to die first, because he

409
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,520
doesn't have much time left.

410
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,720
Big time.

411
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,080
So it's really up to me and Andrew

412
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,440
what we wanna do with Branson's body.

413
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,880
I think we could weekend at Branson's him.

414
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,200
- I'm gonna take it out to the desert and shoot it.

415
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
- You guys would be tired after 30 minutes

416
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,680
of hauling my big ass dead body.

417
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,920
- I wanna scrape a slut on him.

418
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,120
- I have honestly looked at Branson's body before

419
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,440
and thought he would make a good canoe.

420
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,720
So I'd probably burrow out a little hole in you.

421
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,280
- Yeah, well that's where you get the flex seal.

422
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,960
- Yeah, get his arms like-- - Give me fake eyes.

423
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,840
Just give me fake eyes and it's cool.

424
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,540
I realized oh man, it'd be awesome do some taxidermy but dress you up like a sasquatch

425
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:30,740
Some museum in Portland just has a big

426
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:44,860
Somebody to just put me in a cigar shop and dress me like

427
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:51,580
and yeah. You guys have you guys ever heard of the cryogenics

428
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,620
where people have their bodies frozen after oh yeah that's it's

429
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,220
cool there used to be in Michigan right by where I live

430
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,300
there is a facility that held those and I was like man there's

431
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,460
so many fucking rich motherfuckers that got fleece just

432
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:07,140
sitting there frozen but I was like thinking it might be kind of

433
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,420
fun to be a popsicle and then like one day you definitely

434
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:14,660
definitely yeah Futurama vibes yeah oh that does remind me of

435
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,380
Futurama vibe. For some reason. I think you might wake up as Bender. There's some kind of Futurama

436
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,940
vibes there. Yeah. I haven't understood how they do that because I've seen...

437
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:32,820
It's a load of shit. I mean, they freeze you after you die, right? Yeah. Okay, all right. So they just

438
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,500
are holding on to you. They think that there's gonna be some technology one day where we could

439
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:42,820
just like thaw you out. It's like a big rusty car. You turn yourself into a big rusty car that just

440
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,600
sits in your own yard. Mm but it's cold. When I die, I wanna

441
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,720
be a Pontiac.

442
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,460
Andrew, if all five of us got sick in Colorado, um would you

443
00:19:54,460 --> 00:20:01,300
be our nurse? How sick would you be? Really, really, really

444
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,720
sick. Incredibly sick. The same thing. You guys are all in the

445
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,380
same room. Yeah, we all got it from like a ward like a

446
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,720
military ward. We all. Yeah. We had a party. Covered in

447
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,160
bandages we had a party sub that we were all sharing and we all got yeah I just

448
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:19,480
ate from it yeah well is that the good one into my eyes yeah you then you could

449
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:23,400
probably get like a ketamine drip oh that's yo

450
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:27,600
I mean hot now I don't remember ketamine being around when I was in college

451
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,560
ketamine is big now it was big in like the 70s and it came back like the hippies

452
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:43,240
loved it I love that Branson always acts like he's 50 we may do just good old

453
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,000
fashion cocaine just came always shows me a text from Branson that's like a

454
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:56,240
text him in the middle of dead it says do you remember Bugs Bunny he always

455
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,760
wants to test I think you've asked me if I know who you've asked me if I know who

456
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,880
Jiminy Glick is it?

457
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,340
Yeah, I was there.

458
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,600
I was there for the text because you asked everybody else in the car

459
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,560
if we know Jiminy Glick and I was the only one who knew.

460
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,940
Well, see, that's why I asked.

461
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,020
Well, we'll be writing jokes and Branson like he'll make a reference.

462
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:14,900
I'm like, holy fuck.

463
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,100
Like our audience a lot is a lot younger than you think.

464
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,660
You can't be talking about that all the time.

465
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,780
It's like, well, let me touch cameras, see if he knows what it is.

466
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,660
Damn, dude.

467
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,700
Did Cameron tell you guys about when Branson called him?

468
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:28,420
He calls him a lot.

469
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:30,420
I only called him once, it was on accident.

470
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:30,920
Oh really?

471
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,420
It was only one time.

472
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,420
I think we were there.

473
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,420
I was sitting on my phone.

474
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,420
I just looked down at my phone and I saw a missed call from Branson.

475
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,420
I was like, "What the fuck is going on?"

476
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,420
"He's calling me right now."

477
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,420
Is he okay?

478
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,420
Is there some kind of emergency?

479
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,420
Only Cameron can help me right now.

480
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:56,420
Yeah, like everybody else in his life died and I'm the only person he could call.

481
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,420
He calls you and he's talking in a low voice.

482
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,420
He's like, "Listen, Cam, I really fucked up.

483
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:02,420
I really fucked up."

484
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,420
"You gotta get over here, man."

485
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,420
"I can't tell if people know who Beavis and Butt-head is."

486
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,420
"Cam, you like dead bodies, you like zombies and stuff, right?"

487
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,420
"Well, I killed a guy."

488
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:16,420
"Cam, quick! Do you know who Alonzo Bowden is?"

489
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,420
"Cam, have you ever heard of Space Ghost?"

490
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:23,420
"Cam, have you ever seen Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn?"

491
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,680
(laughter)

492
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,500
- You're just like a--

493
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,220
- I would be so blessed to get a call like that every day.

494
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,060
Oh my god.

495
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:34,220
- So a picture in the mail of Brian Big Country Reeves.

496
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,140
It's just like, Cameron, I need you to study this.

497
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,700
- Tell me what the young folks think, Cameron.

498
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,780
- Well, actually, Cameron didn't know the Budweiser frogs

499
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,100
when I showed those to you.

500
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:47,580
- Cameron's gonna do a residency at Branson's house

501
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,580
for a year, just learning all the old Puma references.

502
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,580
Alright, we'll start with the Sid Caesar show.

503
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
The thing is, I'm not even...

504
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,580
Hunk of El Chihuahua.

505
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,580
I'm not even a good person to...

506
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,580
I'm not even a good person to ask those kinds of questions to

507
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,580
because I don't know anything.

508
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,580
I don't even know the stuff that I'm supposed to know.

509
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
You know about Blady?

510
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,580
I know... that's all I know.

511
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,580
You're talking about Brandon from beyond.

512
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,580
That's the only thing I know.

513
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,580
And I only know about him since like a month or two ago.

514
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580
That's not true.

515
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,580
Well then why am I talking to you?

516
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,580
I gotta find a different young guy.

517
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
That's true.

518
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,580
[Laughter]

519
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,580
None of you guys are a good young guy.

520
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,580
Maybe a 17 year old would be really good for you to text.

521
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:24,580
text. I have an 11 year old brother. What can you tell me about the state?

522
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:32,580
The state? Yeah, I'll give you his number. What is the state? The state, uh, uh, it was a comedy show with Michael Ian Black

523
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:40,580
and it was, uh, they were all NYU kids and they, uh, one of them was really, really rich and that's how they got a show.

524
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,580
Which one was it? Was it David Wayne? I don't remember who. David Wayne's the best one.

525
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,260
It strikes me as the richest.

526
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,940
They're all good, but Michael in Black just kind of sucks.

527
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,300
Yeah, they suck now, but back in the day, they were fire.

528
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,700
David Wayne is so funny.

529
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,140
You say that, but you probably haven't

530
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,380
read his book with Meghan McCain.

531
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,140
You would think differently if you read it.

532
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,620
That's true.

533
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,900
True.

534
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,980
You'd probably be able to reach across the aisle.

535
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,540
Hey, the only book I want to see Meghan McCain is Playboy.

536
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,820
The only book I would trust her to write would be a recipe book.

537
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,500
Yeah.

538
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,740
Oh, wow.

539
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,060
Hey.

540
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,180
Do you guys want to know why?

541
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,180
Yeah, because she's a great big fat lady.

542
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,180
She is a bit too fat for me.

543
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:20,180
Yeah, the only movie I'd want to see her in is The Whale.

544
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,180
Yeah.

545
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,180
Or a bit of a Werner Fraser.

546
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,180
She's not in it.

547
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,180
Well, I'd want to see her as Brendan Fraser in the Brendan Fraser biopic.

548
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:31,180
Hey, any movie with her in it is IMAX.

549
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,180
Yeah, she was in Super-Sized Her.

550
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
Yep.

551
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,180
When she sits around the house.

552
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,180
She really sits around the house.

553
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,180
I heard that she has her own zip code.

554
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:42,180
Even James Cameron said, "A little bit too rich for my blood."

555
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:44,380
(laughing)

556
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,460
- She is big and fat.

557
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,180
- I heard that she went whale watching

558
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,920
and all the whales jumped out of the ocean

559
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,260
and said, "We are family, even though you're fatter than me."

560
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,900
- I heard a similar story.

561
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,740
That's very funny.

562
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,580
- I actually also heard that.

563
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,820
- I talked about that on the view.

564
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:59,600
- I heard that she did motion capture

565
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,320
for all the mech suits in the new Avatar movie.

566
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,440
- They got a regular guy to climb on her

567
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,660
for Shadows of the Colossus.

568
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,900
- Yeah, yeah, they strapped him to the front of her.

569
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,700
- She's gotta be one of the fattest women in the world.

570
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,940
hundred and forty 150 pounds push.

571
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:18,140
Yeah, this one's this one's not about her, but I heard that

572
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,460
her mom puts two quarters in her ears and thinks she's

573
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:25,580
listening to 50 cents. What a **** idiot. Her mom is really

574
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:31,500
stupid. Her dad's as dead as a doorknob. Yeah. Yeah. He can't

575
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,980
he can't raise the roof because he crashed a plane in Vietnam or

576
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,500
whatever. That's right, man. The big the worst punishment of

577
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,580
all. Imagine you go to Vietnam, you think you're fighting for your country, and then you come

578
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,460
home and you can't even raise the roof to celebrate how good of a job you did over there.

579
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:59,660
He actually broke his arms hugging her when he got back from Vietnam. He said, "Come here

580
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,580
Darling, she jumped into his arms.

581
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,500
- They fell off and had to get stable.

582
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,760
(laughing)

583
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,580
- Oh God, that is actually awfully disrespectful

584
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:16,180
of an American troop, so I'm gonna go ahead.

585
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,580
- That's completely terrible.

586
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,340
- I'm gonna curb my laughter right there.

587
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:21,460
- You think hell has any aisles for him to reach across,

588
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,500
or is everyone like politically the same in hell

589
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,980
'cause it's just like the devil, you know?

590
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,580
It's like the only game in town.

591
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,680
I think, well you think that John McCain is in hell.

592
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,020
That is very interesting.

593
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,960
Because I think pretty much he spent his entire life

594
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,400
trying to get into the kingdom of heaven.

595
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,680
So, I think you might be wrong on that one, bud.

596
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,520
- He went to heaven.

597
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,580
- Like the movie kingdom of heaven?

598
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,420
- No.

599
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,000
- He was trying to get in that movie?

600
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,840
- Yeah, they put his court,

601
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,680
they digitally edited his court.

602
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,920
- He was a big fan of Bradley's guy.

603
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,040
He's like, please, I have to be in this movie.

604
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,720
He's like, absolutely not, absolutely not.

605
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,520
- He could have been in that movie.

606
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,040
- He's like, what about my big time huge daughter?

607
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,640
is like he put she's in there you can look at the background.

608
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,760
She's yeah we got to project every person where.

609
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,320
Every person on earth should get one what they get to choose one

610
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,760
movie to be in and they get to be in it. No.

611
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,400
I think we should all get to know what I know I just mean that

612
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,840
when there's a movie is being made you should be able to say

613
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,080
I'm going to be in this movie and the director can't do

614
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
anything about it you just get to be in it.

615
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,720
Well we had the idea a while ago to have skins for movies so you

616
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,000
can watch your favorite old movies with skins in them and you

617
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Change like George Clooney to Ronald McDonald

618
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,440
Like Brad

619
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,720
You're gonna spend like 500 bucks in your favorite movie to rewatch it. Yeah, like you change the Godfather to Stewie Griffin, that's cool

620
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,840
Yeah, and then the main thing though is now all movies when you watch them without the DLC

621
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,980
Everyone's just wearing a white t-shirt and jeans

622
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:50,640
It's like when you first get to Grove Street in San Andreas

623
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,880
That's smart. That's a money maker

624
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:03,320
It's an incredible idea. Yeah, well this AI art now. I want to watch taxi driver with Minecraft Steve. It's my dream

625
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Did you see that uh there's supposed to be a taxi driver video game

626
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,980
2004

627
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:18,880
Yeah, what are you doing that like? Oh, I'm gonna. I'm gonna kill a little politician. I it's like a

628
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,660
Prostitute I I read that they like tried to make it a sequel like how it was that that John Woo game

629
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,160
That's what that movie needs. There should be a Call of Duty where you play as John McCain

630
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:39,480
Video game it's a sequel to Paris, Texas. It's called Paris, Texas to the video game Paris, Texas to Paris France

631
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:45,960
Paris video game I agree. Oh, yeah

632
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,200
Pervert what's that fucker's name that little fucker leisure suit Larry? Yeah

633
00:28:53,200 --> 00:29:04,560
Concord should get a picture of her as well. He should bite on her pussy with his buck teeth, and it should chatter them either

634
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:09,080
To chatter his teeth her pussy should

635
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,480
They don't explain it, but actually that's the mystery the entire game

636
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:23,860
Paris Hilton wouldn't know what to do with leisure suit Larry

637
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:31,020
You know what she'd probably do is put conquer in her purse and walk around like it's her tiny dog

638
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,480
Problem, you know what yeah

639
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,280
Crazy though is leisure suit Larry has like four kids now. He's been married for like ten years

640
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,080
Really? Yeah

641
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,100
He's doing cannabis company - really

642
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,860
- He's a stage advocate, yeah.

643
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,500
I think he lives in Three Pumpkins.

644
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,740
- Does he do like Delta-8 and stuff?

645
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,780
- No, just pure gas.

646
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,340
- What is Delta-8?

647
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,180
What is that?

648
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,000
- Delta-8 is--

649
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,400
- Is it a gas station drug?

650
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:02,340
- Yeah, no, it's weed with a removed chromosome or something.

651
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,500
They take something out of it

652
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,980
and then it makes it really scary.

653
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,820
But it's legal.

654
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,300
- It's weed without cum.

655
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,260
- Yeah.

656
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,420
- It doesn't have weed cum in it.

657
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:17,420
And it makes your friends back home want to join the military.

658
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:20,420
Oh, just like the movie Shooter with Mark Wahlberg?

659
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,420
It's pretty much the exact same thing.

660
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
That movie's badass.

661
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,420
My cousin said he was going to be a sniper because of that,

662
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,420
then he made up a lie about being flat-footed.

663
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
It's like, "Okay, you're 24."

664
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,420
Not flat-footed.

665
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,420
Can a sniper not be flat-footed?

666
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
I feel like being flat-footed would be a good thing as a sniper.

667
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,420
You can stand really still here, not wobbling back and forth on the balls of your feet all the time.

668
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:44,420
all the time. I hear you walking around like a penguin. I think snakes would make really good snipers.

669
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,420
You're like a mile away.

670
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,420
Because they just crawl around and slither.

671
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:50,420
All of us should join the military.

672
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,420
Why not?

673
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,420
I've been trying to, but I never make it past the psyche val.

674
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:01,420
Because I say I want to go over there and I want to make everyone ground beef.

675
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,420
And I don't care where.

676
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,420
I don't care where it is.

677
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,420
Killing machine at your service sir.

678
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,940
I

679
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,240
Want to be I say I'm really looking to cause a disaster

680
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:18,600
I want to do something disastrous a war crime in an area where you're still allowed to kind of do it a little bit

681
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,840
The thing about the full motherfucking military though is they'd like that shit. They'd be like you're in yeah, you're number one bastards

682
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,520
And here's my weapon

683
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Yeah, I'm gonna go do that over there

684
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,300
Flip everyone off

685
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:38,420
Did you guys see the video of the the China and Indian armies fistfighting no

686
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,380
Whoa?

687
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,380
I need to see that

688
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,980
No, no

689
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:48,660
There's some like border dispute between China and India where they like have it guarded all the time

690
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,460
one of them overstepped the boundary a little bit and then instead of like

691
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:58,820
Like they don't have I guess they don't fight with guns at that particular border to like make it a little less

692
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,900
- Yes, uh, what's like crazy?

693
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,100
- Keep it real man!

694
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,380
We fight like real men in India, China.

695
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,220
- It's like a 60 person fight.

696
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,460
It looks exactly like an Instagram video.

697
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,300
(laughing)

698
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,380
Fighting outside of a nightclub.

699
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,820
- See, that's why we should join the military.

700
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,540
We should just join the Chinese military so we can do that.

701
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,700
- Oh my God, oh my God.

702
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,380
We go over there and we're like,

703
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:21,060
we go over to China or we do this in the US

704
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:23,940
and we're just like the street beefs team.

705
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,180
So we just teach people how to street fight.

706
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:34,180
How about Potabot List joins the Indian Army, E1 will join the Chinese Army, and then we'll meet at the border.

707
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:36,680
Yeah. Oh my god. I would love to fucking...

708
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:37,680
That is incredible.

709
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:43,180
I would love to ding Branson right here with a rock and a slingshot and kill him with one single hit.

710
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:48,180
I'd love to get hit in the middle of the forehead and instantly go cross-eyed and fall down.

711
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:50,180
That's David and Goliath shit right there.

712
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,680
Yeah, of course. That's what we're doing.

713
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,180
I want to make sure I fall and a lot of dust goes into the air.

714
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,780
- Rant's just speaking just like the most broken,

715
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,680
two week Chinese of all time.

716
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,700
(laughing)

717
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,580
- I think we should play soccer,

718
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:07,100
like the Christmas Armistice in World War I.

719
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,940
- That's after the--

720
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,340
- Look at this, and we'll go viral, and then we'll be rich.

721
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,180
- That's after the--

722
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,320
- Is that like a boring Hallmark movie?

723
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,260
- No, it was really a big dumb asshole.

724
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,140
- The Christmas Armistice.

725
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,020
Okay, a Hallmark movie called The Christmas Armistice.

726
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,620
- Actually, you know how people go to like China

727
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,380
and other countries like Japan to teach English?

728
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,940
We should go there to teach podcasting to the Chinese.

729
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,620
That's actually a wondrous idea.

730
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,920
We should go over there to teach Chinese.

731
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,820
(laughing)

732
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,860
No, that doesn't make much sense.

733
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,420
So, "Ni hao" is "hello" and the rest of it is sounds.

734
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,620
I don't know the rest.

735
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,860
I just started this job.

736
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,620
I'm gonna learn as I go.

737
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,540
I'm just gonna, you can translate anything on your phone.

738
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,620
(laughing)

739
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,140
Yeah, and they're all teaching Chinese

740
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,220
to Chinese kids who speak Chinese already.

741
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,220
It'd just be like, "So, ni hao is 'hello.'

742
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,740
"Zai jian," that's "thank you."

743
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,300
That'd be like kind of a school of,

744
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,940
Oh, go down there, do School of Rock.

745
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:56,700
Oh my god.

746
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,240
That's an amazing idea.

747
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,380
School of Rock in China.

748
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:58,980
Charles can do that.

749
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,620
They need it.

750
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Charles plays some music.

751
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:04,500
Rock and Roll might get rid of that internet policy they have.

752
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,460
Or we could teach them how to rap.

753
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,220
There's a lot of potential for some funny stuff happening.

754
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:12,540
Imagine if you taught Chinese kids how to riff.

755
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,860
Mm.

756
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,940
They're not allowed to celebrate Riffmas

757
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:18,540
because they put fucking riftians in camps

758
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:19,740
over there in China.

759
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,020
Oh, you can't riff in China is what I heard.

760
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,520
Yeah.

761
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,580
Mm-hmm.

762
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,200
I think you can in Hong Kong, though.

763
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,220
You can in Hong Kong.

764
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,100
You get so many shoes, and you open them up,

765
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,180
and there's a little one-liner written in there

766
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,420
that they're not allowed to do.

767
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:35,180
[LAUGHTER]

768
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:37,740
Yeah, I was taught growing up that China basically

769
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:42,700
put Christians into the male chicken meat grinder

770
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,420
thing every day.

771
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,020
Turns out it's really not that true.

772
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,900
I think it'd be more expensive.

773
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,420
I think chickens is one of the cheapest things there is.

774
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:51,900
Yeah, people--

775
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,340
- Getting people would be way more expensive.

776
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:57,220
- Yeah, like we'd probably eat people in some other thing,

777
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:59,100
but not just like chicken, you know?

778
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,140
- We should try to bring the price of people down

779
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,780
so we could eat people if we wanted to.

780
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,140
The only thing stopping me from eating people

781
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,900
is that they're too damn expensive.

782
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,020
- Yeah.

783
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,460
- People are, hey, people are priceless.

784
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,300
It's what I always say.

785
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,140
- Would you eat, Charles, would you eat--

786
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,100
- You do say that.

787
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,060
- Charles, would you eat-- - You say that a lot.

788
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,660
- Would you eat person in tikka masala?

789
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,540
- Dude, I wouldn't know what to do with that.

790
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,100
(laughing)

791
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:26,100
Would you eat Roland Wingo if he was rotisserie?

792
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,740
- No. - In a heartbeat.

793
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,500
- And 40 giant breasted women all got to eat him.

794
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,620
- I'd eat Fleezer Sanger. - Oh my God.

795
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,740
Dude, that lemon pepper, that lemon pepper Roland Wingo,

796
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,700
oh my God.

797
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,860
- Big apple in his mouth.

798
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,060
He'd be the Christmas goose.

799
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,900
- We're all doing the wishbone with his entire body.

800
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,740
Oh my God.

801
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:49,900
- Cracking every one of his ribs.

802
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,380
You would definitely need to cook him well done though.

803
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,100
Oh yeah, I don't trust that.

804
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
There's worms.

805
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:58,180
There's something dwelling in there.

806
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,740
He's beer battered for sure.

807
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,900
He's like the iceberg from The Thing.

808
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,540
I feel like if you heat him up, something's going to come out of there and end the world.

809
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,940
He's got a couple critters in him.

810
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,940
I don't know where.

811
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,300
We could roast him over in there.

812
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:17,700
You would thaw him and his tapeworm would escape.

813
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,300
Pinworms are spinning out all over the floor.

814
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,560
(laughing)

815
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,220
- Yeah.

816
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,140
- Guys, what are we doing here?

817
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:26,980
Like what are we doing?

818
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,860
- We're talking about eating a guy.

819
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:28,700
We're talking about--

820
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,780
- Yeah, we're talking about eating an old man.

821
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,620
- Oh God, this is fucked.

822
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,460
- An old man who gets--

823
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,540
- Hey, what do you guys do on here?

824
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:35,340
You do like a list thing or whatever?

825
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,620
- We're listing old men that we would eat.

826
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,460
- Oh, okay.

827
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,180
Well, I would like to eat,

828
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,180
oh man, if Regis was around, he'd be like beef jerky.

829
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,740
- I was just thinking Regis!

830
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,580
- Yeah.

831
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,140
- You guys don't--

832
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,980
- Cameron's never heard of Regis Philbin.

833
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,820
- Cameron, do you know Regis Philbin?

834
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,140
- No, Regis would taste like Peking duck.

835
00:36:50,140 --> 00:37:08,100
to

836
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:35,100
people

837
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,500
- But by the end you gotta eat the whole torso.

838
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,340
- Yeah.

839
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,420
- It's not as much. - Yeah, it's too much.

840
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,260
- I need to-- - Now--

841
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,040
- You know, Kelly Ripa, she's so thin,

842
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,300
I always offered her a bite of me, but she never wanted it.

843
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,820
- I want you to put me into this stew pot!

844
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,420
(laughing)

845
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,420
- Breathe!

846
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,260
Breathe!

847
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,540
Slice up onions and carrots and dance around me!

848
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:54,380
Over a fire!

849
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,100
- That's like half Gilbert Gottfried, half Regis Gilbert.

850
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,500
- Most of it is the same enthusiasm.

851
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,660
- Regis Gottfried.

852
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,540
- They're both up in heaven bitchin'.

853
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,380
- That's true.

854
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,220
(laughing)

855
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:09,640
complainers those two. I want to phone a friend on the Who Wants to Eat Regis and I want to

856
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:15,340
call Cameron and I want to ask him if he's ever heard of Wait Wait Don't Tell Me. Yes.

857
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:22,380
How about Car Talk? Have you ever heard of Car Talk? Yes yes yes yes. Cameron have you

858
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:28,060
ever heard of Mr. Beast? Come on no Branson's never heard of Mr. Beast. What kind of old

859
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:32,840
ass shit is that? Oh I've heard of Mr. Beast. He's the most famous, he's got the most subscribers

860
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:39,080
on YouTube? No. He's the richest guy ever. He's the richest guy in the world. He'll get

861
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:44,420
like big, like a bunch of food for people and then give them like $10,000. Yeah. Why

862
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:49,240
would he give them food and $10,000? Dude, he's a hunter. He's huge on his YouTube. He

863
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:53,340
gets like 11 million viewers. That motherfucker's 100% gonna be like, "All right, we're doing

864
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:58,400
Hunger Games 3 on this island. The winner gets $5 million. Go." He's like, "I want people

865
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,700
to kill each other." I feel like he's already done that. He's pretty much already done that,

866
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:06,220
it was more of a tag. Didn't he do squid? No, I mean real straight up killing like he wants

867
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:09,560
to see people killing each other. Yeah, that's it. I mean, because like he's gonna run out

868
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,940
of brain juice, but that's all that's left. Like he's gonna eat a guy to he's like, I'm

869
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,880
gonna make you a Mr. Beast burger. Branson, do you want to be a Mr. Beast burger? Your

870
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,780
whole family and friends will be taken care of for the rest of their lives. But you got

871
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:25,980
to be eaten. God, that's so poignant. I would offer myself up. Oh, like, Christ, you do look

872
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,180
like Jesus. Fuck that, dude. My family and my family and friends can take care of themselves.

873
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,020
I don't want to be a burger.

874
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,900
- Yeah, I would be like, can you reverse that?

875
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:36,700
Can you just make all my family and friends into burgers?

876
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,780
'Cause then I have a lot of burgers.

877
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,020
- Can you cook Rolling Wingo for me?

878
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:44,500
- Mr. Beast Burger, he should open a Krusty Krab

879
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,660
under the ocean.

880
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,260
- That'd be such a good idea.

881
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:50,660
- That would be, that's a really, really good idea.

882
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,980
- Yeah.

883
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,820
- Oh my God.

884
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,420
- He could make a Rolling Wingo into a Krabby Patty.

885
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:57,540
- And Linus Tech, do you know who Binging with Babish is?

886
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:58,380
- It's me, Binging with Babish.

887
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,540
- I've heard of him.

888
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,940
today we're going to watch the videos

889
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,540
the

890
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:03,940
the

891
00:40:03,940 --> 00:40:04,540
the

892
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,140
the

893
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:05,940
the

894
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:06,640
the

895
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,540
the

896
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,440
the

897
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,240
the

898
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:09,940
the

899
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,440
the

900
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,240
the

901
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,440
the

902
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,740
the

903
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,940
the

904
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,840
the

905
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,840
the

906
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,240
the

907
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,240
the

908
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,440
the

909
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
the

910
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,340
the

911
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,440
the

912
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,740
the

913
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,840
the

914
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,140
the

915
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:32,800
everybody should be able to get in one movie.

916
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,900
Game shows should just take,

917
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,380
every like fifth episode should have to be just a normal guy.

918
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,300
Like somebody like that, who nobody really--

919
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,620
- It should be like jury duty.

920
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,620
They should send a letter,

921
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,340
they should have a registry of everyone in the US.

922
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:48,620
They should just, yeah, and you have to do it.

923
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,960
- You get a rolling wingo,

924
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,460
you get maybe a Branson on there, who knows.

925
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,300
- You get a Burry Boone.

926
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,980
- No, I'd win over so many people on Hot Ones.

927
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:56,540
- You would eat the bones.

928
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,380
- Oh, yeah.

929
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,200
(laughing)

930
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,040
- Just go ahead.

931
00:40:59,040 --> 00:40:59,880
- I do think Hot Ones would be easy,

932
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,880
I have had the hottest sauce before.

933
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,880
It's not that crazy.

934
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,880
Yeah, right. You've had the hottest sauce before.

935
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,880
Charles, Charles.

936
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,880
Also what you don't realize is that half of the challenge

937
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:11,880
is the crazy ass questions you get asked.

938
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,880
That is the most clear lie ever, by the way.

939
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,880
Is you saying, "Yeah, I've had it before."

940
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,880
And I call you and say, "No, you haven't." And you say, "Yeah, I actually had it twice."

941
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,880
[Laughter]

942
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,880
I don't mean the hottest sauce in the world. I mean like the

943
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,880
triple X last dab thing.

944
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,880
You fucking suck my... Shut up.

945
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,880
I put it on pizza once. This is Charles.

946
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,600
nothing to me that I put it on pizza.

947
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,360
Yeah, no, pizza is different from a wing,

948
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:35,560
because then you got the cheese to counteract the hot sauce.

949
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,520
He's right.

950
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,680
All right, we get to do a--

951
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,180
That is a--

952
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,060
--one in Palo Alto.

953
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,560
Patrick, that is an incredibly fat guy argument.

954
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,880
You're like, well, hold on, it's got the cheese, though.

955
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,400
When he's right, he's right, though.

956
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,520
And Branson immediately-- Branson goes, he's right.

957
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,520
[LAUGHTER]

958
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,360
When you're right, you're right.

959
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,280
You got to give it up.

960
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,280
That's what I always say.

961
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:55,800
It's a science.

962
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,760
It's a science.

963
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
You gotta break it down, you gotta think about this.

964
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,760
Speaking of science, I actually had the hottest sauce a hundred times.

965
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,760
Yeah, fucking fuck you, asshole.

966
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,760
No, you didn't!

967
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:07,760
Charles is a hundred feet tall, too, and he ate the hottest sauce in the world.

968
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
He went, "Yum, yum, yum. It's not even hot to me."

969
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
Yeah, and he's--

970
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
My dad's a spy.

971
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,760
And he's talking to us on a computer that was made by Mr. Bean.

972
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Yeah, I'm talking to you-- yeah, I'm talking to you.

973
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Also, my laptop is alienware.

974
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,760
Welcome to dealing with Charles. Welcome to dealing with Charles all the time.

975
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,760
I've told this story before, but one time we were staying at Joel's in Chicago.

976
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:29,120
in Chicago. Joel made us these really good breakfast bowls. And we're just sitting there,

977
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:32,800
I was like, "Man, this is pretty good." And Charles is like, "Yeah, it tastes so good,

978
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,800
that's why I have to eat it." I was like, "What the fuck?" Who the fuck says shit like

979
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,640
that? What the fuck is wrong with you? He watches too much anime, so he talks like an

980
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:49,040
anime character. Yeah, he just reads One Piece. Oh yeah, I forgot that you're more of a manga

981
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:52,580

00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:55,680

986
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,800
too hard I say annoying stuff. Yet you said that

987
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,560
before Britain fuck you it's like a. I don't have

00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,640

the sink it's so what it is and I said yeah

991
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,240
That's 'cause it's-- that's the trade that you make.

992
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,480
That's like good pussy.

993
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,360
'Cause how good it is.

994
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,440
You eat it over the sink.

995
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,680
[LAUGHTER]

996
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,480
Oh, I wouldn't be able to handle that mango.

997
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:27,280
Standing over the trash can eating pussy?

998
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:28,480
Man.

999
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:30,400
I wouldn't know what to say to that.

1000
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,160
I'm so busy at work, I don't have time to take a break.

1001
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,080
I'm just standing over the garbage can at the break room

1002
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:34,320
just eating pussy.

1003
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,840
I was wiping my mouth with my shirt.

1004
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,720
[LAUGHTER]

1005
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,640
Wiping up my sleeve.

1006
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:40,280
Dress like you're about to eat, like, all you can eat crap.

1007
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,000
It's got a pop--

1008
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:41,800
It's got a hammer.

1009
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,400
--on the bottom.

1010
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:42,900
Yeah.

1011
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,240
Plastic poncho on.

1012
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,280
I actually put some-- when I have a mango,

1013
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,600
I put some of the triple dab hot sauce on it.

1014
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,640
I actually had that.

1015
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,140
Oh, really?

1016
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,880
I think you did that 100 times, actually.

1017
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,120
It wasn't even that hot to me.

1018
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:56,280
And I didn't have the cheese from the pizza.

1019
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,800
If you guys saw the video that Tom and Charles

1020
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:01,760
did of eating the six burgers--

1021
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,280
what was it, the Wendy's burger?

1022
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:04,200
Yeah.

1023
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:05,640
We were so drunk.

1024
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,840
We were when we filmed that.

1025
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:09,520
When I watched it, I was like, damn, we're so drunk.

1026
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,280
Charles takes the first bite, and he goes,

1027
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,360
it's actually pretty good.

1028
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,720
Basically, it tastes like food.

1029
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:15,160
I was like, this motherfucker.

1030
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,160
You gotta stop talking like that all the time.

1031
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,160
He's right though.

1032
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
It's hard to get a good bite, cause like,

1033
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,160
there's six patties, so it's hard to get

1034
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,160
the bun in there, so you're just eating pure meat.

1035
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
And then your hands are getting

1036
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
ultra greasy from this shitty bun.

1037
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
It was terrible dude. Dude, it sucks you didn't live.

1038
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
Food challenges suck.

1039
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
I'm so glad that Charles lives

1040
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,160
in a different city than me, man.

1041
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:39,160
I would hate to be your

1042
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:41,160
mailman or something. Just have to

1043
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:43,160
have like weird interactions with you once a day.

1044
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,460
today. Okay. So one time we were going to record the trail mix.

1045
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,420
Yeah. The trail mix and Charles is like Charles is like well

1046
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,820
Margie his wife is like her friends can be driving off this

1047
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:53,660
trail mix and he's like he's acting like it's like a drug

1048
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:58,460
deal like he's got like I'm gonna have to go get it. I

1049
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:00,700
quit worrying about the show. It's like yeah, they might I

1050
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,860
don't want to get started yet cuz I think she's gonna come by

1051
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:05,980
with the trail mix and then he's eating it while we're like

1052
00:45:05,980 --> 00:45:09,340
of course like man. It's really good actually. It's like and

1053
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:11,660
we're like what no I asked him what it tastes like and he goes

1054
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:19,860
trail mix. Again, not wrong. You're right. I resend what I said. The most tedious man.

1055
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:24,020
The most tedious man. Another thing is that you can never piss off Charles, which is also

1056
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:30,580
very frustrating. I bet Charles does not care. Yeah, hey. Suck on that one, Charles. Actually,

1057
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:34,980
you know what pisses him off? That just makes me sad. I'm not mad, I'm just sad. Actually,

1058
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:39,180
the venue in Chicago fucked up our files. That really pissed him off. Oh yeah. He fucked

1059
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,980
You can tell just by looking at him he's serious about it.

1060
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,980
That's a lost episode.

1061
00:45:42,980 --> 00:45:45,940
That's one of the few lost episodes of you and I.

1062
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,380
That one podcaster who don't play about his files.

1063
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,680
This motherfucker don't play with those files.

1064
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,380
He need his files now.

1065
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,380
Charles he'll let you know.

1066
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:55,380
If you don't send your file he lets you know.

1067
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:57,260
Charles sent us a picture with a gun.

1068
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:58,500
He says I'm going back there.

1069
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,820
You're about to run me my damn files right now.

1070
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:08,300
That is truly, that's the number one benefit of getting a producer for us, of getting Jubia

1071
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,420
to be a producer is I don't have to be the files guy.

1072
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:11,260
- Oh yeah.

1073
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:13,100
- I don't have to say, can you send your files?

1074
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:13,940
- Can you send your files?

1075
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,180
- I just have to do a really shitty bit.

1076
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:16,020
- I don't have to worry about it.

1077
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,660
- That just like failed hard where he was like,

1078
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:19,260
I'm gonna start sending my files to Andrew

1079
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,100
so he can send them to me.

1080
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,100
- I thought that was a good bit.

1081
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,940
- It was terrible.

1082
00:46:22,940 --> 00:46:23,760
- I still think that's a good bit.

1083
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,640
- It's not even a bit, you're just inconveniencing Andrew.

1084
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:26,480
- I know, that's the whole bit.

1085
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,300
- You know what I would do?

1086
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:28,140
- That's the best.

1087
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,860
- I would send them back to Branson.

1088
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,460
- That is a good, that would have been a good bit.

1089
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:38,020
I was is badass. I was really into the email bit for oh, yeah. Yeah, we should bring that back. Oh, yeah, that's true

1090
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,020
I did also I got a lot of

1091
00:46:40,020 --> 00:46:45,820
I would be like at work and I'd get an email from Joel that he sent to all of us

1092
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,340
It's like a woman's like big tits. You just have a great

1093
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:55,660
The email bit though is that you email your friends

1094
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:26,140
and

1095
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:30,140
Yeah, basically, do you see someone's kid now? It sucks.

1096
00:47:30,140 --> 00:47:31,640
Yeah, it does suck.

1097
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,840
Now old people started getting a bunch of a bunch of really good emails.

1098
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,640
Oh, yeah, we just updated our website.

1099
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:42,040
Now we get literally a hundred emails every day that say wow, your website is so beautiful.

1100
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:45,640
Do you want me to to make it even more beautiful for you?

1101
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,440
And they're all up to make swag.

1102
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,940
We got one more beautiful. We got one from Salman Gupta.

1103
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:53,840
Hello, your website is amazing. And so beautiful.

1104
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:56,080
I would like to discuss a business opportunity with you.

1105
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,080
Oh!

1106
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,080
Wait, listen to this!

1107
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,520
This is a, I just opened up our email.

1108
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:04,880
This is from, this is from Jivica, whose email address is fannyyoung1999.

1109
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,160
Good user, good name, good email.

1110
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,520
Hi, hope you are doing well.

1111
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,060
I was examining your website.

1112
00:48:11,060 --> 00:48:14,840
Your layout design is good, but your website ranking is not able to find on starting pages

1113
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
on Google.

1114
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Isn't that funny, losers?

1115
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:19,520
I have one here from Harry Ram.

1116
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:20,520
Wow.

1117
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:21,880
It says, "Hello there.

1118
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,160
"Ready to start boosting websites rank

1119
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,080
"on top page on Google and get visitors?

1120
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,180
"If you like, I can send full plan."

1121
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:32,160
- I wanna hear the full plan.

1122
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,560
- I know, I want all of these people to send us full plan.

1123
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,920
They also always ask, like,

1124
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,600
can we schedule a 20 minute call to talk about this?

1125
00:48:38,600 --> 00:48:39,440
- Yes, we can.

1126
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,800
- And I feel like we should, we have to.

1127
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:42,120
- Oh, you've gotta do it.

1128
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:44,080
- Just take up, just every single person

1129
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,200
who sends an email is be like,

1130
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,040
yeah, we'll talk to you.

1131
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:46,860
- Let's get in there, let's talk business.

1132
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:47,700
- You know what you should do?

1133
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,160
Schedule them all at the same time

1134
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,220
and put them all on a call together.

1135
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:56,940
it. Yeah. No one owns the website used to what we used to do when we were younger. Michael

1136
00:48:56,940 --> 00:49:01,980
and I would go into Skype with our buddies and you can make two phones call each other.

1137
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:06,580
So we just listen in and you hear people like some store calling other stores like hello

1138
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:13,900
will you call me. Then they'd be like look motherfucker you called me. Yeah I don't get

1139
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,140
I feel like you don't get the real people on the spam calls anymore that often you only

1140
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:21,540
get the robots. Yeah, I think people don't pick up enough anymore, you know? Like, I'm not

1141
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,900
gonna pick that shit up. The texts are really good. The texts are really good too, though.

1142
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:29,500
They're like, "Hey, Kevin, let's go skydiving tomorrow." And I'm like, "Okay, not Kevin,

1143
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:37,940
but where?" I got one the other day that I just, it was clearly my friend's mom calling

1144
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:44,300
me. Like, it was him calling me from her phone, but because I instinctively didn't like, like,

1145
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,440
He had the same last name and I think it was her first name, but I just denied it

1146
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,820
And then I was like it probably was an important phone call

1147
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:55,600
But I just if it's not somebody's in my contacts. I always just delete it

1148
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:00,600
Was last time you got an important phone call though pretty much never

1149
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:03,900
Yeah, but it's like Cameron talking about

1150
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,820
Calling him being like what the fuck is going on. I get like my one of my brother's calls me like oh shit

1151
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,820
Is he okay?

1152
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:18,820
Phone I I screen my mother's phone calls so often that I think I could probably go six weeks without finding out that like somebody

1153
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:24,640
Very close in my family died because I would just she just keep calling me be like fuck she wants to talk about Thanksgiving again

1154
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:26,860
No

1155
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:32,100
Yeah, I actually was gonna call someone I would probably text them first like yo, can I call you? Yeah

1156
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:35,520
Yeah, I let it go to voicemail. Let them leave a voicemail. I'll call him back

1157
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:38,160
But most the time like I have the excuse I'm like, oh, yeah, I work nights

1158
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,820
I'm probably still sleep during the day and I'm not but they don't have to know that my brother called me

1159
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:48,080
my brother called me while I was at the Nickelodeon universe in

1160
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:51,280
The American Dream Mall in

1161
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,720
That's a place in his imagination that I was by myself

1162
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:01,080
My brother yeah

1163
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:07,000
no, I my brother called me to tell tell me that we had to like put the dog like our family dog down and

1164
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:13,260
He called me and then I was like dude. I just rode the Shellraiser

1165
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:19,360
It's so sick, and he was like I'll just call you back then he called me like two hours later

1166
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:39,440
Oh my fucking god, I just saw Dora. I swear to God.

1167
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,320
- Guess what dude, I touched the real Agrocrack.

1168
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:44,080
I'm not fucking with you, it's a real one.

1169
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:45,600
It's not a replica.

1170
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:46,800
It's the real one. - Oh my fucking god,

1171
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,880
they got the guy from Legends of Hidden Temple.

1172
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:51,320
Yeah.

1173
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:54,360
- I feel so good right now, my dogs will never die.

1174
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:56,600
(laughing)

1175
00:51:56,600 --> 00:52:02,720
- They do have the Legend of the Hidden Temple

1176
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,560
thing though there.

1177
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:04,560
You got that?

1178
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:05,560
Can you climb to his mouth?

1179
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,200
Patrick, if you never left that place, you would have never had to learn that your dog

1180
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,200
died.

1181
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,200
That's true, yeah.

1182
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:17,000
If I just stay in the American Dream Mall, I would never know.

1183
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,600
I'd meet Jimmy Neutron, Ren and Stimpy.

1184
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,400
Dude, you wouldn't even know what to do with Ren and Stimpy.

1185
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:27,160
What would you guys do if you saw a cat-dog in real life, though?

1186
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
Oh, I'd throw up.

1187
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,160
Fire on sight.

1188
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,840
Wait, what if the dog half was already dead and the cat lived like four more years?

1189
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,840
Eww.

1190
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,840
It's so morbid.

1191
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,840
Well, I'm taking that cat dog, putting two apples in its mouth, and I'm rotissering it

1192
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:42,200
Roland Wingo style.

1193
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,200
You gotta try this.

1194
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,640
Dude, when you come to Detroit, you gotta try Roland Wingo style chicken.

1195
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:51,840
It's the best chicken in the world.

1196
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,840
I'm telling you.

1197
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,720
I think if I saw a cat dog in real life, I probably would just instantly vomit.

1198
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:56,720
Yeah.

1199
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:57,720
I don't think I would have it.

1200
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,720
would reflexively just puke. I don't think I would have a choice.

1201
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,720
Yeah, because like, cat dog in real life...

1202
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:02,720
Cat dog body horror?

1203
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,720
Yeah, I was gonna say, it'll look like the dog in the fly 2.

1204
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,720
Like, it won't look normal.

1205
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,720
I would be scared.

1206
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,720
It will look normal.

1207
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,720
Where's the one that's just the...

1208
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:14,720
I would be like, why is a cartoon running around?

1209
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,720
I would throw up because toons should not be in real life.

1210
00:53:17,720 --> 00:53:18,720
That's true.

1211
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,720
I would throw up because my brain would be so broken seeing a real toon, dude.

1212
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,720
I agree, but like...

1213
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,720
What's its dick?

1214
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:33,380
I feel very comfortable around Eric Hartman. Yeah, oh yeah, he wouldn't cuz you you would get it blow your mind cuz you're that's his

1215
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:40,060
Homie, you've always been like that's a fat kid. He's so fat, but then you T turns completely sideways and he's two-dimensional

1216
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,580
No, and he turns

1217
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:46,140
Anything yeah, he's even yeah, he's even

1218
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:52,400
If you go to like Coachella with him he like takes care of everyone he makes sure like everyone is constantly hydrated

1219
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,560
He has the best drugs

1220
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:59,140
I have heard that sometimes you'd go out to eat with Eric and the end of the night comes and you say all right

1221
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:03,580
Let's like how we're gonna do this bill like let's split the bill or whatever. He says oh, no. It's already

1222
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,280
It's already taken care of what you didn't even see the bill

1223
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,560
He paid for it before you even got to the restaurant

1224
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:14,540
Are we sure that cartoons are 2d cuz what if they're using really thick paper back there that we can't see that's a good point

1225
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:20,220
I don't think that's a good point. I don't think I just want to push back on that being a good point

1226
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,780
That's a good point. I'm on Charles' side.

1227
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,260
Eric should go on Hot Ones.

1228
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:30,060
I think that we should get Pat and Branson on Crossfire and they can talk about things.

1229
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:32,700
Oh yeah. That'd be good.

1230
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:33,660
Isn't it a good point?

1231
00:54:33,660 --> 00:54:34,380
Welcome to Crossfire.

1232
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,220
All right.

1233
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:39,260
Branson, what is the most yummy food in the world?

1234
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:41,740
Roll and Wingo.

1235
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,100
Sandwich.

1236
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:43,820
Roll and Wingo.

1237
00:54:43,820 --> 00:54:47,580
Prepared in which way? Prepared which way?

1238
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:52,540
Oh, I mean, to me, it doesn't really improve the flavor, but anything where he has an apple

1239
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:58,580
in his mouth, I would like, you know, braise them, do a red wine beef broth, and go for

1240
00:54:58,580 --> 00:54:59,580
like two hours on like 250.

1241
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,580
Reverse sear?

1242
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,580
You know what, I wouldn't even want to sear them.

1243
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:11,620
I'm really into J. Kenji Lopez and Guga Foods style chefs, so to get like a sous vide Roll

1244
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:20,020
and Wingo where you gotta put Roland Wingo in a vacuum sealed bag.

1245
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,820
I think you cook him like a brisket. I think low and slow on the Traeger.

1246
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:28,220
He's too fat. Like he's some short rib.

1247
00:55:28,220 --> 00:55:30,220
Yeah, you could literally whole hog him.

1248
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,220
I'm whole hog where you just cut him up.

1249
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:37,820
Definitely. This all sounds really delicious, but I'm a pretty lazy guy, so I think I'm just gonna air fry him.

1250
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,220
He won't fit in no damn air fryer.

1251
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,220
like 15 minutes in my air fryer.

1252
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:47,980
Listen, an air fryer undeniably is going to give you a great crust on a guy like that.

1253
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:50,580
The thought of microwaving a person is so fucked up to me.

1254
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:51,580
Yeah.

1255
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:52,580
I chop off his feet and hands too.

1256
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,020
And I thought in my head, I thought in my head like, oh, I don't want to eat a microwave

1257
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:57,020
guy.

1258
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,020
Like I want to eat a guy in the first place.

1259
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,620
Like, oh, don't microwave him.

1260
00:55:59,620 --> 00:56:00,620
Come on.

1261
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:04,220
If you're going to eat a guy, you're going to ruin him.

1262
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:08,660
He's going to be all soggy and still frozen in the middle.

1263
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:12,740
too fatty. It can't fit in there. Well, you make like a man-sized microwave. I have a big

1264
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:17,140
microwave. Make a big broth. I have a giant microwave because I'm a popcorn freak. Oh,

1265
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:21,540
really? Well, you like movies. Yeah. So it's not a surprise. I go crazy for huge amounts

1266
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:27,300
of popcorn. I buy popcorn bags that are the size of a room. I actually do. I have a whole

1267
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:31,300
floor of my house that's a microwave. Well, when I worked at the movie theater, if you

1268
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:34,460
wanted some of the popcorn in a big bag at the end of the night, I would have given it

1269
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,460
to you.

1270
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:36,460
Aw.

1271
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,460
It was free.

1272
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,460
It was free for us.

1273
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:39,460
And now you get people in a colostomy bed.

1274
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,460
I also fucking hated popcorn after working there.

1275
00:56:40,460 --> 00:56:41,460
What?

1276
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,460
How do you hate popcorn?

1277
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:43,460
What an amazing gift.

1278
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,460
Oh, after working at the theater.

1279
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:47,340
Yeah, but you, what?

1280
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,060
That would make me love it even more.

1281
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:50,420
You don't get anything to eat.

1282
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,420
You just only have to eat popcorn.

1283
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:55,060
You're just like, "Ugh, something I used to love I now hate."

1284
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,700
That's why I hated working at the ice cream store.

1285
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:01,420
And they said, "Your job here is to eat as much ice cream as you want all the time."

1286
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,420
That sounds awful.

1287
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,420
I had a desk

1288
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:11,740
In the seating area

1289
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,220
Families eating ice cream around

1290
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:26,060
My desk end of day I'm calling my wife listen, honey, I gotta stay late I gotta finish this

1291
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:35,040
Leftover military-grade ice cream from Iraq that they didn't get through and it's like it's part of the military

1292
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:37,400
I don't remember what the I don't know what the brand is

1293
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,380
They have it at Whole Foods though

1294
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:43,740
But there's this one that has a Turkish coffee ice cream and they also make this one that has like bits of like Captain Crunch

1295
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:49,020
In it and it's fucking easy. Okay, so he shops at Whole Foods hippie. How's that going for you?

1296
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:53,180
More of a hipster. Okay. There's a whole

1297
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:56,500
so, please

1298
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:57,360
Educate me.

1299
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,600
Basically, here's the thing.

1300
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,260
I only wear my skinny jeans.

1301
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:01,820
Ugh.

1302
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:03,340
I love Taylor Swift.

1303
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,380
Ugh, what the hell?

1304
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,180
As a boy, a male--

1305
00:58:07,180 --> 00:58:08,660
As a guy, I'm disgusted.

1306
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:09,500
And guess what?

1307
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:10,860
I'm addicted to Starbucks.

1308
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,860
So fuck you.

1309
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,420
Well, I'm a hipster too, but I'm a different flavor of hipster.

1310
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,420
I'm more of like a Zooey Deschanel style,

1311
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,660
adorkable hipster.

1312
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,660
He's been fucking with us for fucking 10 months.

1313
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,740
First of all, I've never even heard of Starbucks.

1314
00:58:21,740 --> 00:58:23,020
What the hell is that?

1315
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:25,060
Oh, you're a hipster now?

1316
00:58:25,060 --> 00:58:26,340
No, I've never heard of it.

1317
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,780
It seems too underground.

1318
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:31,460
Where do you buy your December CDs if you don't get them at the counter at Starbucks?

1319
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:34,260
I buy them at a normal coffee shop like Dunkin Donuts.

1320
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,260
Thank you very much.

1321
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:36,920
Oh, you're more bro.

1322
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,920
You're such a bro, dude.

1323
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:38,920
You're indie.

1324
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:41,920
Yeah, I'm a little bit of a jock slash bro.

1325
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:42,920
Fucking sue me.

1326
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,640
Yeah, and I'm more of a scientist.

1327
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:48,100
Patrick is mostly an emo, I would say.

1328
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,100
Yeah, I'm pretty emo.

1329
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,760
He's like a J.I. Simpson.

1330
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,220
I have really long bangs.

1331
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:54,620
Me and Branson are jocks.

1332
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:55,620
I think I'm a jock.

1333
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:02,660
I'm a hipster Patrick are emo emo hipsters emo hipsters who would care about their clothes and cameras and scientists

1334
00:59:02,660 --> 00:59:10,540
Cameron and Charles are two scientists or astronaut a couple eggheads Einstein. Hey, what is point X equal?

1335
00:59:10,540 --> 00:59:12,860
stupid

1336
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:16,860
Well, they would know that where you are. What is it? What is the equal? Why would you call it?

1337
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:21,260
But they know they're on the spot. I'm on here. I just want to hear it. Carol

1338
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:23,300
E equals.

1339
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,140
- You guys, listen, you guys might think, you guys--

1340
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:24,960
- This is more of like a Zoomer thing.

1341
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,100
I think people my age don't know what E equals means.

1342
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,020
- Zoomers don't know.

1343
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:30,700
You're a Zoomer who doesn't know E equals MC squared.

1344
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,700
(laughing)

1345
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:34,940
- Yeah, they lost so much education--

1346
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:38,420
- You guys might think I'm a nerd or a geek

1347
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:39,420
or something like that,

1348
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:41,460
but something that I have that you guys will never have

1349
00:59:41,460 --> 00:59:42,940
is an imagination, okay?

1350
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:45,020
And I have a special machine that plugs into my TV

1351
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:47,020
that can turn me into anything from Master Chief

1352
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:51,500
to Mr. Chief to any video game character in the world.

1353
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:57,100
So as a jock you probably don't even know that shit, so shut the fuck up. I didn't understand a single goddamn word

1354
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,100

The website actually came out pretty well.

1413
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,000
The SEO part of this episode sucked,

1414
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,520
but I know all the episodes suck because we're just

1415
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,640
not good on this show.

1416
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:37,640
