1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:10,080
- New type of vibes.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,720
- Okay, so it's basically a completely different

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,200
type of episode because I can actually hear my own voice now.

5
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,220
- You know what, it is, this is kind of like

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,040
putting horse blinders on us.

7
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,760
- This is actually, I would say, the opposite.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,520
I would say normally I have horse blinders on

9
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,280
and right now I am a horse that is completely aware

10
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,500
of his peripheral vision.

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,340
- Yeah.

12
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,400
- Yeah, and I don't like it at all.

13
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,280
I hate these because I thought for a long time,

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,800
I thought for a long, long time,

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,360
I don't mean this in an offensive way,

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,560
I thought until right now that I sounded like a black guy.

17
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,800
And I'm realizing that I do not,

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,080
at all, 'cause I can hear my own voice.

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,560
- 'Cause you were listening to that Lou Reed song earlier.

20
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,280
- Yeah, well a little bit that.

21
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,640
But I always thought that I had like a lower,

22
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,200
not that black guys have lower voices.

23
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,040
- Yeah, what are you,

24
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,720
what are you getting up to right now?

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,560
What are you saying?

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,920
I'm not getting up to anything.

27
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:03,400
See, this is fucking me up.

28
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,280
The headphones are making me crazy.

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,600
Yep, in the world of the blind,

30
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,400
the smeller is the teller.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,680
Are you the smeller in this scenario?

32
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,000
I guess I'm the smeller.

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,840
But I'm not, that's what I'm saying.

34
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,760
In the world of the blind,

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,400
the hearing are endearing.

36
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,680
I wish that I was blind right now.

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,520
These are my glasses.

38
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:26,080
Well, blind people can hear.

39
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,440
Barely.

40
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,600
- Well it's not, the,

41
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,860
(laughing)

42
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,520
the world of everyone's still a hearer

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,560
in the world of the blind.

44
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,520
- The world of the deaf.

45
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,920
- It's just gonna take some getting used to

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,760
to be hearing my voice. - The world of the deaf,

47
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,320
in the world of the deaf,

48
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,680
you can sometimes pick up on people's breath.

49
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,680
- I always thought I had maybe a Howard Stern kind of thing

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,720
and I'm realizing that I don't at all.

51
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,560
I really don't.

52
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,720
- Well that's what, that's what the,

53
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,600
now with the kind of the advent of this internet

54
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,920
that's been going on over the past several years.

55
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,120
- Don't even say advent to me, you atheist.

56
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,120
- Now people, you know, it's like,

57
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,680
now radio people can have high voices.

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,280
- You think I have a high voice?

59
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,320
- True that!

60
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,160
- Yeah.

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,980
- True that, camera!

62
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,320
- Well, I mean, compared to Howard Stern

63
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,060
and some of these other people, these pre-internet.

64
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,360
- Is Howard Stern the girl or the boy on that show?

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,880
- He's the black girl.

66
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,800
- That's Howard?

67
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,720
- Yeah.

68
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,000
- She is not as hot as her voice is.

69
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,880
I remember listening to her voice as a kid being like,

70
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,800
I bet she is so fucking hot,

71
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,880
and then I would see the videos and it'd be like,

72
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
you know, remember when Howard Stern would make a mom

73
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,240
and a daughter get naked and kiss?

74
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:33,160
- On the Sibian?

75
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,360
- Yeah, and they'd kiss and they'd finger each other.

76
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,000
And I thought that when they first saw the mom,

77
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,160
I was like, that's gotta be her, that's gotta be Robin.

78
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,580
But then you see Robin and you're like,

79
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,060
ah yeah, that's not as hot as I thought she'd be.

80
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:48,860
- That's crazy that he was making ladies ride the Sibian.

81
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,760
- Yeah, he had an interesting--

82
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,520
- In hindsight, once he became

83
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:59,000
the America's Got Talent guy for a lot of people instead of like the radio host.

84
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,480
It's like, "Oh yeah, this is..." Remember that guy that passed along your

85
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,360
favorite singer right now? Yeah, that guy used to make ladies get naked and jack

86
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,800
off on the radio. He didn't jack off. What are you talking about? The Sibbian is jacking off.

87
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,160
Today's topic. No, the Sibbian isn't jacking off. Today's debate. Fuck no. Is a massage chair for a

88
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,900
woman? Is that jacking off? Exactly. If you sit on the... Okay, here's a

89
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,780
scenario. Is the sibyan jacking off or is it some different third type of thing? If

90
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,840
somebody's getting a massage in a massage chair and you decide, "Well,

91
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,800
I'm gonna go visit my friend," and you sit on the armrest and you have a clitoris

92
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:42,220
and it starts going and stinging your clit, is that masturbating or is

93
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,240
that not? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. That's why I'm asking the questions. I'm

94
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,720
I think that hard-hitting questions. I mean, if it's on the radio, it's,

95
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,600
it's probably all made up anyway. It probably wasn't even one.

96
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Cause they filmed it. Also girls can't feel anything if they're not in love.

97
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,960
So they don't give a, they sit on that and they just,

98
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,400
it's basically just making a noise. So they were acting anyway.

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,240
It's basically,

100
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,400
so I guess the Sibian or massage chair is a rollercoaster.

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Yeah. That's what that is. It's a rollercoaster.

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,920
It's not jacking off.

103
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,100
It's not anything else other than--

104
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,240
I think it's a chair.

105
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:25,080
As a roller coaster moves around.

106
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,400
What does a roller coaster have?

107
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,040
Well, I will say--

108
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,760
It goes up and down in loops.

109
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,320
--if you put me on one of those--

110
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:29,840
What do you--

111
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,320
--you put a--

112
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,560
--you would get in it, though.

113
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,000
--if you put a 3D video, an iPhoto booth

114
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,240
background of the roller coaster going--

115
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,240
which, by the way, that photo booth background never

116
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,320
made any sense because it goes reverse.

117
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,040
Right?

118
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:51,440
I think if you position yourself backwards, so say like your laptop's right here and then

119
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,680
you sit, you turn around, it'll work.

120
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
That makes a little more sense.

121
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,120
Yeah, it makes way more sense.

122
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,120
But nobody thinks to do that because they want to see themselves.

123
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,760
Actually, what you guys are missing here is that when you watch the video file, it's backwards,

124
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,760
right?

125
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,280
But what's actually going on is you're riding a roller coaster forwards and there's also

126
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,520
a clone of you sitting in front of you looking at you.

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,600
Oh, that's scary.

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,520
And that's actually what the experience is.

129
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,520
Because your couch or wherever you're sitting on while you look at your laptop, that's the

130
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,360
roller coaster seat.

131
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:24,080
And there just happens to be, there's a guy in front of you who turned around and he looks

132
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
just like you.

133
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,760
And you're like, "Please turn back."

134
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,760
I don't like that.

135
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,160
That's going to keep me up for a couple nights.

136
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Last night I got kept up.

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,200
I got kept up because I thought, you remember last night we were here and you were like,

138
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,360
I felt a spirit on me.

139
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
Yeah, I did.

140
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,040
I went home and I felt probably 30 or 40 spirits in my bedroom and I started

141
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:48,680
freaking out and I went to go lay on the couch and there was a

142
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,920
dress that was hanging up on a door in my house. It was my

143
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,120
dress that I was gonna wear to my quinceanera and I was sitting in the

144
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,160
door and it was completely dark so not only did I think that it was a

145
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,800
woman, I thought it was a woman in a black dress. Wow. So it was pretty scary

146
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,680
because it's too dark to see that is really I did probably charm her and

147
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,600
woohoo would cry instantly if you felt if you felt the presence that I felt last

148
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,880
night or if you saw I guess the woman that Caleb saw you would sob I would woo

149
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:28,720
I got really really I get really scared ghost that's what the ghost I get really

150
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:33,200
scared of ghosts maybe once a month I'll get really scared of a ghost if I stay

151
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,780
up past midnight, the witching hour. But then there's always a moment about 90 minutes into

152
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,480
my fear where I realize, "What the fuck is a ghost going to do to me?" And I start walking

153
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,760
around my house like a gorilla.

154
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,880
Well, stop your heart. Is that what they do?

155
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,560
No.

156
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,000
If they get you good, yeah.

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,320
Well, some people have died from ghost attacks. Mac Miller, Whitney Houston, these people

158
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,880
have where they were haunted.

159
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Well, I thought those were demons that they had.

160
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
I mean, it could be.

161
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
That's what a lot of the news stories said.

162
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,540
Yeah.

163
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,540
That their demons finally caught up with them.

164
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,040
Yeah.

165
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
And I went, "Ahh!"

166
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Haunted by their demons.

167
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,040
"Ahh! That's scary!"

168
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,040
Kurt Cobain killed by his demons, they said.

169
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Yeah.

170
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,040
Here's what I'm saying.

171
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,040
When you even, it doesn't matter what industry you're into.

172
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,040
If you're a musician, if you're a comedian, if you're a chef,

173
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:25,040
as soon as those demons pop up, run the other direction.

174
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,040
You know what sucks about being a chef that has to work with your demons?

175
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,040
You gotta eat all the food.

176
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,040
You gotta eat all the food they make, and it's always so fricking spicy.

177
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,520
spicy. That's right. Yeah. It's always so spicy. And it's also,

178
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,560
it's also always when demons are preparing food, it's always like,

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,720
oh, if this, like, I, this is my favorite food, but I have to,

180
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,520
I have to eat 100 servings of it in a row. Yeah. And I'm like,

181
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,120
I don't even like it anymore. Yeah. Like Bourdain. Yeah. Homer.

182
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,840
He was running all around the world from his demon. Demon?

183
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,040
He was running away from his demon.

184
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:57,360
A lot of people said his pedophile girlfriend was a demon, but I don't think.

185
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,520
Which is a different entity than a demon. Yeah. That's a sucky bi. Yeah.

186
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,420
Yeah, demoned a complete different entity.

187
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,900
Then the blue, blue, like, like, you know what the hottest part of the flame is or

188
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,100
the hottest. Oh, the hottest hockey blue blue.

189
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,600
Demoned blue. It's a palindrome to

190
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,540
demon. Demon. Do you write D M O E

191
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,120
and D D M O E.

192
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,660
D M O. That's how you decided to spell that.

193
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:32,620
DMO. I spelled it perfectly correct. You're just cracking yourself up with DMO-ed.

194
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:36,700
I'm, today, I'm on one, I guess.

195
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,380
I had, you know what I had? What'd you have? I had a, um, I went to that grocery store by your house.

196
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,780
Thanks? Mm-hmm. Thanks. Why are you thanking me?

197
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:50,540
It just stimulates the local economy. Yeah. This block is gonna be bumbling.

198
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,300
That's gonna trickle down.

199
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,380
Thank you so much. Uh-huh, it's gonna trickle down back to you.

200
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,420
I don't know why is it. You know they have that bakery there?

201
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:03,220
They got a you were calling me out turnovers and stuff now you're letting everyone know where he lives guava turnover

202
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:08,900
I had come on pretty good. Okay, so now they know that I live in a fucking Mexico neighborhood. Uh-huh great guava Danish

203
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:13,520
You had one of those no no I honestly have no idea. I didn't know there was a bakery in there

204
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,460
Yeah, there's a bread aisle that I don't go to cuz I'm straight ketosis. I would never eat

205
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,720
Oh, you're on that shit in my life. I've been on you wouldn't eat. No. It's really good

206
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,120
I would maybe eat one at a doctor's office if they had it on a turnover. Yeah, there is certain okay

207
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
- Okay, that's actually such a good point.

208
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,780
There are certain foods that I would never ever eat in my life

209
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:35,800
but if it's somewhere where it's sitting on a table,

210
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,640
then I'm gonna be like, I guess I'll fucking eat it for sock.

211
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,480
- Pretty much every entonoment.

212
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,160
- I'm gonna go buy a scone.

213
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,760
I'm gonna go buy 10 scones.

214
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,600
- Fuck no, I'll never eat a scone.

215
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,560
- No, a scone is something your girlfriend buys you.

216
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,380
- What? - No, it's something

217
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,220
a doctor--

218
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,560
- Yeah, she thinks you're a fucking tubby piece of shit.

219
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,440
- Your girlfriend buys you a scone?

220
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,480
- My girlfriend buys me tomahawk steak.

221
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,560
(laughing)

222
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,560
- A scone.

223
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,400
- Brobrain gets a scone.

224
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,000
- That's like, mayo flowers.

225
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,840
- She gets you a scone, 'cause she may work at--

226
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
- No, she gets me a PlayStation game.

227
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,000
- She may work at a bakery, a nice coffee shop.

228
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,720
- Nobody gets anybody a scone.

229
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,400
Scones exist so you can eat them from the table.

230
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,240
- I agree, that's not true.

231
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,840
- There's no such thing.

232
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,680
- I've never seen anybody buy a scone in my life.

233
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,400
- What if you know somebody who's a baker?

234
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,240
They would get you a scone.

235
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,080
- Scones are fucking shit, man.

236
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,920
- Scones suck, I'm not saying they're good.

237
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,040
- They would make you cookies, brownies, or a cake.

238
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,300
- I'm not saying they're good, I'm just saying,

239
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,980
It's something that somebody who cares about you gets,

240
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,320
even though you hate it.

241
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,460
- Is it a scone?

242
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,140
Is it a saccone?

243
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,060
It has an apostrophe between the S and the C.

244
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,900
- Yeah, like a s'more.

245
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
- Like a s'more?

246
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,560
- That's a saccone.

247
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,400
- That's a saccone.

248
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
- Oh.

249
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,060
- Saccone.

250
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,900
- I actually--

251
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,060
- Yorma saccone.

252
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,520
- Let's do something with that.

253
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,860
- Yorma saccone from Lonely Island.

254
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:48,580
When I was 16, he liked a reply that I had on Twitter,

255
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,260
and I told five or six people in my real life.

256
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,220
(laughing)

257
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,020
I was like, "Yorma from the Lonely Island liked that I said,

258
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,260
'fucking whatever, hot raw rules.'"

259
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,880
- Yeah, he said, "@yormatacone, you're the best, I love you."

260
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,420
- It was essentially that, I think.

261
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,260
- Yeah.

262
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,100
- Yeah.

263
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,420
- Yeah, but I remember I told probably four or five people.

264
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,800
I was like, "That was pretty awesome."

265
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,740
I basically touched a celebrity's arm.

266
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,220
- Yeah, damn, I would like to do that.

267
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,660
Speaking of comedy.

268
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:21,000
- Do tell.

269
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,580
- That's what we should have called it, the fucking show.

270
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,420
- Yeah.

271
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,400
- I had a dream last night,

272
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,540
and I had made up a joke in the dream.

273
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,380
- Holy shit.

274
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,720
- And I wrote it down when I woke up.

275
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,820
Do you want to hear the, and I forgot about it.

276
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,520
I remembered it when I was at the gym

277
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,840
and I had to take a break 'cause I started laughing.

278
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,680
- Okay.

279
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
- And I looked like a crazy person.

280
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,720
- You bragged that you went to the gym.

281
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,280
- You called me fruity pretty recently on the Twitch stream

282
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,180
for writing down my dreams.

283
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:48,940
- Yeah, but writing out a joke from a dream

284
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,520
is very different from writing down your dream

285
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,040
every single day. That's how Louis does it. Louis writes, he dreams, he's

286
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:58,400
also, I also to be fair, I called you for you for having a dream journal, which is

287
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:02,880
a hundred percent correct. It's not a journal, it's a diary. It's a notes app on my phone.

288
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:09,440
It has a little heart-shaped lock on it. Yeah, it has a heart-shaped lock with a heart-shaped key. It is the notes app on my phone. This is how a man writes down his dream.

289
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,920
That's right. He makes a separate note that says, "Joke I came up with in my dream." What's wrong with that?

290
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:20,240
Here's my joke. Okay. This is a stand-up comedy joke. All right. So, well by God, get

291
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,240
Get out of your damn chair!

292
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,240
Get up.

293
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,240
I'm all cabled in.

294
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,240
That's fine, fuck you.

295
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,240
Why is a machine gun called a machine gun?

296
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,240
What's the machine part?

297
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Making a bullet go really fast?

298
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,240
All guns do that.

299
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Damn.

300
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,240
That's pretty good.

301
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,240
That is actually funny as fuck.

302
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Here's my dream.

303
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:53,920
stand-up read your dream had a dream that the Hard Rock Hotel had Indian Hitler as

304

309
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:18,400
supposed to be well he manages the Hard Rock Hotel dreams are a reflection of

310
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,760
your subconscious. So all day you're walking around, you're walking down the

311
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,240
street, you're getting the bus and stuff, and people don't know that one of these

312
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:29,200

314
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:37,920
my room. That is some fucking epic shit. Because I was calling for room service I think.

00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:43,080
That would be a real... Talk about a wake-up call. Yeah. Right? You see this guy...

316

Fuck it, yeah, of course.

323
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,160
If I saw him, yeah.

324
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,440
- How many businesses in India are named after Hitler?

325
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,360
- We talked about this, maybe not on the podcast,

326
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,200
but we-- - A million times.

327
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,040
We have talked about this one billion times.

328
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,800
- Not on the podcast, though, I don't think.

Juvia just looked up maps on Google Maps.

337
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,360
- He looked up India.

338
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,040
(laughing)

339
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,800
- Okay, now look up Hitler.

340
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's see what we got in here.

341
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,280
- Wolf's Lair.

342
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,240
- Ruins of Hitler's wartime command base.

343
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,080
That is not in India, my friend.

344
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,240
- Wait, who's DJ Hitler?

345
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,920
- DJ Hitler, Eleonora Kassiev, DJ in, whoa!

346
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,400
This is in fucking New York?

347
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,040
There's a guy named DJ Hitler?

348
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,040
- Holy shit!

349
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,220
- Whoa!

350
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,100
- DJ, get a quote, get a quote!

351
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:16,100
- I am hosting a party for 100 to 120 people on August 24th.

352
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,340
(laughing)

353
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:24,120
- Whoa, okay, so we know who is DJing my wedding.

354
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:24,960
- Yeah.

355
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,440
- It's gonna be DJ Hitler, Alinora Kaseev.

356
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,600
- Huh? - When is that?

357
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,480
- It's tomorrow.

358
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
- Is it really tomorrow?

359
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,840
- Yep, it's completely tomorrow.

360
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,280
- Whoa, look at the mask that DJ Hitler wears.

361
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,120
- He can't have a what's his name,

362
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,880
Salvador Dali mask on.

363
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,720
- Yeah, that is.

364
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
- And a Shutterstock picture.

365
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,960
- That is confusing branding, Mr. Hitler.

366
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,320
With all due respect, open 24 hours.

367
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,160
- 24 hours every day of the week.

368
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
- We can call him.

369
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,600
- No, we won't call.

370
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,640
We don't wanna bother DJ Hitler, he's busy.

371
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,080
- Yeah, got a lot of events.

372
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,240
- He's very, very busy.

373
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,740
- Two pictures in the gallery.

374
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:02,760
- But yeah, there was a lot of good clothing stores

375
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:07,000
called Hitler. And then for whatever reason, there was like, you know,

376
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,100
every single one of them had some news story written about it, I guess,

377
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,560
because when you look it up,

378
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,640
there was always a picture of the owner in front of it,

379
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,960
like smugly crossing his arms, like, yep, I named my store Hitler.

380
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,880
Do you think that's like a shock value thing?

381
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,240
Like do you think maybe Nathan for you went over there?

382
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:28,760
Well, that's the Nathan for you over there, his every episode is like,

383
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,320
so we're going to change the name of the business to Hitler. Yeah.

384
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
There has to be stuff that they scrap

385
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,500
that is like when the US military

386
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,360
would like lose a nuclear bomb somewhere

387
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,180
and it's just like sitting in the middle of Ohio.

388
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:42,740
There's gotta be tons of stories called Hitler

389
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,740
that have no explanation

390
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,200
because the episode never came out.

391
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,440
- Yeah. - You know?

392
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,400
- That's definitely it.

393
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,240
There's no other explanation for it.

394
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,800
- You know, you saw that, the news story

395
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,400
where they lost some radioactive stuff

396
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,000
in Australia recently, right?

397
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,520
Like in the past week or whatever?

398
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,960
- Yeah, it's called the--

399
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,360
- What, they put it in a kangaroo's pouch and it hopped away?

400
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,200
- Yeah, they put it in a kangaroo's pouch

401
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,240
and it copped away, come on. - That is some funny shit.

402
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:05,300
but the funny thing about that's history to me it was that they like the like

403
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,360
headliner never was

404
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,480
the government has lost a cylinder

405
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,680
uh...

406
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:16,200
israel thinks so hard nobody clicks on the head of the israeli

407
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,640
what do you have to put this together and his story but i don't give a shit

408
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,280
about a cylinder of those of the cylinder i would like to know and that

409
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,920
was

410
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,040
thousands of those a week so that you have to take care of foster is right

411
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:28,920
right

412
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,960
Yeah, well no they don't know anything else. Yeah, they don't like fosters. Yeah, hope it's not fucking

413
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,680
Peanut butter do they like peanut butter?

414
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:43,220
Marmite is that an animal? Yeah. Oh shit. Marmite is a cylinder animal in Australia called a marmite. Yeah

415
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:50,940
Completely furry tube as no just had legs and one tail bloody. Yeah one tail to hell

416
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,120
There's a marmite right there. That's a marmite put this up. Yeah, that is scary man. It's got billions of seeds

417
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,580
I want and it's got one tail. Yeah. Yeah, I'm actually seeing two or three tails. Holy shit

418
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:11,560
There's spikes those got to be the same part of the tail right is Australia really all that scary

419
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:20,120
Isn't all the get this guy out of here. Yeah, I'm sick of seeing this guy. What is it get Matt Doren out of here?

420
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,040
Isn't um get this guy out of here. It's just you know keep this guy around is in

421
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:34,980
Is it true that Australia is full of giant Spidey's and creepy? I've heard that it's it's a it's a myth. I know Bruce paradise

422
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:39,400
I've heard it makes you say kill it with fire. Really

423
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:46,200
Yeah, I heard there was there was they the the settlers did do some horrible things when I got there

424
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,020
I heard in Australia all the toilets flush a different way, too

425
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,320
and that is one of the things they do.

426
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,080
- Yeah, they flush out onto people's faces.

427
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,920
(laughing)

428
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,860
- That's one of the things that the settlers did.

429
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,040
They were like, "We're gonna make these toilets go crazy."

430
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,340
- "We're gonna make 'em shake heads up."

431
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,180
- "It's gonna spin the other way.

432
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,300
"It's gonna come right back out, hit you in the nose."

433
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:09,140
- That is honestly a great idea for an opposite device.

434
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,380
(laughing)

435
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,100
Like if you're gonna make one thing that is--

436
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,220
- One opposite device.

437
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:18,300
- It's gotta be the number one device

438
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,180
that you want it to do the right way

439
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,180
and not the opposite way.

440
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,020
- Yeah.

441
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:22,840
- Which is a tullet.

442
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,300
Because if a tullet shoots the opposite way into your face,

443
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,700
you have poop on your face.

444
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,540
- Yeah. - Or gunk.

445
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,380
- Awful.

446
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,540
That is awful, man.

447
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,660
- Could be diarrhea, too.

448
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,500
- Oh, speaking of diarrhea, dude, I have--

449
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,780
- Diarrhea dude, was that your YouTube name?

450
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,020
- Shit, man.

451
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,460
I mean, I have to give it up for that.

452
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,500
That was fucking incredible.

453
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,260
But speaking of diarrhea,

454
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,180
- I've completely fixed my butt.

455
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,020
- Really?

456
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,580
(laughing)

457
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,420
- I fixed my butt.

458
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,620
- I thought you were having issues.

459
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:58,300
- I had a breakthrough moment when I was in Chicago.

460
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,860
I was walking down the street and--

461
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,220
- Would you just constipate yourself

462
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,300
with all that Italian beef?

463
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,860
- No, no, no, the complete opposite.

464
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,940
I was walking down the street

465
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,780
and I was walking between restaurants

466
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,220
and I was eating at two different restaurants.

467
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,180
I shit myself.

468
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,020
- Sounds like you're in paradise.

469
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,780
I let out a fart and it was very cold outside.

470
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,020
And I let out a fart and there was poop in it.

471
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,340
And I was like, "Hey, I'll catch up with you later."

472
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,380
I was like, "Oh, I need a cup of coffee badly."

473
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:30,780
So I went into a coffee shop and I bought a sparkling water.

474
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,340
And before I, with the water in my hand,

475
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,820
three people back in line, I asked if they had a bathroom

476
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,020
so they know what's going on.

477
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,860
Yeah.

478
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,680
Right, I'm not even up there.

479
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,120
And I'm like, "Do you guys have a bathroom?"

480
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,340
With the water in my hand.

481
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,020
She's like, "Yeah, it's over there."

482
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,980
But I get my water and then I go back there

483
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,180
and I think everybody must have heard me say,

484
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,520
I like ask if they had a bathroom,

485
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,540
'cause I was in there a really, really long time.

486
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:54,500
I threw away my underwear because they had poop on them

487
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,620
and I didn't wanna have to wash.

488
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,220
- How often do you shit your pants?

489
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,420
- Once every six months.

490
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:02,060
I threw away my underwear and then I walked out

491
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,620
and pretty much the entire, it was like a walk of shame.

492
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,660
Like pretty much the entire restaurant or coffee shop

493
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,860
looked at me and could like completely tell

494
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,700
that I just shit my pants

495
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,460
and that I'd just thrown away my underwear

496
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,880
because my fly was down and my penis was out.

497
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,720
- Is that true?

498
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,540
- No. - That part's true?

499
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,380
- No, that part is not true.

500
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,380
- Well, maybe they had-- - But then I got home,

501
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,220
on the way to the restaurant--

502
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,500
- You had to shame your poop in shape.

503
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,980
- On the way to the,

504
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,300
it literally was like rock bottom for me.

505
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,420
And so on the way to the restaurant,

506
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,140
I went on Amazon and I ordered 90 billion

507
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:40,700
probiotic organisms in a pill capsule,

508
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,660
and I've been taking those,

509
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:43,100
and it has completely healed my life.

510
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,060
- It helps.

511
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:44,900
- You know what you can also do?

512
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,740
- 90 billion.

513
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,760
- Sauerkraut, I've learned.

514
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,300
- Any fermented food is very good for your ass.

515
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,060
- It's crazy that the food that smells,

516
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,380
you're supposed to eat a bunch of stuff

517
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,900
that smells terrible.

518
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,420
- There's a bunch of guggy little bugs

519
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,980
sitting in your belly.

520
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,820
- Yeah.

521
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,640
- Eating up and farting.

522
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,480
- They have a world.

523
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,320
- And they shit in there.

524
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,460
- Osmosis Jones was a documentary.

525
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,300
- It was.

526
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,460
- There's a Jurassic world in your body.

527
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,140
- Yeah, your ass-ic world.

528
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,980
- I have a velastic world.

529
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,820
- Your ass is sick.

530
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,180
- Because of how many pickles I've been eating

531
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,900
because they're fermented.

532
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,500
Velasic world.

533
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,340
- Yeah.

534
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,160
- But yeah, so it's been--

535
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,000
- And the stork made you.

536
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,020
- It's been pretty awesome though.

537
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:18,860
So I have been feeling--

538
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:19,900
- It's fixed.

539
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,720
- Amazing.

540
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,860
I was pretty much right on the edge of schizophrenia

541
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,660
and I think it completely saved me from that.

542
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,020
I've been looking up, apparently that's a,

543
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,100
I've been looking at this,

544
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,320
like all the forums for people who are like

545
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,220
trying to heal their gut microbiome.

546
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,580
Half the people are like,

547
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,220
"Yeah, I used to be fucking schizophrenic

548
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,980
"until I started eating kimchi and now I'm completely fine."

549
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,820
- Wow.

550
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:47,300
I've been eating so much fermented stuff too. Really? Yeah. It's sauerkraut, kimchi,

551
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:51,580
it makes your breath smell bad, it makes your butt smell bad. Luckily I also just

552
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,820
switched to a completely natural fluoride free charcoal toothpaste that

553
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:59,980
doesn't do anything. So that's great. Perfect timing. That's huge. Yeah. You

554
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,780
telling that story made my stomach hurt. Really? Do you want me to... can I massage it?

555
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,780
No. Really? Yeah. You know it's also I guess maybe good for gut health if you're

556
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:13,240
talking just you know taking solid craps you're drinking an energy drink every

557
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:18,140
single day it's really bad for you I don't know how this works all of the I

558
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:22,140
don't know how this works but if you drink Celsius every morning no it's

559
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:26,900
super you take one really long solid poop clears out every single thing in

560
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:32,660
your body you have poop in your body every single thing it's kind of a lot of

561
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:38,260
a lot of my body how come when you don't drink enough water your poop turns more

562
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:44,740
watery sometimes. You sound like Jordan Peterson right now.

563
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:50,020
You heard him say that on Rogan this past week. You heard him say that.

564
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:55,220
I only watched the Rob Zombie episode of Joe Rogan.

565
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:59,860
He said like, "You need to drink, there's too much. You don't drink enough

566
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:03,860
water, your poop's gonna be water." You think I learned about diarrhea

567
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,780
- Is that diarrhea from Joe Rogan?

568
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,620
Is that what you were saying?

569
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,860
- It's feeling wet and runny,

570
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,140
but it sounds a little funny.

571
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,260
- No, that's Joe Rogan's voice that he's doing.

572
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,060
- I can't remember which guy's which.

573
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,020
That's Joe Rogan's voice.

574
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,860
Eating all that health.

575
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,260
- That's Jordan Peterson.

576
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,400
That's a quote from him.

577
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,240
- What is it?

578
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,860
- He says, "It's really wet and runny,

579
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:25,780
but it sounds kind of funny."

580
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,700
- I wanted you to make the noise again.

581
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,900
- These days, PC culture, you can't even say,

582
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,740
you can't even say you're gonna go--

583
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:38,060
Nowadays means poop and crap culture you can't even say you're gonna go drop the Cosby kids off to the off at the pool

584
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:41,860
These days now you have to say I'm going to take the Browns

585
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:50,380
He's awesome

586
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,560
He changed my life

587
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:59,100
He said clean your damn room and poop in that damn damn toilet bitch

588
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,780
That's it

589
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,340
He doesn't swear

590
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:12,700
He'll say bloody and fuck I just had a bloody fuck

591
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:18,380
With a turd I fucked a bloody turd he says that

592
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,980
Yeah, he says shit like that

593
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:28,860
Barely an impression

594
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:39,240
And the Board of Psychologists in Canada they wiped my butt

595
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,460
When you make a bloody turd you have to wipe your butt I said no I said I won't

596
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:02,140
I was taken off of campus because I walked in I said milk milk lemonade around the corner fudge is made

597
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,340
He actually would defend that yeah

598
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:06,220
milk is

599
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,780
around the corner

600
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,780
He did do

601
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
Milk is around the corner now.

602
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
Yeah.

603
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
*laughing*

604
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
You walk into any college campus, they're saying

605
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
Fudge, fudge, milk

606
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
around the corner, lemonade.

607
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,220
It's completely backwards.

608
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,220
*laughing*

609
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,220
These institutions are not being respected.

610
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,220
*laughing*

611
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,220
Milk is around the corner.

612
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,220
It's rum and lemonade

613
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,220
around the corner, milk is made.

614
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,220
These people are growing up

615
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:50,100
growing up thinking you can make milk from the back? That doesn't make any sense.

616
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:53,860
But if you don't drink enough water sometimes you can't make milk from the

617
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:58,420
back. That is true. No you make sign up pilk. Nah don't even get me started on

618
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:03,700
pilk. Poop milk? What's poop milk? Pepsi milk from the Lindsay Lohan show.

619
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:13,180
The Lindsay Lohan show? The commercial that she did where she went "ahhh Pepsi and milk." I don't care too much about milk. You don't care too much about it? I saw a new

620
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,500
video about it where the guy, the guy in the video of Lindsay Lohan

621
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,100
demonstrating pilk, she has a glass of Pepsi, she pours a little bit of milk in there.

622
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:26,060
That sucks that like it's like Lindsay Lohan is like making like a comeback

623
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:32,540
through pilk. Yeah, that sucks. Yeah. It sucks for her. She's like, I don't think she deserves what's coming to her.

624
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:37,660
Will you do this jackass style stunt for our commercial?

625
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:44,340
I I I think that Oh pickle milk that does not sound very good. No that does not

626
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:48,260
sound very fucking good. I'll be real with you yeah it also doesn't look very real

627
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,660
to me but I think I need to cut out all food I think I need to stop drinking milk

628
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:56,940
cuz I drink a lot of milk why do you drink a lot of milk cuz I just like the

629
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:02,100
cream no you were doing you I know your ass you're doing some kind of fucking

630
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:05,480
and you're trying to do some carnivore, yeah.

631
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,340
Carnivore diet. - I don't have a bone plan.

632
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,940
- He's doing, he's got a bone plan, this motherfucker.

633
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,780
- I know he's on a bone plan from YouTube.

634
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,100
- The carnivore diet, they--

635
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,740
- God damn it, dude, it keeps getting me.

636
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,540
- They, no, the carnivore diet--

637
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,780
- No more, no more!

638
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,660
- Yeah, you need to stop, you need to stop.

639
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:22,780
You need to close your eyes. - I just put a spell

640
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,900
on you, by the way.

641
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:25,380
- I saw a guy, wait, now that,

642
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,580
or since I have headphones on,

643
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,580
I saw a guy the other day who was doing a bench press

644
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:30,180
at the gym and he had this kind of headphone on,

645
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,860
and every time he would get up and hype himself up,

646
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,740
he's a big fat guy, and then as soon as he would go down

647
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,580
to do the bench press, he would do this.

648
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:41,380
(laughing)

649
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:44,300
He just wore his headphones like this, blocked his vision.

650
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,140
- You look like Jordy LaPorche.

651
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,860
- Star Wars, I mean Star Trek.

652
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,460
- But I didn't know what, I wanted to ask him,

653
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,980
what is this doing for you, man?

654
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:52,860
But this is kind of what Patrick needs to start doing.

655
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,400
He needs to block his vision so that he can't see

656
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,020
all the distractions, 'cause right now,

657
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,860
I'm in perfect radio podcast mode, ask me any question.

658
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,700
- Okay.

659
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,580
what is on the screen right now.

660
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:04,940
- What's behind you?

661
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,220
- What's behind me?

662
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,260
- And can you see it?

663
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,440
- The world, the entire rest of the world?

664
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:10,280
- Yeah.

665
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,600
- Yeah, in a way.

666
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,740
- In a way, yeah, I guess that's a good point.

667
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,280
- See, I'm so much more philosophical

668
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,120
when I don't have my eyes.

669
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,780
- Yeah, and that's what you want on something like this.

670
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,860
- See, it's like I said at the top of the episode.

671
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,700
- I don't even know which side is the top.

672
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,780
- In the world of the blind, the mice.

673
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,060
- No, the mice will not play.

674
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,180
- The mice are--

675
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,100
- There's three blind mice.

676
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,740
- The mice are three guys. - Three blind mice.

677
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,980
- Three blind mice. - You guys ever hear

678
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,700
that other, the Christian parody,

679
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:37,820
"Three blind guys, three blind guys,

680
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,740
"deny God's love, deny God's love."

681
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
You never heard that? - No.

682
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,460
- We learned that. - That's really good.

683
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,780
- In school. - I know three blind mice

684
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,460
from the theme song of the Stooges.

685
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,300
- I know it from-- - Which Stooges?

686
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,260
- Shrek. - Shrek 2.

687
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,340
- Well, I knew it before Shrek,

688
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,740
but Shrek, that's the touchstone.

689
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,660
- You know the one, you know the three Stooges,

690
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,660
They got that...

691
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,020
They got the theme song.

692
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,020
I've never seen...

693
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,260
Yeah, I did.

694
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,780
I never...

695
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,540
Yeah, me and the wife are doing three stooges.

696
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,500
I just had a mind blown moment.

697
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,700
Wow.

698
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,620
Yep. Those stooges are just as good.

699
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,140
They're just as intelligent as three blind mice.

700
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:14,740
Yeah.

701
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,340
Yeah.

702
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,300
You didn't think I was going to come for you, huh?

703
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,420
Were the stooges blind?

704
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,460
Curly.

705
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,580
They might as well have been.

706
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,580
Curly Joe.

707
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,260
Remember they kept replacing all those guys?

708
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,100
Yeah.

709
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,900
Shemp.

710
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:26,740
- No, I don't remember it.

711
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,060
I have never seen the Three Stooges.

712
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:29,620
- You've never watched the Three Stooges?

713
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,340
- I think I've maybe seen a clip

714
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,220
of the Will Sasso Three Stooges.

715
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,120
- They've got Shemp, Curly Joe,

716
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,980
- Curly.

717
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,260
- Curly, Moe, Larry.

718
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,860
- They have Curly Joe and Curly?

719
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:40,700
- Yeah.

720
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,540
- And then there was another guy.

721
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,380
- That's five Stooges!

722
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,220
- Well, they keep switching them out.

723
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,060
- That's bullshit!

724
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,700
- That's what we were just talking about.

725
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:48,540
- Shemp.

726
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,500
- And you're all like, I never even heard of a Stooge before.

727
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,100
- They replaced Curly with Shemp.

728
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,220
- The only Shemp I recognize is Sean Kemp,

729
00:30:54,220 --> 00:31:00,740
Seattle Supersonics Dunk Master. Deadlift shrimp. Deadlift shrimp. Mm-hmm. Deadlift shrimp.

730
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:04,740
Yeah. That's what you and your deadlift so much that you get scoliosis. Yeah, yeah.

731
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,060
You look like a shrimp. Yeah. That's perfect form on a deadlift. You have a back like a

732
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:13,180
shrimp. Yeah. It's like downward dog. You make the back like a shrimp. Yeah, you make the back like a shrimp.

733
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:19,380
And you pick up the weight. Well, I'm sorry. We looked at the x-rays of your spine and you have a back like a complete shrimp.

734
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:24,660
have deadlift shrimp. You have deadlift shrimp back. I'm a basketball player? No,

735
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:32,280
no, no. You have deadlift shrimp. Your back is this big. Yep. I'm really, really

736
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:37,860
sorry. You know what people don't talk about enough? The Three Stooges, Curly, Moe,

737
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:42,500
and Shemp, all brothers. Larry, just their friend. He was not part of it. Uh-huh.

738
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:46,800
Now here's something. They could have had Curly, Moe, and Shemp, and it could

739
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,220
have been called three stooges three brothers these days they were this is a

740
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:57,900
very rude Photoshop that that uh GBO has just done on photo p.com photo p.com it's

741
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:02,160
a bad photo P yeah these days if they tried to do three stooges oh probably

742
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:06,440
don't even look like that probably called the three fucking sluts or something

743
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,820
right and it'd probably be Amy Schumer Nancy Pelosi and yeah it would be like

744
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,820
it would probably be like...

745
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Or some other girl.

746
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,820
They'd bring Terri Schiavo back.

747
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Nowadays they'd probably make a show that would be like

748
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,820
5 to 7 politically

749
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,820
approved and diverse archetypes.

750
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,820
That's probably the name of the comedy show.

751
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,820
You actually can't say stooge anymore.

752
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Yeah.

753
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
It's a disability.

754
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,820
Diminishing to the mentally disabled.

755
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:35,820
You have to say...

756
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,820
Being a stooge nowadays is a disability.

757
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Follicularly challenged.

758
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,020
three of these fools are.

759
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,860
- Yeah.

760
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,060
- Yeah, one of them got a damn bowl for a haircut.

761
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
- Calling him curly is just mean-spirited.

762
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,060
It wouldn't fly now.

763
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,300
- Oh no, it's 'cause he would do curl-ups.

764
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,860
- Yeah, curling a shrimp.

765
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,700
- Yeah.

766
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,820
His name was originally gonna be Shemp.

767
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,180
- And then he became Shrimp.

768
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,020
- Yeah.

769
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:57,860
- Yeah, it was one of those--

770
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:01,580
- Shemp became Shrimp, then Shrimp became Shemp back again.

771
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,780
- But it probably would be called

772
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:06,140
the three or four only fans sluts.

773
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,980
- Yeah.

774
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:09,180
- Who fall onto dildos and that's--

775
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:14,420
So if they were going to create a situation where they were seen as lesser than or they

776
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:21,420
were silly or stupid characters, it would probably be called the 100-200 Republican voters.

777
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
That's true.

778
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:26,060
They would probably, yeah exactly, they would say, "No, you can't make three stooges anymore,"

779
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,500
unless they are living...

780
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,180
What the fuck is this?

781
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,180
Stop!

782
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,180
This sucks.

783
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,700
This is the three little stooges.

784
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,660
They would say, they would, uh...

785
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,860
GBO's just railroading everything with fucking photos.

786
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
You're ruining this episode!

787
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,860
You need to fucking stop.

788
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,620
You're literally ruining it.

789
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,100
I'm docking your pay.

790
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,460
Um, nobody can see these, you suck at, you're so bad at your job.

791
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,460
If you're gonna do that, you at least have to put them on screen.

792
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:53,460
You're actually so fucking bad at your job, it's unreal.

793
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,420
You show up to work in a hoodie.

794
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,460
Yeah, at least dress nicely.

795
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,860
Look at this fucking piece of shit.

796
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,900
You're dressed up like some kind of graffiti artist.

797
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:07,460
You made me lose my thread on Republican Stooges.

798
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:12,020
Which was gonna be probably an all time part of one of the smartest things we've ever done.

799
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,020
In the podcast.

800
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,900
It was gonna be on some Mort Sahl shit.

801
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,460
This was gonna be the one that pops us.

802
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,780
We're about to pop.

803
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:23,780
This was gonna be like fuckin, I don't know, what's another?

804
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,780
Matrix PowerPoint.

805
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:28,180
This was gonna be our Matrix PowerPoint.

806
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,100
It was gonna be Republican Stooges.

807
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:33,440

820
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:35,340
I had, I played Mafia Wars and then also there was a Facebook app called Flare.

821
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:39,020
You played a game called Flare?

822
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:40,020
Wasn't a game.

823
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,900
It was a light that you looked into?

824
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,380
No, it was a virtual cork board.

825
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,660
It was a virtual cork board that you could play?

826
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:52,860
My mom showed me it and she was like, "Look at how much flare I have."

827
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:53,860
I was like, "Okay."

828
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,860
What?

829
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:58,660
I guess it used to show on your profile.

830
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,900
Like OfficeSpace Flare?

831
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:04,740
Yeah. It used to show on your profile that you had this little cork board with buttons.

832
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:10,020
But then that only worked for maybe a year. So then you had to open up the Flare in a

833
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,340
completely different app. And it was like you could put a picture.

834
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,340
They ruined Flare.

835
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:15,340
They ruined Flare.

836
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,340
That sucks, man.

837
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,860
That's why MySpace was sick because you could put those HTML things in your page. Like you

838
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:23,920
go to playlist.com put up your own playlist you didn't have to just have

839
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,940
one song you can have dude did you guys do you guys remember I just remembered

840
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:30,820
this do you guys remember that fucking Facebook game that Halloween game where

841
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,760
you would put in your information that would be a clip of a creepy old guy

842
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,980
looking at your profile and then he would be like I'm gonna fuck this little

843
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,020
kid and then jump in his car I'm serious and they jump in his car and I don't I

844
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:48,620
I seriously doubt that the thing that I don't remember he said that was I'm

845
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,540
going to do that. That's what I felt threatened. I thought that was

846
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,380
the kind of context, the subtext of the video. The threat was like he's gonna

867
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,780
- Damn.

868
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,600
- We've basically...

869
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,860
(laughter)

870
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:42,340
We've basically been best friends since...

871
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,600
(laughter)

872
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,740
Since elementary school,

873
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,620
and we've pretty much been in every single class together,

874
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,120
except for fifth grade.

875
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:51,980
(laughter)

876
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,820
Bad face.

877
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:58,720
It's so cool that we have been friends for this long,

878
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,100
And honestly, we have so many inside jokes

879
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,520
that I can't even type this

880
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,260
without thinking about cracking up.

881
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:09,420
I would rate you a 10 out of 10.

882
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,560

883
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:15,700
I'm giving you silver,

884
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:18,660

And I'm saying, "Indian Hitler, LOL."

887
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,860
To everyone else, that's an inside joke.

888
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,740
And it's okay for me to comment that 'cause it's 2009.

889
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,740
I'm gonna comment it and say I get it too.

986
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:47,580
the best friend you can have in the world. We look up Caleb and it says that and I

987
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,700
say it's got to be a mistake but then we keep scrolling and pretty much every

988
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:54,580
definition is the exact same. So we decided to go on chat roulette.

989
00:43:54,580 --> 00:44:02,960
Uh-huh. Yep. Pull up chat roulette right now. No, don't do that. No, no, no. Stop. Dude, there's

995
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:32,380
Yeah, that was funny

996
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,860
That's the funniest thing you can do

997
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,020
It's a you're is whip your dick out when as soon as you get an adult guy and say you're a pedophile

998
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:41,620
That's the funniest thing you can do. Yeah. Until you get a little bit older and

999
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:46,420
you realize that probably most of those people were pedophiles. And I gave them exactly what

1000
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:52,260
they wanted. Yeah, and that's on their computer still. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1001
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:58,180
I thought when I was a kid that I couldn't take any nude photos of myself because I would go to jail.

1002
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,220
Yeah. Because my body was such a perfect...

1003
00:45:01,220 --> 00:45:06,660
It was so perfect. Well, you don't ever, you never know who's gonna get in because like, you know,

Like say your your mom lets you upgrade your phone. Yeah going from the flip phone to the other flip the cooler flip phone

1005
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:17,120
Yeah, and it's like they refurbish that shit, but you know they could probably recover some of the data or whatever

1006
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,020

But you were talking to me and then you looked at Patrick when you said your uncle like yeah like cuz I was secret

1013
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,260
I feel like you two

1014
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:48,640
Honestly, I feel like you two gang up on me and make me feel like I'm this weird-ass kid all the time

1015
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,900
Even though I'm the fucking completely normal one and you two will probably never get even jobs or go to college

1016
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:59,740
Not true. We all went to college together. That's an offer God. I'm gonna go. I mean I

1017
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,740
It's right we're just kids are we we're just kids where what where are we?

1018
00:46:06,740 --> 00:46:09,900
Where are we we're at my uncle's house?

1019
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,540
He invited all three of us over

1020
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:17,260
listen, I just feel like you two could be nicer in class because

1021
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:22,820
You guys honestly are hella excluding me all the fucking time. It's bullshit

1022
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:30,180
That is not dude don't laugh at that little Lego helmet, that's mine

1023
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:31,760
- He thought it was a Lego helmet.

1024
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,580
- Bro, stop making me feel like this.

1025
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:37,260
This is honestly gonna lead to some

1026
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:39,700
developmental issues for me.

1027
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,740
- No, for real though?

1028
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,780
- Yeah.

1029
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,080
- I think I need to go home.

1030
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:44,180
- No you don't.

1031
00:46:44,180 --> 00:46:46,680
- Yeah, I just remembered I have to do homework.

1032
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,860
- You don't do homework, bro.

1033
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:50,900
It's the middle of the summer.

1034
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:51,740
- Do you ever know--

1035
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,860
- I mean, I have to get into my summer reading.

1036
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,540
- We're talking about Omegle and Chat Relay.

1037
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,500
Do you ever know somebody who made a good friend off of there?

1038
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:59,380
- I one time fell in love with a girl

1039
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:01,220
and then my little brother turned off the computer

1040
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:04,060
and I beat his ass for like an hour.

1041
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,900
- What up with the girl?

1042
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:06,620
- I fell completely in love and she was like literally

1043
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,660
two digits into giving me her phone number

1044
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,820
so that we could continue texting

1045
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,980
and we could maybe fall in love

1046
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:13,420
and actually have a marriage.

1047
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,260
- Yeah.

1048
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,500
- And now I'm with this other fucking bitch you guys.

1049
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,860
(laughing)

1050
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,260
So obviously it didn't work out.

1051
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,340
Sucks.

1052
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:21,180
I think about her every day.

1053
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,860
- I knew a few people who were like

1054
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:27,100
friends with people for like life.

1055
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:27,940
That they met off of--

1056
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:28,780
- Off of Omegle?

1057
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:32,780
Oh, they died? Yeah, they weren't friends for life then, you fucking asshole.

1058
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:34,780
They still have time to break the friendship.

1059
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,780
You're such a no-it-all.

1060
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,780
In what world?

1061
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:39,780
You're just a no-it-all just now.

1062
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,780
You're mad that I skipped grades.

1063
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,780
Yeah, skipped grades backwards.

1064
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,780
You skipped backwards.

1065
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,780
That's called being held back, actually.

1066
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:49,780
And don't say that I'm a no-it-all for knowing that.

1067
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,780
I need someone to hold me back right now.

1068
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,780
I almost got held back twice.

1069
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,780
Where are you actually?

1070
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:58,060
First time, first time, kindergarten.

1071
00:47:58,060 --> 00:47:59,340
I almost got held back.

1072
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,180
- You didn't get held back in kindergarten, dude.

1073
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,420
- So you didn't get held, you almost got held back.

1074
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,260
- They were like, "We're thinking maybe."

1075
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:04,100
- Your mom didn't say that 'cause you were in the way.

1076
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,420
- And then my mom was like, "No."

1077
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,500
- She said, "Let him through."

1078
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:10,740
- Yeah, and then fifth grade, we had a meeting.

1079
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,100
- That ruins you forever.

1080
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,940
- I didn't wanna skip a grade because I didn't.

1081
00:48:13,940 --> 00:48:17,220
- Fifth grade, we had a meeting with the principal

1082
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,780
because they were like, "He doesn't do any of his homework,

1083
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:20,900
"so we have to keep him back."

1084
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,340
And then my mom was like, "Yeah, he doesn't want

1085
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,420
"to do his homework, he's a kid."

1086
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,500
- That's like evil to hold a kid, but that's like, I mean--

1087
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:29,340
- Of course he's not gonna do it.

1088
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,740
- That's the biggest like stupid mom excuse.

1089
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,140
Of like, "Uh, he's a kid,

1090
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,940
"no he's not gonna do his homework."

1091
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,820
- But I just remember how people would treat

1092
00:48:39,820 --> 00:48:40,940
kids who got held back.

1093
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:41,780
- No, I know.

1094
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:42,620
- Yeah.

1095
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,440
- I think that's why--

1096
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,380
- That's Frankenstein's monster.

1097
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,580
- That's why my mom didn't want me to get held back.

1098
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,420
But I think--

1099
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,240
- You can't hold a kid.

1100
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,160
- In hindsight, Bob--

1101
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,620
- I remember Bob got held back.

1102
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,100
- In hindsight, I probably should have.

1103
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:54,940
- Probably shit-hoof.

1104
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:55,780
- Probably should have.

1105
00:48:55,780 --> 00:48:56,620
- Probably should have.

1106
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:57,440
- Probably should have.

1107
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,280
(laughing)

1108
00:48:58,280 --> 00:48:59,580
- Probably should have.

1109
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:00,860
- Well your life would be completely different.

1110
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:02,220
I wouldn't know you, he wouldn't know you.

1111
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:04,700
He might know you, but you would have been too young for me.

1112
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:05,540
- Yeah.

1113
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:06,360
- Yeah.

1114
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,140
- But I could have explained, oh I'm the same age.

1115
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:08,980
- Yeah.

1116
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,380
- I only hung out with kids my own grade.

1117
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:12,220
- Yeah.

1118
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:13,580
- Pretty much my entire life.

1119
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,980
- I'm younger grade than you.

1120
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:16,140
- You are not a gunger grade.

1121
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:16,980
- I'm a gunger grade than you.

1122
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,460
- See, that doesn't even make sense.

1123
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:19,300
Well you and me had a job together.

1124
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,420
- That's true, yeah.

1125
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,260
You are one grade below.

1126
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:22,780
- I just proved you wrong.

1127
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:23,780
You are a grade below.

1128
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:24,780
You are a grade below.

1129
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,780
Yeah.

1130
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:26,780
That is embarrassing.

1131
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:27,780
Damn.

1132
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,780
No.

1133
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,780
Yes, you're a grade below us.

1134
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:30,780
He's a little kid.

1135
00:49:30,780 --> 00:49:31,780
No, I'm not.

1136
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:32,780
You are literally a fucking junior.

1137
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:34,220
I'm actually, I'm like two grades above him.

1138
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,220
That's bullshit.

1139
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,220
That's true, yeah.

1140
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,220
That's true.

1141
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:38,940
I was, when I transferred into college none of my credits transferred over.

1142
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:42,780
Yeah, so he was still in fucking, yeah, he's a 13th grade.

1143
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:46,300
I was a, I just became a junior when.

1144
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,900
So you're a junior for life.

1145
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,900
When I was in.

1146
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,900
Do you ever think about going back?

1147
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,740
out I like jet like my credits finally rolled over some shit I can't believe

1148
00:49:53,740 --> 00:50:05,700
that I'm asking you this would you ever think about going back to college? No. That would be so crazy. Everyone else that I know like dropped out of college would be like like mostly

1149
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,620
like yeah maybe one day I would go back to college you're the only person I know

1150
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:14,140
for a fact you will never go to college. I'm not doing school work ever again. Yeah fuck that man.

1151
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:18,340
Yeah homework yeah you knew it's a tough homework that last year in college art

1152
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:19,340
art history.

1153
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,380
I'm trapped out of art history.

1154
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,380
Too hard.

1155
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:27,740
You know what, to get some kind of credit, I think it was like if I took this class I

1156
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:36,620
would get a double credit and I took East Asian art history and it was so hard.

1157
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,020
You have to memorize pictures.

1158
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:43,420
Yeah, I had to memorize the whole artist from the entire gloria period and she would sing

1159
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,420
them all in little songs.

1160
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:47,540
You have to look at all these pictures that are confusing because they're art.

1161
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:52,180
not just a picture of a thing, it's a crazy picture in a weird way. And you have to remember,

1162
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:57,620
okay, what's the name? And it's going to be an Asian name, if it's Asian art history.

1163
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:58,620
Like what's an example?

1164
00:50:58,620 --> 00:51:05,580
Oh, I didn't take Asian art history. So Patrick would have to give an example of this one.

1165
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,580
Yeah.

1166
00:51:06,580 --> 00:51:07,580
Patrick, give me.

1167
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,620
And then you have to remember, and then you also have to remember the year it was made

1168
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:16,100
and also the name of the artist, which is going to be Patrick, an Asian name.

1169
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,500
So what's the name?

1170
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,740
it's it's hard trying to remember that's not even English there's that painting

1171
00:51:21,740 --> 00:51:30,060
with the waves I didn't take the class you know that one I know that there was

1172
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:38,160
the Goryeo period and then you had a period around the same time I really do

1173
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:42,420
not remember a single thing from that well cuz I took I took um I took an art

1174
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:46,900
history class that was uh like Polynesian art yeah you remember I don't

1175
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,840
- I don't remember any of it.

1176
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,160
- Lilo and Stitch, mother fucker.

1177
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:50,000
- Yeah, okay.

1178
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:50,820
(laughing)

1179
00:51:50,820 --> 00:51:51,660
- Oh yeah.

1180
00:51:51,660 --> 00:51:52,500
- I'm trying, I can't.

1181
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,320
- The picture of the white shirt.

1182
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,160
(laughing)

1183
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,660
- Lilo and Stitch.

1184
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:57,740
No, that is actually fucking rude.

1185
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:58,580
I took history of--

1186
00:51:58,580 --> 00:51:59,820
- Well no, you know what actually is nice about that

1187
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,660
now that I'm thinking about it,

1188
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,300
is a lot of it, you don't have to know the artist

1189
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:04,580
'cause it's from like the 14th century or something.

1190
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,780
You know, it would just be like, they made it.

1191
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:07,620
- Yeah.

1192
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:08,940
- It wasn't a person who would just be like,

1193
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:09,860
yeah, they made this one.

1194
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,940
- Yeah, yeah, the entire group got credit for it.

1195
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,780
- They did this.

1196
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:16,140
I took a history of women in America

1197
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,580
and I kicked open the door, I said,

1198
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:19,420
what up hoes?

1199
00:52:19,420 --> 00:52:21,620
This is the history of bitches and hoes.

1200
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:22,620
And I got kicked out.

1201
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,220
Yeah, that's a shame.

1202
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:26,180
This is the history of fine ass women.

1203
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,020
And it wasn't, a lot of these women were ugly.

1204
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:28,260
Because it covered two credits

1205
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,060
and I was trying to speed my way through.

1206
00:52:30,060 --> 00:52:32,980
I was trying to like only do two years there.

1207
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:33,820
Yeah.

1208
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,820
I took Latinx literature.

1209
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,940
Yep.

1210
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:37,780
I think everybody took that.

1211
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:38,600
I got to watch that movie.

1212
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,440
I took that too.

1213
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:40,260
Yeah, I got to watch that movie.

1214
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:41,100
Not me, but not me, because I didn't want to.

1215
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:46,300
or what el norte I didn't watch that el norte good man or tape by el norte West

1216
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:53,500
uh-huh el norte and then we read some play about pretty fucking sure we

1217
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,740
listened to zoot suit riot by the cherry poppin I don't know what that is

1218
00:52:57,740 --> 00:53:04,140
what that is either but it's making me laugh that you're laughing we read some

1219
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:10,620
play we read this play about this called the cherry poppin that's pretty nasty

1220
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:16,440
that'd be a good name for a horse we read this play about a girl was only a head

1221
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,220
and this guy fucked her whoa that can't be true

1222
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:25,260
oh yes I don't know I don't know that's who I had to learn about he got head and

1223
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,840
he fucked her and he got into a lot of trouble for that actually yeah do you

1224
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:37,600
Diaz yeah. Bruno Bliaz. Juni Cortez. That's what I'd rather see. Latinx literature. The

1225
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:48,440
Cortez family. Juni! Juni! I can run. I love that movie. Oh my god the best part of that

1226
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,960
movie. The best part of the grandpa thing is when they they do like when he

1227
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:55,920
gets his legs back there like they're scanning him into the game and they do

1228
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:58,960
like a scan that's like a 3D wireframe of him in his wheelchair and it's like

1229
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:02,040
rotating and it has like the little lines that are labeling parts of his body

1230
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:06,240
and it says like "Grandpa useless"

1231
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:14,840
that's fucked up man. That's awesome. That's crazy. That's a good movie. Dude all those movies are so sick.

1232
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:20,320
I wanted to be teleported into their Hispanic family so bad. I re-watched

1233
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,000
them recently I re-watched because they're on Pluto TV I was watching like

1234
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,400
the second half of all of them. Dude, the microwave that makes the food. The McDonald's thing.

1235
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:37,040
Oh gosh. You put the aluminum foil in the microwave and then it blows up and it's a whole Big Mac

1236
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,840
meal. That's definitely giving you some kind of permanent bone cancer. Remember the little

1237
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:47,200
bug bot? Oh yeah. The bug bot was amazing. I got this Spy Kids toy as a kid. It was like

1238
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:53,040
the metal briefcase that they have. He gets handcuffed to it in Spy Kids 2. Had the bug

1239
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,040
And then a bunch of other gadgets

1240
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,960
Animals that were also big do you know what I realized this is

1241
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:05,080
The fucking that whole movie the second one is all like Ray Harry how like it's all like yeah

1242
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,900
Skeletons and then animals and stuff. I never realized that what are you talking about?

1243
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,800
Oh all the like old stuff. It's all reference old stop-motion stuff

1244
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:16,480
Oh like that old movie where they fight the skeleton Jason and the Argonauts

1245
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,680
I never really processed as a kid and I grew up and I was like that's actually a hell of a

1246
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:26,320
That's nerd service. Wait, there's a spider monkey in Jason and the Argonauts? Yeah. Well, no, that's from the just

1247
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:33,900
Spider half monkey. Yeah, he makes monsters. I saw a play in seventh grade. That was like two guys doing Jason and the Argonauts

1248
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:43,800
Comedic as hell. I remember I think maybe the theater can be funny. Hmm. Yeah, I remember the first play I ever saw Don Quixote

1249
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:51,040
Whoa, and I was like they got a new show for kids called Don Quixote and he's a puppet donkey

1250
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,440
- Isn't his whole thing that he gets

1251
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,240
that he wants to fuck as many bitches as possible on planet Earth?

1252
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:59,840
- He wants to throw a javelin at a windmill.

1253
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,940
- But he also is like fucking hoes.

1254
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,040
- Is that the... that's all I know, is that he fights windmills.

1255
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,840
- Yeah, that's all I know too. - Oh man.

1256
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,640
- I didn't read it yet. - Yeah.

1257
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,040
- They took us to a play, a field trip,

1258
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,740
and we saw The Monkey's Paw as a play,

1259
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:15,240
and I was kind of scared.

1260
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:16,840
- That's scary as shit. - Hey, it was because

1261
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:17,740
the only thing I want to see... - It was because they had

1262
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,440
thunder crashes and stuff. - The only time I want to see

1263
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,000
- I'd rather see a monkey's paws at the zoo.

1264
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:22,840
- That's right.

1265
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:23,660
- Take me on a trip to the zoo.

1266
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,540
- I'd rather see its hand than its paw.

1267
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:28,960
- What?

1268
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:29,800
- Are you for real right now?

1269
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,620
- Are you fucking serious?

1270
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,460
- Are you shitting me?

1271
00:56:31,460 --> 00:56:33,600
- I think the first--

1272
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,960
- I wish I had a button here that had a hand,

1273
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,920
a big hand comes out of here.

1274
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:41,120
- I remember the first stage production I ever saw,

1275
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,200
my mom was in a community theater thing

1276
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,960
for some play that was essentially--

1277
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,360
- You think Bad Mom's the play?

1278
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:48,200
- No.

1279
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,680
(laughing)

1280
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,680
- That's not funny.

1281
00:56:50,680 --> 00:56:51,520
That's actually not funny.

1282
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,000
- The movie Bad Moms.

1283
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,840
- You're saying that I had a bad mom?

1284
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:55,960
- No, I'm saying-- - That is not fucking funny.

1285
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,440
- I'm saying that your mom was in Bad Moms the play.

1286
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,960
- Is that like horrible bosses?

1287
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,040
- Yeah.

1288
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:04,480
- Bad moms and bad Santa, moms that like to drink wine--

1289
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,840
- You're actually gonna piss me off.

1290
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,520
You're actually gonna fucking piss me off.

1291
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,640
- If I was in a play, I would not let my kids see me

1292
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:11,600
in a play. - I'm saying that it was

1293
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,760
Bad Moms the play.

1294
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:13,760
- It wasn't though.

1295
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,200
It was some stinky cheese-- - What was it then?

1296
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,560
- It was like basically stinky cheese man.

1297
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:19,600
- Your mom was in the Stinky Cheese play?

1298
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,400
- It was basically the Stinky Cheese Man

1299
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,320
where it was like a bunch of different like,

1300
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:24,160
like the shit.

1301
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:24,980
- Come on little Caleb,

1302
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:27,280
come watch me in the Stinky Cheese play.

1303
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,680
- Hey Caleb, I'm the Stinky Cheese.

1304
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,600
- She didn't play the Stinky Cheese,

1305
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:30,800
she played Rapunzel.

1306
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,880
- I'm so excited.

1307
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,400
- She played Rapunzel, okay?

1308
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,200
She had to wear a giant hair extension

1309
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,240
and then we got out and my mom said,

1310
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:37,080
"How'd you think of it?"

1311
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:40,120
And I said, "They should make the Matrix a play."

1312
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,080
- How old were you?

1313
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:43,440
- 17.

1314
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,080
- No, I was probably nine or 10.

1315
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,200
- Yeah.

1316
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,880
Come on, this is gonna, come on little Caleb,

1317
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,200
this is gonna shape your perception of me forever.

1318
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,680
I want you to come watch me perform

1319
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,200
in the Stinky Cheese Man.

1320
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:55,600
- If you guys, if you guys, if my mom--

1321
00:57:55,600 --> 00:57:57,200
- My mom was in the Stinky Cheese Man.

1322
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,040
- Okay, first of all, the Stinky Cheese Man

1323
00:57:59,040 --> 00:57:59,880
is one of my favorite films.

1324
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,700
- I know.

1325
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,640
- Like how you say, like when you say your dad

1326
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:02,480
is in a movie or something.

1327
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,120
- It'd be terrible, it'd be terrible if somebody

1328
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,240
made fun of somebody's mom on this podcast.

1329
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,280
- I agree, because I don't make fun of your mom.

1330
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,120
- I'm not making fun of--

1331
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,000
- I make love to your mom.

1332
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,400
- Anybody's mom would make fun of the Stinky Cheese Clay.

1333
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,240
- But if my mom--

1334
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:17,240
He got so upset because I said his mom was in Bad Moms the play.

1335
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:19,240
Yeah because his mom was in a worse play.

1336
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:21,240
His mom's in a way worse play.

1337
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:25,240
She could have been on some one woman show where she's drinking wine and stuff.

1338
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:27,240
Okay, LMS for a rating.

1339
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
Patrick? Nope. LMS for a rating.

1340
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,240
I'm not gonna like that. Okay, I'm posting on your wall.

1341
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,240
So...

1342
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:35,240
dot dot dot.

1343
00:58:35,240 --> 00:58:37,240
You said that my mom was in Bad Moms the play

1344
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,240
when I was trying to clarify that she was in a

1345
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,240
play that was not the Stinky Cheese Man

1346
00:58:41,240 --> 00:58:47,000
not the stinky cheese man as at Cameron Fetter as at camera at my name my name

1347
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:55,040
is Cameron Cuddy as at Cameron Cuddy said he was she was not in stinky cheese man

1348
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:58,560
she was in a play that was akin to stinky cheese man and before you call me

1349
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:03,840
and know it all for knowing what a kin means when we're only three years old I

1350
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:11,120
learned that from the play because it was also educational it wasn't the stinky

1351
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:13,120
It was a kind of you remember in the sticky cheese

1352
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:32,020
Fine she was in bad mom. She was in bad fucking slut mom. Yeah, that's what she was in she played Katherine

1353
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:36,020
Rip off this smelly butter guy

1354
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:39,160
Such thing as smelly butter

1355
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:46,000
When we were when we were kids in my family we got like us like this spider-man VHS camcorder

1356
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,860
And we made it we tried to make a TV show and are my older brother my

1357
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:56,240
My older brother we made him play a character called fat baloney

1358
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,360
That's rude

1359
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:07,160
You know it was just making you imagine fat baloney guy the play if either of you two came to my house

1360
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:14,680
I'm opening the door and speaking of Spider-Man, I'm doing this silly string right in your face.

1361
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:20,080
Okay, well we're never coming to your house. Here's what happens, you hear the knock, you

1362
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,760
open the door, you spray out, you spray into nothing, we ding-dong ditched you.

1363
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,000
Yep.

1364
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,320
I have silly string that reaches hundreds of feet.

1365
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,760
And we have flaming poop on the doorstep too.

1366
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,440
And we have spy glasses that let us see through things.

1367
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,560
You would do that because you're stealing from a movie and you're the kid who's walking

1368
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,560
around saying, "Oh dear sweet baby Jesus,

1369
01:00:36,560 --> 01:00:37,400
you're ripping off Talladega Nights."

1370
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:38,680
- Yeah, I'm putting it on my Facebook status.

1371
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:40,600
I'm making Ron Burgundy quotes my Facebook status.

1372
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:43,400
- You rip off Talladega Nights at school all the time.

1373
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:44,960
- You've never seen Talladega Nights.

1374
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,800

1400
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:47,840
i've never even heard of this show

01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:49,840

liberty kids is the funniest

1405
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:00,840
I watch... It's a show they make you watch in fifth grade when you're learning about the Declaration of Independence.

1406
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:03,840
I didn't watch that, I watched the John Stossel program.

1407
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,840
You look up and you pull up a picture of Liberty Kids for Caleb.

1408
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:11,840
I watched the John Stossel program and I made my family computer's home page the US debt clock.

1409
01:02:11,840 --> 01:02:14,840
Okay? This is Caleb's favorite show.

1410
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:18,840
No, I hated this show. I've never even heard of this bullshit.

1411
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:23,840
No, I was doing... This is Caleb's favorite show.

1412
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:30,840
No, that's just wrong. It was not Liberty Kids. My favorite show was Adventures in Odyssey.

1413
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:36,840
You know what, actually maybe it was my favorite show. Now that I've seen that.

1414
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:41,080
Oh my god, we should watch Liberty Kids. Yeah, just put that on YouTube. We're gonna, the

1415
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,080
rest of the episode we're just gonna watch that.

1416
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:48,640
You guys have been such dickhead assholes to me. And I honestly-

1417
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,680
I'm telling your mom what you just said. I'm telling my mom that you two double bullied

1418
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:55,920
We didn't double bully. I can't imagine it feels like

1419
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,580
That must be so

1420
01:02:58,580 --> 01:03:00,580
So terrible. No

1421
01:03:00,580 --> 01:03:08,660
Back on this side there we go Caleb boy and Patrick gay guy yeah, you're in numb nuts

1422
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:14,540
You're a cotton-headed ninny muggins. You're in numb nuts. I love that movie. You're a cotton-headed ninny muggins

1423
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,080
I love that movie at Christmas, and I saw the unrated version of that movie - like five times

1424
01:03:18,080 --> 01:03:19,860
Well you are cotton-headed ninny muggins

1425
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:24,120
No, I'm not and if you say that again the principal's gonna overhear you cuz I'm gonna get him. It's not even a cuss

1426
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:29,380
It's literally not even a fucking cuss. I will be to the principal. Why cuz he's a Christmas elf cuz he's short

1427
01:03:29,380 --> 01:03:31,380
You're saying mr. Wolf is short. Yeah

1428
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:37,260
Cuz he is short. He's not I'm taller than him. Yeah, that's cuz you hit puberty earlier than us - okay

1429
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:41,120
So that doesn't mean fucking bullshit. I don't even care that you have pubes anymore

1430
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:47,780
It's not even impressive that you have yeah, it's not impressive that you have pews my uncle has

1431
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:54,800
stuff. It doesn't matter that me and Patrick are shorter than all the girls

1432
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:59,460
in the class. Whatever, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care. I'm gonna go watch my Transformers DVD

1433
01:03:59,460 --> 01:04:04,900
with the slipcover that I got for my birthday. Patrick, we did karaoke at the last music

1434
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:07,740
class of the year. None of the girls thought it was embarrassing that I picked

1435
01:04:07,740 --> 01:04:12,220
the "Who" as my song. Patrick, LMS for a YouTube video. I need to see a YouTube

1436
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:17,460
video. I liked it. It's called, it's called "How to Be Awesome," right? You click it.

1437
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:29,860
(Humming)

1438
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:31,420
You don't like it?

1439
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,540
You Rickrolled me and that's a type of...

1440
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,540
That's blocked.

1441
01:04:34,540 --> 01:04:37,340
I'm blocking you right now, bitch.

1442
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:38,500
Blocked on all platforms.

1443
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,420
Facebook, Gmail, your cell phone.

1444
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:44,180
You're not even going to see me on Sparktop.org.

1445
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,540
I'm hitting you up on my...

1446
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:48,420
I see you in class, I put my folder across my face like this.

1447
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,580
I'm gonna hit you up on RuneScape.

1448
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,380
I don't play RuneScape, I play Adventure Quest.

1449
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:53,460
We just drew a funny ass photo of you

1450
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,580
and Microsoft Paint in the computer.

1451
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:58,820
My friend, Peter F., actually gave me his Guardian account.

1452
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:00,100
Peter Fetter.

1453
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:00,940
Guess what I'm doing?

1454
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:05,100
You guys have set me off a very, very bad, bad, bad track,

1455
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,620
and now I'm gonna start drawing swastikas

1456
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:10,100
into all of the bathroom stalls,

1457
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,700
and I'm gonna eventually get suspended.

1458
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,940
(laughing)

1459
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:18,300
And my mom is gonna start making me eat

1460
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,540
natural peanut butter instead of the stuff with sugar in it.

1461
01:05:20,540 --> 01:05:21,380
(laughing)

1462
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,100
'Cause it hypes me up too much.

1463
01:05:23,100 --> 01:05:24,100
Yeah, that's right.

1464
01:05:24,100 --> 01:05:25,940
Fuck you guys, I'm outta here.

1465
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:27,180
- Fuck you.

1466
01:05:27,180 --> 01:05:28,500
- I guess this is the end.

1467
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,140
- You're a piece of shit.

1468
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:31,300
Fucking shit, man.

1469
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:33,260
- He's dropped his C4.

1470
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,080
He made it.

1471
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:37,060
- I'm gonna put some C4 in the classroom

1472
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:39,260
and blow you up.

1473
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:40,700
I'm gonna blow you up.

1474
01:05:40,700 --> 01:05:42,060
- You're not, you wouldn't dare.
