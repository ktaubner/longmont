What's up all my chuggers?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm trying to get that burp out.

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000

Foo!

00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,160
Ribbit!

19
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,880
I know it's a--

20
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,200
Beers we drank, motherfucker, with Juvio, Caleb, and Rex.

21
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,700
Beer.

22
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,200
Listen.

23
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,700
And--

24
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:37,700
And listen to the show.

00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,360
--and we're on the show.

26
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,400
Listen to this, guys.

27
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:40,960
I have a new--

28
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,320
I have a brand new sound.

29
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,000
I have a new thing.

30
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,920
I can do this up here.

31
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,360
Damn.

32
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,680
Oh, yeah, I forgot that Caleb can drink beer.

33
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,920
Well, but I made an exception because I am--

34
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,280
I'm just completely fine with having diarrhea tonight

35
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,520
because I have been wimping on the beer thing.

36
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,000
So I have a Gulsch premium, a Grosch?

37
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,680
A Gulsch premium Pilsner that comes with,

38
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,520
it has its own little bottle.

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,680
- That is premium looking.

40
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,920
- It has its own little bottle topper,

41
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,520
like a fancy restaurant water bottle.

42
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,720
- That's just gonna kill you.

43
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,560
- Let's see.

44
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,880
Yeah, that's not very good.

45
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,720
Yeah, that's not very good at all.

46
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,480
- How about you, Rex, what do you have?

47
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,160
I have a really cool beer.

48
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,680
It's called Coke Zero.

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,280
Mind you, everybody, Rex just woke up from his eight hour nap.

50
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
No, from an eight hour nap.

51
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,720
You have a, your house kind of has a Breaking Bad vibe to it right now.

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,720
I've asked Julio to like kind of figure out how to crop the room out of it.

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,820
I'm going to be doing the square crop,

54
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,540
but people can see kind of a little bit on the floor there.

55
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:00,620
It's getting worse.

56
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,020
My life has a complete shambles.

57
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:06,340
It has that same kind of vibe as Jesse's house in Breaking Bad,

58
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:08,620
where you bought a bunch of stuff,

59
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:11,420
but nothing that goes on any wall.

60
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,560
You just have big white open walls

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,220
where nobody like you would ever put anything.

62
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,260
I kind of have that right now.

63
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,260
You have that?

64
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,740
You know what I bought for this room to actually combat that?

65
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
Some of these boys.

66
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Oh my god, soundproofing.

67
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,740
That's what we call that.

68
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,540
I'm turning this shit into a studio.

69
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,540
That's amazing.

70
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:40,820
I'm pretty much becoming a complete professional.

71
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:49,820
I got a boom arm, I got a soundproofing, and I got a modello negra.

72
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,280
I hate ordering those, man.

73
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,280
Why?

74
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
A what?

75
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,900
I just don't feel that...

76
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:02,620
I also feel like the only places I've ever seen that beer be served at like a normal

77
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:10,420
dive bar or whatever is in Portland and in Bushwick.

78
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,500
Nobody sells that beer in North Carolina because they know that it'd be a problem.

79
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,740
Like guys would just be ordering it in the craziest fucking way.

80
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,820
It's not even a problem.

81
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:20,820
I'm in Mexico.

82
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,580
I have a bunch of these in my fridge because...

83
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,420
And it don't sit right with me.

84
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,180
Like two weeks ago, I had some friends over and they did that thing where it's like 2

85
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,380
AM and they would still just went out to buy some beers.

86
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:41,020
And I just got left with a bunch of beers in my fridge, which I'm not super enthused

87
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,860
about especially because I've never drank a Modelo Negro in my entire life.

88
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,860
They're good.

89
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,360
And now I'm gonna try them out.

90
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,860
All right.

91
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,860
Live taste test.

92
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,360
Tell us what you think.

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,360
Yep, that shit yummers.

94
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
It's okay.

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
I think it's yummers.

96
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,860
I think that shit is yummers.

97
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,860
Yep, that shit is yummers.

98
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,360
All right, Rex, what do you have?

99
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,860
I already said I have a Coke Zero.

100
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,360
You have a Coke Zed?

101
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,860
Yep, there's a mango cart in my fridge, but I don't know who it belongs to.

102
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,860
Hmm.

103
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:16,140
and then grab a mango cart.

104
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,380
- He's gotten in trouble before for stealing stuff

105
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:19,220
from the fridge. - Really?

106
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,260
- That's not his.

107
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,380
- That's not true, I've never been talked about.

108
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,740
- That's true, he told me about,

109
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:27,380
he got put into a predatory contract,

110
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,820
no, in a contract.

111
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,660
- Oh.

112
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,460
- To repay a salad that he took illegally.

113
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:36,460
- The salad contract, the 5,200% APR salad contract.

114
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:39,140
- Excuse me, what salad was this?

115
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,420
- Like a Trader Joe's pre-made Caesar salad.

116
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,980
And you had to pay how much?

117
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:47,180
$52,000 for it.

118
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,120
For a salad?

119
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,540
If I didn't replace it within two days,

120
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,300
I owed one more salad

121
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,180
and then it added another salad every week.

122
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,460
Oh, okay.

123
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,260
You know, so a 50, you know,

124
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,700
like a 5,000% APR salad, short-term salad loan.

125
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,540
Gotcha.

126
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,940
Basically a payday loan for salads.

127
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,340
Yeah, that's pretty predatory.

128
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,340
How many salads did you end up paying back?

129
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,180
One.

130
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,940
- You made it back in full pretty quickly, huh?

131
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:13,780
- I did.

132
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,600
- Pretty responsible guy.

133
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,500
- You'll never believe it, about 47 hours in,

134
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,340
I got my ass in the store.

135
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,180
- Just the--

136
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,000
- 47 hours.

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,840
- Right there.

138
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,680
(laughs)

139
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,560
Right under the wire.

140
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,300
- Right under the wire. - I like that.

141
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,140
- Came back with some salads.

142
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,840
- I used to steal so much food when I had roommates.

143
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,160
I would steal food all the time, dude.

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,360
- Well, I'm a nice guy. - It was so easy.

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,980
No, I'm a bad, bad guy.

146
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,180
You steal food from Neil.

147
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,480
I used to take so much food from Neil,

148
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:44,120
'cause Neil, he just thought that he was stupid, I guess,

149
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,320
and he would just be like,

150
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,040
"Huh, I coulda swore I bought some Campbell's chunky soup."

151
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,880
- Just gaslighting yourself on purpose.

152
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,160
- Yeah, I musta just not.

153
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,600
And I go, "Oh yeah, I don't know."

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,280
And I just look in the opposite direction.

155
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,400
I'm a really bad liar.

156
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
- Yeah.

157
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,220
- I used to take that,

158
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,240
I used to take his Easy Cheese all the time.

159
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,400
- I don't know what's Easy Cheese.

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,240
- What is that?

161
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,440
- Sprite cheese, spray cheese out of the can.

162
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:08,360
The key with taking anything like that,

163
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,560
Like you can take all, if somebody has milk

164
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,700
and is your roommate, if somebody has easy cheese,

165
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,320
if they have salsa, anything that's in some kind of--

166
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,160
- Big container.

167
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,540
- Container where they can't see exactly how much is in it,

168
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,960
you can take as much as you want

169
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,040
except for the last serving.

170
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,320
People will only notice if it's unopened,

171
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,020
if they left it unopened,

172
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:32,320
or if you took the last serving and threw it away.

173
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,880
- I feel like the weight of it is also a big tell.

174
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,720
Like if--

175
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,380
How often, nobody has a mental,

176
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,680
like, oh yeah, I know exactly how much my gallon

177
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,520
of Fair Life chocolate milk is.

178
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,080
- I think if it's like, if you left it

179
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,320
like right after you opened it,

180
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,680
and it's like really full, and then you go back to it,

181
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,620
and it's like, I don't know,

182
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:54,440
like a quarter of the way full at that point,

183
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,160
I think you would be like, all right, this was not me.

184
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,000
- See, what I do-- - But if it's like

185
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,280
somewhere in the middle there,

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,640
I think you could get away.

187
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:03,960
- That's fine. - When I used to steal

188
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,560
like food from Neil.

189
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,800
I just did like the vodka trick

190
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,000
that you did with your parents' vodka.

191
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,040
I just filled it back up with water.

192
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,480
You filled the chocolate milk with water?

193
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,280
Well, chocolate milk, salsa.

194
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,520
If he had Lunchables, I'd open up the Lunchable,

195
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,600
I'd eat just the crackers and then replace it with water.

196
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,400
And he basically had no idea.

197
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,880
He just would--

198
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,000
I felt like I didn't buy the water Lunchables.

199
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
Yeah, he's like, "You gotta stop making

200
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,600
these water and cheese Lunchables.

201
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,440
It doesn't even make sense."

202
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,560
I fucking hate these water bowls.

203
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,040
And I said, "God, dude, you know what?

204
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,080
That probably has something to do with fucking Michelle Obama.

205
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,200
And then he would get so angry thinking about Michelle Obama,

206
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,920
they completely forget about his water Lunchable. Yeah.

207
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,560
Water and cheese Lunchable. That's for a dog. Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

208
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,160
That's a pretty good idea for a dog actually. Yeah. No. Speaking of dogs,

209
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Phil has yesterday, Phil peed not once,

210
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,120
but twice inside the house.

211
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,840
Inside the house. Unfortunately he's been put down now. I don't,

212
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,920
I thought about it. I thought about it heavily yesterday. Very heavily.

213
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,760
I thought about completely killing my own dog.

214
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,620
I think we need to look at the circumstances.

215
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,400
Well, what was the context here?

216
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,260
Did he get really scared?

217
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,900
OK. Yeah, I wanted to see if he could pee.

218
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,740
I was giving him a bunch of green tea to see what would happen.

219
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:19,140
Yeah, I was feeding him five hour energies

220
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,940
that we wrote over and over again and then big bottles of Gatorade.

221
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,720
And then it turns out he peed.

222
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,840
Hmm. No, he was just being a bitch, man.

223
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,720
He's just being a bitch ass dog.

224
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:33,160
And I just, it just, he was on my last nerve, I'll say that.

225
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,660
And I don't want to go any further than that because he might hear me.

226
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,400
He's in the other room.

227
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,560
Well, his time is coming to grow up soon, right?

228
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,400
His time is coming to grow up.

229
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,300
Yeah.

230
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,360
Like a year in, a year in or two years in, maybe they stop becoming,

231
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,080
they stop being puppies and they get a job.

232
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,520
Yeah.

233
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,320
He, I'm hoping, I'm hoping that I'm going to be an empty nester pretty soon here.

234
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,920
And he'll finally start fucking leaving at least during the day.

235
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,560
Yeah.

236
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,920
That's the nice thing about a cat is that cats mature.

237
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,460
Cats have a curve to them.

238
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,000
Dogs start off as babies and you have to take care of them

239
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,040
and watch every single thing that they do.

240
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,080
And then they get a little bit less.

241
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,880
But then when they're old, they get even worse than they were at the beginning.

242
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,580
Now and then, like, you know, you ever do that thing

243
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,920
where you go over to somebody's house?

244
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,340
I hate this. You go to somebody's house.

245
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,360
And they have an old dog and you go, Oh, what's up?

246
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,620
Hey there, old timer. Nice to meet you.

247
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,720
You bend over to pet him and they say, Oh, no, don't pet him.

248
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,660
He has cancer in his entire body.

249
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,340
If anything he does hurts him, don't even look at him actually.

250
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,180
Don't breathe.

251
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:35,100
If he moves himself, he's going to start internally bleeding.

252
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,940
That is not, I don't know.

253
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,380
I've never experienced that.

254
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,820
You know what's the worst part about seeing an old dog at someone's house?

255
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,740
Well, the worst part is like when they're just like pissing and shitting everywhere

256
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,580
and they just have like piss and shit in their ass all the time.

257
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,060
And it just stinks.

258
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:52,780
Yeah. Everywhere.

259
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,980
And you're supposed to be like, oh, hello, puppy.

260
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,100
Yeah, I actually like it.

261
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,300
Guys, thanks for having me over.

262
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,140
Oh, take couch is that I had this

263
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:04,040
miniature pincher who was blind.

264
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,300
He had diabetes.

265
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,500
They always go blind.

266
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,380
They went. He's completely blind.

267
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:12,780
And he had he was incontinent, so I had him in a diaper.

268
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:16,320
But he was like daredevil

269
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,520
because I had to give him like insulin.

270
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,720
And but he like had like a sixth sense to know

271
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,860
and I was going to stab him in the neck with a needle.

272
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,920
So he would like dodge it like in midair.

273
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,860
He was like literally just like he looked like the resident evil

274
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,460
dog.

275
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,660
Like he was just like bones just bones straight up.

276
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:35,560
So you'd like stab him into like his neck, which is like this

277
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,160
thick.

278
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,460
It's just like he would just jump like move back at the last

279
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,160
possible second.

280
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,160
He would feel the force of the needle coming towards him and

281
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,560
then he would bite at his diaper and he would like bite his

282
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,260
penis from outside the diaper.

283
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,860
Like he was like trying to get the last bit of taco and let

284
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,860
(laughter)

285
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,860
and he gave himself like

286
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,860
diaper rash

287
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,860
(laughter)

288
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,860
(laughter)

289
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,860
it just

290
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,860
(laughter)

291
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
it was crazy

292
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,860
and he would piss himself like 9 times a day

293
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,860
(laughter)

294
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,860
oh my god man

295
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,860
he was awesome

296
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,860
and he lived 20 years after that

297
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,860
he lived like 2 years

298
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:30,100
only died when I moved and then just like I missed you so much I moved I put him

299
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,580
in the fucking bathroom and then I came home I was like hey why aren't you

300
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:40,000
moving and it just you know I was like all right well he completely had died he

301
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,820
had completely died yeah completely just his body finally shut down

302
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,820
R.I.P.

303
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:46,980
What's his name?

304
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,540
Cash.

305
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,540
I adopted him.

306
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,540
That's so money.

307
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,540
He had a dog named Cash.

308
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,540
It wasn't my dog.

309
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,060
Like I didn't, I only had him for like a year, right?

310
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,060
Like I adopted him.

311
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,860
He was already fucked.

312
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,180
So you didn't even love him?

313
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,740
I liked him a lot actually.

314
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
I thought he was great.

315
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:04,740
He was a good dog?

316
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,740
He was a good dog.

317
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,700
Right, he was yours or he was like a family dog?

318
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,700
No, he was just some random dog.

319
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,360
- Okay. - Lived in my ex's apartment complex

320
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,660
and they were just like trying to throw him out

321
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,300
with the trash basically.

322
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,800
They were like trying to get him to run away

323
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,900
but he was too blind to leave the porch.

324
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,380
- And you said, dog named Cash.

325
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,980
I know the perfect place for you.

326
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:24,820
- Give me that, yeah.

327
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,460
- My house, my family's house for some reason.

328
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:30,900
- I had an apartment at the time.

329
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,300
- That's very sweet.

330
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,820
Did you guys ever have any smaller pets?

331
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,620
You ever have any lizards or?

332
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,020
- I still have turtles.

333
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,020
You have turtles?

334
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,360
I had turtles.

335
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,020
Oh, what happened to them?

336
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:45,120
Um, I know.

337
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,920
I don't want to know.

338
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,180
They probably flew away into soup.

339
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,080
They went away.

340
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,620
Probably.

341
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,820
I had a turtle.

342
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,920
I ran into a pot.

343
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,720
I had a box turtle.

344
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:56,920
That I got from the ground

345
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,180
outside of my house.

346
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:58,760
Yeah.

347
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,060
And it just and I was like,

348
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,360
I'm going to save this turtle.

349
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,180
And it just pretty much instantly died.

350
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:05,180
Me and my brother used to

351
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,620
we used to go, we should go

352
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,720
like look for snakes.

353
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,620
Me and my older brother,

354
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,860
we go look for snakes cause I live near a swamp and uh,

355
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:14,740
but we didn't know which ones were poisonous and which ones weren't.

356
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,300
So we would hunt,

357
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:20,980
we would catch the snake first and then we would walk over from the swamp over to

358
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:25,540
my mom's house and we would hold up the snake in the front yard and have it like

359
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,140
right next to our heads and be like, is this one?

360
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:35,420
And a couple of times they were really badly poisonous ones.

361
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,340
So we just had to throw them as far as we could.

362
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,740
Yeah, you ever get a bit tight spiral?

363
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,880
I never got bit by a snake.

364
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,540
They're pretty easy to catch.

365
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,380
Yeah, they don't really have a stick.

366
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,180
That's the whole thing.

367
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,920
You just catch them with a stick.

368
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,540
Oh, and then you just grab them.

369
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,620
You slot you kind of like grab with one hand.

370
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,180
You slide your other hand like you're straightening them out.

371
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,480
And then if you just hold them behind their head,

372
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,580
then they basically can't do anything.

373
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,200
Yeah, like they can't, you know.

374
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,900
Yeah. Turn their head around.

375
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,600
All they can do is try and get you to eat an apple.

376
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,100
Yeah, exactly.

377
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,100
Which they would pretty often.

378
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
They could try to trick you.

379
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,580
They'd be walking back to my house and I'd say, "I'm going to show you to my mom."

380
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:15,420
They'd say, "Hmm, you know what else you should show your mom is this beautiful red,

381
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:16,420
shiny apple.

382
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,620
This waxy, waxy, delicious apple."

383
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,620
And I'd say...

384
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:21,620
Nothing bad will happen.

385
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,620
I've never even had that.

386
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,620
I don't even know what that is.

387
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,620
Where'd that come from?

388
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,620
Yeah, yeah.

389
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
These don't even grow here.

390
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,620
How did you even get that?

391
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:28,620
Yeah.

392
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:34,700
For small pets, I also used to have like a hamster, or maybe two hamsters, I think.

393
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,580
The funny thing is that they say that hamsters never just like quietly pass away.

394
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,240
They will die like from a horrific way.

395
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,820
And I'm pretty sure both of them died a crazy way, which is one of them,

396
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,160
I think, just got lost and just showed up dead one day.

397
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,460
And the other one, I think he got it's like like legs stuck in like something.

398
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,920
And he just got so hurt that he died of a heart attack, I assume.

399
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,260
Yeah.

400
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
That's pretty awful.

401
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,560
My roommate had a hamster and I'm pretty sure it died of like a heartbreak

402
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
because people just forgot it existed.

403
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,840
That's pretty sad.

404
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:15,280
My buddy used to have a fish named Booger that only ate boogers.

405
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:18,720
That he would just come in and he'd feed him his boogers.

406
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,280
And then I used to have two, I had two rabbits, two bunny rabbits when I was a kid

407
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,640
and we had them for a couple of months, but my dad thought they were so disgusting

408
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,200
that they weren't allowed inside the houses.

409
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,120
So they're outdoor bunny rabbits.

410
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:37,220
And they lived in a cage that like hung off of our like back porch.

411
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,700
And then one day, one day we like went out of town for a week.

412
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,760
And my dad hired the kid next door to like watch the rabbits and come feed him.

413
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,000
And he just didn't feed them.

414
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,800
And they just starved to death.

415
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,900
Jesus. Oh, I.

416
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,100
Yeah, it was pretty bad.

417
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,100
And we came back and there clearly had been like

418
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,700
coyotes or not

419
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:04,860
I foxes that like jumped up and like ate the meat out of the fucking crates of the

420
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,540
It was pretty terrible

421
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:08,940
Yeah

422
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:15,580
That's horrifying. Yeah, and we fed those boogers - we basically always fed we fed every animal boogers

423
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,820
Bill tries to drink my bath water every time I have a bath he like comes in

424
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,940
Oh, yeah, and he just like looks at me really crazy and just starts like

425
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,740
Slowly going down to like drink the to take a sip of the bath water

426
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,540
Here's another gross dog thing spill over lick the bed

427
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:41,260
Look the bed, what are you saying? What are you implying after you know after what do you after what sleeping? What?

428
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:47,940
The vigorous activity I know for you. Maybe it's not that vigorous, but you know like two three minutes of

429
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:53,020
Mild exercise on the bed. I don't know what you're talking about looks sweat

430
00:16:53,640 --> 00:17:00,740
Like jumping on the bed no, but when I shit my pants I let him lick the inside of my boxers even better. Yeah

431
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:06,580
He likes it when I have real bad swamp ass and I run a half marathon and then I come inside

432
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,920
This is for you or you know

433
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,660
Or the girl yeah

434
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,300
He prefer he likes me more. He's gay. You're a gay dog. Oh

435
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:20,140
It does have a gay dog watch your mouth

436
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,720
This is well, this is widely known maybe goes both ways

437
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,420
We're hoping you're hoping

438
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:30,180
He has a boyfriend named Luke. It's my buddy Eric's dog and

439
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,700
They always meet up and and Phil tries to fuck his face

440
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,820
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty

441
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:42,620
Hopping at least he's the top. That's right. That's why my son ever told me he was gay

442
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,060
I'd say you better be that straight up are you pitching or catching what's going on? Yeah

443
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,580
If you're catching, you're out.

444
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,580
It's over.

445
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,580
We're done.

446
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,580
I'm having a new son.

447
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:53,580
I'm proud of you.

448
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,420
I'm buying you all sorts of new stuff to upgrade your butt.

449
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,380
We're going to get you in tip-top shape.

450
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,180
We're getting you a shiny new asshole.

451
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,060
We're putting wax lips on your butthole and we're getting you back on that street.

452
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:11,860
We're getting you the new self-lubricated asshole.

453
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:17,580
Is there any other surgery to the ass that's not just making it huge, huge too big?

454
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:21,980
You can use surgery to make your ass hole huge.

455
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,860
Not your ass hole, but there is Brazilian butt lift.

456
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Oh, I see.

457
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,620
Which is becoming more and more popular as the days go on in this world.

458
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:37,260
One of her friends just told us about she had to get Botox injected into her shoulders.

459
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:41,580
And I'm just thinking about what else you could get Botox injected to make you feel

460
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:42,580
so good.

461
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,580
The most relaxed ass of all time.

462
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,000
- Isn't Botox, don't you get Botox for like a bunch of shit?

463
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,760
Like you get Botox for like if you go to like surgery

464
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,680
for a specific thing?

465
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,000
- I think it was like a, oh, new thing.

466
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:54,840
Hello, what's that?

467
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,660
- Yeah, I gave up on that beer

468
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,940
because I know it's gonna make me shit.

469
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,060
So I just got a normal white clart.

470
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,640
- White clart. - White clart.

471
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,200
- That's probably one of the biggest white clarts

472
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,380
I've ever seen in my entire life.

473
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,840
- Wait. - It's probably normal size.

474
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,440
- It's normal size.

475
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,680
(laughing)

476
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:11,240
- Don't hold it that way. - It's happening again.

477
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,320
- It's just a normal size. - Stop holding shit

478
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,160
like a baby.

479
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:16,040
I was remembering that clip from the Twitch

480
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:21,040
where Caleb held up a flower to show how normal size he was.

481
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,200
- I'm a normal size.

482
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,680
I don't, I'm not little in any way.

483
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,360
- Do you think that you're still--

484
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,560
- By the way, this is not a dollhouse furniture bed.

485
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,920
- No, I'm sure it's not.

486
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,080
Do you think you're still gonna grow some

487
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,400
in the coming years?

488
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,140
- Man, it's so funny you say that.

489
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,200
I say probably every nine months I get a pain in my legs

490
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,860
and I go, it's happening.

491
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,320
It's fucking happening.

492
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:52,000
- See that's such like-- - The growth horror is coming.

493
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,080
It's happening.

494
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,880
- Yeah. - Well I'm hitting six too.

495
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,840
- I had that until I was like,

496
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,680
until like two months ago.

497
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,520
I would be like, yep.

498
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,880
- Yeah, so I got a couple years, I'm fine.

499
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,040
- Yeah. - Bryce, have we ever talked

500
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,800
publicly about your scenario?

501
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,200
Your, would you, would you rather

502
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,560
- You came up in New York.

503
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,400
- Yeah.

504
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,720
- I think this is a perfect space for it.

505
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,560
- I don't even remember.

506
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,640
I kind of remember.

507
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,760
I don't remember the details though.

508
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,020
(laughing)

509
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,960
Explain.

510
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,200
- Okay, so here's the scenario.

511
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
No matter what, you shrink five inches.

512
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,480
Would you rather know that you shrunk or not know?

513
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:38,220
Would you rather remember

514
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:41,000
that you used to be five inches taller

515
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,360
Or that you were always a little tiny.

516
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,480
- I don't really recall how this thought was born,

517
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,680
but I do recall that it was,

518
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,640
we took like a 40 minute just walk back to our Airbnb.

519
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,960
- Yeah, we were just walking.

520
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,400
- And the entire time Rex was trying to explain

521
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,640
this scenario to, I think, Caleb.

522
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,240
And I don't think you guys ever came to a consensus,

523
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,000
we just got to our destination and you guys stopped talking.

524
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,840
- No, the consensus was absolutely

525
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,760
that you don't wanna know.

526
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,680
- Yeah, but you would know.

527
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,880
Well, that was the fatal flaw of the hypothetical,

528
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,640
is that you don't want to know, but you will know.

529
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,920
No, you wouldn't know.

530
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,480
Because, what do you mean you wouldn't know?

531
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,400
Your shoes are smaller.

532
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,240
You're close, okay, so you're hiding behind

533
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,600
this coward's veil of it being a hypothetical.

534
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,080
How about you have some dignity

535
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,280
and be better at building out your logical situations?

536
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,560
Oh, I'm sorry, it's logical to shrink five inches overnight?

537
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,000
No, I mean a logical, it's a logic problem.

538
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,620
I think at the heart, this is a logic problem.

539
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,300
This can be expressed as an equation.

540
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,780
Yeah, what's the equation?

541
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,120
Five minus five plus.

542
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,400
Yep.

543
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,420
Plus what?

544
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,340
Yep, plus what?

545
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,940
That's the whole question, isn't it?

546
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,220
That's the entire fucking question.

547
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,140
I think it's a stupid scenario.

548
00:21:58,140 --> 00:21:58,980
It is really stupid.

549
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,740
And it's also just a thing that people under six feet

550
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,940
would just talk about.

551
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,220
And I don't concern myself with these type of scenarios.

552
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,100
So I just don't.

553
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,260
Okay, well, here's one for you.

554
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,100
Would you rather be more mentally disabled than you are

555
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,460
or way more mentally disabled than you are?

556
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,340
And by the way, you won't know either way

557
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,700
because of how stupid you are.

558
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,340
You won't notice anything that ever happens to you.

559
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,640
You're basically a picture.

560
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,580
That's about what you are, is a picture of a person.

561
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,340
I am not a picture of a person.

562
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm actually quite smart.

563
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,020
Okay.

564
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,320
And I know two languages.

565
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,620
Solve something right now.

566
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:39,260
- I don't have like a puzzle.

567
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:42,020
- He looked around for a puzzle and he doesn't have one.

568
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,920
Guess what I have?

569
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,060
- That's a puzzle.

570
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,660
- You guys keep like trinkets and puzzles?

571
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,840
- Yeah, look what else I have.

572
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,840
I have an alien head.

573
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,820
See, you've melted your brain with video games.

574
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,780
You don't have a simple brain, man.

575
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,020
- This is a book.

576
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,940
- I got tons of books.

577
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,260
So many that I can't even reach for one right now.

578
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
Does this count?

579
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,260
A knife?

580
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,260
Yeah.

581
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,260
I mean that's smart in a different way.

582
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,660
You have street smarts, I can say that much.

583
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,100
I was thinking about that today.

584
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,860
About what?

585
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,660
About being street smart or being...

586
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:26,780
Would you say you're more street smart or more book intelligence?

587
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,180
I think I'm more book intelligence, yeah.

588
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:33,000
I think you are book intelligence, Rex.

589
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,220
I think Caleb is street smart.

590
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,340
I'm 100% book intelligence.

591
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,480
That's not true.

592
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,940
It is true.

593
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:40,940
I'm street smart.

594
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,620
Yeah, you got me and Rex flipped.

595
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,460
Yeah.

596
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,160
I do a street smart job and he does a book smart job,

597
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,860
but in our real lives, the people we really are,

598
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
it's flipped.

599
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:53,340
I'm a dork and he's a pussy getting animal.

600
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,380
I take it back.

601
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,660
You're both street smart.

602
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,540
Well, you don't even get to switch me to book smarts,

603
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,060
the one I want to be and you switch him to what he wants to be?

604
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,940
- Well, that's just the way he is.

605
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,780
- Yeah.

606
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,220
- I think you just have to accept where you are.

607
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:09,820
- Guess what I'm reading?

608
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,900
- What?

609
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,340
- Shel Silverstein, "Where the Sidewalk Ends,"

610
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:15,620
a book of collected children's poems.

611
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,500
So is that not a book to you?

612
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,340
- Why are you reading children's poems?

613
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,880
- Well, I'm not reading it, it's an audio book,

614
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:22,940
so technically I'm listening.

615
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,780
- Oh.

616
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,980
- Just do it, that was like a bunch of kids books.

617
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,220
- I'm reading a Good Night Moon,

618
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,720
well, technically I'm listening to Good Night Moon.

619
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,700
(laughing)

620
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,660
There's a lot of amazing stuff in it.

621
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,140
- Yeah, do you consider that reading?

622
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,980
Listening to a book? - No, I don't like

623
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,340
audio books. - No.

624
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,740
- I like reading.

625
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,240
I have a Kindle, but I don't even like it.

626
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,860
- I saw, do you know who John Carmack is?

627
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,700
- Yeah.

628
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,420
- He made like some posts today that was like,

629
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,180
I used to only be able to, okay.

630
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:54,200
He's the guy who made like Doom.

631
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,820
Oh, he was he do.

632
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,520
He did Rogan recently or so.

633
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
Yeah. OK.

634
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,060
And he's talking about how he used to listen to audio books

635
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,400
on like one point five speed.

636
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,500
And then he's like slowly trained his brain to listen to it

637
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,200
at one point nine speed.

638
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,160
He just yeah, it's great.

639
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,460
Helping the speed.

640
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,760
And that's not reading.

641
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,860
You're not you're not like remember anything at that point.

642
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,860
No, no, no.

643
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,260
I agree with you.

644
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,360
Yeah, I like I like reading really, really slow.

645
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,920
Yeah, that's how I prefer to read.

646
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,520
I read nice and slow.

647
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,400
I I'm really good at reading exactly.

648
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,460
This much of a book, can you see that?

649
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:38,800
Just this much, this much is that like, are you holding the front or the back?

650
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,740
This is the front.

651
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,240
This is the front.

652
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,200
Yeah, so this is yeah, yeah, yeah, 56, 50 pages into a lot of books.

653
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:44,580
I understand.

654
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,780
What's this book?

655
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,720
This is a thing.

656
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:50,040
Numena by Nick Land.

657
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,780
Don't worry about it.

658
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,160
- Mm-hmm, it's a gay book.

659
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,000
- It is a gay book.

660
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,680
It's a very gay book. - We gotcha.

661
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,800
We gotcha.

662
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,640
- I don't read books. - The thing is,

663
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,480
I really only do one, you don't read books?

664
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:02,880
- No, I think that's for nerds.

665
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,080
- And how would you say that you're book smart

666
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,320
if you don't read books?

667
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,600
- I've read books in the past. - See, you're not book smart.

668
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,260
You are not even street smart.

669
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,720
- Yeah. - Well, there's only two

670
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,160
different-- - You think you're book smart

671
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,880
just because you're not street smart,

672
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,040
but in reality, you're neither.

673
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,720
- Yeah. - I have to be one then.

674
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,920
- No, you don't. - I can't just be none.

675
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,240
- You're a brain nun, you're the first one who's none.

676
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,280
- That's not true, I'm looking this up.

677
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,440
I'm completely looking this up.

678
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,240
- Yeah, you're a full brain eunuch,

679
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,720
you've been lobotomized.

680
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,720
- What's the dichotomy between book smart and street smart?

681
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,400
- Is there a third option?

682
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,440
- The third option is neither.

683
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,280
- A third one.

684
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,100
- Yeah.

685
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,280
- The third option is you're just not anything.

686
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,560
- Yeah, some people are not book smart,

687
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,400
and therefore they like to think they're street smart.

688
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,240
- One, two, three, four,

689
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,000
there's actually like seven of them.

690
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,040
- Okay, I remember. - So someone asked,

691
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,480
what other kinds of smarts are there?

692
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,360
Street smart, for example.

693
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,200
So someone says, word smart

694
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,880
or verbal linguistic intelligence.

695
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,520
- Well, because you just said verbal,

696
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,560
I think that you're out on that one.

697
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
- Next. - That's book smart.

698
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,360
- Picture smart or visual spatial intelligence.

699
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,480
- Okay, that's just creative.

700
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,320
- I could be that one. - You could be that.

701
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,800
You could be that, maybe. - I think I'm that one.

702
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,840
Logic smart or logical mathematical intelligence.

703
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,040
- That's obviously me. - Probably not.

704
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,440
Body smart or body kinesthetic intelligence.

705
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,360
- So that's just being athletic.

706
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,160
- Yeah, music smart or musical rhythmic intelligence.

707
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,800
- I'm probably that.

708
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,800
- Self smart or interpersonal intelligence.

709
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,880
- Okay, so emotional intelligence.

710
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:37,240
- Right, yeah, I guess I'm emotionally intelligent.

711
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,800
- That's, all of that is cope.

712
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,640
That is bullshit.

713
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,560
- Yeah, I would agree.

714
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,400
- There's only two types for it.

715
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,040
- People smart, nature smart.

716
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,320
- Nature smart, that's the most.

717
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:49,160
- Or life smart, or existential intelligence.

718
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,000
- Yeah.

719
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,680
- Wow.

720
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,360
- Actually, I think I'm life smart.

721
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,360
- You think you have existential intelligence?

722
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,360
- I'm smart about the entire life.

723
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,040
- That's, no, that's book smart.

724
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:01,720
All of those fall under the categories of either--

725
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,640
- Yeah, there's books about every single one of those.

726
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,920
- Yeah, you're either book smart or you're--

727
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,560
- Well, books, there's a lot of bullshit books anyways.

728
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,400
- That's like--

729
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,480
- Now he's anti-book.

730
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,300
Are you hearing this?

731
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,820
are like you're autistic and you're high intelligence or you're

732
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:20,300
retarded and you're high interpersonal intelligence.

733
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,820
The reality is things.

734
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:25,860
The fact that we're doing this right now proves that none of us are anything

735
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,540
but just low value.

736
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,060
Oh, yeah.

737
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:34,580
People that like 400 years ago, there's no chance we would be living past 14.

738
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,940
We would be like as soon as we hit puberty and they realize that we were going to be

739
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:42,180
ugly, they were going to throw us all in a pit and nobody wants to fuck us.

740
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,900
We're bad, bad people.

741
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:44,940
We're like mistakes.

742
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,700
All three of us.

743
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,260
I'm not a pet person.

744
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:46,840
Yeah.

745
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,660
I would not be a pet person.

746
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,700
You would be used as a human ladder.

747
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:53,940
They would put you in carbonite and climb up you.

748
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,340
You would be a playground installation.

749
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,940
Yeah.

750
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,420
They would, they would not.

751
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:01,340
They would hang a little candy bar above your head and you put your arms up and

752
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,620
then they just flash freeze you.

753
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,580
Exactly.

754
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:03,900
Yeah.

755
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,500
That's what you would be.

756
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,700
You'd be used to clean out gutters.

757
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,060
I would be an alpha male back in the day.

758
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,740
You think so?

759
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,740
Yeah.

760
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,540
Is this modern world, this modern age, is destroying you?

761
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:24,320
The modern age has pretty much destroyed all my avenues, my opportunities to get any money

762
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,520
or love or friendship or kinship.

763
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:33,660
And I just have to resort to being on Discord calls with other men talking about how to

764
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,940
make money on the latest crypto NFT shit.

765
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:40,340
That is what we talk about all the time.

766
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,340
That's just me.

767
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,340
I'm always talking about that.

768
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,460
- I'm sick of us talking about the way to make money

769
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,820
on the latest crypto NFT, but--

770
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:48,840
- I just have so much money now on the crypto space

771
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:52,160
and women are not into that and I don't care.

772
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,340
- Fuck 'em.

773
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,180
- Yeah.

774
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,000
- They need to--

775
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,840
- They're not gonna make it.

776
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,680
- I was thinking today, you know--

777
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,500
- They're gonna turn around.

778
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,340
- Have you guys seen that--

779
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,180
- They're gonna have fun staying poor.

780
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,580
- TikTok guy, and God bless him,

781
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:05,820
that guy who's, he's in a wheelchair and he has a big head,

782
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:07,740
but he has like a very pretty wife.

783
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,580
- Mm.

784
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,180
- You know, have you seen this guy?

785
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,020
- Oh yeah.

786
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,320
Yeah. And he's like got a really good job or something.

787
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,720
He's like got a whole his whole his life is like amazing. Right.

788
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,820
I was singing yesterday about like it used to be.

789
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,360
We thought it would be dead.

790
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,800
No. Well, when you were at your lowest point in your life

791
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,660
where just everything was going wrong for you, you get fired

792
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,200
or somebody breaks up with you or whatever.

793
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,840
You could always be like, man, at least I'm not horribly disabled.

794
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,900
But these guys are fucking winning, dude.

795
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,180
Yeah, you're like this.

796
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:39,440
Worse than a guy who can't even use his legs.

797
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,600
I know, dude. It's like, fuck, that would be awesome now.

798
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,440
I'm like, that'd be fucking incredible, man.

799
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,960
I'd be out there giving motivational speeches and shit.

800
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,720
Yeah. My mom would be sending videos of me to people like, look at this

801
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,480
inspirational genius guy whose head is the size of a peanut.

802
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,440
And like that's that is the life, man.

803
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,720
Well, that's like that Iceland guy.

804
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,800
So I hope that's not offensive to say.

805
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,200
What I saw in the guy that's like the best.

806
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,640
We talked about that last week.

807
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
We talked about it last week.

808
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,640
Yeah, we talked about it last week.

809
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,640
Yeah, he's just like a multi-millionaire.

810
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
He's got a wife and kids.

811
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
He has a perfect life.

812
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
He's voted the best guy.

813
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,800
It's not like I want to fucking go run.

814
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,920
It's not like I want to use my legs.

815
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,200
I hate that I have legs.

816
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,520
My legs hurt from how much I haven't walked in the past three weeks.

817
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Exactly, yeah.

818
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,260
I walked down the stairs and I almost fell.

819
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:32,200
If I could go to the gym three days a week and skip legs and just never use them and they're

820
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,760
gone and I'm just like, I just have the most insane upper body ever and I still, I weigh

821
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:40,540
I weigh 90 pounds and I'm ripped because I don't have any legs.

822
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,380
That's ideal.

823
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:46,100
Do you think you can make it as like that type of like motivational speaker just

824
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:48,620
traveling the world, just speaking about?

825
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,180
I think I can motivate people.

826
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,580
I can do that with being bald.

827
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,500
Yeah, you could do that with being bald.

828
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:53,980
Yeah.

829
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,300
So now that I think about it, I'm a fool.

830
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,180
Can we get a sample of your speech?

831
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,540
That is legitimately being bald at your young age.

832
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,940
Hang on, let's see if I can get this bald speech.

833
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:04,620
Guys, guys,

834
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:10,660
Uh, well, it's more of a, I'm sharing an anecdote about my bald life.

835
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,660
So that's powerful.

836
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:16,020
You may, everybody looks at me and they say, man, his life is perfect.

837
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,660
His life is amazing.

838
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,700
He's the ball.

839
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,420
The, this bald guy's figured it all out.

840
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,900
He knows how to do it better than anybody.

841
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,740
Right.

842
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,420
But I want you to know, I want you to know this shit right now, all you people

843
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:30,780
holding onto your hair and maybe you just shave for the first time you're

844
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,460
getting nicks and cuts every single time.

845
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,100
Buddy, I'm three years in, and look what I did to my head.

846
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,940
(laughing)

847
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,140
Look at that.

848
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,580
Right in the center.

849
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,300
Right in the center of my head.

850
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,380
- It's like a horn.

851
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:48,700
- I put a horn in my head.

852
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,000
- You look like a dive bar.

853
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,460
- Pool cue, pool ball, cue call.

854
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,940
- Cue ball. - Pool call.

855
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,220
That's right.

856
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,500
Look at me, guys.

857
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,220
I look like a giant pimple.

858
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:03,020
I look incredible, despite.

859
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,380
You look like someone put a cigarette out on your head.

860
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,780
And let me tell you what,

861
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,140
if you think that I wasn't walking around my house

862
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,700
with a giant piece of toilet paper

863
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,340
hanging from the top of my head for about two hours,

864
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:16,420
you got another thing coming.

865
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,180
Yes, sir.

866
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,020
So that's what I would do,

867
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:22,020
is I would kind of just use my bald experience

868
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,300
to relate to other bald men.

869
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,700
You should just put like a,

870
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:28,940
what's the word they call it?

871
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:29,780
The fucking, oh.

872
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,500
A what?

873
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,700
A bandaid?

874
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,160
Yeah, you should put a bandaid on that.

875
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,160
I thought about it.

876
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,160
I was like, "You know what that is?

877
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,160
That's cowardice."

878
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,160
That's cowardice, right?

879
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,900
Because I walk around and go, "Oh, Pulp Fiction."

880
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:45,480
And I go, "Yeah," and not admitting to them the truth.

881
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,180
I'm trying to be more...

882
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:54,460
I'm trying to only tell the truth and give my 100% authentic self all the time.

883
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:57,980
And if I'm walking around with a bandaid on top of my head, what kind of message am I

884
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,260
I sending to these bald teenagers and preteens that listen to this show?

885
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:06,780
Very true. Yeah. I think if you go bald, you know,

886
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,060
your young age,

887
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,060
it's fine for you to get a wig or maybe like a horn or

888
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,100
just some sort of thing.

889
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,740
Like a realistic wig.

890
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:20,140
Um, no, it was like expensive wigs. Yeah.

891
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,500
It looks so good in that, uh, uh, final fantasy.

892
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,100
Or the orange one.

893
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,500
- The orange one, yeah.

894
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,600
- Yeah, a lot of people masturbated to that.

895
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,600
- Yeah, I think you should have like a year

896
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,440
where you just wear wigs for like a year or something.

897
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,160
- I legitimately think in your wedding photos

898
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,120
you should wear that wig.

899
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,240
- Guys, I've looked into everything, okay?

900
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,720
I'm not gonna, again, I'm not gonna lie to you

901
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,080
and say I've always been proud to be bald.

902
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,120
I've looked into everything.

903
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,320
When I first started losing my hair,

904
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,980
there's something called, they call it, it's a wig,

905
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,600
they call it a hair system

906
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,960
because men are so afraid of wearing a wig

907
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,600
that they call it a hair system.

908
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:59,920
And they're like, they make videos like, I just spent $1,200 on a brand new hair system.

909
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,160
And it's like, this is RuPaul, you're doing RuPaul.

910
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,720
But for like, I've got like a guy who works at like a sweet green, like that kind of look.

911
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,360
Who's giving a disgusting feedback noise?

912
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,200
It's really scaring me.

913
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
It's like kicking.

914
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Yeah, there it goes.

915
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,840
I came back for a second.

916
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:22,040
But yeah, I looked into that shit.

917
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,040
It's too hard, though.

918
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:28,320
Yeah, it's like a stereo. It makes it feel like you're like pimping out your car.

919
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:36,840
Exactly. Yeah, yeah. All of a sudden, it's basically like that, a hair system is to like

920
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:42,440
guys who are balding and want to change it, what like a tube amp is to guys who get into

921
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,440
like record players.

922
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,440
Yeah.

923
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:48,440
You know what I mean? Like it's that level of like, you're spending too much money on

924
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:51,320
this. Yeah, you're like, you're in too deep. You need to stop.

925
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
Yeah.

926
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,720
- Your wife is disgusted by you.

927
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,320
- Yeah, I don't want my bald-ass head to be my hobby.

928
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,640
I want it to be my shining strongest feature

929
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,520
where I walk down the street and people say,

930
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:04,720
"Fuck, I don't wanna ever meet that guy."

931
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,960
That's what I like.

932
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:06,800
- Yeah.

933
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,160
- I like that, when I had hair, dude,

934
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,440
people thought I was too friendly

935
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,760
and they liked me too much.

936
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,880
Now that I'm bald, people always assume

937
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,320
that I'm a really mean gay guy

938
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,040
and it makes me really happy.

939
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,960
- Yeah.

940
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,800
- I get way different goodwill.

941
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,400
- And you are a really mean gay guy.

942
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,200
- In more ways than you would really even imagine, yeah.

943
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,040
But-- - Yeah.

944
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:25,880
- You're gay smart.

945
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:28,720
- Yeah. - Guy smart.

946
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,980
- Guy smart.

947
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:32,020
I think we should just all get into wigs.

948
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,140
- Yeah.

949
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,260
- What kind of wig are you wearing?

950
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,180
- So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,

951
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,000
- So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,

952
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,840
- So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,

953
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,680
- So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so,

954
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,500
- What, I could wear a wig.

955
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,940
- Luchador masks.

956
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,780
- Yes sir.

957
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,740
- And I could start wearing a luchador mask

958
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,620
because then people, nobody knows

959
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,220
if I'm cut or uncut under that thing.

960
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:51,420
- Is that what they call that when you go bald?

961
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,420
- Yeah, I'm cut.

962
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,460
- Right.

963
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,300
- That's what they say.

964
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,120
- No, the problem with luchador masks

965
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,300
is that they get very hot immediately

966
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:00,660
so you can't really wear them after like 20 minutes.

967
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,500
- I feel like--

968
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,820
- It's funny that you know that.

969
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,940
- Yeah.

970
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:06,820
- This guy, you definitely are like,

971
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,340
yeah, your size, you should have been a luchador.

972
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:09,840
For sure.

973
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,840
I had luchador masks when I was a kid.

974
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,240
Whoa, do you like, did you like grow up liking luchadors?

975
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,440
Like it was like a, like how kids like wrestling?

976
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,540
Like it was my Marvel?

977
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,240
No, I like, I liked like wrestling.

978
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:28,740
I liked like WWE, I guess when I was a kid, but I don't, I never really cared that much.

979
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:31,640
Do you like it enough as an adult to make it a podcast?

980
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:35,940
No, nope, I don't.

981
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,740
We're not doing that.

982
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,340
We're not getting into wrestling.

983
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,740
Can't do it.

984
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:41,820
Yeah, I can't do it either.

985
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:48,260
I have it on good authority that we have an invitation to all go to Mexico

986
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:53,180
City to watch Lucha Libre whenever you guys come down here.

987
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:57,260
Is Lucha Libre a cartoon?

988
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,900
It's a thing.

989
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,540
No, you're thinking of Nacho Libre.

990
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,340
No, that's not.

991
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,140
Will he be there?

992
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,140
Someone who looks like him.

993
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,720
A lot of people who look like him will be there.

994
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,020
Really? That is the craziest movie, man.

995
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,460
Yeah, that is the funniest movie ever that they made that movie.

996
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:19,060
A movie where Jack Black fully is like, man, I got to be a lucha door.

997
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:21,900
I want to be a lucha door.

998
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,900
He got it right at the cusp that last year.

999
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,660
2007, 2008.

1000
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,900
That was the same year as like Tropic Thunder.

1001
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,540
Yep. Tropic Thunder.

1002
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:32,980
And he but he went in, but they actually cover their ass in the movie, though,

1003
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:35,540
where he was like an adopted kid.

1004
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:36,540
Yeah, yeah.

1005
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,100
Where they don't pretend.

1006
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,280
They also do that on Tropic Thunder.

1007
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,540
Yeah, but.

1008
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,700
It's a white guy who thinks he's black for some reason.

1009
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:46,280
You're right. Yeah, no, they do it on both.

1010
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:50,220
But if you don't watch the first 15 minutes of the movie, it just reads

1011
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,020
completely differently on both movies.

1012
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,020
Yeah.

1013
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:59,520
But on Nacho Libre, he's literally talking to the guy at the monastery and

1014
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,900
he's like, I'm going to have diarrhea.

1015
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,300
He says that shit.

1016
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,420
Yeah.

1017
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
God bless Jack Black. He does, dude.

1018
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I need to watch that movie.

1019
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Natural Ego?

1020
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Underrated performance in Tropic Thunder

1021
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
is Tom Cruise as a Jewish guy.

1022
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
I don't know why,

1023
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,500
but every time I watch

1024
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
Tropic Thunder or I see Tom Cruise

1025
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,500
in that Jewish guy costume,

1026
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
I always think of

1027
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Andy S. from Twitter.

1028
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,500
A little bit, yeah.

1029
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,500
I think liking that Tom Cruise scene

1030
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
at the end of Tropic Thunder, that's Reddit

1031
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
to like that scene.

1032
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Really?

1033
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
Which scene are you talking about?

1034
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,500
The dancing thing.

1035
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Oh yeah, I agree with that.

1036
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,500
You think it's Reddit that he's dancing?

1037
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
It's Reddit to like that scene.

1038
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
Yeah.

1039
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:44,500
Why is it Reddit to like that scene?

1040
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,500
Because that's where I saw that the first time before I watched the movie, was on Reddit.

1041
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,500
Reddit?

1042
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
You didn't watch that?

1043
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
A lot of news also ends up being pretty Reddit.

1044
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,500
Yeah.

1045
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,500
So like the election of Barack Obama, I saw that on Reddit.

1046
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:57,500
Yeah.

1047
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,500
And that was pretty Reddit.

1048
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
And it ended up being, yeah.

1049
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,500
So it's a pretty much perfect system that I have.

1050
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Yeah.

1051
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,140
Yeah, for you an avid Reddit user.

1052
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:08,620
Oh, my God. Yes.

1053
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:12,880
I can't believe you of all people didn't see Tropic Thunder organically.

1054
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,520
I didn't see any movies until I was like 15.

1055
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,220
I didn't see Superbad until I was 18.

1056
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,520
I didn't see Borat till I was 21.

1057
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,420
Wow. Isn't that wild?

1058
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,100
That is wild.

1059
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:28,300
You're like a one of those tribes that exist

1060
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,900
like untouched by modern society.

1061
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:33,380
I know, that's kind of how I felt.

1062
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,220
All I knew was--

1063
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,060
And he's still like that.

1064
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,140
He never watches any movies at all or any entertainment.

1065
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,380
Yeah, you fucking wish.

1066
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,220
You don't watch anything.

1067
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,220
You wish I didn't watch movies.

1068
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:45,060
Guess what I watched two days ago?

1069
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:46,100
What did you watch two days ago?

1070
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,780
A little movie called

1071
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,860
"I Hired an Assassin to Kill Me"

1072
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,820
by an auteur filmmaker named Mr. Beast.

1073
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,420
Have you seen this film?

1074
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,460
No.

1075
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,300
This guy--

1076
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,360
Please give us a detailed review.

1077
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,340
Oh my God.

1078
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
Letterboxdstyle, letterboxdstyle, five stars.

1079
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
I've seen it twice, I've seen it twice now.

1080
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:05,340
Okay.

1081
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,340
Okay.

1082
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
Alright, letterboxdstyle.

1083
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:16,820
There are some pieces of art in this world that grab you by the lapel and dare you to

1084
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:19,600
feel something.

1085
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,020
This is one of these.

1086
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:26,140
We open on the top of a moving train.

1087
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:29,340
Our hero, Mr. Beast, aka Jimmy.

1088
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:37,640
Yeah. Which in parentheses, it also turns out this is the filmmaker himself. Addresses

1089
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:44,120
the camera and explains the situation, which once he gets into the details, you might realize

1090
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:53,340
is quite horrific. An assassin, a trained assassin is hunting him currently. He has

1091
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:02,220
exactly 12 hours or has Jimmy says till the end of the day to stab him not with

1092
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:10,940
a real knife not a sharp knife but with a simulacrum of a knife a rubber knife

1093
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:17,380
okay that which he must bend against Jimmy's body okay the assassin is tied

1094
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:24,060
up with his two friends, with Jimmy's two friends on two carts behind Jimmy.

1095
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:27,300
They let him go, the count begins.

1096
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,140
First stop, a warehouse.

1097
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,880
Jimmy's hiding behind a mirror, the assassin finds him almost instantly.

1098
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,340
Jimmy gets away by breaking open a brick wall and barrels fly everywhere and crack the windshield

1099
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,920
of a sprinter van.

1100
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,300
What the hell?

1101
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,420
the assassin is in the building.

1102
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,860
Jimmy's friend Carl runs over his car with a tank.

1103
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,100
The assassin says, "It's as flat as a pancake."

1104
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,620
That's a direct quote.

1105
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:57,020
I honestly can't tell if you're being sincere or not.

1106
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,420
You could be completely lying about this.

1107
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,940
I think he's completely sincere.

1108
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,740
All of this is true.

1109
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:03,860
All of this is true.

1110
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,060
Next stop, a hotel.

1111
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,980
And you may be saying, "Hmm, what, a Best Western?

1112
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,980
15 rooms?"

1113
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:13,980
- Buddy, no, 25 floors with at least 10 rooms on each floor.

1114
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,420
And guess who's in one of the rooms?

1115
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:18,700
- Mr. Beast? - Mr. Beast.

1116
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:20,660
- Well, there's no way they could find him in there.

1117
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,500
That's too many rooms.

1118
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:23,540
- Well, that's what Jimmy was thinking

1119
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,820
when he set up this whole thing.

1120
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,420
But he rented out every single room.

1121
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,320
The assassin walks in, he starts opening every single door.

1122
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:35,140
But right before the assassin gets to Jimmy's room,

1123
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:37,580
Jimmy escapes in a hidden elevator

1124
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,360
that he hid behind a fake wall.

1125
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,400
Next stop is a bank.

1126
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,120
They go into the bank, he locks the assassin into a vault,

1127
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,880
he pulls the vault out of the brick wall,

1128
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,100
and then at the end, for absolutely no reason,

1129
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:51,080
they blow up the bank with actual bombs

1130
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:53,120
and the whole thing explodes.

1131
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:54,160
- What the fuck?

1132
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:56,800
- The climax of the movie, coming up right now.

1133
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,680
Jimmy sets up an entire carnival.

1134
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:03,080
There's rides, there's booths, there's roller coasters,

1135
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,880
but he gets there before the assassin.

1136
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:09,480
Because of his time advantage, he stages an entire scene.

1137
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,240
Oh no, Jimmy was climbing up onto one of the rides,

1138
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,360
he fell off, he broke his ankle.

1139
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,040
The production is halted.

1140
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:18,920
All of the actual production cameras are hidden.

1141
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:23,720
And the only cameras left on set are like little spy cameras.

1142
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:27,600
So they tell the assassin, sorry, the video's over.

1143
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,880
Jimmy broke his ankle, rather,

1144
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,040
and he's on that stretcher over there.

1145
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:35,760
and they have him in a splint.

1146
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:39,440
And the assassin walks over and as he walks over,

1147
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,920
he twists the tip of the knife, the rubber knife,

1148
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:46,640
against his index finger like this, right?

1149
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,660
And he says, "What happened?"

1150
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,840
And Jimmy goes, "Broke my ankle."

1151
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,580
The assassin cold as ice.

1152
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,040
"All this for a broken ankle, huh?

1153
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:56,920
I'm not buying it."

1154
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:59,080
Stabs him in cold blood right there.

1155
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,520
- Yeah, dude.

1156
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:03,720
And the assassin makes $100,000.

1157
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:07,160
- Wait, what?

1158
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,840
They paid an actual killer money?

1159
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:13,840
- He was like a guy who used to work for the CIA.

1160
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:14,680
- Yeah, okay.

1161
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,960
- He used to be like a guy who would kill

1162
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:19,760
like a random mercenary contract killer dude.

1163
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,040
And like a real, this guy's actually a monster.

1164
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,360
You can tell in the video that he's a monster

1165
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:26,480
because he does certain things where you're like,

1166
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,000
this is not your first time doing this.

1167
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:30,660
where when he's in the hotel, he kicks open all the doors,

1168
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:32,300
but he kicks them open in this weird way

1169
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:35,400
that I've never seen anybody kick open a door in anything,

1170
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,200
where he like looks away from the door

1171
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,360
and he like donkey kicks it

1172
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,320
like two feet underneath the handle.

1173
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Every single time he opens like 10 doors like this.

1174
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,800
And it's like, dude, that's,

1175
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,240
this guy has done this way too many times before.

1176
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,520
And also he's wicked smart

1177
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,360
because he knew that Jimmy was actually fine

1178
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,600
and did not have a broken ankle,

1179
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,440
but it really blew my mind.

1180
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:56,760
It really was one of their better videos they've made.

1181
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:58,460
I don't actually want to watch that now.

1182
00:45:58,460 --> 00:46:00,120
It's really, really good.

1183
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,400
X killers and shit like that are always so insane to me.

1184
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:06,400
Like that one video that was going viral on Twitter

1185
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,460
like a couple of months ago,

1186
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,360
where it's like an ex assassin for like the actual mob

1187
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:16,400
just watching someone do like killing like kill clips on Hitman.

1188
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,340
Oh, yeah. And it's for Vanity Fair.

1189
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:19,780
Yeah. No, it's not.

1190
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,840
It's like some like some like YouTube channel, like a random YouTube channel.

1191
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:26,480
And they're just like having me react like,

1192
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
"Yeah, so basically, I wouldn't...

1193
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,140
Me, myself, I wouldn't have done that.

1194
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:33,180
I wouldn't have thrown an axe across the room

1195
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:34,480
at a direction that someone said,

1196
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:35,820
because you could miss."

1197
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,580
I was like, "Okay, man, that's crazy."

1198
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,820
But then he just goes like,

1199
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:39,920
"Yeah, I've done that before,

1200
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,080
where I push someone off a building and they die."

1201
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,520
I was like, "Whoa, that's weird."

1202
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:47,820
- And all the comments are like,

1203
00:46:47,820 --> 00:46:50,340
"Why do I find this guy strangely charming?"

1204
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:51,540
- He's kind of funny.

1205
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,340
- He's kind of funny.

1206
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:54,280
- They should have him more.

1207
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,480
You ever seen the Iceman tapes?

1208
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,600
No.

1209
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,320
Dude, it's one of the best video

1210
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,480
or one of the best documentary series of all time.

1211
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:06,160
It's like four or five part HBO documentary series

1212
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,560
where they interview this guy, Robert,

1213
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,720
suddenly find his name, the Iceman.

1214
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,480
Anyway, he was this guy,

1215
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,960
it's called the Iceman Tapes Conversations with a Killer,

1216
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,760
Richard Kuklinski, former hitman.

1217
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,440
serves two life sentences for murder after admitting he killed over 200 people.

1218
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,720
So this guy got booked.

1219
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:33,720
He was like a mafia guy who got booked for like maybe two murders or three

1220
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:37,680
murders or something as a hit man. And then as soon as he got in jail,

1221
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,600
he said that he killed like, he actually killed like 10 people.

1222
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,640
And then HBO did this documentary with him.

1223
00:47:43,640 --> 00:47:48,720
And then he admits to killing like 200 people, but they're clear.

1224
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,920
Most of them are clearly lies where he just will like tell these stories.

1225
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:56,200
He was like, "So the guy was as small as an ant."

1226
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:02,200
And I caught him, I picked him up by his little shirt and I swallowed him whole with one bite

1227
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,040
like the giant from Jack and the Beanstalk.

1228
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:09,560
And they're shooting it all dramatic and they have a dun-dun.

1229
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,560
And he's like, "The next guy."

1230
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:12,240
His blood was as red as an apple.

1231
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
Yeah.

1232
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:14,240
"The next guy."

1233
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,020
I stabbed him in cold blood.

1234
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:23,260
before me, he turned into an alien and vaporized away and was clearly abducted by...

1235
00:48:23,260 --> 00:48:28,540
Like he just has these crazy stories where everything ends with, "I was this close to

1236
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:29,540
die."

1237
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,540
There's movie stories.

1238
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:35,780
He literally, he tells stories that are just straight up taken from James Bond movies.

1239
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:40,460
And he just makes himself sound like the coolest, most badass guy of all time.

1240
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,500
And he calls himself the Iceman.

1241
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:48,660
I think even a couple of mafia people like openly were like, yeah, I don't think like

1242
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:50,660
he didn't do a lot of stuff.

1243
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,420
He's just like like he worked for the mafia.

1244
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:56,420
He killed some people, but he wasn't like this crazy.

1245
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:01,380
He wasn't a demon, but he basically like portrays himself as a demon.

1246
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:06,020
It's the same thing that happened with the the guy, the Irishman, the Irishman is based

1247
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,760
off of where he he didn't actually kill Jimmy Hoffa.

1248
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,700
just like made it up at the like right before he died.

1249
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,260
Pretty smart.

1250
00:49:15,260 --> 00:49:18,700
Yeah, I'm kind of sick of like that medium, honestly.

1251
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,840
Mafia movies?

1252
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:21,160
The Netflix movie.

1253
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,160
No, like the documentary like a mini show.

1254
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,600
I think it's like so overdone and it's so annoying.

1255
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,240
I hate reality.

1256
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:33,300
It's so no, it's always like they build it up like this is going to be

1257
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,700
the craziest thing of all time.

1258
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:39,240
And it's just like, oh, it's just like this guy who just killed a bunch of women.

1259
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,440
Did you ever watch the videos of those?

1260
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:46,040
A guy that like he's like a he's like the capo of like the

1261
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:52,540
Colombo family name like got out and then he gets into like YouTube

1262
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:56,740
like podcast beefs with like really old like mob guys different

1263
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,640
crime families.

1264
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,340
Awesome.

1265
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:00,840
He's very funny.

1266
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:03,640
He like he was like really big in the 80s and 90s.

1267
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:08,440
He ran like a gas scheme like a gas siphoning scheme all along the

1268
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,160
East Coast.

1269
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:15,840
And then he like went to prison for 10 years and then like got

1270
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:19,840
out and then he just goes on like lad Bible and shit like

1271
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:20,280
that.

1272
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,960
And he's like, Yeah, I thought they were gonna fucking kill me.

1273
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:32,040
He's dope dude. He's awesome, man. My favorite one of those

1274
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:36,960
like documentary like stories is like the the Tinder Schindler

1275
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:39,500
Oh, that dude was awesome.

1276
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,500
That guy is the GOAT.

1277
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:45,680
Basically, I don't know if you've seen this, Kilo, but basically some guy in Europe, he

1278
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,440
would just like swindle this women all across Europe.

1279
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,240
He would just be on Tinder.

1280
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,100
He portrayed himself as being some sort of millionaire.

1281
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:58,960
He got money from I think some jewelry shop or whatever from his family.

1282
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,960
Just some lie like that.

1283
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,880
And he would just go out with women.

1284
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,960
He would show them this insane, lavish lifestyle.

1285
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:08,520
He would just keep texting them and like only seeing them like once every,

1286
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:13,600
every so, so many weeks. Uh, and at some point he would just like, be like, Oh my God,

1287
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,000
my enemies are after me and I need some fucking money. Uh,

1288
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,440
and then we'll just give him money. Yeah. He was like,

1289
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:25,000
my office pulled up and they fucking show my bodyguard and it was just like show

1290
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:28,120
him like the same pictures every time. And he'd think that this is like,

1291
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:30,560
I don't know if it was like under hundreds of women.

1292
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:35,600
So he got a bunch of money. Uh, and the, my, I love that,

1293
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,840
that documentary because at some point,

1294
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,240
like there's a little bit of retribution

1295
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,520
because at the end, like one of the women

1296
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,440
are like figures out who he is.

1297
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,320
Like he, she sells like some of his stuff

1298
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,000
and she gets some money back.

1299
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,760
But he just like flees to Israel

1300
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,320
and like all the women that like lost all that money,

1301
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,480
they're just like, yeah, we're still owe that money.

1302
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,720
And it's like, okay, sick story, man.

1303
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,680
Like he just gets away.

1304
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:01,680
- Why does Israel harbor this guy?

1305
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,760
- Because he's Israeli.

1306
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,880
- Oh, okay.

1307
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,000
Just an Israeli guy.

1308
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
I didn't know he was just an Israeli guy.

1309
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,040
Yeah, I thought you said he was European.

1310
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,320
Well, it happened in Europe,

1311
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,320
but he was like an Israeli guy.

1312
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:16,880
He was also like apparently convicted in Israel.

1313
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:19,840
So that's why he just was like staying in Europe, I guess.

1314
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:20,680
I see.

1315
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,500
But he just like goes back

1316
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:23,840
and he like didn't serve like any time, I think.

1317
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,160
And he's just like still like posting pictures on Instagram

1318
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,800
of like dating a model

1319
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:30,320
and like being like just riding a Lamborghini.

1320
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:31,160
This guy's a beast.

1321
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,880
Talking to Netflix like,

1322
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:33,880
That is so cool.

1323
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:37,480
I owe American Express $100,000 and no one's helping me.

1324
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,440
And I'm like, oh, well, that's the end.

1325
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,920
So, yeah, that's my favorite guy of all time.

1326
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,220
And we're going to have a monsoon.

1327
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,560
Do you think that you could be a scammer for a social engineer?

1328
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:49,020
Yes. I could not.

1329
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,160
I don't think I have that in me.

1330
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:54,320
I'm too honest and friendly.

1331
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:57,800
I think friendly is actually I think that's something that those people are.

1332
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,540
Yeah, they're very friendly.

1333
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:02,360
I do love that movie with Tom Hanks and Leo.

1334
00:53:02,360 --> 00:53:06,640
Yeah, you got to not have a conscience to do it.

1335
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,720
Well, I don't know because I feel like for the most part, you're ripping off like, at

1336
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,760
least in that movie, you're ripping off like a bank or whatever.

1337
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:18,180
Like who cares?

1338
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,720
If I could press a button and steal from a bank, I would.

1339
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,480
Yeah, of course, who wouldn't?

1340
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,560
But it's just the whole thing, you know, you have to kill the teller, you have to kill

1341
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:29,680
the security guard, you have to kill two or three hostages.

1342
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,800
that's kind of where I draw the line as the third hostage.

1343
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:38,520
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you could still just strictly steal from like rich people who

1344
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:44,880
won't really miss it or like the bank, but you don't get to those leagues without scamming like,

1345
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:47,600
you know, the small guy first, you got to practice.

1346
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,680
You got to steal money from homeless people to get a taste of practice. What you can actually

1347
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:57,760
do is you can create a complete recreation of the bank with cardboard and you can hire

1348
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,400
or homeless people to occupy all the different places.

1349
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,300
And then, you know, if one of the you know, if you accidentally have

1350
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:07,500
bad trigger discipline and one of the fucking rounds goes off

1351
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,640
into this guy's abdomen or whatever, it's not that big of a deal.

1352
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:13,640
Yeah. Yeah. That's season two of the rehearsal.

1353
00:54:13,640 --> 00:54:17,880
Yeah, yeah.

1354
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:23,020
Nathan Fielder planning to he's planning out a mass shooting.

1355
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,820
These like central casting Tim and Eric extras.

1356
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,660
(laughing)

1357
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:32,460
They just like sit around in a high school.

1358
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:34,660
Yeah.

1359
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,740
(laughing)

1360
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:38,220
I don't know if I could scam a homeless person.

1361
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:39,060
Like, I don't even know how,

1362
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:41,380
but I would tell them to give me their $5

1363
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:43,980
that they just got from someone else.

1364
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:45,380
Like, what would you even tell them?

1365
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,640
I'd say, I'll double that.

1366
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:51,620
I'd say, I'd pretend it was, I was investing for them.

1367
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,340
Yeah. Yeah.

1368
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:55,740
I'm about to invest. I'd say it's penny stocks.

1369
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:57,540
You just had a farmer walk around.

1370
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,540
Who the fuck is that?

1371
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,380
(laughing)

1372
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,100
An actual yokel.

1373
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,460
- That's the guy we saw at SASS

1374
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,620
from on the second episode, I believe.

1375
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,020
- It is. - Oh, really?

1376
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:06,940
- Yeah.

1377
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,620
- He's looking terrible these days.

1378
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:11,220
- Yeah, he's a farmer now.

1379
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:12,220
- Wow, good for him.

1380
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:15,740
Well, that completely distracted me.

1381
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:16,860
I didn't see a farmer that often.

1382
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:19,260
- I was really worried about that happening.

1383
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,100
- Yeah. - Yeah, no.

1384
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,300
I don't know, I forgot what we were talking about.

1385
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:22,300
We were talking about being farmers.

1386
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:23,140
I don't think I could be a farmer.

1387
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,540
- Farmer with a full Sasquatch walk.

1388
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:25,740
I could be a farmer.

1389
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:27,080
People say that they could be farmers,

1390
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,580
but I feel like it's way more work than you think it is.

1391
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:30,540
I've done it before.

1392
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,380
It's not that hard.

1393
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:32,200
No, you have never done it before.

1394
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,040
I have to imagine you lying to the bathroom.

1395
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,100
I've literally had this exact argument

1396
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,420
with Cam and Pat on the podcast before.

1397
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:38,760
Okay, new argument.

1398
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,580
I worked at a farm over the summer.

1399
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,260
I worked at a soybean farm.

1400
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,860
I plugged the irrigation holes.

1401
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,100
I did everything.

1402
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:47,700
You were a soy boy?

1403
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:50,300
No, I farmed soybeans in Louisiana.

1404
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,300
You were a soy boy in Louisiana for a summer.

1405
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:53,860
That's what they call those.

1406
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:54,700
That's what they call them.

1407
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,860
If you want to call it that dude, it was bad, bro. I was with my,

1408
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:02,860
my mom's like friends for a friend from high or from somewhere from high school

1409
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:03,700
or college.

1410
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,700
I was like staying with her family and like working on their farm for a summer.

1411
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:11,100
And uh, they were like literally in word every,

1412
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,660
every hour racist. They were like,

1413
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,820
yeah, it was crazy.

1414
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,780
It's like a Twitter bot and word every

1415
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:26,500
Yeah, some guy, like this is also like,

1416
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,740
they would sit around and they would watch Obama

1417
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:31,260
give like speeches on TV,

1418
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:34,780
just so they could just say the N-word to their TV.

1419
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,340
And I was like, and I was not,

1420
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,340
and I didn't know this when I signed up to do this.

1421
00:56:38,340 --> 00:56:40,060
And I was only, I was like 14.

1422
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,420
So I didn't have a lot of agency in my life.

1423
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,580
So day one, I text my mom and I'm like,

1424
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:49,000
hey, your friend's husband is racist.

1425
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:54,020
My mom's like, "Oh, they just don't know what,

1426
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,820
you know, they're just from a different time."

1427
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:58,260
I'm like, "They're the same age as you.

1428
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,180
What are you talking about?"

1429
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,940
- They're from a different place.

1430
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:05,420
- And then I showed their kid Team Fortress 2,

1431
00:57:05,420 --> 00:57:07,900
and you do not wanna hear what he called the Demo Man.

1432
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:08,740
- Demo Man, yeah.

1433
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:12,140
- It was bad when he started playing the Demo Man

1434
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,340
and started doing just all sorts of terrible stuff.

1435
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:17,420
And I was like, "God, what have I unlocked in this kid?"

1436
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:18,260
But it was bad, man.

1437
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,500
It was not a good time.

1438
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,340
- No. - Yeah.

1439
00:57:20,340 --> 00:57:26,020
that's the hard part of farming is the intolerance. Do you think you could be a farmer Rex? No,

1440
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:32,660
I'm too delicate. I think that nowadays like if you want to run like a successful farm you need

1441
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:40,260
to like acres of you know land and like the big ass machines. That is genius. So I don't think

1442
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,940
it's that hard anymore I think it's it's incredibly easy. Pretty hard. You have to

1443
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,960
- You need to know how to drive stuff.

1444
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:47,800
- I know how to drive stuff.

1445
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,320
- It's mostly about the business part.

1446
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,240
It's just like having to run

1447
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:54,940
like the hardest, least successful business you can have.

1448
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,120
You don't make any money farming anymore.

1449
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:58,160
- I know business and how to drive.

1450
00:57:58,160 --> 00:57:59,680
I think I could do it.

1451
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,520
- That's not true.

1452
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:03,480
- Yeah, farming is just a losing business

1453
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:04,680
that gets propped up by taxes and shit.

1454
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:09,120
- Yeah, you have to pay royalties on your--

1455
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:09,960
- I could pay your seeds.

1456
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,240
- You have to pay royalties on the seeds that you use

1457
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:13,680
because they're owned by,

1458
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,520
like companies have the patent on the specific genetic modification of the seed.

1459
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:23,320
So it's like you're using a sample in a fucking hip hop song and you're paying

1460
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,000
the Nina Simone's estate for the rest of your life.

1461
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:28,520
Like that's that kind of situation.

1462
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,360
Just use my own seeds from the store.

1463
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:34,640
So that's the thing is they've literally eliminated every other seed in the

1464
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:37,440
world. Yeah. It's pretty genius.

1465
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,440
It is except for Antarctica.

1466
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,840
Yeah.

1467
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:44,120
Not a lot of stuff grows in Antarctica, though.

1468
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,720
You don't know about the secret Antarctica seed repository?

1469
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,400
No.

1470
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,800
It might not be Antarctica.

1471
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,200
It's definitely in somewhere really cold.

1472
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,840
There's like an underground bunker

1473
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,560
that has like a copy of every seed.

1474
00:58:57,560 --> 00:58:58,840
Really?

1475
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,080
To like repopulate the earth with plants after.

1476
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:02,920
Yeah, I think that--

1477
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,000
Svalbard Global Seed Vault?

1478
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,200
That YouTube video kept popping up on my recommended

1479
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:08,040
and I never watched it.

1480
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:08,880
I never heard of those.

1481
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,000
It's so boring.

1482
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,800
It's on the Norwegian island of Spitsbergen

1483
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:16,120
in the Arctic archipelago.

1484
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:17,440
- Yeah.

1485
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,580
- Man, that's pretty dope looking.

1486
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:24,580
- Yeah, it's like the seed repository of last resort.

1487
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:29,440
- I mean, do vegetables go extinct?

1488
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,600
- If a nuclear winter happens.

1489
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:33,520
- Yeah.

1490
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:35,440
- When would that ever happen?

1491
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,520
- That's a good point.

1492
00:59:36,520 --> 00:59:37,360
- Yeah, you're right.

1493
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,000
- We're all friends here.

1494
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:41,660
Yeah, it's definitely not about to happen.

1495
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:44,840
We're just going to happen.

1496
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:47,140
Shut up there,

1497
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:49,940
because they were talking about the like depleted uranium rounds

1498
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:52,300
that Britain has given to the UK.

1499
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:56,900
Yeah, I saw a bunch of pictures of like babies that were born after being.

1500
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,780
It's fucked up what the human body can produce,

1501
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,840
which is a little bit of radiation. It's fucked up.

1502
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:06,640
Yeah, the radiation is not so good, man. Yeah. Yeah.

1503
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:15,980
I don't I, uh, I think it's such a clear choice between living in the middle of New York City,

1504
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:25,740
where you get exactly bullseye hit and destroyed versus living like everybody's like, oh, I just

1505
01:00:25,740 --> 01:00:31,020
want to live 50 miles outside of a city. Oh, OK. So when the fucking nuke hits, you want all your

1506
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,340
skin to slowly just fall off like a lizard.

1507
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,880
You want to die with no skin doing that,

1508
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,260
the help me thing from Hellraiser.

1509
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,920
That's what you want to do?

1510
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,540
- Yeah, just vaporize me instantly.

1511
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:43,820
- I want to be a shadow.

1512
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:47,740
- You guys ever saw that, I don't know what it was from.

1513
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:49,860
Maybe you can help me with this, Rex.

1514
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:51,800
But I remember watching this a bunch of times

1515
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:53,820
when I was a kid or somewhere,

1516
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:56,260
but I don't know where it's from.

1517
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,180
It was just like some anime or it's like the bombs

1518
01:00:59,180 --> 01:01:00,560
like hitting Japan.

1519
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,780
Oh, that anime is awful.

1520
01:01:02,780 --> 01:01:04,700
I saw that as a kid and it made me leftist.

1521
01:01:04,700 --> 01:01:06,080
Yeah.

1522
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:09,500
I don't, I remember it's just, I've only seen like clips of that.

1523
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,000
I don't know.

1524
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:13,460
I don't know what, where that's from, but I, and I don't know how I watched that so

1525
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,220
many times.

1526
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,900
I don't even know what you're talking about.

1527
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:16,400
So that's all.

1528
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,100
You know what it is?

1529
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:17,640
No.

1530
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:23,100
It's some anime where like the guy, he must've been, he must've like been

1531
01:01:23,100 --> 01:01:26,140
sexually attracted to like pictures of people.

1532
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,580
He must've been hit by the nuke.

1533
01:01:28,180 --> 01:01:30,060
- That's true, for his brain to come up with something

1534
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:34,660
so sick, but he basically did just like an anime slow motion

1535
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,580
of like little kids eyeballs melting and like old grannies

1536
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,740
having their skin burned off.

1537
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:42,860
It's really-- - Have you ever seen that?

1538
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:44,740
- It's pretty gnarly.

1539
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,460
- It's pretty much like the precursor of like

1540
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:49,180
that HBO show, "Chernobyl," I guess.

1541
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:50,060
- Yes.

1542
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:55,060
- Yeah, I do know that if you are in the blast range

1543
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:59,100
of like the nuclear bomb, it happens so fast

1544
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:03,400
that you like die before you understand what's happening.

1545
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:04,240
- Oh yeah, yeah.

1546
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,060
- That's good.

1547
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,040
- It's like quicker than the neurons

1548
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:09,060
can actually reach your brain.

1549
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,020
- Yeah, your body just vaporizes.

1550
01:02:11,020 --> 01:02:11,860
It's fine.

1551
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:12,740
- It's pretty cool. - It's pretty good.

1552
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:14,180
- You know that they put the,

1553
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:17,140
this is an amazing place to be kind of rave slowly,

1554
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:19,160
kind of winding down the podcast is great.

1555
01:02:19,160 --> 01:02:21,840
But you know that they put the big loads

1556
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:24,660
of nuclear armaments they put at like

1557
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,100
in these very desolate parts of the United States

1558
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,980
because they know that they'll be the first targets

1559
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,460
in any kind of like nuclear engagement.

1560
01:02:31,460 --> 01:02:35,900
So if Russia sends four nuclear bombs,

1561
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,980
they're all gonna be headed towards

1562
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:40,480
where all of our nuclear bombs are.

1563
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,180
And they did that so that all the farmers die

1564
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:46,660
and all the amazing smart city people live.

1565
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:47,500
- Yeah.

1566
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:49,180
- But the thing is, man, bro, if they send nukes,

1567
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:51,460
they're sending 50,000 of them.

1568
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:53,500
And there's gonna be like everywhere you walk,

1569
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,440
you're getting hit by one.

1570
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:58,440
If they were water balloons, we'd be in trouble.

1571
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,840
You know, the fact that they are nuclear warheads just makes it

1572
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:02,840
that much worse.

1573
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:03,640
Yeah.

1574
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:07,240
I just hope I loved reading.

1575
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:10,940
I was reading about Einstein a bunch and what I forget who the

1576
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:15,940
president was at the time and but there's like this anecdote

1577
01:03:15,940 --> 01:03:16,740
or Wilson.

1578
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:20,240
Yeah, like Einstein met with the president.

1579
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,340
He was like, yo, you know, like fucking Dukes are real bad.

1580
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:26,660
This is like, we gotta be good about this.

1581
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:30,300
And then he left the office and the president turned

1582
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,300
and he's like, that guy's a fucking pussy.

1583
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:34,540
(laughing)

1584
01:03:34,540 --> 01:03:38,780
That guy's a bitch.

1585
01:03:38,780 --> 01:03:41,140
- That is so dope, dude.

1586
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:43,620
Yeah, Einstein was a bitch.

1587
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,020
That's why Oppenheimer was cool.

1588
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:46,860
- Yeah.

1589
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:47,680
- I can't wait to see that movie.

1590
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,820
- I can't wait to watch the movie now.

1591
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:49,660
- I'm so excited.

1592
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:52,100
- That's like a hack bit to talk about

1593
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:56,340
how he planned out, I am become death destroyer worlds,

1594
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:58,740
like he was like at home looking up shit to say.

1595
01:03:58,740 --> 01:03:59,580
- But it is cool.

1596
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:00,680
- It is fucking hard.

1597
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:02,000
That is a hard line.

1598
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,340
- Oh dude, he, when I was a kid.

1599
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:05,160
- He killed that.

1600
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:07,380
- Tell you where that was in my life,

1601
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:08,740
my desktop background.

1602
01:04:08,740 --> 01:04:09,580
- Yeah.

1603
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,240
- And yeah, guess what was behind it?

1604
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:12,080
The word.

1605
01:04:12,080 --> 01:04:12,900
- Nuclear.

1606
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,700
- No, space.

1607
01:04:14,700 --> 01:04:16,220
It has nothing to do with space.

1608
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:18,960
He was not involved in space at all.

1609
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,700
But you look at those words and you say,

1610
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:24,140
Holy fuck dude, that is existentialism, motherfucker.

1611
01:04:24,140 --> 01:04:26,780
You know what, I've changed my mind. You are book smart.

1612
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:28,380
You are completely book smart.

1613
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:29,380
Obviously.

1614
01:04:29,380 --> 01:04:31,380
The Baghdad Gita.

1615
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:32,700
Okay, bye guys.

1616
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:33,700
Bye.
