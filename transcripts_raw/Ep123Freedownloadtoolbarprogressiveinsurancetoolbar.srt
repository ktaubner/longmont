You're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Podcasts for the heartless.

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Crap monster.

00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yep. That's some funny shit, man.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I don't care who you are. Black, Indian, Hitler.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Man, I don't care if you're Adolf Hitler yourself, man. That's some funny shit, man.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
That's some funny shit.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I don't care.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
God damn.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,760
- Damn, the boys are back, dude.

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,000
What the fuck?

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,440
Oh my God.

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:35,560
- We're back in New York, New York, Manhattan.

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,800
- They done fucked up and let it happen again, dude.

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,000
- They let me back into New York, Manhattan.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,960
- Which I wasn't expecting to, yeah.

17
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,520
I wasn't expecting that to work.

18
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,000
- Yeah, after you acted like a total beast.

19
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:46,840
- Yep.

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:47,840
- You partied hard.

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,680
- I did.

22
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,240
- Dude, people were talking.

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,400
- Last time I was here,

24
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,240
I thought I had COVID for a couple days.

25
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,480
- You did think you had COVID just 'cause you were tired.

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,040
We all got tired and we were like, "We have COVID."

27
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,440
I was like, "This is the big C."

28
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:04,920
There's no other explanation.

29
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,560
I mean, it's fair because that happened to me so many times during the beginning of lockdown.

30
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,480
I got tired or had a sore throat and I thought, "Oh, I have COVID."

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,880
That was the first time that I got tired when I was around other people.

32
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:15,880
Yeah.

33
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,560
No, COVID was like as a fucking just a terrible hypochondriac.

34
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Yeah, that's bad.

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,560
This whole thing.

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Yeah, yeah.

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,720
- Since March, I have been on edge just every day.

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,560
- Yeah.

39
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,340
- You've been on H every single day?

40
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,700
- I've been on H every single day

41
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,540
to deal with the pain of COVID-19.

42
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:34,360
- I wish, I mean, I could get some good shit in New Hampshire.

43
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,480
- I would love to have those big bulging veins.

44
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,720
- Oh my God, dude, I would get so thin on heroin.

45
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Are you kidding me?

46
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,680
(laughing)

47
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,000
- True, true.

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,460
- I would look good.

49
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,000
- No, you would be like an already laying heroin addict.

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,840
- No, I wouldn't.

51
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,000
- Yeah, you'd be like, oh, I just had so much heroin,

52
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,080
we have to go to Burger King.

53
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,920
- We have to eat cheeseburger.

54
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,520
- We have to go to Burger King.

55
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,120
No, no, no, I would get Taco Bell so I could shit it out of my system immediately.

56
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,240
Plus heroin makes you shit.

57
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,240
Does it?

58
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,240
I would not.

59
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,040
I've never done it.

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,040
What's the thing in Trainspotting?

61
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,040
A toilet?

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
A baby toilet?

63
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,280
Yeah, he goes in the big toilet.

64
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,280
A train?

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,280
No, heroin makes you constipated.

66
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Scotland?

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,280
Heroin makes you cum.

68
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,280
Heroin does make you cum.

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,280
It is true.

70
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,560
Would you guys do heroin?

71
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,360
I mean, it's available to me.

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,360
But you haven't done it.

73
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,360
That's a, yeah.

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,360
So why not?

75
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:26,360
thing I know every all the heroin in New Hampshire is cut with Fent.

76
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
Ah!

77
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,360
So we have a very...

78
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,360
Would you do Fent?

79
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,160
New Hampshire has an extremely bad opioid crisis and now that the election's over it's gonna

80
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,040
be forgotten until the next election.

81
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,800
Because Biden's gonna snap his fingers it's over dude.

82
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,200
Biden's gonna do the Thanos snap.

83
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,680
White people listen to Biden.

84
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,680
If he says...

85
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:44,680
Yeah.

86
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,680

87
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,680
If he says hey Jack stop doing Fentanyl.

88
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,680
Yeah listen.

89
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Stop putting Fentanyl in your balls.

90
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,680
Jack you're...

91
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,440
The whole city of Manchester is gonna be fine.

92
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,120
was a kid fentanyl was something that mom said to their dads when we were and we

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,920
were walking around

94
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,520
Well shit. It's been ages since I've seen one of those. Well shit.

95
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,520
Shit. Joe Biden.

96
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,520
Gimme Joe Biden.

97
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,520
No I can't wait till the opioid crisis in New Hampshire to get way worse and then Joe Biden should be like "Hey look, this is not my fault."

98
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:33,520
I mean it's not his fault. It's his fucking fucked up ugly hillbillies in New Hampshire.

99
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:38,400
I'm really I'm really a glad fucking Corky Messner didn't win New Hampshire

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm glad Jean I mean, I don't like Jean Shaheen, but I'm glad that Jean Shaheen beat him out

101
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:50,400
He's a mean and quirky guy if the guy from New Hampshire who was in charge of shit was named Corky Messner. Yeah

102
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,620
Would fucking suck. Yeah, that would not help my case for being stupid. Yeah

103
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,880
Run by a man named Tweety bird. Yeah, exactly

104
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,840
That's yeah, yeah, this is New Hampshire's state senator chunky

105
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:17,120
Yeah, yeah, it's basically everybody in New Hampshire throws their poop

106
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,320
We all live in cages

107
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,480
We all live in cages and throw poop at people yeah

108
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,820
In North Carolina everybody who runs for election is either called like

109
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:38,000
Either like Rob Messner should be the North Carolina. Yeah, well, it's either like it's either like Robert

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,680
Braxton or like or like Duh-Dawn

111
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:50,480
And like Duh-Dawn got a got a City Council membership. Oh damn. Did you hear Duh-Dawn finally legalized drunk driving?

112
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,920
Now that's the fucked up part is in North Carolina did dawn is a way better

113

Fucking elected a right like you're fucking elevator per ari berry cherry berry. Yeah

114
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,440

115
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,200
fucking elevators

116
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:10,480
First of all, what the fuck is that?

117
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,360
secondly sure her name is

118
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,200
cherry berry and she puts it on every single elevator along with a picture of her face and

119
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:28,280
she's never lost an election she wins by by 90 she's in the booth and it's like

120
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:32,720
yeah who do you want to vote for you want to vote for you want to vote for Enrique

121
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,360
Rodriguez or Cherry Berry there's a clear choice yeah yeah especially North

122
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:41,920
Carolina yeah I know people are like well Cherry Berry it's not like an ice

123
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:48,920
cream flavor. Cherryberry, hell I'm hungry. I could go get ice cream right after this. I don't care if it's November.

124
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,360
But yeah she's a she's you know probably a piece of shit. Maybe. But she's a genius.

125
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,760
Yeah she's the best. She invented elevator. I'm gonna take you guys to North Carolina and show you an

126
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,720
elevator. Oh I'd love to go to North Carolina I know the skate park there. I know the skate spot.

127
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,200
We have to go at some point. It's sick. North Carolina rules. Yeah. Much respect to North

128
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,800
Carolina. I feel like North Carolina is like New Hampshire in the in the spring.

129
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,600
well it's better food than New Hampshire for sure. Yeah, now that you guys

130
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:19,160
experience what New Hampshire is like. There's black people and beaches. It's nothing like New Hampshire.

131
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:27,160
I feel like the most similar state to New Hampshire is probably Vermont

132
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,240
because it's upside down New Hampshire. I would say or Maine. No, Maine's too big.

133
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,560
but main is like main is half about mongolia

134
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,880
yeah yeah might be close right people eat out of big boy do it we do have a lot of uh

135
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,600
we do have a lot of cons there we do have a lot of uh distant relatives of genghis khan

136
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,720
they're all over yeah yeah he actually conquered new hampshire

137
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:00,040
yeah that was the edge of the empire everybody yeah when people say like oh like like point

138
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,960
2.2% of the population has has Genghis Khan's genes. That's all New Hampshire.

139
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,360
Yeah, it's only people in New Hampshire.

140
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,200
It's just a bunch of Khans conquering each other.

141
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:14,360
There was this house in Auburn that I used to drive by. It was literally like,

142
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,440
I think it's a trailer that they built like a big picket fence around.

143
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,680
It's in the middle of the woods. It just says it has a big sign that says keep out on it.

144
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:28,120
And it's just like a whole like fence. It's like a fenced in house and it's near like some fire

145
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:35,480
department in Auburn and that is the great wall that King is Con was trying to conquer.

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,600
There it is dude.

147
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:41,320
So what do we, I mean are we going to stay up until 5am again first night with you guys

148
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,320
here?

149
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Probably not.

150
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Knowing us we probably will.

151
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,760
Let's just do the same thing as last time.

152
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,760
Never learn.

153
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,360
Never learn from our mistakes.

154
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,440
What did we do last time?

155
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:57,480
Last time we stayed up until like 5am and then Caleb took us on a 10 mile walk the next day.

156
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,760
We said, "Oh, Caleb, so we're going to go backlog so many episodes. Oh, wait, no, let's

157
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,760
go, let's walk ten miles."

158
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,520
We had to have something to talk about. We couldn't just do Phil Hoffman all, you know.

159
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Well, we could have done Phil Hoffman all weekend.

160
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:09,520
Yeah, that's true.

161
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,600
We haven't seen each other in long enough that we could just talk.

162
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,600
That's true.

163
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,600
It's trying to go on a long walk.

164
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,000
Yeah. There's been some stuff happening, I guess.

165
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,560
So, there's some interesting stuff going on.

166
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Hey, look.

167
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,200
No, Patrick, go ahead. What's going on?

168
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,160
I'm going to talk about what's happening in my life.

169
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,160
Okay. All right.

170
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,080
All right, I'll talk about what's happening in my life. It's going fucking awesome. Yeah

171
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:36,840
Doing so much drugs and fucking having sex every day. Yeah. No, no, I've gotten a little bit better at the base

172
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,520
I've gotten a lot better video games. Yes. I have I think if it wasn't for video games

173
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,280
I would have gotten addicted to drugs. Yeah in the past six months. Honestly, I think honestly I think learning like the first

174
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:50,000
part of

175
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,180
Chicken by Jaco Pastorius has saved that guy. Yeah. Yeah by Jacob Jacob Sartorius Jacob Sartorius

176
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:00,520
Yeah, nice. Yeah, because the first like bar of

177
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,720
Chicken is just done done done

178
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,540
Well, it's the exact same chord progression as the chicken dance. Exactly

179
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,880
Yeah, which is the taco pastorius wanted to play the chicken dance and people are like this isn't few

180
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,680
This isn't jazz fusion enough if this ain't jazz fusion. I don't know what is play. Oh

181
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:24,000
Exactly. Yeah, I don't know enough about Jaco Pastorius to even joke about him. Don't even joke about that

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,200
I don't even joke about that guy joke about Jaco Pastorius. He's got a scary name. That's all. Yeah, he kind of looks scary, too

183
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,180
What does he look like? He's kind of like a freak

184
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:40,740
Go on he looks kind of like a freak I've only seen him the only pictures I've seen of him

185
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,040
He's wearing a turtleneck and I don't trust somebody wears turtlenecks all the time. Yeah, we never know it could be under that

186
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,840
What if there's no knife under the turtleneck?

187
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,640
What if it's to hide the fact that he has no neck?

188
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
He's a floating head, dude.

189
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,360
What's that scary story as to tell in the dark?

190
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,360
The first one in that book?

191
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,160
Yeah, what if his head falls off?

192
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Yeah.

193
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:02,160
What if he takes it down and he's got dracula bites?

194
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,240
He kind of looks like a vampire.

195
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,080
What if he has one of those boxes that smokers have when they talk to a robot?

196
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,480
What if he's got a pussy on his neck?

197
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,480
I think that's definitely the most effective.

198
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,480
I think I'd actually want to see that.

199
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,480
Yeah, let me see.

200
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,560
Let's take a couple steps back here.

201
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,280
he's got a pussy on his neck. He's got an innie or an outie on there.

202
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:24,120
If you're born with a pussy on your neck do you think you get in trouble for having it in public?

203
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,600
Yeah. Yeah. What? People hate women more than men. If you had a penis on your neck you could

204
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:38,120
walk around with your dick hanging out. Dude. That's right. Yep. Uh-huh. Yeah. Cheers to that

205
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:42,920
dude. Oh my god. Imagine imagine okay imagine you're a guy who has a penis on your neck okay

206
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:47,720
and you're walking around the mall and across the mall you make eye contact

207
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:53,360
you make eye contact with a woman working at Auntie Anne's who has a

208
00:10:53,360 --> 00:11:06,120
pussy on her neck and you walk up to her and you walk up to her and you ask her on

209
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,880
a date because this is the first time you ever see someone like that she says

210
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
know. Well, because she knows what you're doing.

211
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,880
She's not going to be like, "Oh, this is what happens."

212
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
He's asking me on a date. How convenient.

213
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,880
Well, I mean,

214
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,880
you don't think that she would,

215
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,880
finally someone that's like her too?

216
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,880
I mean, guys would find a fucking

217
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,880
face fuck. Yeah, guys would

218
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,880
fuck a throat with a pussy. Yeah, that'd be

219
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
like kind of ideal, dude. I don't have to get

220
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
near the butt.

221
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Fucking perfect. Are you kidding?

222
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,880
You know?

223
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:49,440
Yeah. Yeah, my wife heard that and I heard her move around. She's opening the door. That

224
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,200
was the most scary moment of my life, dude. I almost got grounded. That was tough. I got

225
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,920
grounded before I left. You got grounded, really, by your mommy? My brother grounded

226
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,440
me. For what? He texted me and said, "I'm grounded and I need to come back home." Are

227
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,160
you serious? He just misses you, dude. Is that why you've been crying the entire time

228
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,080
No, that's why I've been crying. It's because Eric said I was grounded.

229
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,580
Damn, dude.

230
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:10,080
Yeah.

231
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:11,760
How are you gonna recover?

232
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,260
I don't know.

233
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
I mean, how are you gonna crawl yourself out of this?

234
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,440
I probably won't.

235
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:15,940
Yeah?

236
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,440
No.

237
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,940
What's the longest you've ever been grounded for?

238
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,940
Longest I was ever grounded...

239
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:25,660
No, I didn't get grounded for a long... I always knew how to weasel my way out of getting grounded.

240
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:26,900
But...

241
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,400
Yeah.

242
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:33,340
The first time I ever got in like serious trouble for something I did was

243
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,100
was when I first got Twitter in like 2012.

244
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Yeah.

245
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,780
And my cousin Patrick, I have a cousin named Patrick.

246
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,780
Looks just like you.

247
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,780
No he doesn't.

248
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,780
He probably does.

249
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,780
Oh is he one of your big cousins?

250
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,500
No, or I think we're the same height.

251
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
He looks just like you.

252
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,500
So he looks exactly like you.

253
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Nah checkmate.

254
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
He doesn't look like me at all.

255
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,260
Okay what does he look like then?

256
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,260
I think-

257
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,260
Just describe him you fucking idiot.

258
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:59,060
He, I feel like if I showed you a picture you'd say he didn't look like me.

259
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,420
You probably couldn't tell.

260
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,700
So say some features on his body.

261
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,700
I got a lot of tattoos.

262
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:06,940
So that's not, that doesn't have to be.

263
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,940
I was right dude, he's Maori.

264
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,940
Yeah, he's Maori.

265
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,140
Exactly, that's my Maori cousin Patrick.

266
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:23,300
But we went back and forth and we were talking about holiday themed dick pics and somehow

267
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,900
my aunt saw it.

268
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
In 2012?

269
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,900
Yeah, exactly.

270
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,780
Like in 2012, that's just an at midnight game.

271
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:38,620
And my aunt saw it and then I guess something he said, he said like a picture of my dick

272
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:44,080
on Yom Kippur with Jewish sideburns or something.

273
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,620
And my aunt, who I hadn't talked to since I was like, I hadn't talked to her in like

274
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,620
four years.

275
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,620
Is this a Blue Lives Matter aunt?

276
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:52,500
No, this is not the Blue Lives Matter aunt.

277
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,820
This is the aunt who has notorious RGB stuff.

278
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,820
Syndrome.

279
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:57,820
Yeah.

280
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:00,060
(laughing)

281
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,220
But she messaged his dad and then his dad called my mom

282
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:08,440
and said, "Your kids are posting anti-Semitic things online."

283
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,500
(laughing)

284
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,560
And my mom--

285
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,740
- Your dad was like, "Duh."

286
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,180
(laughing)

287
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,420
- Hell yeah, dude.

288
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,260
- Nice, dude.

289
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,080
- All right.

290
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,920
- Nice, dem boys, right.

291
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,760
- My mom, as soon as I got home from school that day,

292
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,760
my mom was like super mad at me and I was like,

293
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,120
"What, what the fuck is going on?"

294
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,460
She's like, "You need to delete your account, blah, blah, blah."

295
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,640
And I was like, "What are you talking about?"

296
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,260
She said, "You're posting anti-Semitic things."

297
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:31,560
showed her that it was his kid not me your mom hit you with a delete your

298
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,960
account my mom hit me with a delete my account yeah so my my mom was like you I

299
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,120
uncle Bobby called and said you were posting anti-semitic things and I was

300
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,120
like no it was uncle Bobby's kid who was posting the anti-semitic things so take

301
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,660
that and he didn't call my mom back because my mom explained to him like

302
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,500
yeah you know because it was me my brother Paul and my cousin Patrick damn

303
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,780
and they got confused by which Patrick exactly yeah they said they said Patrick

304
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:07,620
my I think my aunt said Patrick is posting anti-semitic things and then

305
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:12,500
Bobby called my mom immediately eight years later you're posting anti-semitic

306
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,260
things constantly rewarded for it yeah I'm rewarded by all those Jeremy Corbyn

307
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:24,300
nights. Patrick runs a small account that's been getting a lot of

308
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,920
anti-semitic cow which is different from anti-semitism cow. He moves when something is anti-semitic in a good way.

309
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:39,080
It's like yeah dude fuck yeah. Yeah it sends moos to fucking every Jeremy

310
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,760

00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:50,100

00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:46,220
upstairs and made a bunch of clam chowder and I was like oh wait so I almost got

333
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,060
ground it was before a parent-teacher conference I smoked a shit ton of weed

334
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:54,060
and you brought a grocery bag of clam chowder.

335
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
A clam chowder.

336
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,060
Family style, you eat it out of a Walmart bag.

337
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,060
So it was the night before parent-teacher conferences,

338
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,060
and I made a bunch of clam chowder,

339
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,060
and I was about to make egg noodles for some reason.

340
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,060
That's a great combo.

341
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,060
Yeah, clam chowder and egg noodles.

342
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
Why didn't you make pasta and clam chowder?

343
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
That's what I was going to do.

344
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,060
Dude, okay.

345
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,060
That's what I was going to do.

346
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,060
And you got punished for it, dude.

347
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:23,940
It was midnight before parent-teacher conferences, so I made a shit ton of it and then I

348
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,300
Think the microwave went off and I was like that shouldn't have happened

349
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:34,260
Like I was like I was too busy looking at the noodles to realize that the microwave went off and then I went oh no

350
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:37,020
It was beeping for like a couple minutes my mom like came downstairs

351
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:41,500
I was ready to like get like she pissed at me and she looked at the fucking

352
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,800
Clam chowder sitting on the counter and was like oh having a little feast

353
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:54,560
start and I was like mom went medieval yeah dude she went medieval on my I never

354
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:59,240
got caught with smoking weed cuz me and my parents I didn't get caught smoking weed at the same exact time.

355
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,280
I didn't get caught, she didn't know I was high. Okay. But she did see that I was

356
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,600
eating a bunch of food and was yelling at me for eating all the food and then

357
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,120
went to parent-teacher conferences the next day expecting to hear something

358
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,160
really bad. She was like, "Oh, now my son's a fuck up." And she they went and she's

359
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,200
like, "Yeah, no, he does all the work. He's just kind of like a piece of shit."

360
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,760
My mom sat me down one day and she was like, she, you know, she texted me while I

361
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,760
was out and she was like, "You boys need to come home because I have something, we

362
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,880
have to talk about something really important." And I was like, "Oh, fuck dude. Her and my

363
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,880
stepdad are like getting divorced or something. This is serious." And I got home

364
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,880
and they were like, "Come to the bedroom, sit down with us."

365
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:49,440
And they were like, "So basically, we've been using medical marijuana to deal with our anxiety

366
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,240
because I can't find a job."

367
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,760
And I was like, "Fucking shit."

368
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,480
The same shit happened to me.

369
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:05,720
My fucking dad called me and he was like, "Cameron, I just want you to know that I sometimes

370
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,760
I'll smoke marijuana because it calms me down and I like it.

371
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,120
And I just wanted you to know because your younger sibling just found some in the attic

372
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,240
and I just wanted you to hear it from me.

373
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,800
It's like, "Okay, Dad."

374
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
That's hilarious.

375
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
Yeah, and I was in college.

376
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,920
I also know that it's not for anxiety.

377
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,120
That was like in sophomore year of college.

378
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,280
Dude, the fucked up thing is like...

379
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,920
That's when we knew each other too.

380
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Yeah.

381
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
No, you know what?

382
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,720
It might have been freshman year actually because I think it was pretty soon after my

383
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,960
parents got divorced.

384
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,960
Oh, okay.

385
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:42,240
I know that it wasn't for anxiety because now I go home and my stepdad will like smoke a

386
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,200
bowl and watch Lord of the Rings.

387
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,920
And like do a puzzle or some shit.

388
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,640
Yeah, he wants to become an Uruk-hai, that's why he smokes weed.

389
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,080
But it's just like, just fucking, I don't care dude.

390
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,640
My parents never smoked weed.

391
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,000
And then somehow they could never tell that I smoked weed.

392
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,320
Even though, like, I mean they were just so brain dead about it.

393
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Yeah.

394
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,200
Oh dude, I almost got caught one time.

395
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,640
It's when smoking go on.

396
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,600
When I was 14.

397
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:20,160
This is before I realized I just can't smoke weed, but I like went up the fucking

398
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,840
Oh my god.

399
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,120
I'll turn it off after this.

400
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,160
But you won't.

401
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:24,640
I won't.

402
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,720
So I like it was like when my sister was like a senior.

403
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,840
So my sister, my brother and I were in high school at the same time.

404
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:36,320
and she had her like ex-boyfriend over and uh

405
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,400
i like went i got super high in the basement i went upstairs and i was going

406
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,480

He's just evil. I think your brother might be the devil. I think your brother got possessed.

414
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:26,120
That was like one of the scariest moments of my life. I was like yep I'm

437
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,200
And then being like, "I like Ditchymon."

438
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,320

00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,680
(laughing)

446
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,280
- I still have it, but my uncle,

447
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,640
The day I was born, my uncle Jack, my godfather,

448
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:44,040
took a, he had his game, I think he was like 18

449
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,640
when I was born, I don't know.

450
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
I don't remember when he was born,

451
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,200
but he had like a game-winning ball

452
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,860
from one of his high school football games

453
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:54,200
and he wrote my name, my date of birth, my weight,

454
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,900
like everything, I still have it, it's in my closet.

455
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,880
It's a football from the day I was born

456
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,320
from one of his game-winning, like,

457
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,000
oh, he got the game ball.

458
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,520
and I still have that and I cannot imagine what he thinks of me now.

459
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,640
Just like yeah this kid's gonna grow up he's gonna be a fucking linebacker it's

460
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,320
like not. He walks in your house and you're using it like a whoopee cushion.

461
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,520
Yeah I played football for like three years.

462
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,920
Really? And I was insanely good at it. I wasn't. But I kept getting concussed.

463
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,680
I knew. I got concussed like five times. As a kid?

464
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,040
As a kid. And this is back like people talk about like they're like

465
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:37,440
back in my day football was way worse than it is now. Like people used to lead with

466
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,040
their head. That was like 2008. Yeah. Like it was not that long ago that people did that.

467
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:50,480
One of my cousins quit, it was like a flag football team, one of my cousins quit because

468
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,480
the coach was like, "Use your fucking head!" He was like, "I'm not gonna lead with my head!

469
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,600
I'm not gonna charge with my head!" God gave you that heavy brain for something, buddy.

470
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,080
Yeah, you like freaked out at him and like...

471
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,920
The thing is I was really good at football because somehow when I was 11 I was 6 feet

472
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,320
tall and I'm 5'9" now.

473
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,240
Like I was fucking huge.

474
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,560
You were probably 5'9" at 11 which is 6 feet for an 11 year old.

475
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Your mic just turned off, pal.

476
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,560
Oh shit, I turned it back on.

477
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Why did you turn it off?

478
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,560
It was an accident.

479
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
It just slipped the finger.

480
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,560
It happens sometimes.

481
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,560
You definitely were like, "Oh, here's the switch."

482
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Come on.

483
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560

And that's the problem. Nobody can tell you why. Fucking owned.

515
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:00,560
It's a good thing to venerate another culture you respect and that you want to be part of

516
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,600
and you want to dress up as on Halloween.

517
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Yeah, it's amazing.

518
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
It's true.

519
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,840
Yeah, my grandpa brought back these Vietnamese eyelids from the war. I mean, you know, am

520
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,760
I going to say no?

521
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,760
What am I going to do?

522
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,600
These are perfectly good ears, okay? I'm not gonna just throw them away.

523
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,920
I'll never throw away good ears. My grandpa would get so mad at me if I didn't wear his ear necklace to school.

524
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,680
(laughter)

525
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:38,480
You'd think it was disrespectful, dude. Yeah, my grandpa killed a whole village for this, man.

526
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:45,880
fucking 18 years on this how much work goes into that it was a lot of time it

527
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,200
was a lot of time it was from one guy

528
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:06,200
My grandpa went to ward the circus. He's got a necklace of girl beard hair. He's

529
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,500
got a necklace of clown noses. Dude, I need to check on my grandpa since Trump lost. I

530
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:16,240
bet he's not doing well. Yeah? Yeah. I bet he's doing so badly. He has like all the

531
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,600
hats. He has the white one. Oh man. Once you buy the white one, the coolest one is

532
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:27,920
the one that that uh that poopy pie 360 has. Oh yeah the the real tree one? Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,040
That one is cool. Honestly that one does kind of look sick. Dude anything that has real tree on it

534
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:38,560
I'm just like I would wear that it doesn't matter what it says on it. When I when Trump like first

535
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,520
started like running there's a there's a picture of me in a Trump shirt because I didn't think he

536
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,000
would win. One of my my friend my high school friend's roommate bought one because he was like

537
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,040
a serious Trump supporter and I put it on as a joke and I was like "Hey guys, check me out!"

538
00:30:55,040 --> 00:31:00,080
And then like months after, as soon as he got elected, I was like "I need to delete that

539
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,080
photo."

540
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,120
There's a photo of Noah wrapped in the Confederate flag.

541
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:09,480
I guess that had nothing to do with Trump being elected.

542
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
No.

543
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,960
That didn't look good at the time.

544
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,360
But it does make me laugh sometimes.

545
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:22,840
I do remember when me and my cousin on like the first debate being like, "Let's go Trump!

546
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,840
Let's fucking go!"

547
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,720
Right, because you don't think that guy's gonna fucking win.

548
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,800
I mean and he texted me like when Trump won, he's like, "I can't believe he did that."

549
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,960
I was like, "It was still funny."

550
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
You know, whatever.

551
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:38,360
It's cool that he's out, but he's out as bisexual.

552
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:42,280
Guys Donald Trump is bisexual and he loves drama.

553
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,120
Yeah, Barron's actually his boyfriend.

554
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
He's his little boyfriend.

555
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:49,560

565
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,000
I'm gonna start doing extremely physical Charlie Chaplin bits on the show.

566
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
Yeah. Yeah.

567
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I fucking told you dude. Come on.

568
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
No one could hear that.

569
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
That was just like Charlie Chaplin.

570
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
Yeah that was more.

571
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,600
That was just like the Charlie Chaplin bit where he fell sideways on the chair.

572
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,200
You know what? That was more Buster Keaton. I'm gonna be honest.

573
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
True.

574
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,440
No, no. You were Buster Keaton. Come on.

575
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,160
That was more Caleb sliding off a chair to me.

576
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,920
I could be the worst physical comedian of all time.

577
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
I'll say it, buster.

578
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,440
My SNL audition, "Uh, yeah, so, uh, I'm gonna be sliding off this chair pretty slowly, honestly.

579
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,400
I really don't want to hurt myself, so, uh..."

580
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Just know, this is fake.

581
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,400
No laughter?

582
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,400
Yeah, I heard that happens.

583
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Yeah.

584
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,240
Today's list is "Weirdest Reasons People Have Filed for Divorce" by Usermisfire.

585
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,680
It's strange, but it's true.

586
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:41,280
people have filed for divorce for strange and bizarre reasons.

587
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,640
Number one, she didn't share her love of a Disney film.

588
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Oh my god.

589
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
When did that happen?

590
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:54,160
If I married a Disney woman, I would get divorced immediately.

591
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,560
A Japanese woman filed for divorce because her husband didn't share her love of the movie

592
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:58,560
Frozen.

593
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,800
After persuading her spouse to watch the film, he made the mistake of asking her, "Did you

594
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,480
really think it was that good?"

595
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:06,400
Apparently she did, and the fact that he could even ask that question made her question what

596
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,000
sort of person he was she furiously responded if you can't understand what

597
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,640
makes this movie great there's something wrong with you as a human being and

598
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,960
filed for divorce after unfortunately it seems that she didn't learn anything

599
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:21,680
from frozen's biggest musical number let it go I think she did big facts she did

600
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,680
let him go it's funny to him go this this it's about divorcing over a Disney

601
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:30,400
movie and you mentioned frozen specifically and then Pat goes that's a

602
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:39,680
kids movie. Yeah. What the hell? Disney kids movie. Watching Frozen. Okay, so

603
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:44,920
whoever fucking, if you're married when Frozen comes out, you're probably past

604
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:50,520
like 23 at least. Would you be happier if it was a Marvel movie? Yes. Okay.

605
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,480
Alright. Yeah. I feel like Marvel divorces happen a lot more. No, I feel like the, I

606
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:02,480
I feel like the kind of women who marry, assuming it's the guy who likes the Marvel movie and

607
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,840
the woman who doesn't, I think the kind of woman who marries the kind of guy who likes

608
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:12,480
Marvel movies probably is not the kind of, you know.

609
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Yeah, she's probably 14.

610
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,480
Yeah, she probably doesn't know any better.

611
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,480
That's a really good point.

612
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:24,680
Yeah, she's probably saying, "Oh, my man's in his man cave again watching Captain Marvel."

613
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
Yeah.

614
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,720
- She's watched it three times this week.

615
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,560
- That woman is probably like a--

616
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,680
- I never picked up Black Panther for whatever reason.

617
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,360
(laughing)

618
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,080
- It's probably like a pizza rolls maker.

619
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,920
- He said we could skip it.

620
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,120
- Hey, we don't even have to watch that one.

621
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,800
My hair is bad.

622
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,680
CGI is just terrible in that movie.

623
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,160
- That's like a made snacks for my gamer hubby.

624
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,320
- Yeah, true.

625
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,160
- You know what I mean?

626
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,040
- Yeah.

627
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,040
- Marvel husband is a gamer hubby too.

628
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,880
- Yeah.

629
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,720
- But he's only playing the Avengers game,

630
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,400
the Square Enix, the Squeenix.

631
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,240
- The new one?

632
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,960
the ones that they lost like a hundred billion dollars on.

633
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Because who's gonna fucking, I don't wanna play this shit.

634
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,000
They already, they made a Spider-Man game that was good and they were like,

635
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,720
oh everyone's gonna want to do Avengers and it's like no, the Spider-Man is good.

636
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Literally that game, the first hour of that game you just play as like a girl walking

637
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,960
around a convention center and you're like, oh that's cool, it's fucking-

638
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:13,920
In Avengers?

639
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,240
Yeah, you're like, oh it's cool, it's Thor.

640
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,560
Oh that's cool, it's Iron Man.

641
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,960
You don't get to play as the Avengers for like an hour.

642
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,520
like Amazon was doing like whenever you order from Amazon for a while they would

643
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,040
send you in a package that was just like it was just the whole package was an

644
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:31,800
advertisement for Avengers so you would like get like I ordered what did I

645
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,880
fucking order might have been these headphones or something but it was

646
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,420
literally like it came in a package like did they send me a ventures for

647
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:41,760
PlayStation because it just says when Avengers just has the fucking Avengers

648
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,760
pictures all over it with the minions - they like minions minions they made a

649
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,560
lot of money on it yeah I mean minions made fucking money but the Avengers game

650
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,800
did not make... Did you see the... When we were growing up, was there a Minions style thing,

651
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:59,640
like an IP that was just so fucking popular? Yeah, there definitely was. I can't think of

652
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:04,840
it off the top of my head. Rugrats. What am I thinking? No, no, Rugrats was not as big as

653
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,680
the Minions, but I think when we were growing up, it was probably like... Mr. Meaty. I think Minions

654
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,240
is probably the first thing that occupied the same space that Minions does, though. And being

655
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,720
and like old people's like minions. It was still Tweety Bird at that point. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

656
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:28,280
Tweety Bird was just everlasting. Yeah. There's no like fucking rank. Like they were waiting until

657
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:35,160
like CGI, like the 3D animation was good enough to make a minion. Yeah. And they tried with Rango.

658
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,160
They tried with fucking. It was the mine seagulls from Finding Nemo. Oh you're right. Yeah. Yeah.

00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,780
Does your, do your parents not know about that video? Fuck no. Damn.

819
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,140
My parents know about that video.

820
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:49,500
I told you a crazy parent.

821
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:52,780
Your parents definitely check your phone every night when you're sleeping.

822
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:55,860
So no, they don't. Yeah, they do. My parents never checked my stuff. No,

823
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:59,500
you think that's just what you think. My parents never checked.

824
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:00,340
They check about it,

825
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,220
but not to check and make sure you're doing anything bad,

826
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:05,540
but just to laugh about it while you're sleeping. Yeah. Just be like our son.

827
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:08,020
We're so proud of our son being too proud of me.

828
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:13,620
That is funny. Yeah, my family to my parents are like hey, I'm so proud of

829
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:19,920
him. He's yeah, we don't know what he's doing, but he has asked for money in a

830
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,120
ever so we're okay.

831
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:29,320
Yeah, number five. He saw her without makeup. That's a fake story. I remember

832
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:33,620
days after her marriage. A 28 year old Arab bride was dumped by her 34 year

833
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:37,320
old husband after he saw her with no makeup. Apparently the man felt that his

834
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:41,160
had deceived him with cosmetics. The couple's engagement lasted for six months.

835
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:48,520
She did one of those Tim Burton makeup tutorials. Yeah, she looked like Jack Skellington.

836
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:54,360
He only ever saw her on a black background. He's like, "He looks just like Jack Skellington.

837
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,960
Beautiful, beautiful round head. Jesus Christ. Perfect skull."

838
00:46:57,960 --> 00:47:03,400
Matt Afterburner comments, "From what I heard, with the triple talak, a man in the Middle East

839
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:08,200
can divorce his wife just by saying to lock three times for whatever reason this

840
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:18,240
is just one the triple to lock I'm keeping that you have to go in the

841
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:23,440
bathroom and say to lock three times your wife gets sucked into the mirror

842
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:29,000
she becomes the next bloody Mary number six he found her secret love letters in

843
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,340
the 1940s. What does that say? I can't read that from here. A 99 year old Italian man

844
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:38,360
divorced his wife of 77 years after he stumbled across letters she had written

845
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:42,480
to a secret lover in the 1940s. The wife confessed to having an affair 60 years

846
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,560
ago and then desperately tried to persuade her husband to stay but he

847
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,240
just wasn't having it. What's the statute of limitations for you guys on an affair?

848
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:57,480
For me it's probably that. Probably that amount of time. 60 years? Yeah 60 years.

849
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,480
60 years is like, hey, you can forget it.

850
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:00,480
But 59 years?

851
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,480
59? No.

852
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,480
I mean, no fucking way.

853
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:11,480
No, look at it. It's like, it's the point, if I'm 99 years old, I'm not going to care about divorcing my wife. You know what I mean?

854
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:14,480
He's not thinking about the fact that he'll never get pussy again, dude.

855
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,480
Yeah.

856
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,480
Yeah, it's over for him.

857
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,480
His thing doesn't work.

858
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:22,480
I mean, he's probably, the strain of signing the divorce papers is going to take it like the last...

859
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,480
Yeah, dies in the office of the law.

860
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:31,080
I don't need the stress of filing for divorce if I'm 99 years old and Italian.

861
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:34,880
I would have just been like, "Okay, now I get to fuck an 18-year-old because you did

862
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,880
that."

863
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,380
Okay, this is on you.

864
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,800
You did that, so here it goes.

865
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,640
I'm going to fuck some OnlyFans woman right now.

866
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:49,440
What are their seven 250-pound, 40-year-old children going to think, dude?

867
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:50,440
That's a good point.

868
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:51,440
It's going to break their hearts.

869
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,440
Yeah, they're going to be like, "What?"

870
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:59,440
gonna be like what? They're gonna be like what? They're gonna be like what? WTF? Excuse?

871
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:06,120
Excuse? Sqoozy. Sqoozy. Realistically that's what they'd say. That's true. Number seven

872
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,640
he was cleaning too much. Yeah okay well if somebody was cleaning too goddamn much you'd

873
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,880
probably probably probably knock their block off. I mean maybe doing it to avoid his bitch

874
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:22,360
wife yeah yeah they didn't they didn't mention I'm angry vacuum before I'm not

875
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:25,160
gonna fucking lie like I haven't I've been I've never cleaned when I'm angry

876
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,680
fucking take this they didn't they didn't mention that he was he's cleaning

877
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:33,560
his wife that was the problem he was vacuuming his wife's body

878
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,600
you need to you need to rub I'm gonna rip you down with this

879
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:36,960
I'm trying to get you a job

880
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,960
I'm trying to get you a job

881
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:41,760
I'm trying to get you a job as one of those naked women that they serve sushi off of

882
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,760
you have to be as clean as possible yeah yeah yeah he was cleaning out all our

883
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:53,360
photo albums. He's cleaning out her wallet. Trash, trash, trash. Oh your purse is so dirty

884
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:56,300
on the inside. I gotta get rid of some of this stuff. Showing her a picture of a, or showing

885
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:59,960
her a hundred dollar bill and pointing to Ben Franklin and be like, "Who's this? Who

886
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:04,360
is this man? Who is this guy? What is he doing in your wallet? Why do you have a picture

887
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:09,040
of this fucking guy in your wallet?" Oh and this is his phone number? 100? Let's give

888
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,040
him a call. I'm gonna dial it right now. Yeah, let's give him a call right now. Oh, looks

889
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:23,420
like someone got wise. It says it disconnected. Number eight he refused to shower. An Egyptian

890
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:28,300
woman filed for divorce when her husband refused to shower for eight weeks

891
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:34,000
according to the husband he could not bathe because of a skin disease which

892
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,160
made him allergic to water however while a doctor did confirm he had a skin

893
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:45,300
brain disease. He had it. He said it never had you reading nothing to do

894
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,120
with water.

895
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:56,260
He was in the shower. I hear reading. What is so funny because yeah, you

896
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,860
can tell you're just checking everywhere you every time you say a

897
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:01,020
word you're checking if it's the end of the sentence.

898
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:10,020
I can't help that. I don't know how to Egyptian woman filed for divorce.

899
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:12,360
(laughter)

900
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:13,780
From her husband?

901
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,540
Yeah.

902
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,620
- What's the longest you've gone without a shower?

903
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:19,460
- Me?

904
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,300
- A hundred years.

905
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:21,120
- What do you mean?

906
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:21,960
There's two of you.

907
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,800
Either of you.

908
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,020
- I didn't know.

909
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:27,500
- I'm not asking, in what world would I be like,

910
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,420
only Pat, Cam, take a fucking minute off.

911
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:34,540
Pat, how long have you gone without taking a shower?

912
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:36,540
- Well, okay, if you're asking me now,

913
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,100
yeah, probably like five days.

914
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,200
- That's not that crazy.

915
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,040
- Yeah.

916
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,860
- I think--

917
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,660
- No, no, my routine used to be I would shower

918
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:44,760
as soon as I woke up.

919
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,140
- I think when I went camping for a while,

920
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:49,340
it was probably two weeks.

921
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,980
- A few years when I was taking baths.

922
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:52,820
- Just a couple.

923
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,640
- Just a--

924
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:54,480
- Mm, you fucking--

925
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:55,780
(laughing)

926
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,940
You're a trickster, dude.

927
00:51:56,940 --> 00:52:00,080
- Yeah, I don't know, probably like a week or so.

928
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,340
There's probably, but there's, yeah.

929
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:03,760
- I don't like showering.

930
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:04,600
No, I don't like it anymore.

931
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,420
- I like showering.

932
00:52:05,420 --> 00:52:06,260
- I used to like it a lot.

933
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,980
- I like showering, but now that I have long hair,

934
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:10,220
I don't like having to let my hair dry.

935
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:14,860
Oh yeah, since I cut my hair, my shower has decreased in time.

936
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,860
Yeah?

937
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:16,860
Yeah.

938
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,860
Yeah.

939
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,740
I remember when I cut my hair pretty short for me and I was like, "Damn, I'm in and out

940
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:23,740
of the shower."

941
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:24,740
For like three years now.

942
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:25,740
I can jack off way faster.

943
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:29,860
When I shaved my head completely bald, I just like...

944
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:31,740
Dude, it's easy.

945
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,140
You just jump in the shower, jump out.

946
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,660
Fucking pits and tits and I'm out.

947
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,660
You don't even have to dry your head when your hair is short.

948
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:38,660
I just washed my winky.

949
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:42,660
I hold the hole open and let it stream from the shower head.

950
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:44,660
Well, I got skin there.

951
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,660
True, you actually do have to do some work.

952
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,660
I do have to do some maintenance.

953
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,660
Thank God I'm a Christian.

954
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,660
You get one of those water jets from a dentist's office.

955
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,660
I spray the water pick at my wiener.

956
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,660
And then you also have one that sucks the water back up.

957
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:05,660
I close the hole up and I just keep the water in there.

958
00:53:05,660 --> 00:53:07,660
That's a good idea. You got a Velcro hole.

959
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,660
(Laughter)

960
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,660
You got a Velcro hole?

961
00:53:11,660 --> 00:53:13,660
Fuck.

962
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:15,660
That's not a bad idea.

963
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,660
Dude, imagine if you could shave like

964
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:19,660
your pubes so they were Velcro.

965
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,660
Yeah.

966
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,660
And then you could stick it to something else that was Velcro.

967
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,660
I'm almost certain you could put a piece of Velcro

968
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:27,660
on your pubes and it would stick.

969
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:29,660
That's probably true. But if it was like

970
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,660
actually Velcro.

971
00:53:31,660 --> 00:53:33,660
Wouldn't that be cool?

972
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:35,660
Wait let me think about this for a second.

973
00:53:35,660 --> 00:53:37,660
Wouldn't that be interesting?

974
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,660
Yeah that would be fucking awesome.

975
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,660
Yeah.

976
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,660
Why would I get stuck to?

977
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:45,660
Probably your mouth.

978
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:47,660
Just get stuck to the carpet.

979
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,660
Just face down on it.

980
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:51,660
I'll be a couple minutes late.

981
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:53,660
I do think sometimes.

982
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:55,660
He's trying to do a push up.

983
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:57,660
I do think sometimes about a guy falling over.

984
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,660
If you fell over

985
00:53:59,660 --> 00:54:01,660
and your penis got stuck

986
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:05,340
like a warm hole in the ground probably takes you a minute to get up you know

987
00:54:05,340 --> 00:54:13,600
yeah you're probably like yeah I must have pulled something I'm gonna be a

988
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,620
little late you guys go ahead on the hike I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm sorry

989
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:20,460
I'm trying to pull myself up here

990
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:37,100
It's a volcano. Would you fuck a volcano? Yeah. If I was God. Yeah. Yeah, if I was God.

991
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:41,620
There's a there's like the Chappelle show Godzilla sketch he fucks the

992
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,180
volcano and I remember watching that when I was younger and being like. It

993
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:49,480
awoke in something in you? No I was like why would he fuck the volcano his penis

994
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,060
would burn off. Here it is fire in his mouth. That's true.

995
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:56,980
It's actually not fire, it's an atomic ray.

996
00:54:56,980 --> 00:55:00,700
Now I brought up Godzilla and now Cameron's not going to be able to talk for the rest of

997
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:01,700
the episode.

998
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,860
I just need to correct something really quick, okay?

999
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:06,500
He said something that was wrong, I'm not going to just like...

1000
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:10,000
Well alright, number fucking whatever.

1001
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,220
Number nine, she won the lottery and wanted to keep the money all to herself.

1002
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:15,220
That's a good reason.

1003
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:16,220
Yeah, that's a very good reason.

1004
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:17,220
I think that's a very good reason.

1005
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:18,220
Yeah, absolutely.

1006
00:55:18,220 --> 00:55:19,220
That's a fine enough reason.

1007
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,060
I just won ten million dollars and yeah, I'm keeping it.

1008
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:28,500
you seen that video of the it's the aunt and nephew and the oh yeah I think I

1009
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:39,780
have seen this video it's the aunt and the nephew and like the aunt finds out

1010
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:43,820
at the lottery office that they are sharing their winnings and she goes it's

1011
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:49,260
not what I agreed to she'd like sharing their winning because I think she bought

1012
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:53,140
the ticket and then he scratched it for her so she went down to the office. How do you

1013
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:59,100
prove that? With the nephew and was like yep we won together and then the they

1014
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:02,620
brought out like two checks or something. Oh yeah. Yeah and then she freaks the

1015
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:07,500
fuck out yeah. Damn. It's a really good video. That's fucked up dude. I'm gonna just kill

1016
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:13,620
my nephew. Take the money. Right there? I mean yeah. Kill my nephew and then I'm

1017
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:19,700
doing a Cain and Abel thing. I would kill anybody for money. Okay. Yeah. Okay, number ten I think

1018
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:25,900
is the most justified one so far. Yeah. She was possessed by the devil. That's fucking

1019
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:30,300
clear cut, dude. An Italian man has been granted a divorce by claiming his wife is possessed

1020
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:36,620
by the devil. Apparently, she displayed inexplicable behavior. Yeah. Including fits, body stiffening,

1021
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:38,700
even self-levitation.

1022
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,900
- Whoa.

1023
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,900
- Crescential. - Self-levitation's

1024
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,740
pretty cool.

1025
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,340
- Yeah, I would marry him all over again.

1026
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:48,020
- Yeah, damn, let's just go renew our vows.

1027
00:56:48,020 --> 00:56:50,300
I didn't realize you were some levitating ass pope.

1028
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:52,300
- You took your vows in midair?

1029
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,940
If you levitate while you're renewing your vows,

1030
00:56:55,940 --> 00:56:59,260
you're technically not on land.

1031
00:56:59,260 --> 00:57:00,500
- Yeah, it doesn't count.

1032
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,340
It severs your connection to Earth Spirit.

1033
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:04,180
- You can't get married in water?

1034
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,020
- No.

1035
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:06,020
What do you think?

1036
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:07,020
You think it's a mermaid?

1037
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,020
Yeah.

1038
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:09,020
Tell that to a mermaid.

1039
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:10,020
Oh, you already said that.

1040
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,020
Tell that to some crabs.

1041
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,020
Yeah.

1042
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:13,020
Tell that to Sebastian.

1043
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:14,020
Tell that to a fish.

1044
00:57:14,020 --> 00:57:15,020
Yeah.

1045
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,020

1046
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:17,020

Say some more.

1051
00:57:21,020 --> 00:57:22,020
Say some more in water.

1052
00:57:22,020 --> 00:57:23,020
Yeah.

1053
00:57:23,020 --> 00:57:24,020
Yeah.

1054
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:25,020
Tell that to a guy and a girl in a bathtub.

1055
00:57:25,020 --> 00:57:26,020
Yeah.

1056
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,020
Tell that to two boats that love each other.

1057

Yeah.

1065
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:41,520

00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:37,000
with divorce divorce is so strong like

1085
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,000

1086
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,240
strong yeah yes have a long

1087
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:46,320
so what's how what do you what do you guys divorce over

to what I divorce if I don't want to be married yeah

1089
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,480
while probably a bit probably

1090
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,720
double homicide double D's yeah that's right double D's next door

1091
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:03,640
peace yeah I'll see you later yeah double homicide Caleb's paradox is when

1092
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:07,880
you're is when they're two women who live on either side of you with double D's

1093
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:11,880
and you keep getting you keep getting divorced and remarried over and over

1094
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:14,960
you're trapped in an infinite loop yeah that would be a nightmare

1095
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:21,560
don't be so awful oh my god I hate that fuck no bitches right next to each other

1096
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:30,680
it will mean twins to Cameron you just said that please no oh fuck the Caleb

1097
00:59:30,680 --> 00:59:42,480
dilemma what if you marry one twin and you get to forget dude what is dude can I

1098
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:58,920
get a high five? What if a pizza guy had no money? What if the lady had wanted pizza?

1099
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:07,400
Well? Okay. I'm not feeding her. Go on. You're joking. Do you guys want to get pizza after

1100
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:12,680
this? No. Maybe. I had pizza already. I might have a slice or something. I had pizza last night. I had frozen pizza last night.

1101
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:17,280
We said already I assume today. Yeah. Yeah. That's a lot different. I was gonna say

1102
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,800
yesterday but I just stopped it already. Well because then it makes no sense that you won't eat pizza

1103
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:26,320
two days in a row. I just don't want to. I mean we can. I'll just I'll just hate you

1104
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:34,120
forever. That's Caleb's dilemma. Yeah. That's the true Caleb's dilemma. That's the real dilemma. Yeah.

1105
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:36,120
I'll get pizza.

1106
01:00:36,120 --> 01:00:37,120
Alright.

1107
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,120
Sounds good.

1108
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,620
I mean if you guys really hate me that much.

1109
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:41,620
Pizzazz!

1110
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,720
We'll have to find something that's open if it's not pizza.

1111
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:44,720
Yeah.

1112
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:45,720

01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,520
I'm sorry, you smell like one.

1150
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:12,520
Because you look like, with that hat and that facial hair, you just look like a robber from

1151
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,520
a movie.

1152
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:14,520
It's true.

1153
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:19,280
I did, when I first shaved my head bald, I wore my black beanie all the time, the one

1154
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,280
that I still have today.

1155
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:29,400
And my friends medals teacher told me I look like Joe Pesci in Home Alone.

1156
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:33,360
You should just start walking around dressed in all stripes with a giant burlap bag over

1157
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,360
your shoulder.

1158
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,360
That would be so fucking funny.

1159
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,360
That would be funny.

1160
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:37,360
And a black beanie.

1161
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:38,360
Yeah.

1162
01:02:38,360 --> 01:02:39,360
Yeah.

1163
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,360
I would not be that funny.

1164
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,360
That's not bad luck.

1165
01:02:41,360 --> 01:02:42,360
Yeah.

1166
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,360
All right.

1167
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:44,360
All right.

1168
01:02:44,360 --> 01:02:45,360
I think we're done.

1169
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:46,360
Yeah.

1170
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:47,360
I gotta eat something.

1171
01:02:47,360 --> 01:02:48,360
Yeah, me too.

1172
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:49,360
Bye, y'all.
