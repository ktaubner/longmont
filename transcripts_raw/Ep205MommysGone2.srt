1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Come here, come here, come here.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:02,080
Let me see your butt.

3
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,340
(laughing)

4
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:06,920
(upbeat music)

5
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:10,040
- Crap monster.

6
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,860
(laughing)

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,040
(explosion)

8
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,080
- Okay. - Okay.

9
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,340
- All right. - No mommy.

10
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,480
- I think we got it to work.

11
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,320
- Oh my God, dude.

12
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,360
- No mommy, I think we have no,

13
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,960
this is, mommy's gone too.

14
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,240
- Mommy's completely gone.

15
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,420
- Mommy's out of town. - She's out of town again.

16
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,640
- And it doesn't matter where she went.

17
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,600
I don't care if she's with other boys

18
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,320
and being just completely out of town with other boys.

19
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:34,160
because she's not here. And the important thing is the two kids and

20
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,840
brothers, you and me, actually learned how to press all the buttons and start all the things.

21
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,520
We learned how to do the recorder and we learned how to do the... I guarantee you that somebody's listening to this

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,160
right now and it's just completely... Well you have the headphones on. Yeah but I

23
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,920
have bad hearing because I actually have bad hearing. Why didn't you let me do that? I had bad hearing. I had an

24
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,120
ear infection when I was nine years old. I ruined my hearing forever. Really? Yeah, every

25
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,920
time I open my mouth I hear four pops. I have TMJ. I have TMJ, that's what the

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,520
doctor said. I just didn't know if you knew what TMJ was. If I click my... If you click

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,020
your jaw... I can hear yours, that's weird. That's not what I have. Yeah, I've

28
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:16,820
definitely done it on the show before. Oh, that's scary. Yeah, I have a lot of dental

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:23,080
stuff that I... I should start a medical GoFundMe. Definitely, you should. I really

30
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,820
I can't afford any of these fucking dental bills

31
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:26,900
that I have to pay.

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,920
Don't you have a dental credit card?

33
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,000
Yeah, they made me take out a credit card.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,840
The dentist did.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
The dentist fully made me take out a--

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,240
The dentist said, "First of all,

37
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,300
"you need a credit card."

38
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,140
Yeah.

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:37,960
Wow.

40
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,480
Well, I had $8,000 of dental work I needed done,

41
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,640
and then I couldn't afford all of it,

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,460
so they made me take out a credit card

43
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,400
for the remaining $3,000,

44
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,320
and I've been paying that off for the past two years.

45
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,140
Wow.

46
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,140
Jesus Christ, that's so much fucking dental debt.

47
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:01,140
I know. And I have like probably like $15,000 more dollars I need done.

48
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,140
What the fuck could you put... Are you getting shark teeth put in your mouth?

49
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,140
Yeah.

50
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,140
What are you getting for... Really?

51
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,140
I'm getting full... I'm adding more teeth into my mouth.

52
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,140
More lit rows of... That would be cool to get rows of human teeth.

53
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
Yeah.

54
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:18,140
See, this is the kind of stuff that we only come up with when mommy is completely gone.

55
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:19,140
When mommy is not here.

56
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,800
When mommy is gone, the company--

57
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,640
Watch this.

58
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,460
Yeah?

59
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,460
I just took a bite of a banana.

60
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,580
And nobody can say anything.

61
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,500
And nobody yelled at me.

62
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,340
'Cause I don't care if you eat.

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,460
I'm not your mommy.

64
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,300
Right?

65
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,140
I'm just your brother.

66
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,140
I'm just your twin brother, and I'm sitting across from you.

67
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,180
We're two twin brothers.

68
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,020
It's just that simple.

69
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,020
And Cameron is a complete mommy.

70
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,500
Mommy is not around.

71
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,140
Mommy is not anywhere to be seen.

72
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,980
I don't see a mommy.

73
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,500
I think it's $15,000 a dental day.

74
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,700
It might be another $8,000.

75
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,140
Did they say you have to, it's gonna be 15K.

76
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:51,220
- I have to get my wisdom teeth out,

77
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,060
and then I have a bunch of cavities

78
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,300
that I need to get fixed.

79
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,300
- I mean, how many is a bunch?

80
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,800
Is every single tooth cavitied?

81
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,180
- Well, I also need to get a,

82
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,500
the reason that I have cavities and chipped teeth,

83
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,400
I have a shit ton of chipped teeth.

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,240
- Mm-hmm.

85
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,080
- And a lot of like--

86
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,980
- You have a shit ton of chipped teeth.

87
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:10,820
- Yeah.

88
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,640
- I mean, come on, no mommy.

89
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,180
- I have this one cavity up top,

90
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,740
and then I have to suck food out of it,

91
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,820
and then when I do, it tastes bad.

92
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
You know what I really want?

93
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,820
It constantly takes notes.

94
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,820
You know when the dentist is like burning your tooth

95
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:25,820
or like grinding your tooth down with the thing

96
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
and it smells like burning bone?

97
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,820
Your dentist burns and grinds your teeth?

98
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:32,820
With the little Dremel thing?

99
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,820
With a pickaxe?

100
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,820
No, nobody's ever put a Dremel in my mouth.

101
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
Well, you've probably had better dental health than me.

102
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,820
When I go to the dentist, they...

103
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:42,820
And I brush my teeth generously once every two days.

104
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,820
And when I go... I'm 100% serious.

105
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,620
And when I go to the dentist, they go like, "You've been keeping up on brushing, haven't

106
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,620
you?"

107
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,620
And I say, "Yes, ma'am."

108
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,060
And I think the reason why, I've thought about this before.

109
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,060
I think dentists...

110
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,060
Maybe because you call them ma'am and sir.

111
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,060
I'm very polite.

112
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,060
Maybe they're like, "Well, let's kind of tell them."

113
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,060
Let's kind of tell them.

114
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,060
Let's cut them some slack.

115
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:01,060
Yeah.

116
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:05,660
I think that dentists have an inflated idea, or a deflated, I guess, of what average dental

117
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,140
hygiene is because most people lie to their dentists and say, when they're like, "Do you

118
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,260
brush twice a day?"

119
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,260
And they go, "Yeah."

120
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,860
But if they brush once every two days...

121
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,700
See, I actually do brush twice a day.

122
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,020
Really? And you're that fucked up?

123
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,860
Yeah.

124
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,960
I hate brushing my teeth, man.

125
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,800
Me too.

126
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,620
I hate taking care of myself.

127
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,960
I don't like showering.

128
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:22,800
I don't like brushing my teeth.

129
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,620
You should see what my bedroom looks like right now.

130
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,160
My girlfriend hasn't been, like,

131
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,920
she's been off on business.

132
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,760
Yeah.

133
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,940
I have not cleaned my room once.

134
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,780
Yeah.

135
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,000
That's bad, dude.

136
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,460
That's how I used to be in Boston.

137
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,300
Yeah.

138
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,140
Yeah.

139
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:35,960
Baby girl used to come over,

140
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,680
basically just clean my room.

141
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,020
Clean my room and I'd make the worst

142
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:39,860
fucking dinner the whole time.

143
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,460
I guess my roommate was telling me last night,

144
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,620
said that like one time I was here recording or something and she was like

145
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:55,420
staying over and he heard a bag full of bottles clinking in the living room and

146
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:59,960
Neil walked out and was like what the fuck is going on and she was like oh he

147
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:08,260
thinks I don't know he hides bottles under his bed. I'm not doing like a full deep clean you know I'm not

148
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,980
I like that a deep clean to you is just getting the bottles off the floor yeah I

149
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,380
I live like that lady from Evangelion most of the time.

150
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,580
- Never seen that show.

151
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,420
- Yeah.

152
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,700
- I've never seen any, I've seen Naruto.

153
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,460
- I used to, so I got into Naruto the week of my birthday

154
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,300
and then I bought a shit ton of Naruto action figures

155
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,880
and then never watched Naruto again

156
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,460
and then just had all these fucking Naruto action figures

157
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,380
for the rest of my life.

158
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,220
- They're cool, dude.

159
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,980
It's cool that he, I only think I started watching--

160
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,340
- I used to get told I looked like Rock Lee.

161
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,460
- Who's Rock Lee?

162
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,380
- The guy with the bowl cut and the big eyebrows.

163
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:45,700
yeah. Because when I was a kid I had a bowl cut and big eyebrows. Yeah I've seen

164
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,340
pictures of you as a kid. Yeah. Yeah you do look like that a little bit. Mm-hmm.

165
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:54,140
Have you been watching Naruto? No, no I watched it as a child. I watched it as a

166
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,140
child and there was a part where he becomes naked. He's a child. He's

167
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,100
eleven years old. He's a child and they make him naked. He tries to seduce old old men who

168
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,300
look like the Jedi of whatever they're called. Uh-huh. He goes yeah I'm gonna use

169
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:11,340
my sexy jitsu on you. I haven't seen it in a long time. I forgot about sexy jitsu.

170
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,940
And the clouds cover his mom's pubis and his nipples on his breast.

171
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,460
No, you see most of the breasts, honestly. Really? Yeah, and so the guy, he goes

172
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,100
"sexy jitsu" and then the guy who's got gray hair, this guy's got to be in his 50s or 60s.

173
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,100
There's a poster! There's a poster! Oh yeah, there's a Naruto poster.

174
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:32,100
Oh my god, I cannot believe he was right behind me the entire time.

175
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
It's my girlfriend's Naruto poster from middle school.

176
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,100
Oh my god, he's even younger than I remember.

177
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
This kid is like nine years old, right?

178
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:38,600
Yeah.

179
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:44,100
So he says "sexy jitsu" and then this fucking guy, who's clearly in his 60s or 70s,

180
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
gets horny as hell.

181
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,100
He goes "oh!" and then he's got that blush on his cheeks.

182
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
I wish that happened in real life.

183
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:55,100
When you get horny you get those lines.

184
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,100
Me too, that'd be so awesome.

185
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Your cheeks go red and you're like "ooh!" and you get the lines on your cheeks and shit.

186
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
That'd be so dope.

187
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:05,780

193
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,060
doing great without you.

194
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,240
Huh?

195
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,500
- What are you guys doing right now?

196
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,900
- Oh, nothing.

197
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,040
- No mommy.

198
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,880
- No mommy.

199
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,700
- No mommy.

200
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,740
- We're having a no mommy moment.

201
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:39,580
- Yep.

202
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,940
- And you're basically ruining it by being here.

203
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,780
- What do you mean?

204
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:45,420
I'm just calling to see what you guys are up to.

205
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,800
- We're staying up as late as we want

206
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,160
and basically eating a fucking over one and a half servings

207
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,000
of food at a time.

208
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,040
- Let me tell you the amount of sugars in this drink.

209
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,880
Oh shit.

210
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,660
- Yeah, yeah, tell him how many sugars.

211
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,040
- 41 grams.

212
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,740
- There's 41 grams of sugar in what he's drinking.

213
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,740
And I'm having caffeine past four o'clock.

214
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:03,740
Patrick, stop standing on the bed.

215
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:04,740
Nope.

216
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,740
He can stand on the bed if he wants.

217
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,740
We wore shoes inside today, so I bet Mommy's pretty unhappy about that.

218
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,740
Yep, I'm wearing complete shoes.

219
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,740
Mommy's such an attention whore that she actually has to call us in the middle of the "No Mommy" episode.

220
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:15,740
I know.

221
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,740
Oh, you guys are doing an episode I didn't even know.

222
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,740
[Laughter]

223
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
You're a complete mommy.

224
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
You're completely mommy.

225
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,740
What are you guys doing?

226
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,740
If you wanted to be on the episode, you would have stayed here.

227
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,580
- You would have stayed here.

228
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,780
- Yeah, you would have come home.

229
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,620
- Yeah.

230
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,460
- Feeling sick?

231
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,280
- Feeling sick?

232
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,460
How did you even know to call us right now?

233
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,980
What is wrong with you?

234
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,260
You have some kind of preternatural mommy sense.

235
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,500
- We should have taped up all the webcams in here.

236
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,420
- You guys might be in danger or need me.

237
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,420
- We're not in any danger and we're actually,

238
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,260
we don't need you.

239
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,340
And I would say that you're actually

240
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,960
a hindrance on the episode.

241
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,060
We have a lot of stuff planned.

242
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:48,900
We were gonna maybe do a--

243
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,020
- Do you guys even care that I'm shopping

244
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,740
at Rope's Shoe Barn in Plastown, New Hampshire right now?

245
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,580
- Where?

246
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,300
- Yeah, mommy's getting a new pair of shoes.

247
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,140
Where?

248
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,140
In Plastow?

249
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,060
- I was born in Plastow.

250
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,440
- You better be at DSW

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
because my mommy only deserves the best.

252
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,000
- Okay, well you guys behave, okay?

253
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,960
- If you're in Plastow, you should go to the Savers.

254
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,720
It's really big.

255
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,720
- Yeah, I know about the Savers here.

256
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,020
- The Plastow Savers is really, really big.

257
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,680
- This is a conversation,

258
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,820
this is a mommy-son conversation.

259
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,520
She can call you on your jitterbug.

260
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,360
- That's true.

261
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,520
Not my jitterbug, my firefly.

262
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:39,040
firefly yeah okay okay okay okay he doesn't know about the new TV oh yeah no

263
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,800
we didn't definitely get a new TV okay bye mommy yes Joe Joe gave us a big what

264
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:49,400
is that like 70 years TV yeah we don't know where to put it but Joe just put it

265
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,960
right in front of Caleb's desk yeah I just can't even access my desk yes I

266
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,040
I think we could put it on this wall, maybe like hang it up.

267
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Yeah.

268
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,360
But I don't know.

269
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,680
I feel like it's kind of fucking annoying when your mom just like, unrelated to the TV thing.

270
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,680
Yeah.

271
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,720
When your mom just like can't fucking leave you alone when you're just trying to have

272
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,360
a fucking good ass time with your bro.

273
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,760
Isn't that fucking annoying?

274
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,720
Dude, you're preaching to the choir right now.

275
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
Right?

276
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
Knocking on the basement door.

277
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
What are you doing down there?

278
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,760
I made ants in a log.

279
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,400
Yeah, it's like bitch, I know that you're coming down here.

280
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,280
And I'm not going to say bitch to you.

281
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,280
I'm gonna say "bitch" to my friend.

282
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,280
I'm gonna be like, "Bitch, I don't want any ants on a log, thank you!"

283
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,280
Yeah, well you say "thank you" so she doesn't know.

284
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,280
Yeah.

285
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,280
But she can feel it.

286
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,280
"Bitch, bitch, you stupid bitch."

287
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,280
I actually don't want anything to do with you, mommy.

288
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:38,280
And I don't want your ants on a log.

289
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
That's not for me.

290
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,280
I would hate it if I got ants on a log right now.

291
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:44,280
If you're gonna bring me a snack, can you at least make it like pepperoni?

292
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,280
Beef jerky.

293
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,280
Or beef jerky.

294
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,280
Pepperoni beef jerky.

295
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
Pepperoni jerky.

296
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,280
You know when you buy the pepperoni in a bag?

297
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,280
You ever get that as a kid?

298
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:57,960
I never bought, see when I was a kid, I was a very weird child.

299
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,240
I found out that Hannaford Supermarket, my mom talks about this all the time, you could

300
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:13,580
buy a wedge, it's like a little small wedge shaped box full of shrimp with cocktail sauce

301
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
at the tip.

302
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,580
That sounds so good.

303
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,040
Oh, you told me this, you ate 25 of them.

304
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,040
No, well I have eaten a whole bag of shrimp before.

305
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,040
That's awful, bro.

306
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
In a sitting.

307
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Shrimps freak me out.

308
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,040
I used to, it would cost five bucks, it was like a little shrimp cocktail thing that you

309
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,040
could get on the go.

310
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:35,540
My siblings would be getting candy bars and shit and I would come back with a little thing

311
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,400
of shrimp.

312
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,920
That makes a lot of sense to me.

313
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,240
That you'd be like, "Oh no, I don't like sweets, I like savory things."

314
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,840
And somehow, even though you were eating shrimp cocktail as a kid, still got fucked up teeth.

315
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,680
- Yeah.

316
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,120
- I was eating all the candy I wanted to.

317
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,160
- I was also eating a lot of candy too.

318
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,240
- Oh yeah, that's a bad combo.

319
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,600
- If I had the opportunity to get shrimp,

320
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,360
I would get shrimp every time.

321
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,360
- Shrimp over candy.

322
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,960
- Shrimp over candy for sure.

323
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,420
- That's honestly crazy to me.

324
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,260
- Yeah?

325
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,960
- Yeah, I feel like, I still don't like shrimp as an adult.

326
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,200
I went to, I got some shrimp shumai.

327
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,040
- That's insane.

328
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,280
- Ugh.

329
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,560
- You're crazy for that.

330
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,400
- It's like five--

331
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,520
- Shrimp is my favorite food.

332
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,160
- But those baby shrimps they put in shumai,

333
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,200
it's like 5,000 fucking crushed up shrimps, disgusting.

334
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:21,600
I like that. You're just an odd duck. I can't believe you're my twin brother.

335
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,520
Mm-hmm. Makes almost no fucking sense. That's like with my roommate I eat

336
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:30,440
sardines and every time that I'm- You like sardines. If I eat sardines and he's

337
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:35,280
in the same room he says he he goes he makes like a noise and leaves the room.

338
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:41,080
Really? It affects him that deeply? It goes to his room. I've never- If I eat

339
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,880
because I made I made like a sardine toast. Uh-huh. I just took like a nice

340
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,840
piece of sourdough, layered out the sardines on it, ate it like that with a

341
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:56,280
little bit of, you know what I put on it? What? This fucking goat cheese.

342
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,800
That goat cheese that comes in the terracotta thing. I knew it was gonna be something. I knew it was gonna be goat

343
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,840
cheese. Yeah. That means that Neil is fucking, he's fucking, he's a

344
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:08,040
Greek-a-phobic, Greco-phobic. Yep. He doesn't want anything to do with the

345
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,320
Mediterranean people. Yep. Because he thinks they smell and their food smells.

346
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,280
You know? And you, middle of the summer, you're sweating. I know you got a shirt

347
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,000
off in that kitchen. You're making sardine toast with goat cheese. I mean you look like

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,720
Pestanopolis or some shit. You're sitting there, you're looking like a Greek god and he's jealous.

349
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:32,360
I do look like one of those Greek gods but if it's the Greek god of diabetes.

350
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,240
No because they would get way fatter. I'm not going to say you look like the Greek god

351
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:44,640
of Apollo. The Greek god of 24 hour diners.

352
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:49,360
Yeah, something like that. Yeah, no, you would look right at home with like a...

353
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,040
Like a tank top with like a...

354
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,720
Big rag on the side.

355
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,040
Big rag on the side and I'm just like shaving Euro meat off of a spit.

356
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,480
Yeah, exactly. You're just sweating so much. I've been doing it for 50 years.

357
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,960
Oh, yeah.

358
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,840
I saw a video the other day.

359
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,280
I have a big Greek flag pendant.

360
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,840
Yeah.

361
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,080
I think I should start dressing like this.

362
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,600
I think you should too. I saw... You know what I hate? I've been seeing a lot of people

363
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,140
dressing like they're in the 1970s recently a lot of them yeah get that

364
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,860
shit out of my face I don't I there's like dudes wearing bell-bottoms again

365
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:25,460
and it's like yeah like the coolest way to dress is is a like 90s style yeah or

366
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:30,380
maybe we're in big-ass jeans or like Easter Bunny or Santa Claus but yeah if

367
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:36,060
you're going 70s you don't don't go like cool bell-bottoms and stuff you know yeah

368
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:42,240
go like David Koresh. Look like David Koresh yeah or wear like a

369
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,260
pinstripe suit yeah yeah and maybe go maybe go to maybe two decades

370
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:52,380
earlier or actually you know what no that's perfect two decades 70s but you're

371
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,300
dressing like like really big collar mm-hmm just like the crushed velvet

372
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:02,420
suit. Do you think that that that late late 2000s early 2010s is ever gonna come

373
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,940
back. It already is. Really? Like teach me how to doggie yellow skinny jeans and stuff?

374
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,780
Yeah. You think so? I think that it's coming back but I don't think jeans that tight will

375
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:17,680
ever be back in style. But I have noticed an uptick in like, there's like the people

376
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,840
dressing like Y2K. See, no mommy, we can finally do Patrick's fucking fashion corner. Right?

377
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:28,140
This is what, this guy's on the streets patrolling right now. All day, every day. You're walking

378
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,540
I'm walking around. I'm in Soho. Yep. I'm following these people. I'm in a Sherlock Holmes outfit.

379
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,240
Following tons of women, tapping them on the shoulder.

380
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,140
Excuse me. I'm a street photographer. I'm a street photographer. Can I have a photo?

381
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:46,940
Can I take a photo of your big-ass pants and your small shirt? Yeah, please.

382
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,240
I have been seeing... yesterday I saw a woman in Etnies. That's sick. Yeah.

383
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,400
That's fucking dope. Like the pink Etnie, like the Molgoth. People are dressing like

384
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:01,860
mall goths again and I'm like 2010 mall goths and I'm I mean I think I'm I think

385
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,580
I am down with that I think I'd rather you haven't had an episode since we were

386
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,940
in the Pacific Northwest I feel I feel I feel acutely acquainted with the goth

387
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,420
subculture at this point yeah in time went to a place called the coffin Club

388
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,940
yeah there's an actual coffin there and not only is there a coffin there's also

389
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,900
spiders and there's is skulls as well there's a big Ouija board on the floor

390
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,700
yeah and we and there was a little person there and I don't know if that

391
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:33,100
was part of the theme. Caleb got a text from me at one point. I think I was

392
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:38,080
upstairs buying a drink. I got a crazy text. I sent Caleb a text that just said

393
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,860
there is a woman here with a slave. And then I looked down at my phone, I

394
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,300
was at the bar, I looked down at my phone and then I looked up and who was walking

395
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:52,220
towards me but this woman with her slave. She had elf ears on. Yeah and

396
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,920
And you know, at first I thought it was maybe

397
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,520
what would you do episode.

398
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,340
- Yeah.

399
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,180
- And it was like, what would you do

400
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,280
if a woman was walking around with a slave?

401
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,540
- And a goth, but then you had to put,

402
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,940
once you put goth club in there.

403
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,360
- Exactly, it's like, oh well probably,

404
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,680
there's probably more than one slave here.

405
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,520
- Yeah.

406
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
- And maybe they take turns.

407
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,580
But I don't know, that slave seemed like she was

408
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:13,000
doing a damn good job.

409
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,840
- Yeah.

410
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,420
- Yeah, and you could tell who the master was

411
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,260
'cause she had elf ears.

412
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:20,400
- The master had big elf ears and they had them on a chain.

413
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,360
- Yeah.

414
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:25,640
And I was like, man, I guess they're just like doing like,

415
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:29,000
I wasn't weirded out by it at all.

416
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,520
- Were you surprised at how okay you were with slavery?

417
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,120
'Cause that doesn't surprise me.

418
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,640
That yes, you, a slave walked right by you and you said,

419
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,480
hmm, okay, interesting.

420
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,480
You said, instead of I'll text my friend,

421
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,520
you should have said, I'm gonna text 911.

422
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,360
- Yeah. - And you should have

423
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,440
called 911. - But I think,

424
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,300
I think it was a sexual thing.

425
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,840
That should still be illegal.

426
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,680
- Yeah.

427
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,720
- I think, yeah, I think slaves,

428
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,640
people fucked slaves all the time.

429
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,880
- Yeah, look at Thomas Jefferson.

430
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,720
- Thomas Jefferson was a fucking--

431
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,560
- They called him the slave fucker.

432
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,400
- They did.

433
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,220
- Yeah.

434
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,880
- He was like, he was putting up wilt numbers.

435
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,360
- Yeah, dude, he was the most prolific.

436
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:07,200
- Slave fucker.

437
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,040
- Yeah.

438
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,480
- And I don't want, you know,

439
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,440
this person who's walking around the coffin club

440
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,200
could have been the next Thomas Jefferson.

441
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,520
(laughing)

442
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,360
You know?

443
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,000
And no founding father.

444
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,640
She could have been fucking, she could have been--

445
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:24,000
- You know what was crazy about that was we went there,

446
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,660
then the next day went to Seattle, two days later,

447
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,660
and we did see this small woman who looked pretty old there.

448
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,880
- That's what I'm saying, we saw the same, oh yeah,

449
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:36,720
it was the same little person.

450
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,880
- We saw the same old little person two days in a row.

451
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,280
- Unmistakable little person.

452
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,120
- Oh yeah.

453
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,400
- Yeah, and was just walking around,

454
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,600
in two cities, three hour drive apart.

455
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,440
Just walking around.

456
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:52,660
the same as like going to like upstate New York. Yeah but to see them two times in

457
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:57,400
a... that's true. To see them on the sidewalk. Yeah. Just randomly. And also...

458
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,480
Seeing them at a goth nightclub and then seeing like it's like seeing like an

459
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,280
NPC at a place it's like somebody's like... Exactly, they reuse the texture. They did like a

460
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,240
console command to spawn them on that sidewalk. It's like when you when you say

461
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,400
when you're in a video game you get a quest from somebody and they're like okay

462
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,600
I'll meet you there and then they stay there and you walk away and then you get

463
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,800
to the new place they're already fucking there that's what it was like oh yeah

464
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:23,520
it was like she gave us a quest she was like go you need to get as far away from

465
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,260
the slave driver in Portland as possible and we said yes ma'am next day we see

466
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:33,240
her there right and we didn't even get XP for that no we should have I think we

467
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,680
did I think we got a lot of XP on this trip I think so I think I'm getting

468
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:43,320
ready to level up yeah I've leveled up to my goth tree yeah I've completely gone

469
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,680
I think I realized that I would be a really fucking good goth based on my looks.

470
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,180
Me too.

471
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:53,400
You're a little too swarthy, honestly. You're like, I feel like you would go, you'd be, you should be at a pirate bar.

472
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,920
Let me be, I look like a, like a skeleton. You let me be a goth guy.

473
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,420
I think I look more goth than, I think I know more about goths than you.

474
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:05,720
That doesn't mean anything, you could be a historian, right? That doesn't make you a, you can be a...

475
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,700
I think that's, I think that'd also be a cool look at the goth club, as if I'm dressed up like the gothic professor.

476
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,180
Oh, you could be like kind of a goth Indiana Jones type. Yeah. Yeah that

477
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:20,100
That bow house record belongs in a museum. There we go say stuff like that. Yeah

478
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:26,380
Okay, but did goths okay museums then though? No, hey that they go to mortuaries

479
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:33,180
Yeah, that uh that that alien six fiend record belongs in a mortuary belongs in a mausoleum mausoleum

480
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:38,380
There we go. Uh-huh easy did yeah, but I do think that God belongs in an alcove

481
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:44,260
There we go an alcove. Yeah, that's a that's a that's a joke for for real Goths

482
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:49,140
It's really fucking hard to talk and do all these dials. Yeah, there's two dials

483
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,820
We need to rest. I think I think everybody needs to respect mommy more

484
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:57,860
I don't need to know cuz by the time by the time that this is listen if I was doing this for three years

485
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:04,380
I'd be a pro true right and mommy, you know, I love her right? We love mommy

486
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:08,180
No, exactly a pro at this show. I mean I hate to say it

487
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,480
it. So it's good that I'm learning, you know. I learned how to do this, you

488
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,460
learned how to press play on the timer. Yeah. You know what, I got it the timer to

489
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:24,340
go up. Oh shit. Yeah, you see how it says up? Yeah. Yeah. That's pretty legendary.

490
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:29,960
Uh-huh. Pretty cool. Yeah. So now that we've invaded the Goths and I think

491
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,380
they accept us. That's one thing I'll say about the Goths. The Goths are very accepting.

492
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:37,640
accepting us. So we went to the goth club we went to four different goth clubs.

493
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,020
Yeah and I yeah we did. I'd like to know about some in New York because I again I

494
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:48,340
really I enjoyed the people. So we went to four different ones then ended up at

495
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,900
coffin club we went there met the bartender then came back the next night

496
00:21:53,900 --> 00:22:02,100
in face paint. Yeah we got a bunch of face paint for our Portland show yeah

497
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,580
and then we didn't have time to take it off before we went back to the goth club

498
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:09,620
and so we showed up the first night we let's be real we looked like complete

499
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:14,000

They're like, "That's the wrong coast."

506
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,280
We were saying cap, we were saying fam.

507
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,120
It wasn't working with them.

508
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,240

00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,880
You're supposed to say bam.

00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,720

00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
Yeah, bat, cape, skull.

They say like, "Yo, that's mad skull."

513
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,660
- It is mad scully in here.

514
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,300
- Yeah, like that's skull AF.

Yo, that's some brimstone.

517
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,140
- Yo, you look like obsidian right now.

518
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,180
- Yeah, you straight staked up.

519
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,480
That's what they be saying.

520
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,320
But then they'll say it like that.

521
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,140
- They say stuff like that, yeah.

522
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,380
coast kind of New York accent. Yep. But anyway, then we show up the next day, we

523
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:08,500
hit the upgrade button. Oh, absolutely. My face, white as snow. Patrick's face,

524
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:13,660
completely green. It was gray. Completely gray. It was gray because I tried to

525
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,060
layer. My lips, black as night. My eyes, black as night. Patrick's eyes, black as night.

526
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:24,580
Patrick's lips, wax red lips. Mm-hmm. Just looked like a Mr. Potato Head. I looked

527
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:29,460
like old Greg. Yeah, you looked completely like old Greg. Uh-huh. Which, I mean,

528
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:35,140
honestly fit in. I fit in well in there. I wanted to pull up like a mime though. I

529
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:38,500
think that would have been a better look. Yeah, I think if next time I think we all go

530
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,860
Next time we pull up like mimes. Yeah. Mimes got to be part goth, right? Yeah. The thing is a mime

531
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:49,300
can't even talk. What's more kind of sad than that? Yeah, and they're always sad.

532
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,220
Goth music, I was pretty surprised. I'd never heard a goth song before that I knew of,

533
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,340
but then we got in there. They're playing like Depeche Mode and shit. Depeche Mode.

534
00:23:56,340 --> 00:24:00,980
if you want to be a goth you gotta say Depeche Mode.

535
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:06,980
Depeche. No, I don't want to be a goth. I'm a Spaniard. Why are you becoming, why are you

536
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,980
changing up? Why are you changing up now? Because I'm, because I was, I dabbled, right? But honestly

537
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:17,300
I'm a culture vulture. I'll cop to it. Yeah. I just want to be a fucking culture vulture. You are.

538
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:22,660
I've been about being goth. You have not been about being goth. You're wearing white. I'm wearing,

539
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:27,100
I had a whole goth playlist ready when we got to Portland.

540
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:33,620
Yeah, Spotify presents. Nope. Goth 90s. It was my own gothic playlist. No. I had a lot of...

541
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:38,140
I had Killing Joke on there. That's a Batman movie. Nope. That's a band.

542
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:44,620
I like you give a fuck about bands. I do. I give a fuck about the goth culture. I was

543
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,580
pulling up with mad knowledge. I was spitting facts at them. I was educated.

544
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,140
They honestly they thought I was an OG and you know what the G stands for.

545
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,980
- Old goth.

546
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,820
- Yep.

547
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,100
- I pulled up like an OG too, old Greg.

548
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,360
(laughing)

549
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,620
- Yo, he's a OG, OG.

550
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,820
- Yeah, dude, that's OG, that's old Greg.

551
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,200
- Yeah, you pulled up, you were like,

552
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,040
"Yeah, bartender--"

553
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,900
- "Wanna drink Bailey's out of my shoe?"

554
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,740
- "Can I get Bailey's straight up in a shoe?"

555
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,660
- "Can you serve me Bailey's in my shoe?"

556
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,500
- Yeah, right now.

557
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
- Thank you.

558
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,340
- I don't like Bailey's.

559
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,740
I don't like any of those creamy ones.

560
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:18,700
- I don't know, I did, I had white Russians

561
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
on Christmas a couple years ago.

562
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
ago. Oh, actually, white Ukrainians.

563
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,540
That's in a white Ukrainian.

564
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Same ingredients.

565
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,660
Yeah, but we just don't fuck with the Russians anymore.

566
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:33,260
Remember, whose birthday were we at?

567
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:35,260
Did a bar we were at have a white Ukrainian?

568
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,260
Yeah.

569
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,260
I tell you what, a lot of the--

570
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,260
It was at KGB.

571
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
A lot of the bars--

572
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,860
It was at fucking KGB, dude. They changed it to like--

573
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,860
That's fucking hilarious.

574
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:49,620
Yeah, they tried to change other shit to Ukrainian stuff. They were like, "We only sell Ukrainian

575
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,620
vodka."

576
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:58,620
Oh god. Yeah. Come on bro. Who gives a fuck? Yeah, that's not my war. Dude 1940s. I'm buying it

577
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:03,100
I'm buying a fucking Jeep tell you that much. Yep. I'm buying it. I'm buying a Volkswagen. That's a damn good car

578
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,740
Right

579
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,740
It's a car of the people. That's what

580
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,540
Volkswagen is a damn that is what Volkswagen translates to 1944 folks folks. Yeah car folks folks

581
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:22,080

587
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Volkswagen, they got a little beetle looking motherfucker.

588
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,800
- Volkswagen, right, you call the dealership,

589
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:52,960
you're like, I want something nice, right?

590
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,200
Something foreign, right?

591
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,680
I hate these American cars.

592
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,720
Something where maybe the steel came

593
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,240
from a questionable place, right?

594
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,120
And, 'cause it makes it cheaper.

595
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,720
And he says-- - Oh, that's a fly.

596
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,560
- He says, tell you what, bud.

597
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,840
- That's a spider.

598
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,560
- All we got-- - I'd be fine with that as a goth.

599
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,360
- All we got is this Volkswagen Beetle,

600
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:22,240
steering wheel monogrammed HH. We just got this in. The previous owner passed away and

601
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,720
wanted to get rid of this. Exactly. And we go, "Oh, you know what? I mean, HH, that could

602
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,760
stand for anything. Honk honk. That's why it's on the steering wheel." That's why it's

603
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,400
in the middle of the steering wheel because you say honk honk. That's why it's monogrammed

604
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:38,800
right there. So you look, you're like, "Ah, really? Where's my horn? Where do I press my

605
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:43,600
horn again. HH Honk Honk. There it is. See and I'm going okay. You could also look at

606
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,480
that too. I'll buy that. Two HH next to each other. That's the parallel lines in

607
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,920
the middle of the road. Exactly. There's so many ways. It could be two ladders if

608
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,840
you stack them on top of each other. Right? If you overlay them on top of each

609
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,200
other it's just one H. And who knows what that stands for. Maybe just honk

610
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,240
once. Yep. But it's got instructions right there. You know what I mean? I don't know.

611
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:09,080
I just feel like it's uh, I feel like it with the Russian vodka shit, if you want to enjoy

612
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,760
yourself a fucking Smirnoff Ice, by all means.

613
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,760
You know?

614
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,120
And you know I want a Smirnoff Ice.

615
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
Yeah, dude.

616
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,640
You know, when I get iced, I don't freak out.

617
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,160
I actually enjoy it.

618
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,960
It's like basically a sativa.

619
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Yeah.

620
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,960
Beer is an indica.

621
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,960
Yep.

622
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,120
And Smirnoff Ice is a sativa.

623
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Yeah.

624
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,600
And Mike's Hard Lemonade is a hybrid.

625
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
I agree.

626
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Yeah.

627
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,840
found out they make is a Simply Lemonade, spiked lemonade.

628
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,840
Really?

629
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,320
Had two of those last night.

630
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,400
Holy shit.

631
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,040
The Simply Limeade, that's a bit of a game changer.

632
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,720
I think that's how I got fat as a kid.

633
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,400
Oh, earlier we were talking about pepperoni.

634
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,280
I don't know if I've ever told you this.

635
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,640
It's really not that important of a story.

636
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,640
I don't know why I'm bringing it back.

637
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,360
When I was a kid, I thought pepperoni was a vegetable.

638
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,840
Yeah, you told me that before.

639
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,840
I did?

640
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:57,840
Yeah.

641
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,840
Isn't that fucking stupid?

642
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,840
That is crazy.

643
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Imagine if it was a vegetable that tasted good as pepperoni.

644
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:06,360
There are, well I guess mushrooms aren't a vegetable, but there's a bunch of mushrooms

645
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,000
that taste like, there's like mushrooms that taste like lobster.

646
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,720
Oyster mushroom, I like an oyster mushroom.

647
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
Yeah.

648
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
King oyster mushroom, that's a big mushroom.

649
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,200
King oyster mushroom, you can make some vegan scallops.

650
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,120
Yeah, I mean I've never had a scallop before though.

651
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
Really?

652
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
Yeah, I haven't had much.

653
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Not even a scallop and bacon?

654
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
No, I've had very little seafood.

655
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:28,720
I've definitely talked about my scallop and bacon incident, right, where I got food poisoning

656
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
so bad that I--

657
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,720
Because you had frozen scallops?

658
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,880
frozen scallop that expired two days, I think, later.

659
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,720
But I, the first time I've ever pooped and puked.

660
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,200
- Like same time or same day?

661
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,320
- Same exact, like same time.

662
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,160
- Wow.

663
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:48,960
- I was on the toilet and like simultaneously,

664
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,200
it was like a demon was leaving my body.

665
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,360
- Yeah.

666
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,280
- It was insane.

667
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:58,080
It was like, like, blech, like that's the sound I made.

668
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,440
I sounded like the boomer from Left 4 Dead.

669
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,560
- Oh shit.

670
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,400
- Think about the boomer and think about

671
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,480
how bad it probably smells.

672
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,580
- Think about how bad he feels walking around.

673
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,420
You know what I mean?

674
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,240
- Yeah.

675
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,160
- Like he's fucking, first of all he's got

676
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,480
body image issues, right?

677
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,560
- He's got cellulite.

678
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,340
- He's fat as a balloon, he's got cellulite

679
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,040
all over his body, he's dressed terribly.

680
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,880
- Yeah.

681
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:21,700
- Okay?

682
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,540
- That shirt does not fit him.

683
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,220
- Everybody he's running up to trying to touch

684
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,060
are running away from him.

685
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,920
- And then when he gets hit he explodes.

686
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:32,720
It would be funny if a zombie apocalypse happens and it follows the left 4 dead

687
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,800
rules of like you become whatever you kind of were. Where like oh you're a

688
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,680
you're a woman, you become a witch, you're a fat guy, your whole things you run

689
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,760
around you diarrhea and throw up on people. What the hell is the hunter

690
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,160
supposed to be? I think the hunter is a stoner. Oh because he wears a hoodie? Yeah

691
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,960
- Yeah, it's like a Kid Cudi type guy.

692
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:55,800
- Oh, okay.

693
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,540
- You know, I knew a couple of Kid Cudis.

694
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,740
I've told you that, there was a guy--

695
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,300
- Oh, the kid who changed his name?

696
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,100
- Yeah, last name Mess Cudi, Dylan Mess Cudi.

697
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,520
- He changed his last name to Kid Cudi's last name.

698
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,080
- As far as I know, yeah.

699
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,420
- That is so sick.

700
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,180
- And then I think he quit rap shortly after,

701
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:15,940
so he's just sitting at a Best Buy, Geek Squad status,

702
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:18,660
just with a name tag, says Dylan Mess Cudi.

703
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,940
And let me tell you, by looking at this guy,

704
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,840
you'd never think he's related to Kid Cudi.

705
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:29,720
blonde hair could have dyed it blonde hair no Frank Ocean okay yeah you get me

706
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:43,280
yeah yeah yeah yeah remember that time we saw Frank Ocean at that bookstore hey

707
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,720
who the fuck's that guy reading the Berenstain Bears wait didn't it used to

708
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:55,240
be called the Berenstain Bears? I'm gonna write this book and call it the Berenstain Bears.

709
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,200
It was Berenstein everyone thought it was an E. I think it's most Mandela

710
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,040
effect stuff is just so stupid. Yeah no I think it's real actually. I don't know.

711
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,880
Nobody knows what's going on there could be a Mandela effect.

712
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:14,440
I don't care. Right? What is it that people think that they... it's funny that

713
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,480
that people think that they just skipped a timeline.

714
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,400
- I think that's possible too, dude.

715
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,240
- Yeah?

716
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,160
- Yeah, I mean anything is,

717
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,640
I think, I truly believe anything is possible.

718
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,680
- That's a good way to live.

719
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:28,400
- Right, no, it's a scary way to live.

720
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,800
What if I get, what if a needle,

721
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,980
what if a needle goes into my body?

722
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,800
And it's got radiation on it.

723
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,040
- Oh, shit, okay.

724
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,160
- Doesn't that sound pretty bad?

725
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,360
- It does sound crazy.

726
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,920
- Yeah, I want that. - That sounds scary as well.

727
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,080
- It is scary, thinking about that kind of stuff.

728
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:47,160
I watched Nope yesterday, I watched that new Jordan Peele movie.

729
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,520
Do not give me any spoilers.

730
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
I have not seen it.

731
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
I'm not going to spoil it.

732
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
I'm not going to spoil it.

733
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
I've got to go to the movies soon.

734
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:56,560
But I'm sitting there and I'm thinking, "Man, that could actually fucking happen."

735
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Yeah.

736
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
You know?

737
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,560
Because anything could.

738
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,880
Anything is possible.

739
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,880
Get out?

740
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Not so much.

741
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,880
That could not happen.

742
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,880
That could not happen.

743
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,880
No, it doesn't make any sense.

744
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,840
I don't think Bradley Whitford could be mean.

745
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,840
Is that the guy?

746
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:09,840
Is that the dad?

747
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:10,840
Yeah.

748
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:11,840
He's cool.

749
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,800
Marnie from Girls is in that.

750
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:18,240
she play? Oh the girl who eats the Froot Loops? His love interest, his girlfriend.

751
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,920
That's Brian Williams daughter? Yeah. She got her ass ate on TV. Yeah and let me tell

752
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:28,480
you something I saw it and I think that guy was going hungry that night. He was

753
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:33,800
going to bed with an empty stomach. She's got no ass. Yeah. I thought you meant

754
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,920
that it looked too clean. It looked too...

755
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:45,440
that's why he was eating her buddy I'm hungry for poop I need poop right now I

756
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,680
guess she probably does have a clean butt yeah you think is the female celebrity

757
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,840
with the nastiest stinkiest but probably Marilyn Monroe you're not allowed to say

758
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:01,800
a dead person or Lizzo who do you have female celebrity she knows she's famous

759
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,240
she takes care of herself what do you know doesn't straight-up doesn't wipe

760
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:14,200
Did you read that Marilyn Monroe, like, biopic, or something about like people like...

761
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:18,120
Don't tell me there's about to be a scene in this Anna de Armas movie where she don't wipe her ass.

762
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,920
It's not that she doesn't wipe her ass, it's just that like she would like,

763
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,840
I guess, there's like this story that came out that she would like just

764
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:29,400
eat like chicken wings and shit in her bed and just leave the plates under her blankets and stuff.

765
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,360
And like...

766
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,400
That's normal girl shit.

767
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,920
She would fart and like burp everywhere.

768
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,840
and just like... She's farting? She was farting in front of everybody. She's releasing pheromones

769
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:46,440
like a bug dude. She's fucking walking around. I guess her ex-husband Joe DiMaggio said something

770
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,720
like how he was surprised at how disgusting she was or something. Really? Joe DiMaggio?

771
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,960
Which also like, I don't know, maybe that's just like a 1950s guy just not like

772
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:01,240
realizing that women burp and fart too. Yeah I think it was probably more of a like you were

773
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,920
finally in private with this woman. She's rich and famous enough that it doesn't matter if

774
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,120
she farts in front of you. You're not going to ruin her career.

775
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:14,120
She has more money than you and he's just like, "Dear God. Women poop. Women poop!"

776
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:21,600
Who is the guy, Fatty Fucker, who fucking...

777
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,600
Fats Domino?

778
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,160
No.

779
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:23,760
Fatty Arbuckle.

780
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,600
Yeah, who fucking killed a million women or something.

781
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,600
He killed a million women by sitting on them?

782
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Yeah, I think so.

783
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:32,880
Okay, well I still I still think Marilyn Monroe maybe had a nasty butthole

784
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,400
But I do I told you no it has to be a lot. I do remember. I do remember somebody

785
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:45,900
fucking Trisha Paytas started like only fans, and she posted like a whole photo and she had

786
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:48,840
toilet paper all over her butthole

787
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:52,520
Really yeah by God. That's awful

788
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,120
Yeah, I feel like male celebrities. I honestly I guess is the exact opposite of what your question was, huh?

789
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,640
Yeah, because that does show that at least it was clean. Yeah, I would say

790
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,080
But male celebrities who do you got because I think top two has got is probably like Homer

791
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:15,840
Yeah, Griffin probably Homer and Peter Griffin. I was gonna say yeah Slimer from Ghostbusters

792
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:21,220
I do Jack Harlow if Peter Griffin was actually a Carlos pubes and asshole

793
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:26,840
He mentioned that they also they also they make him look more like mr. Tumnus. Yeah

794
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:32,120
This is based on his B. I know he's got full hair. Yeah, I got a fawn from the legs down

795
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:37,640
That would be so cool to convince Jack Harlow to dress up like mr. Tumnus. I think it'd be easy

796
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:40,520
He looks so much like he should be a fawn

797
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,280
I think it little Nas X told him that there's a they're gonna make a music video where he sucks his dick

798
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,040
He'd probably put on the the fawn pants. Yeah. Yeah

799
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:53,800
Damn, that would be crazy, but I bet his pubes are nice and patchy and like an s-shape or something

800
00:36:53,800 --> 00:37:00,400
Yeah, because it's just based on his facial. I tried to do a Naruto arrow once with your avatar

801
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:07,060
I'm I do a tasteful landing strip right down the middle. I don't do that. You don't do a landing strip my

802
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,040
my penis skin grows hair

803
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,960
Mine too, I guess I shave your balls

804
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,600
I looked at my I looked at my shaft and I saw two hairs on it. That was dude

805
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,040
I got fucking a hundred hair

806
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,020
I thought - well

807
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:27,540
I was looking more at it and then I was just like oh like even on like the tip where like the like the skin you

808
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:31,920
Have a you have a hair on your tip not on the tip, but like the skin. Oh, I

809
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:37,820
Still I still got my I'm I'm I'm I'm made completely in God's image. I was not

810
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:42,060
I was about to do plants versus zombies to you, bro. I was about to fucking shoot you

811
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:45,580
Is that one of your pubes hanging out of your pants?

812
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:46,460
Yeah, that's one of my pubes.

813
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,220
Holy shit, that thing's long as fuck.

814
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:51,340
Yeah, dude, look, it's like I'm a marionette on my penis.

815
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,340
(laughing)

816
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,420
See, this is the kind of conversation you can't have with mommy.

817
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,260
This is the kind of stuff Cameron would not let us say.

818
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:01,260
No, no, he'd be, she'd be, "Oh, you're being nasty."

819
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,060
You're being nasty.

820
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,180
You know how Cameron is.

821
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:05,020
"Oh, you're being so nasty."

822
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,020
Oh, I need you to completely stop.

823
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:10,540
"I don't like to hear all this pee-pee-poo-poo-penis humor."

824
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:14,820
I don't want to hear that. I don't like it. I completely don't like that.

825
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:22,220
Hunched over, hands like this. Coach Steve-ish style. Long, yeah, complete Coach Steve. Long,

826
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:28,100
long fingernails on Cameron, right? Beautiful painted fingernails. You know those like the

827
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:33,260
lady, the cartoon lady with the gray hair and the big sunglasses and it says like, "I'm

828
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:38,020
not over the hill." Yeah, the greeting card lady. Yeah. What's her name? I want to say

829
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:41,680
it's Margaret. We'll say it's Margaret yeah she's kind of a mean-ass fucking

830
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,820
bitch. Or it's Kathy I think it's Kathy. I like the ones where she where it's like

831
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:49,900
it's like 18 plus and you put you pull it up it's like yeah I love my grandkids

832
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:53,700
but not as much as I love getting fucking anally fucked. Happy birthday

833
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:58,340
grandson. Old woman. Yeah and it's her you know it's like and she's heard she

834
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:03,940
says happy birthday I love getting I love getting sucked on. Yeah. My nipples.

835
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,540
Yeah, I like getting peanut butter licked out of my hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

836
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,180
My name's Margaret and this is a picture of it.

837
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,540
My name is Old Margaret.

838
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:16,260
Yeah, I'm a fucking old stupid-ass fucking bitch and my grandma, my nana,

839
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:21,380
she goes to the Hallmark store once a year. She buys a hundred cards. I swear to

840
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:25,380
God. The top drawer of her dresser. The most easily accessible drawer.

841
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,940
Does she have her own little Hallmark store?

842
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:33,300
No, no, she doesn't sell them to other people. She's not like a dropshipper.

843
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,060
No, she has them and then when it's somebody's birthday or an event so that she doesn't have

844
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,580
to go out and do it, she just grabs it from her collection.

845
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,580
That's not a bad idea.

846
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:45,900
She has one for like every age range, you know.

847
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,300
She goes to the middle age section, she goes to the early age section, she goes, condolences,

848
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,300
you know.

849
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:54,840
Maybe she runs out of cards sometimes, ended up sending kind of a sexy anniversary one

850
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:58,140
on somebody's, when somebody's like teenage son does a car accident.

851
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,000
ever one of my favorite things to do in high school was uh go to the the

852
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,420
greeting card section and just put like the funny ones in like like loss of

853
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,980
husband yeah that'll that'll fucking own them yeah yeah cuz but well but somebody

854
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,700
trying to find something for their grieving friend and it's just like yeah

855
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,220
who the hell yeah or a hell a trying to cheer herself up when her husband does

856
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:23,420
yeah but she gets there and it's kind of funny you know she sees a chimp and it

857
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,220
says like it says going ape over you yeah I'm going ape because you're turning

858
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,500
six years old. She goes, "Oh my god, I'm turning six years old!"

859
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:38,460
Finally, I'm six. I'm finally six. "Oh my god, how was my husband dating me when I was

860
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,020
five?" And then he died. And then maybe she'll feel better about it. Maybe he had a heart

861
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,100
attack because of her age. Yeah, yeah. "How old are you, honey? We've been together

862
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:55,340
60 years." I think I'm five! According to this card, I'm this many. Yeah. "Oh my god,

863
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:58,800
I've been dating a five-year-old for 60 years. Oh, that'd probably be his last

864
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,980
words. Oh my god, I'm going to die even though I was dating a five-year-old. I'm not going to

865
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:05,300
heaven for this. I'll probably go to hell, I just realized because I'm dating a five-year-old.

866
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,860
That would be honestly the fucking worst. Yeah. Imagine you've been dating somebody,

867
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,500
you're hitting your 75th anniversary, right, and you go,

868
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,580
"Here, I'm gonna go, honey, I'm gonna go grab us some drinks, but the bartender

869
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:22,300
requires an ID for everybody. You know, I know he's not gonna ask for it, but it's

870
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:26,740
just good to have it just in case you know she cuz she's got bad legs she got

871
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:31,980
a bad hip you're chasing this fly around like Walter White so you walk up you

872
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:36,140
bring your ID you put them both on the counter it says she was born seven days

873
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:40,700
ago wouldn't that be fucking heartbreaking that'd be the worst thing

874
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:44,220
in the world you'd have to instantly kill yourself yeah right you've been dating

875
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,100
even with this woman 75 years and it's like a Benjamin Button thing exactly

876
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:52,060
yeah well that's the questionable thing about Benjamin Button when did she stop

877
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:56,860
fucking him yeah yeah a really good question cuz there's like the one maybe

878
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,220
we do that in the movie I haven't seen a long there's the one point where they

879
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,180
start to kind of look the same age yeah yeah they intersect yeah and that might

880
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,780
be the only time it was okay - well I mean either way it would have been

881
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:11,540
pretty bad I think I kind of wish I aged like that

882
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:17,220
reverser yeah like I'm growing more hair you know I think I would not want to

883
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:22,500
disappear or go back up my mom what happens at the end of Benjamin Button

884
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:29,740
I've never seen literally just did you get so small he disappears that's so

885
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:35,700
smart that is a good idea yeah they just fucking they came and there's no ashes

886
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:41,140
to fucking spread he's just a piece of nothing damn yeah so they probably

887
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,660
squished him like a fucking bug that's what well at some point it's like well

888
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:49,180
this is I mean come on Roe v. Wade style let's fucking he's he's let's crush him

889
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:52,580
yeah yeah let's put him in a vacuum we're gonna crush him we're gonna put him out

890
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:56,660
of his misery dude he's fucking sitting there he's red once he turns into a red

891
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:02,060
thing he's a he should turn into red mist yeah so I guess we have a list or

892
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:08,020
something oh yeah yeah I wanted to just do a little um it's like an interview

893
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,700
type thing you know okay people don't get enough yeah of your personal do

894
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:15,340
people yeah there's I don't think I've ever said anything personal on this show

895
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:19,460
yeah yeah even within like the first I guess like whatever like 30 minutes

896
00:43:19,460 --> 00:43:23,380
prior no no not at all so I'd say anything about my girlfriend or no no no

897
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,580
I think that maybe we just need to get to the bottom so so I brought these two

898
00:43:26,580 --> 00:43:30,100
these basically these metal things that just because we might get kind of

899
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:33,260
intense so you want to have something so I hold I hold these two metal things

900
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,020
connected to that here we're connected to that machine right yeah well yeah it's

901
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,800
- It's another recorder, it's a backup recorder.

902
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,660
- Oh, okay, so that's gonna record the--

903
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:42,500
- Yeah, so we're just gonna--

904
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:47,160
- What is it in, like it says, I see the ohm symbol there.

905
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,000
- It's just the brand. - This is like

906
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,580
electrical volts? - No, it's just the brand.

907
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,420
- Okay. - Yeah, so don't worry

908
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,620
about that.

909
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,980
Just gotta check the levels.

910
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:55,060
So, basically, you're gonna, so put your hands on that,

911
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:56,100
we'll mount your mic.

912
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,940
Okay, perfect, so put your hands on that.

913
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:01,020
- All right, I got my hands on the two metal things.

914
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,500
- Basically, just don't think about these questions at all.

915
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,220
- Okay. - Okay?

916
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,020
All right, and we're just gonna go through these, okay?

917
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,940
Have you ever debased a nation's currency?

918
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:15,700
Ooh, that's a tough one.

919
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:17,300
Is that tough for you?

920
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,140
That's a tough one 'cause I don't know.

921
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:20,100
I don't know if I'm supposed to say anything.

922
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:22,300
Maybe you're supposed to just say yes or no.

923
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,540
No, you probably gotta give a sword.

924
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,540
Maybe?

925
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:25,380
Maybe.

926
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:28,660
Have you ever killed the wrong person?

927
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:29,540
No.

928
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,180
No, never.

929
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,380
No.

930
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:35,460
Have you ever torn out someone's tongue?

931
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,380
No.

932
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,380
No?

933
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:39,220
Maybe.

934
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:40,040
Maybe?

935
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,460
What about your own tongue?

936
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,100
I've stuck it out.

937
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:47,100
I don't know if that counts.

938
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,500
I don't think that counts.

939
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,220
Have you ever been a professional critic?

940
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:53,660
I guess, I guess technically that is my job.

941
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,780
I guess in a way it is, you're critiquing things.

942
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:56,740
It's my job too, I guess.

943
00:44:56,740 --> 00:44:58,420
But this isn't about me, this is about you.

944
00:44:58,420 --> 00:44:59,260
Hands back on the thing.

945
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:00,260
Okay, sorry.

946
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:02,260
Have you ever wiped out a family?

947
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:05,060
Ooh, that--

948
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:05,900
I'm getting some interesting readings here.

949
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,060
A family of humans?

950
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,060
It doesn't say.

951
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:13,020
'Cause I do a lot of stuff with mice.

952
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,220
When you say, well, I guess I can't ask you

953
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,620
that follow-up, it's not on the thing.

954
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:17,580
Yeah.

955
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,540
I will say your rating just went off the charts,

956
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,660
so we'll take that as a yes.

957
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,500
Okay.

958
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,680
Have you ever tried to give sanity a bad name?

959
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,060
Which I don't know what that maybe like,

960
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:29,460
maybe sat in the middle.

961
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,160
Maybe saying like, "Let's go crazy."

962
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:36,340
Maybe you sat and went to the mall and you said, "Bah!"

963
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,180
Or maybe you stuck out your--

964
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:39,820
Maybe I said, "Wait 'til the elevator, don't,

965
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:42,540
"oh no, let's go, let's go crazy, let's get nuts."

966
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,700
All right, here's a better version of the question.

967
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,020
I'm just gonna rewrite this real quick.

968
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,940
I hope they don't mind.

969
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,060
Have you ever photobombed someone?

970
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:50,900
Oh, yes.

971
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,180
All right, well, that's pretty insane of you.

972
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,100
Have you ever consistently practiced sex

973
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:56,960
in some unnatural fashion?

974
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:01,660
By a natural fashion, you have to imagine maybe one of those big Tyrannosaurus Rex

975
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:03,160
inflatable suits or something.

976
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,160
Yes.

977
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
Yes.

978
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,060
Have you ever made a planet or nation completely radioactive?

979
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:10,860
Oh, yeah.

980
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:11,860
Okay.

981
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:13,620
Have you ever made love to a dead body?

982
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,180
I'm going to do another quick edit.

983
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,020
We'll just say, have you ever fingered or above?

984
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:21,580
Have you ever gotten a second base with a dead body?

985
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,580
No.

986
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,580
No.

987
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,580
First base?

988
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:25,580
No.

989
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,580
Okay.

990
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:28,580
Have you ever engaged in piracy?

991
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:30,060
In piracy?

992
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,060
In like sailing the seven seas.

993
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:35,340
Have I engaged in piracy or in piracy?

994
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,340
In piracy.

995
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:38,460
In piracy, yes.

996
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,460
Have you ever been a pimp?

997
00:46:39,460 --> 00:46:40,460
Yes, every day of my life.

998
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,460
Oh for show.

999
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,460
Hold on, I'm taking my hands off to film you.

1000
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:45,180
Yeah, that's right, no that's okay.

1001
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:47,660
Have you ever eaten a human body?

1002
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:52,620
Which I would count as second base, so you've already answered this one.

1003
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,140
Okay.

1004
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:58,780
Have you ever disfigured a beautiful thing?

1005
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,300
Well I shave, sometimes I shave my face.

1006
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:03,460
And you nick yourself?

1007
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:10,100
I shave my penis, I shave a lot of parts of my body, and I think naturally I should keep

1008
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,180
the hair there because God wants it to be there.

1009
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,180
Of course, yeah.

1010
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,620
So I guess that's technically, on a technicality, yes I have.

1011
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,620
Okay.

1012
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:20,020
Have you ever exterminated a species?

1013
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,020
Yes.

1014
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:22,020
Okay.

1015
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,700
Have you ever been a professional executioner?

1016
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:25,660
I'm talking Black Hood, Giant Axe.

1017
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:27,580
- Yes.

1018
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,300
- Have you given robots a bad name?

1019
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,460
- Hundreds of times.

1020
00:47:31,460 --> 00:47:34,300
- Okay, have you ever set a booby trap?

1021
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:35,140
- Yes.

1022
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,740
- Okay, have you ever failed to rescue your leader?

1023
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,300
We'll say mommy.

1024
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,120
- Oh yeah.

1025
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:40,960
- Have you ever failed to rescue mommy?

1026
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,620
- I have failed to rescue mommy, yes.

1027
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:44,820
- I hate disappointing her, but it happens.

1028
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,180
Have you ever, or have you driven anyone insane?

1029
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,020
- Yes.

1030
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:50,540
- So have you ever been, have you ever maybe had,

1031
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,700
forced somebody into a photo bomb on a dare?

1032
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,740
Okay, have you ever killed the wrong person?

1033
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:56,300
We already talked about this one.

1034
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,140
Yeah.

1035
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,960
It's almost like it's repeat,

1036
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,940
like it wants you to just assess these more.

1037
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,820
Is anybody looking for you?

1038
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:03,700
Yeah, mommy.

1039
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,980
Have you ever set a poor example?

1040
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
Absolutely, 100 times, yes.

1041
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,640
Okay, hold on one second,

1042
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,120
I need to dial a couple things in.

1043
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:15,300
Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?

1044
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,140
Yes.

1045
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,940
Okay, are you in hiding?

1046
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:20,780
Yes.

1047
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,600
Okay.

1048
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:29,300
Okay. Have you systematically set up mysteries, maybe like escape room style?

1049
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:34,980
Yes. I applied to work at an escape room in Boston, Massachusetts, and in the interview process,

1050
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:41,780
my friend said that I gave the worst interview that the employer has ever seen.

1051
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:45,700
That's right. Anjan Biswas did say that. Yeah, I do remember that.

1052
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:51,460
Have you ever made a practice of confusing people?

1053
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:53,660
Maybe going up and going, "Buh!"

1054
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:57,700
Maybe, I don't know, there's probably hundreds of hours of me confusing people.

1055
00:48:57,700 --> 00:49:01,000
I would say you've set up shop doing that exact industry.

1056
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,800
Have you ever philosophized when you should have acted instead?

1057
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:04,400
Yes.

1058
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Yeah? Have you ever gone crazy?

1059
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:06,960
Yes.

1060
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,700
Yeah? Like, permanently? Or like, "Oh, I'm so..."

1061
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:10,700
Yes.

1062
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:14,660
Okay, alright. Have you ever sought to persuade someone of your insanity?

1063
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,460
Like maybe, for example, going like, "I'm completely a loony!"

1064
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:18,900
Yes.

1065
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,660
You've said that before?

1066
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:25,500
I've said I've looked at people in a store and I said I'm completely crazy.

1067
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,140
Well, did you say I'm completely a loony or a loon?

1068
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,780
I said...

1069
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:29,820
Crazy could be like...

1070
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:30,940
A nyuck nyuck nyuck.

1071
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:34,380
Well, that's basically a Zoidberg Marx.

1072
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:36,060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1073
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,820
Have you ever sought to...

1074
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:38,380
Oh, no.

1075
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:41,580
Have you ever deserted or betrayed a great leader?

1076
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:42,540
Yes, mommy.

1077
00:49:42,540 --> 00:49:45,100
Oh, have you ever smothered a baby?

1078
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:45,740
Yes.

1079
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,260
And what, you know, nacho cheese?

1080
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:47,980
I mean, come on.

1081
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:49,040
Yeah.

1082
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:53,840
Well, again, I do a lot of stuff with mice and small animals.

1083
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:54,840
Oh yeah, I guess that's a baby too.

1084
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,880
And I do a lot of bedwetting and setting fires.

1085
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,160
Do you deserve to have any friends?

1086
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,160
Yes.

1087
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,240
Okay, have you ever castrated anyone, yourself included?

1088
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:04,240
Yes.

1089
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,040
Do you deserve to be enslaved?

1090
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,040
Yes.

1091
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:11,720
Okay, I'm gonna take a note of that.

1092
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:15,320
Is there any question on this list I had better not ask you again?

1093
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
Yes.

1094
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:17,320
Yes.

1095
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,040
ever tried to make the physical universe less real?

1096
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:20,880
- Yes. - Been like,

1097
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
"Just tone it," just like late night.

1098
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:24,840
- I have, there has been many times

1099
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:26,560
where I've told God to knock it off.

1100
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:28,080
- You're sitting on the hood of a car, right?

1101
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,320
You're looking up, and you say,

1102
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,240
"Just take it down a notch."

1103
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:32,080
- "Give me a break."

1104
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,240
- "This shit is getting a little too much for me."

1105
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,160
- "Give me a break."

1106
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,880
- "I'm getting too fucking old for this shit."

1107
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,600
- I think if you, so, I mean,

1108
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,960
when you say, "Give me a break, give me a break,

1109
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,520
"give me a break," at that Kit Kat bar,

1110
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,760
who were you asking?

1111
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,600
- God.

1112
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:52,160
God. Just give me a break! Give me a break, give me a break of that cat bar. Have you ever

1113
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:58,880
zapped anyone? A hundred times. A hundred times you've zapped someone? I've zapped a billion

1114
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:04,760
different people. Have you ever had a body with a venereal disease and if so

1115
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:09,960
did you spread it? No. You've never done, well that was the last one. That was the

1116
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,480
last question? Yeah but I guess we can keep doing more. I guess I need to, well I

1117
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,640
I guess, I mean, hmm.

1118
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,160
- What if I, how about I ask you these questions now?

1119
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,200
- Okay, well there's gotta be more of those.

1120
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:23,080
They're from some, from some church.

1121
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,080
Let me just look it up.

1122
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,080
I can't remember what it's called.

1123
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:26,920
- Okay.

1124
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,040
- Something's got it. - Why don't I ask you

1125
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:31,440
the same questions because you didn't answer them.

1126
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,080
- I mean, if you want to, yeah.

1127
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:34,800
- Yeah, I could just pull these up.

1128
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:41,720
Okay, so have you ever debased a nation's currency?

1129
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,200
- Oh wait, I got more.

1130
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:44,680
I have more.

1131
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,160
Yeah, nobody wants to know anything

1132
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:48,480
about whether or not I've fucking debased currencies.

1133
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,560
Listen, I'm not the one getting interviewed here, okay?

1134
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,400
That's true.

1135
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,240
You're the one getting, so hands back on those puppies.

1136
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,720
All right, I'll put my hands back on the poles.

1137
00:51:58,720 --> 00:51:59,840
I don't wanna touch them.

1138
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:01,880
They're not calibrated for me, they're calibrated from you.

1139
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,120
That's true, we'd have to do a whole

1140
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:04,520
new calibration process, I guess.

1141
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,000
Are you a pervert?

1142
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:10,840
No.

1143
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:14,400
Are you guilty of any major crimes in this lifetime?

1144
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:15,320
Yes.

1145
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:18,880
Have you been sent here knowingly to injure Scientology?

1146
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,280
Yes.

1147
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:21,120
What?

1148
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:21,940
No.

1149
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,540
Are you or have you ever been a communist?

1150
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:25,440
Yes.

1151
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,820
Well, that's interesting.

1152
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:33,960
Okay, any more questions?

1153
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,460
Have you ever embezzled money?

1154
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,300
Yes.

1155
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:37,160
Have you ever been a drug addict?

1156
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,000
Yes.

1157
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:39,160
Have you ever bombed anything?

1158
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,000
Yes.

1159
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:42,160
- Have you ever, yeah, a couple open mics, come on.

1160
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,600
I mean, come on, that's, yeah.

1161
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
No mommy, you can actually, you know.

1162
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:46,960
- Oh, I had to put my hands back on the poles

1163
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:48,100
and I had to fist bump? - Yeah, put 'em there.

1164
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:50,680
Yeah, no, yeah, don't do that again, please.

1165
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,240
Have you ever-- - Well, what if I say

1166
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,440
another good answer?

1167
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:55,760
- Then I guess we'll have to do it again, okay?

1168
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,600
- I guess we'll have to fist bump again.

1169
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,320
- Listen, I'm fun over everything.

1170
00:52:58,320 --> 00:52:59,160
There's no mommy here. - Okay, yeah, that's true.

1171
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,360
- Ain't no rules, right?

1172
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,920
Have you ever murdered anyone?

1173
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:04,800
- Yes, family of mice.

1174
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,760
- Oh, we back to that.

1175
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,440
- Yeah, I did, I was,

1176
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:14,000
Have you heard about the story of Werner Herzog on the set of Nosferatu?

1177
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:15,760
No. What happened on the set of Nosferatu?

1178
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:20,720
He tried to dye a bunch of white mice gray and put them in boiling Rit dye.

1179
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,320
Holy shit.

1180
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:26,560
And he boiled a big, big box of mice.

1181
00:53:26,560 --> 00:53:27,760
That's horrifically awful.

1182
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,400
Yeah. I did the same thing, but I wanted to make them rainbow.

1183
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:32,400
Oh, that's sweet. Yeah, like an Easter egg.

1184
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:32,900
Yeah.

1185
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,520
Have you ever raped anyone?

1186
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,020
No.

1187
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,320
Not even a mouse?

1188
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:42,560
No. Okay. Have you ever had anything to do with a baby farm?

1189
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:49,920
Of mice? It doesn't specify. There's a citation here, but it doesn't specify beyond that. Okay.

1190
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:56,400
Yes or no? No. No, never been involved with any kind of baby farm? No baby farm. All right,

1191
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:03,280
you've never been out there milking babies? No. All right. Do you collect sexual objects?

1192
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:05,440
No. Well...

1193
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:08,960
You better be. Come on. I know if you're lying. Not because of the machine, but

1194
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,040
because I have a psychic link with you as your brother.

1195
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:17,920
Define sexual object. Anything that can go in your ass. Oh, then yes.

1196
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,600
I collected a banana earlier. You did. You collected it in your front.

1197
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:27,020
Do you have a secret you are afraid I'll find out? Yes.

1198
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:29,660
And what is it?

1199
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,360
Mommy's over there.

1200
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,000
Don't tell me mommy's here.

1201
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:36,040
Okay, that was actually a lie, and you're very close to failing this test.

1202
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,040
Oh, right.

1203
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:39,640
I know you're not technically, I know you said it before, you're not a good test taker.

1204
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:40,640
Yeah.

1205
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:41,640
Right?

1206
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:42,640
I do, I do.

1207
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,640
I want you to know you're teetering on.

1208
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,440
With my 504 plan, I should have been able to take this in a quiet room, and I should

1209
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:48,700
have had gum.

1210
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,040
You're teetering on a C plus here.

1211
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,440
I should have had gum provided.

1212
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:52,440
So far.

1213
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,200
There's some questions left though, so we can bump that thing up to a B, big guy.

1214
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
Okay.

1215
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Yeah.

1216
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:59,200
And then you won't have to take a summer audit.

1217
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,360
Okay.

1218
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,800
Are you upset by the security check?

1219
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,120
No.

1220
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,840
Have you ever had an unkind thought about L. Ron Hubbard?

1221
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,680
Yes.

1222
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,500
Not sure who that is.

1223
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:12,000
Really, what did you think?

1224
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,840
Hair weird.

1225
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,760
Hair weird.

1226
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,720
Is he a weird hair?

1227
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:17,960
He had weird hair.

1228
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,800
Who is this guy?

1229
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,140
Oh, this is an author.

1230
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,680
He made a series of jazz albums with, I think,

1231
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:27,840
Chick Corea about horses.

1232
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,280
Oh, okay.

1233
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,800
I think we've listened to that before.

1234
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,040
- Oh, dope.

1235
00:55:32,040 --> 00:55:32,920
Uh, okay.

1236
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,160
Do you hope you won't be found out?

1237
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,120
- No.

1238
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:37,840
- Do you think there is anything wrong

1239
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,740
with having your privacy invaded?

1240
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:41,080
- Yes.

1241
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:41,920
No.

1242
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:42,740
- No.

1243
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,580
That's what I like, yeah, that's what I like to hear.

1244
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,040
- Yeah, that sounds like the better answer.

1245
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,840
- What do you wish you hadn't done?

1246
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:49,200
- No.

1247
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:50,800
- Well, no, you gotta give an example here.

1248
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:52,320
- Oh, um.

1249
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,440
- Maybe something with those mice or something.

1250
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,960
- No, I don't regret making rainbow mice.

1251
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:57,900
- Well, yeah, of course not.

1252
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,740
You're like Darwin.

1253
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,820
like yeah like a huge scientific breakthrough as far as creatures are

1254
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:06,460
concerned yeah are you well I already asked you that but what they got me

1255
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:12,300
that's on the list are you upset by the security check yes no okay so this one

1256
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:16,820
is we have a couple of more here this is designed these ones it's another

1257
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:21,780
security check designed to be applied to children aged 6 to 12 okay okay and

1258
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:25,660
there's 99 questions but we're just gonna do a couple of ones here all right what

1259
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:28,660
What has somebody told you not to tell?

1260
00:56:28,660 --> 00:56:33,820
Uh, Santa, not real.

1261
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:35,820
Somebody told you not to say that?

1262
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:36,820
Yes.

1263
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,140
My mom, my mommy.

1264
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:41,140
To somebody in the room.

1265
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,140
Okay.

1266
00:56:42,140 --> 00:56:51,580
Um, well that, um, it's basically just a lie that mommy told you and I hope that you know

1267
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,260
that because I know that, right?

1268
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:54,260
I hope.

Yeah, so you can put your, I'll just keep going

1270
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,060
with the questions, you can put your hands on the thing.

1271
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:00,980
Yeah, good.

1272
00:57:00,980 --> 00:57:04,760
Have you ever decided you didn't like

1273
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,300
some member of your family?

1274
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:07,140
Yes.

1275
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:07,960

Mommy.

1278
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:12,640

1280
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,820
As your brother, I like that.

1281
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:16,660
Okay.

1282
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,100
That's good to know.

1283
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,560
Have you ever taken something belonging to somebody else

1284
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,980
and ain't never given it back?

1285
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:23,900
You never gave it back?

1286
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:31,660
What was it? Mommy's hairbrush. You stole mommy's hairbrush? Uh-huh. Holy shit, man. Yes. Is that

1287
00:57:31,660 --> 00:57:36,380

1288
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,980
nest. Rat's nest. That's what they're looking for. It's a rat's nest. At least that bee has a hive,

1289
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:45,340
huh? And that's just a hairdo. Yep. Yeah. That's just Marge's hairdo. That's right. I'm getting a

1290
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:51,740
little off track. Have you ever pretended to be sick, little guy? Yes. Really? And did you get

1291
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:53,580
get out of doing some homework?

1292
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,420
- Yes.

1293
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,900
- Oh, what did you pretend that you had?

1294
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,660
- I used to pretend that I would have painful stomach aches

1295
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,620
at the nurse's office, so they would give me food.

1296
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,660
- Nice, I used to put my head under my lamp

1297
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,300
on the side of my bed, and then be like,

1298
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:07,320
"Mom, I have a fever," and she'd touch my head,

1299
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,240
and she'd be like, "You have like a burn on your head.

1300
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,480
"You have such a bad fever.

1301
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,200
"You seriously can't go to school.

1302
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,540
"Mom, if you're listening, you're a dumb bitch."

1303
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,720
Have you ever made yourself sick?

1304
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:19,920
- Yes.

1305
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:22,500
Have you ever hurt yourself to make somebody sorry?

1306
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,340
- Yes.

1307
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:24,320
- Nice.

1308
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:25,660
Like put a stake through your heart?

1309
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:26,500
- Yes.

1310
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,320
- Holy crap.

1311
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,200
- I put a arrow through my head.

1312
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:34,200
- By God, at least you weren't playing an instrument, right?

1313
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:35,280
- I was playing the banjo.

1314
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,680
- No.

1315
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,600
Well, at least you weren't singing

1316
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,980
about some kind of Egyptian ruler or anything.

1317
00:58:39,980 --> 00:58:43,200
- No, I was singing about grandma.

1318
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,700
- Ah, well that's much better news.

1319
00:58:45,700 --> 00:58:48,440
All right, not that many questions left, okay?

1320
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,140
You ready? Put your hands back on.

1321
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:50,640
Okay.

1322
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,640
And you know what? For this one, I'm gonna say, um...

1323
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,940
Take all your clothes off.

1324
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:55,440
Okay.

1325
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:55,940
Yeah.

1326
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:56,940
If you could just do that real quick.

1327
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,640
Yep.

1328
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,240
Mm-hmm.

1329
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,240
And your- Hey! And your shirt.

1330
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,240
Oh.

1331
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:04,140
Take it off!

1332
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:04,640
Alright.

1333
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,540
That is a fuckin' heavy shirt.

1334
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:08,240
Chainmail.

1335
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:09,640
Oh, yeah, well...

1336
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:10,640
You are goth.

1337
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,640
Did you- Oh, we already did this one.

1338
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,740
Hey, we'll do 'em again, 'cause I think that's one of the things we were supposed to do.

1339
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:17,240
Okay.

1340
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:20,680
Did you come to Earth for evil purposes?

1341
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:24,600
Yes. So let's investigate this a little bit. What are your purposes here on Earth?

1342
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:28,280
Just to cause rats pain. Rats or mice?

1343
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,560
Mice, rats, rodents. Have you ever confused mice and rats?

1344
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,160
Yes. Have you ever seen a rainbow rat? Yes.

1345
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:38,600
Have you ever seen a rainbow mouse? Yes. You've seen both? I've made both.

1346
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,800
Oh my god. That's awesome. Mm-hmm. Have you ever smothered a baby?

1347
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:52,880
Yes. Baby mouse. Okay. How did you do it? And with what? Chipotle sauce. Okay. Chipotle's an adobo.

1348
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,240
Oh, those are good. That's a good, that's a little flavor bomb. Yeah. For all you white people out

1349
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:04,480
there. If you add a little bit of a Bobo's Chili. Yep. And I think a Bobo's the guy's name. A Bobo

1350
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,800
is the chef who makes the chili. He basically invented the chili, invented the red sauce. And

1351
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:14,160
if you put them to a little mayonnaise, which I know you got in your damn cabinet. That's right.

1352
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:18,080
That's how I pound it out. I'm taking my hands off the reader. Put the hand back on that rod.

1353
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:21,680
I'm putting them back on the rods, but I had to bump one time for the one time.

1354
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:28,000
Here's one for you. Do you think mayonnaise is spicy? Nah. Nah. What do you keep in your bag?

1355
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,280
Hot Tabasco. That's right.

1356
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:37,040
Have you ever destroyed a culture? Yes. Which one?

1357
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:48,560
Rhodesian. I thought that was a Star Wars thing. No. Oh. Rhodesian. Rhodesian. Are you sure?

1358
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:54,560
That's not a Star Wars thing. I could-- there's a ghost in the office. Somebody's completely

1359
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:59,720
moaning in a sex way. Yeah. Have you ever jacked off to the thought of someone moaning

1360
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:05,840
in the office? No. Do you-- but I will later. Do you have plans-- oh, that answers it. Have

1361
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,160
Have you ever enslaved a population? Yes. Which one?

1362
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:18,080
Rhodesian again? All right. You say it into the microphone and keep your hands on the rods.

1363
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,160
You enslaved Rhodesia and

1364
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:24,200
then you destroyed their culture.

1365
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:32,560
Yeah, no, I meant Rhodian. Sorry. I mean, the whole time I've been saying Rhodesian, I've meant Rhodian.

1366
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:35,160
Have you ever torn out someone's tongue?

1367
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,160
Yes.

1368
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,160
Okay, this time not yourself?

1369
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,160
Yes.

1370
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,160
Okay, whose was it?

1371
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,160
Mouse.

1372
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:41,160
A mouse is... yeah, we'll say that's someone.

1373
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,360
And again, have you ever zapped anyone?

1374
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:45,360
Yes.

1375
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,320
And have you ever eaten a human body?

1376
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:48,680
Yes.

1377
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:51,760
Have you ever farted and blamed it on your friend?

1378
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:52,760
Yes.

1379
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:55,680
Okay, have you ever drawn a naked photo of me?

1380
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:56,680
Yes.

1381
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,800
Was my penis average size, small size, or huge mega large size?

1382
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:02,360
Small and your head was bigger than your body.

1383
01:02:02,360 --> 01:02:04,480
Did you do that on purpose or are you a bad artist?

1384
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:06,000
- It was a forced perspective thing.

1385
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,360
- Have you ever drawn me with hair?

1386
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:08,180
- Yes.

1387
01:02:08,180 --> 01:02:09,280
- What kind of hair did I have?

1388
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,120
- Mohawk.

1389
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:10,940
- Was it awesome?

1390
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:11,780
- No.

1391
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,620
- Did you erase it afterwards?

1392
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,460
- Yes.

1393
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:14,300
- Do you wish I had a mohawk?

1394
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,080
- I put a different mohawk on.

1395
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,120
- Did it go sideways, like a left to right mohawk,

1396
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:19,120
ear to ear? - Yes.

1397
01:02:19,120 --> 01:02:21,120
- Is that the best thing I've ever invented right now?

1398
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:21,960
- Yes.

1399
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:22,780
- It's pretty smart.

1400
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,700
- I think you should do that.

1401
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:24,540
- A sideways left to right mohawk?

1402
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:26,640
- I think you should do a sideways left to right mohawk.

1403
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,680
- I honestly can't believe I just came up with that

1404
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:33,760
I think that this question, I think these questions were all leading to that

1405
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,760
invention. That might be the best fucking invention of all time. A sideways mohawk?

1406
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:41,320
A sideways mohawk that goes completely sideways. Because the best part is you

1407
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:44,600
look at someone from the side with a mohawk, that's the whole profile, right?

1408
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:49,520
But somebody with a sideways mohawk, we'll call it a, we'll call it a sidehawk.

1409
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,040
Let's just keep it easy. You're like, oh this guy's got a fucking spike on his

1410
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:58,080
head. Yeah. Right? Or he's... This guy looks like a fan brush. And then he turns sideways

1411
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:03,080
and you say oh my god yeah oh my god he's like he's like a lizard

1412
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:07,480
holy shit he has some kind of lizard thing that would be cool that'd be

1413
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,920
fucking dope that would be so cool all right all right so how much how many

1414
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,960
more questions do we have just two more all right you ever eaten a human body no

1415
01:03:15,960 --> 01:03:21,200
I think you said yes earlier I think I said yes earlier so what so who was it

1416
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:26,480
because we're going to take the yes at the time. A prince. A prince of what country?

1417
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:33,320
Michigan. It was Rhodesia wasn't it? Yeah. It was a Rhodian. Yeah. It was a Rhodian prince.

1418
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:40,120
His name was Gugu. Okay. And have you ever made a planet or nation radioactive?

1419
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:46,000
Really. Rhodia. So this is interesting. Under the controversy section of this

1420
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,000
you have potential blackmail. Researcher John Attack-- I'm not sure I'm gonna trust

1421
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:57,160
this guy. Yeah. His last name is A-T-A-C-K. That's a bit of a scary last name. A critic of

1422
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,640
Scientology and himself a former Scientologist explains in his book A

1423
01:04:00,640 --> 01:04:05,240
Piece of Blue Sky that SEC checks could be applied either as a confidential

1424
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:09,360
confession or as a non-confidential investigation. He alleges that former

1425
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:12,640
members have been silenced by the fear that their confidential secrets will be

1426
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:17,360
used in blackmail against them. Do you have any fear that I will release this

1427
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:22,280
audio? Yes. All right. Well, then I won't. You're fine. Nobody's ever gonna hear this.

1428
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:26,080
All your secrets are safe with me. All right. Well, and that's it? Yeah, that's it.

1429
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:30,600
I think you're good to go. Free to leave, as they say. All right. That'll be

1430
01:04:30,600 --> 01:04:37,880
$8,500. Perfect. I have that. Exactly. All right. All right. Nothing else to talk

1431
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:41,120
about, right? We're done. Yeah, I guess we're done. Mommy was gone. Mommy was gone,

1432
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:45,200
and nothing weird happened. Nothing, not a single thing. And we have nothing to plug.

1433
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:49,280
I guess you can go to Patreon maybe. Yeah I guess maybe go to the Patreon and

1434
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:53,120
the Twitch. And check out Prank Ass. Check out Prank Ass the movie. Mm-hmm.

1435
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:56,960
Well the pilot. The pilot. It's not a movie yet. Could be one day. Could be. Yeah.

1436
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,440
Alright, bye. Bye.
