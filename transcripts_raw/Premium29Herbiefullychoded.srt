[explosion]

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,500
I'm recording. Yeah, I'm pretty much recording.

7
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm recording too.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,800
Yeah, I'm basically the best at it though.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,500
Yeah, I've hit the button so damn hard.

10
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,500
No, I basically hit the button better than anybody.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:29,500
I have it rigged up to a Staples "That was easy" button just so that I can feel some real feedback when I press it.

12
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,260
You practice pressing buttons by pressing guys' P-stot.

13
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:34,420
- Yeah. - No.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,140
I don't press anybody's P-stot.

15
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,540
If I did, it would be a woman's P-stot.

16
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,860
- Yeah, your own.

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,820
- No, I'm not a woman, I'm a guy.

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,580
- So you do touch guys' P-stots.

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,420
- I don't touch guys, first of all.

20
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,980
First of all, okay, I'm gonna break this down

21
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:49,820
one step at a time.

22
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,340
- You just touched your fingers together.

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,180
- Not a woman. - Yeah, you're touching a guy.

24
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,220
- But I'm not a woman.

25
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,860
I'm explaining to you I'm not a woman.

26
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,300
I'm a guy and a half, if anything.

27
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:59,780
So you're XXY?

28
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,620
No.

29
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,440
You're Kyle.

30
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,280
He's a guy and a half, you're XXY.

31
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,120
No.

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,100
You are Kyle, XXY.

33
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,660
I'm XXX.

34
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,140
I'm three X's.

35
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:07,980
Yeah.

36
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,800
I'm three X's like--

37
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,540
And we're here, you have to answer to your crimes.

38
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:12,860
What crimes did I do?

39
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,980
I didn't know crimes.

40
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,060
You did all of XXX crimes.

41
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,420
Name one crime he did.

42
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,740
I actually don't know.

43
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,580
Yeah, see he doesn't even know.

44
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,300
He stuck, didn't he stick a fork

45
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,340
into his pregnant girlfriend's vagina?

46
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:26,700
He stuck a fork into an outlet,

47
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,740
which is a crime when you're a baby and he got cancelled for it. I don't know what he

48
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,880
did. I don't, I don't, I don't.

49
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,860
He threatened his girlfriend a bunch and beat her I believe.

50
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:39,220
Yeah, so did Patrick though.

51
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,140
Don't say that.

52
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:47,900
Yeah. Patrick and Cameron have both done everything XXXTentacion has done, they have both done

53
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,900
too.

54
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,300
Yeah, I made really awesome music.

55
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,420
yeah yeah what do you mean blended perfectly over ten genres into a

56
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:00,460
masterpiece of an album no no they both stuck forks in each other because they're

57
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:05,140
both girlfriends of each other yeah I don't think so you did and you both

58
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,500
zapped each other with your with your men's electricity men are full of

59
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:15,980
electricity and women are full of water and that's why it doesn't work that's

60
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:22,820
true it's so fucking hot here dude yeah this is recording in a mirage in the

61
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:31,940
Mojave Desert. This feels like that episode we did that we like scrapped after we ate a bunch of

62
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,580
chicken honestly. We ate a bunch of chicken honestly. That was a week I

63
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,620
remember that we recorded two in a row we had to scrap the first one because it

64
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,620
was right after we ate a shit ton of KFC.

65
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:46,620
We ate a shit ton of KFC and we were just sitting there just like...

66
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Oh yeah, we had chicken brain.

67
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,620
In the middle of the summer.

68
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,620
Yeah, we had chicken brain.

69
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,620
We had chicken brain.

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,620
That was the chicken brain episode.

71
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,620
It was one of the lost episodes.

72
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,120
There are so many lost episodes of this podcast.

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,620
There's a couple lost episodes where it's like we said something sort of out of pocket,

74
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,620
you know, or we ate too much chicken.

75
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,860
(laughing)

76
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,900
- I wish we had just not even recorded another one.

77
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,740
We'd just been like, sorry, new episode.

78
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:13,780
(laughing)

79
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:17,340
We actually ate too much chicken before we recorded.

80
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,060
- The thing is, we like don't even say things

81
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,020
out of pocket that often.

82
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:24,500
So it's mostly like any last episode.

83
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,340
- It's way more the chicken thing.

84
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:27,860
- Yeah, it is honestly the chicken thing more than anything.

85
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,900
- It's way more like we ate too much chicken

86
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,140
or it was too hot.

87
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,500
- Too hot, it's too hot.

88
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,380
It was a combination of it was too hot

89
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,380
and we ate too much.

90
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
One of us didn't sleep enough.

91
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:42,580
Yeah, we got excited about a website too much and just didn't talk and just looked at the

92
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:46,220
website instead of talking when we were supposed to be doing the list.

93
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,180
Stuff like that.

94
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:54,660
Shout out to the kid who sent me that list to @bitbyacarp who I can't find his Twitter

95
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,380
now, but we had to scrap your episode too.

96
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,380
Because the website was too good.

97
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,380
The website was too fun to look at.

98
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,380
We spent too much time just clicking on and laughing to ourselves.

99
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,380
Yeah, so that's the revealed reason that we haven't...

100
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,880
Hopefully he's a patron, because then he'll fucking hear this.

101
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,380
We'll make that the teaser, just me trying to be nice.

102
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,380
That is the reason we unlocked a premium episode,

103
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,380
is because we waited until the last minute to record,

104
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,380
and then we got too distracted by a website about sex and love.

105
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:29,380
And also chicken. We also had chicken before that too.

106
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,340
I did go out and I went to the grocery store and I did buy a bag of grocery store chicken.

107
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,420
The bag chicken is insane.

108
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,780
It's so gross.

109
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:39,780
It's so gross.

110
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,820
It like sticks together and it's cold.

111
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,460
There's no difference between the skin and the meat.

112
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,900
It's just all just like mashed potatoes.

113
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:47,900
Oh but it's so good.

114
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
Oh but it's so good.

115
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,900
Oh my god.

116
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,020
Dude I honestly, honestly considered going out and just buying just a rotisserie chicken

117
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,220
and eating the whole thing last night.

118
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,220
Oh I've done that so many times.

119
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,220
Oh my god.

120
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:01,900
Gus told me that him and his dad when they went there when they've like gone on tour

121
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,220
Basically if they go on a road trip

122
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:10,460
They just buy a rotisserie chicken at the beginning of the day and they just eat that for their and like all of their meals

123
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,300
throughout the day

124
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,860
Just a rotisserie chicken with their hands while driving. That's the dream dude. Yeah, that's I wish I wish my dad

125
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,860
Would eat a whole chicken with me. I

126
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:24,060
Used to me and my dad used to get the fucking market basket

127
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:29,460
Rotisserie chickens. Yeah, leave it in the fridge and pick at it the bag chicken though

128
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,940
You can get the spicy you can get the spicy chicken, which is just red chicken. Yeah, it's like comically red

129
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,580
And there's it's not spicy at all. Yeah, it's not they it's spicy like

130
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:43,020
It's just paprika

131
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,700
Exactly. Yeah, it's just paprika red that's I and like it like it's temperature is a little hotter for some reason

132
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:53,020
The way that they make that is they just they get the chicken really mad before they kill it

133
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,980
it. They just really piss it off. They jump on its head twice but not three times which

134
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:07,620
would kill it. They jump on it twice right before it turns into coins. They play I Know

135
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,980
an Annoying Song, an Annoying Song, an Annoying Song over and over on the speakers before

136
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:16,620
they kill it and it turns red and steam comes out of its ears. It's actually pre-cooked

137
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,140
because it steams itself.

138
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:22,420
It's one of those, it's like a sous vide,

139
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,540
but in like a human.

140
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,300
What?

141
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,120
Or like, I don't know.

142
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,960
It's a sous vide in a human?

143
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,800
(laughing)

144
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,420
God, my brain is liquid right now.

145
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,620
Okay, so you put some steak in a bag

146
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,060
and then you swallow the bag,

147
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,340
and then when you poop it out,

148
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,180
it's safe to eat.

149
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,020
Oh, it comes out hot.

150
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,620
It probably would be kinda cooked.

151
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,460
Yeah, it's warm in there.

152
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,540
'Cause your internal body temperature

153
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,460
is like roughly 100 degrees.

154
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,300
Can your body melt glass?

155
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,580
Isn't a sous vide kinda cook stuff at that level?

156
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:47,420
- Can your stomach ask it?

157
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,880
Can your stomach ask it?

158
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,740
(laughing)

159
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,580
- I need to get, I'm crowdfunding to get a million PCs.

160
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,860
- Patrick is like a computer.

161
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,260
Like, he has like an operating temperature.

162
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,420
Like if it's too cold or too hot,

163
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,260
it doesn't work anymore.

164
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,700
- And it's 56 degrees.

165
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,620
- Yeah, 56 degrees exactly.

166
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,340
Any colder or hotter, and he sucks.

167
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,220
- No.

168
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,060
- Ugh, bleak.

169
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:14,380
- I'm thinking, that's probably the first thing

170
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,340
I'm gonna do with the podcast money

171
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:22,180
get a sous vide machine. Yeah? Yeah. Just I don't want to put my hand in it. I gotta get...

172
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:31,180
See if it'll cook my hand. Just eight hours, eight hours recycling, circulating water at

173
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:36,700
120 degrees. It's not even that hot. It's not that hot. It's like a jacuzzi. Yeah. Do

174
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,980
you guys ever wanted to eat yourself? Eat parts of yourself? Yeah, pretty much every

175
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,700
day of my life. You ever think about like cutting off your finger and like cooking it

176
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:48,020
in a pan and then like putting it in a quesadilla and then eating it. I've never thought about that.

177
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:52,500
I've thought about that. Have you ever thought about eating Patrick because he'd be the most

178
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,460
delicious of us? I would not. There's so many chemicals in me. No, Patrick's legs.

179
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:03,300
That's true. No, that's why he'd be so delicious. Have you ever had like GMO raised cows?

180
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,700
Yeah, that's true. If you didn't, you cut possible.

181
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,220
Eating me would be like eating like Burger King. Yeah, Buku King.

182
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:16,020
if you tried to if you cut Patrick in half his flesh would just be like blue

183
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:25,220
like bright neon blue like electric blue yeah he's it's sizzling

184
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:34,500
he's carbonated his meat is carbonated sparkling Patrick oh my god dude i would

185
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:39,140
love to get a carbonated hamburger just bite into it oh you know when i was

186
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,120
- When I was young I used to call carbonated hamburger,

187
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,720
yeah, Pop Rocks Burger.

188
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,820
(laughing)

189
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,940
- That's more, that's more like, that could happen.

190
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,140
- That's like a food challenge.

191
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,980
- Yeah.

192
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,020
- I wouldn't be surprised if I went to like

193
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,060
some shitty neighborhood, or some shitty like

194
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,860
small town in Massachusetts, and they were like,

195
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,740
yeah, the only thing here is like,

196
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,860
we have a restaurant that has a Pop Rocks Burger.

197
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,900
- Yeah.

198
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,540
That's what we're known for.

199
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,220
- And you go and there's pictures of people like,

200
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,940
like, with the, like famous people there with the owner,

201
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,140
but none of them look happy.

202
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,980
- Yeah.

203
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,300
- They're all just like, oh, fuck.

204
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,420
The famous people are all people's dads from the town.

205
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,820
They're not even famous.

206
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,340
Just community members.

207
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,540
Dan O'Brien Kia.

208
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,540
That's the old thing.

209
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,140
It's the little, it's the kid.

210
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,060
It's the 3D, the little 3D guy.

211
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:25,340
The 3D render from Dan O'Brien Kia, yeah.

212
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,060
That guy's awesome.

213
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,740
Boston, Boston's the only joke.

214
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
Cam, is it you who in LA we went to,

215
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:34,940
is it you that I went to a diner with that had the like pictures of all the celebrities

216
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:39,420
on the wall but then one of them was just like some random guy

217
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,780
and he was like eating an omelet and smoking a cigarette inside and it was like

218
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,300
Dan 2003.

219
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,740
He's sandwiched between like Brad Pitt and like

220
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:57,100
Leonardo DiCaprio and it's just like Dan and then just some ugly guy.

221
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,380
He rocks dude. I have a picture of it somewhere. Do you remember that diner we

222
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:02,780
went to um what was it called the one that was

223
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,660
was just like, yeah, that one was crazy. It was like this, it was this diner that was

224
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:11,820
like kind of, it was like part of a hotel but not really. Like it was its own thing

225
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,300
but it was like connected to a hotel. So like everyone in there was just like

226
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,180
people who were staying at the hotel. But like worst hotel ever. Just like a terrible

227
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:24,220
sunset strip, or sunset boulevard motel. Yeah and it's like the the TVs were all

228
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,420
like doing this crazy, this weird glitch. Like it wasn't even like static, like the

229
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,780
TVs were just like glitching. It was very, it felt like it was the most

230
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,700
purgatorial place I think I've ever been in.

231
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,480
- Yeah, it felt like it was the motel California.

232
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,320
That's what that place felt like.

233
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,000
It felt like we would never leave that place.

234
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,400
We'd be, and also, I don't know why,

235
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,020
we ate there probably five times.

236
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,860
It was like the worst breakfast I've ever had.

237
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,700
- It was so bad.

238
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,740
- It sucked, but we just kept going back.

239
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,580
- No, it was just weird.

240
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,600
- It was like 15 dollars.

241
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,440
- God.

242
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,880
- There was something about it, I don't know.

243
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,720
There was some, that place, it draws you back.

244
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,040
- I just liked that it was called Dreams and it was crazy.

245
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,880
- Yeah.

246
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,440
- It was called, I thought you said it was called Kareem.

247
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,760
I wish dude.

248
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,960
That was easily one of the worst places I've ever eaten probably.

249
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Yeah pretty bad.

250
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,960
Yeah.

251
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,960
But we went.

252
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,120
What was, oh we also went to that fucking, that place that was like part of a college

253
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:23,040
that was like the, was it like a Korean, like a Korean church or something?

254
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
No, yeah no it was part of a church.

255
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,600
Yeah.

256
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:30,000
It was like, we went to like, there was this restaurant downtown LA.

257
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:37,680
It was in like Korea town and there was a Korean Baptist church and then upstairs there was

258
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,680
like a cafeteria.

259
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,760
Yeah, but it was like you had to go up all these crazy flights of stairs, you had to

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,280
go around the back, like it was so hard to find to get into this place too.

261
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,600
It was a fucking nightmare, but it was pretty good.

262
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Yeah.

263
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,600
Honestly.

264
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,600
It was like a cafeteria style diner.

265
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
It rocked.

266
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,000
I miss that shit, just cafeteria style.

267
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Cafeteria.

268
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,840
God, you gotta give me some fucking-

269
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,760
No, no, every single time I'm gonna call you up.

270

It's mostly Spanish Spaniards with dreadlocks.

00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,300
Spaniards like conquistador guys.

319
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,140
Yeah.

320
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:35,540
Walking around with giant dreadlocks going,

321
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:37,620
"Bomba, clack, taco bell."

322
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,460
Yeah.

323
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,020

I'm pretty excited.

326
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,020
I'm moving to my like 10 minutes outside of my hometown.

327
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,900
That's nice.

328
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,820
So things are going great for me.

329
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,020
That's every young man's dream.

330
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,860
Yeah.

331
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,700
Yeah, to move back to the man's chair.

332
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,660
With 10 minutes outside.

333
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:58,420
Well, yeah, but 10 minutes outside,

334
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,260
I mean, that's the beach.

335
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,700
Yeah, that's a big distance.

336
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,520
Yeah.

337
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,220
That's a long, that would take you,

338
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,060
you know how long that would take you to walk?

339
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,580
I mean, like a literal border.

340
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,180
Do you know how long a letter would take

341
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,460
to go from your house to your parents' house?

342
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,540
Probably a couple days.

343
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,380
Yeah.

344
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,700
Yeah, so that's a day's worth of travel

345
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:18,580
between you and your parents' house.

346
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,420
And that's with no breaks.

347
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,980
If I mail myself.

348
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,620
And that's if the mailman doesn't take a break

349
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,460
the middle to drink a Gatorade. Yeah, which you know he does. If I see a mailman

350
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:29,700
taking a break, I run up to him and I hit him on the back of the head and I start

351
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:34,620
kicking him. I run up to him and I just give him more mail. I say, "Well, you want to take a break?"

352
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,620
You have to deliver all this now. You want more mail?

353
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:47,620
I point to my garage, which is just stacks, piles of just letters to Santa Claus.

354
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:56,640
Santa Claus. He just has to process and throw away. Yeah. Damn. That is the mailman's

355
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,940
dilemma. Yeah. He looks at, he gets the, he gets the letter, he looks at it, he says,

356
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:08,180
"Do I throw this away or do I deliver this to the North Pole?" It's one of the

357
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:13,020
hardest decisions a mailman ever has to make. Yeah. Yeah. I fucking, I like, when I

358
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:17,500
was going to community college, I like, when I was in Laconia and I lived like a

359
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,900
a couple minutes away from my parents.

360
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,740
Aconia.

361
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,660
Yeah.

362
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,460
It's like Winnipesaukee.

363
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,220
That's where Dracula lives.

364
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,340
Draconia.

365
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,460
That's, I think that's an actual other city, but, uh, I fucking, I

366
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:37,380
looked up how much it would cost to install a motor onto my, onto my

367
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,860
Walmart bike that I bought so I could get around up there and I like for,

368
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,840
for like two weeks, I was like, yeah, I'm going to buy a motor

369
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,700
for this thing.

370
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:50,300
And then I'm going to drive home every weekend with it.

371
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,260
It's called a souped up.

372
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,460
It's called a souped up a Mongoose.

373
00:16:56,460 --> 00:17:01,140
I found out, I found out it was a woman's bike halfway through.

374
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,580
Yeah.

375
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,700
Belong to you, man.

376
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,660
Cause men's bikes have on the seats.

377
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:08,340
They have a little hole where you can put your, you can hold your

378
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:09,300
balls in your penis.

379
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:09,580
Yeah.

380
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,220
It's a cradle.

381
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:14,780
And you can fuck it too if you, if it's a really long bike ride.

382
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:15,780
Yeah.

383
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,780
Yeah.

384
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,780
Yeah.

385
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:18,780
Exactly.

386
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,860
I deeply considered getting a motor for it and now that I'm moving back, I think I'm

387
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,860
going to do it.

388
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,740
You just need to learn how to drive, dude.

389
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:27,740
Learn how to, I'll teach you.

390
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,340
Yeah, but it would be funnier to have a motorized bicycle.

391
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,100
You would get wet.

392
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,500
Somebody imagine this.

393
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:40,140
What if you get into a chase scene.

394
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,140
My bike has a motor.

395
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,140
My bike has a motor.

396
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
They can't go into the alleyways.

397
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:51,140
What if somebody just cause 2 style shoots at your gas tank and your bike explodes?

398
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,140
I will fly up and do a backflip.

399
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
I know how to convince you.

400
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,140
They're not going to let you through any drive-thrus on a bike.

401
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,140
Even if it has a motor.

402
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,140
Yeah they will.

403
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:05,140
I can chain up my bike and go inside. Nice try.

404
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
No you can't chain up.

405
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
Not in coronavirus.

406
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:14,140
No, they're just doing, they're canceling restaurants forever.

407
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,060
It's only drive-thrus.

408
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,900
They're using all of the chains.

409
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,220
I'm going to, I'm moving back to New Hampshire.

410
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,060
I'm moving back to Liberty, Free State Project,

411
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,900
New Hampshire.

412
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,720
No.

413
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,980
They're gonna open up every restaurant.

414
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,940
When was the last time you were in New Hampshire, dude?

415
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,900
It's pussified.

416
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,340
Yeah, they changed everything there.

417
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,180
Now they love rules.

418
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:31,400
They put lines in the middle of the road

419
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,980
so you can tell which lane you're in.

420
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,820
Yeah.

421
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,860
Did they really?

422
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,860
Yeah, might as well be California now, bro.

423
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,700
They raised the age of consent to 11.

424
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,180
People are gonna be fuckin' eatin' avocados and shit now.

425
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,500
Yeah, people are gonna have auto toast.

426
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
(laughing)

427
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,740
People are gonna be talkin' auto-tune out there.

428
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,140
(laughing)

429
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,340
People are, I'm gonna have to,

430
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
I'm gonna go into every fuckin' restaurant

431
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,360
and some guy's gonna be like,

432
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,940
well, it's a two burger king.

433
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,780
Yeah.

434
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:01,260
People are using credit and debit cards.

435
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:06,260
It's gonna be automatic movies and automatic toast.

436
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:08,220
What next, 3D movies?

437
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,220
Come on.

438
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,220
No.

439
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,220
Yeah.

440
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,220
Never.

441
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,220
This is New Hampshire.

442
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,220
This is New Hampshire.

443
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,220
Yeah, New Hampshire still has 1D movies.

444
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,220
Yeah.

445
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,220
Yeah.

446
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,220
We're still playing the One Direction movie at the drive-thru.

447
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:19,220
A 1D movie.

448
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,900
Because they are normally about nine months behind on every single release.

449
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:28,420
A 1D movie is when you go to the movie theater and you just go up to the guy at the popcorn

450
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:32,060
counter and you just say, "Hey, can you tell me what the movie's about really quick?"

451
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,820
And he gives you a two-sentence summary.

452
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:34,820
That's a 1D movie.

453
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,140
And then you don't have to pay.

454
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,140
And then you have to guess.

455
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,500
You don't have to pay if you can guess which movie he's talking about.

456
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,500
You've already told me everything. I would like a refund.

457
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,300
And then that's how you get unlimited popcorn. You keep asking what the movie is

458
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,860
and then you get a refund and you buy another thing of popcorn.

459
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:55,300
Then you ask what the movie is. And then you have points because in...

460
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:58,340
because you can actually get points at the movie theater now.

461
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,740
Because everything there is made up and the points don't matter.

462
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:03,300
That's right. Yeah, it's sort of a...

463
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,740
The points are kind of like...

464
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,420
But also sometimes they do matter and it's like points, you know, like that.

465
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,620
The points don't matter.

466
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,060
And then whoever, well, if you win the most points, you get to do the

467
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,700
hoedown at the end of the movie theater.

468
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,580
Yeah.

469
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:19,180
You get to do the Irish drinking song at the end to everybody.

470
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:22,780
But only if you have a black friend who's actually like the,

471
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,900
he's really good at singing.

472
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:28,020
If he's there, then you can, you're allowed to do it no matter what.

473
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,500
Well, you get to judge the hoedown.

474
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,860
The Irish drinking.

475
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,820
Oh, you get to judge.

476
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,360
Yeah.

477
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:37,980
That's why they, that's why Drew would sing it sometimes.

478
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,580
Because sometimes he didn't win.

479
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,780
Why, are game show hosts, is it like a casino

480
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:49,860
where the host is like the house?

481
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,680
Yeah.

482
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,520
And like he is trying--

483
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,340
That's how I've always looked at it.

484
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,380
He's trying to win the game also.

485
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,220
Yeah.

486
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,260
Well, that's the thing, there's also like Family Feud,

487
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:00,020
in order to get like the full amount of money

488
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,820
on family feed you have to get

489
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,700
every question right

490
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,740
even the uh... and you have to get everything right in like

491
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,960
the uh... the survey questions

492
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,860
so really people go on family feud and just walk home with like fifty bucks

493
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,660

494

496
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020

00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,920
and i got fifty bucks

498
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,760
- It sounds like a pretty good deal to me.

499
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,800
- Yeah, I'm thinking it fucking rocks.

500
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,640
- Yeah, I'm thinking I'm going on family feud.

501
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,440
- But that's split between your family though.

502
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,280
- Huh?

503
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,100
- No.

504
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,940
- That's split between you and your family.

505
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,960
- No, my family doesn't know about money,

506
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,800
so I just pretend that money doesn't exist

507
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,640
and then I just take it away from them.

508
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,440
- I go on family feud and I play every member

509
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
of my family like the clumps.

510
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,200
(laughing)

511
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,640
I'm just running around back and forth.

512
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,520
- Hold on, Steve, hold on.

513
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,400
I am not in my father yet.

514
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,240
- Caleb!

515
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,280
(laughing)

516
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:59,400
Yeah, and then I play like my grandma being like completely mortified that someone had a sex answer.

517
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Where it's like, "What do you put in your asshole?"

518
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,400
"Um, a penis!"

519
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,400
"AHHHHH!"

520
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
"You said a penis!"

521
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,400
[laughter]

522
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
And then I have to switch to my dad.

523
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,400
And then I'm like, "Mama!"

524
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,400
"Hell yeah!"

525
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,400
"Mama!"

526
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Pretty awesome.

527
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,360
You should like on Wheel of Fortune,

528
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,160
you should have to battle Pat Sajak for supremacy.

529
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,960
He's battling for supremacy.

530
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,800
Yeah.

531
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,960
If people get close enough to the answer

532
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,120
and he doesn't like them,

533
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,920
he'll switch the answer to something else

534
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,760
with the same number of letters.

535
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
Well, that's 'cause he's a genius.

536
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,760
He actually comes up with everything in real time.

537
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,000
Yeah, sometimes though he messes up

538
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,440
and they'll be like too far along

539
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,640
and he turns it into complete gibberish.

540
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,760
And yeah, and they'll say,

541
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,040
"I'd like to solve the puzzle."

542
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,800
it's on what's up doc and i go actually know it's worth a little bit

543
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,100
it's been a little bit

544
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,640
sorry guys you got it wrong

545
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,600
yeah they should do it is you know we look for to make

546
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:05,360
a hangman and if you lose pat c jack dies he hangs himself

547
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,160
is it didn't quit

548
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:11,840
is the only way he quit his aid date they uh... they propose that idea to him

549
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,560
yes i think that he was like you made conservative voices

550
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,440
Yeah, Pat's, is Pat Sajak a conservative?

551
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,680
Pat Sajak is like a dumb, he was like a tea party guy,

552
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,600
I think, him and Chuck Woolery.

553
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,640
So are you.

554
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,480
No, I'm not.

555
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,700
But you're still out on this show.

556
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,540
No.

557
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,360
Yeah.

558
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,400
Please don't say that during this time.

559
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,400
He is, he's a tea party guy.

560
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,280
He's got a big red hat on, he actually does right now.

561
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,120
Yeah.

562
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:37,960
He's a big red hat on.

563
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,320
I got a new hat, so.

564
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,660
Why aren't you wearing it?

565
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,680
It's not here yet.

566
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,520
Yeah, right.

567
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,280
And you didn't get it, you ordered one.

568
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,120
Yeah, I ordered one.

569
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,780
a new hat but it's not you don't have it you didn't get a new hat yet I got it

570
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,360
and it's in the mail no no I stole it out of the mail yeah and he mailed it to me

571
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:57,800
actually and I'm a little bit yeah and we're playing monkey in the middle right

572
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,960
now I'm looking at the mail the mail I can't wait till it gets here and it

573
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,240
doesn't fit me we're playing monkey and the mailman yeah game for ps2 that I got

574
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,600
you play as a monkey and you have to beat the shit out of the mailman and

575
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,680
then steal his clothes and then work his job and then you get out of his job and

576
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,040
you go home and you fuck his wife and she doesn't even notice that you're a monkey.

577
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,560
It's like a Farside cartoon.

578
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Exactly.

579
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
Yeah.

580
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:26,600
That's kind of the joke of every one of those cartoons is like, yeah, there's actually an

581
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,480
animal who's pretending to be a guy right now.

582
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,600
But it gets me every- I think they're so funny.

583
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,120
Farside's so good.

584
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
It's so good, dude.

585
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
A bug with a wife?

586
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,800
Oh my god, dude.

587
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,800
Are you kidding, dude?

588
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,480
A monkey reading a book?

589
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
What is this?

590
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
That just ain't right.

591
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
That just ain't right.

592
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,480
That just ain't right.

593
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
That just ain't right.

594
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,280
God man, God save you.

595
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,280
That just ain't right.

596
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:57,400
Yeah, whenever I get a book of Far Side comics I flip through whenever I see an animal with

597
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:02,200
the speech bubble I just white it all out because animals shouldn't be able to talk.

598
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,880
It's not a very funny comic to me.

599
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,480
I write in this all the sounds, all the cows are just saying moo.

600
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,840
Wasn't there like a documentary about, oh no wait, I'm thinking documentary now.

601
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,720
Well that's probably based on a real documentary.

602
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:20,840
It was a documentary about a guy trying to find the guy who writes the Farside comics.

603
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,840
Oh, Gary Larson?

604
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,840
Yeah, I mean he's a guy.

605
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,840
He's trying to find Gary Larson?

606
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,840
He's trying to find him?

607
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,840
Yeah, that was a Documentary Now episode.

608
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,840
I thought it was a real one.

609
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,840
Is it like an exit to the gift shop thing?

610
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:32,840
I don't know.

611
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:33,840
Oh, okay.

612
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
Okay, cool then.

613
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,840
I don't have the brain capacity to remember past that.

614
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,560
You don't have the brain capacity to fucking spell, uh, capacity right now, Patrick.

615
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,560
C-A-P-A-C-I-A-T-Y.

616
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Nope.

617
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
I bet you can't spell "I-cup", dude.

618
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
I-P-C-U.

619
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,360
Aw, crap, I can't spell for shit right now.

620
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
Dude, you're so stupid.

621
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,860
Nah, he's so stupid. His brain is being melted.

622
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:01,560
And it's just tough because his brain is made out of hollow chocolate like an Easter Bunny.

623
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,560
Yeah.

624
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Yeah, and you know that because you like to eat poop like an Easter Bunny.

625
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,060
I don't like to eat poop like an Easter Bunny.

626
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:10,020
First of all, the Easter Bunny likes to eat candy.

627
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
The Easter Bunny likes to eat candy.

628
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,020
He doesn't eat poop.

629
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,620
Second of all, I am not the Easter Bunny.

630
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,420
You're eating one of Cameron's dad's Easter Bunnies.

631
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,420
Nah.

632
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,420
Yeah, I am.

633
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,260
That one, I actually am.

634
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,260
You're not eating one of those.

635
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:27,220
He would never give you one of those.

636
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,220
He already did.

637
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
No.

638
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,220
He already did.

639
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,220
He gave me one.

640
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,220
No.

641
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,220
He gave me one too.

642
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,780
I'm pretty much his best friend and we like to play video games.

643
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:38,300
Specifically we like to play foosball in your garage when you're not around.

644
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:40,180
That's not- And he calls me dad.

645
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,820
I don't have a garage with foosball.

646
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,020
He says, "Can I call you dad?"

647
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,500
And I say, "Yeah, as long as you're okay with it."

648
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,540
Can I call you Cameron's dad?

649
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
Yeah.

650
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,540
Yeah.

651
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
Yeah.

652
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,540
He says, "Can I call you Cameron's dad?"

653
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,540
And I'm like, "Yeah."

654
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
He's like, "You're such a pervert!

655
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
You're such a pervert, Cameron's dad!

656
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,540
Fuck you!

657
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
Fuck you!"

658
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,540
Yeah.

659
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Ugh.

660
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,540
He really lets me have it.

661
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,040
Yeah.

662
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,160
Yeah.

663
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,640
"Kermit's dad, you ruined your marriage for no reason!

664
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,680
What's wrong with you?!"

665
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,160
It's awesome.

666
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,240
[laughs]

667
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
That's cool, dude.

668
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,280
Yeah.

669
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,240
And that's your dad.

670
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:15,740
That's not my dad, though.

671
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,760
And then I call my dad, and then my dad comes, and he's driving a really cool car.

672
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,760
Maybe Herbie the... the lovebug.

673
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,760
[laughs]

674
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,900
When he shows up...

675
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,640
[laughs]

676
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,800
Everyone in school thinks you're the coolest kid 'cause you got dropped off by Herbie.

677
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,640
(laughing)

678
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,400
- Who's driving that car?

679
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:41,200
Oh no, no, the car was driving me, okay?

680
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,040
- That's Herbie.

681
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,880
- That's Herbie.

682
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,700
- That's Herbie.

683
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,840
- He lives in my garage and I feed him gas.

684
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,640
(laughing)

685
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,800
- That's basically the whole movie, isn't it?

686
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,800
- Yeah, dude, except I'm the Lindsay Lohan character.

687
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,320
- What was it, Herbie fully loaded?

688
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,160
- Herbie, yeah.

689
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,000
- Yeah.

690
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,820
(laughing)

691
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,200
- 'Cause he was full of gas.

692
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,160
- That, there's too many movies like that now.

693
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,920
Like, there's too, they've made too many of the Herbie movies.

694
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,520
Yeah, they need to shut it down.

695
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,640
Herbie goes bananas.

696
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,660
Yeah, Herbie goes to the moon.

697
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:15,440
Herbie fucks my goddamn wife.

698
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
Herbie fucks my goddamn wife.

699
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,760
Herbie goes to prison, that would be a good one.

700
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,760
That would be pretty good.

701
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,160
Just a car and prison.

702
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
(laughing)

703
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,520
They keep making new license plates for him.

704
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,640
(laughing)

705
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,360
He's in a women's prison.

706
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,160
They're like, "He had a hole on his back.

707
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,080
We put him in the women's prison."

708
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,820
His name's short for Herbina.

709
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:42,180
They have to take off all the bars to put him in the cell and then put the bars back.

710
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,820
He just barely fits.

711
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:52,360
He just everyone in the prison ties because it was exhaust fumes.

712
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,720
He's doing prison push-ups by just lowering and raising his suspension.

713
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,720
He gets hydraulics.

714
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
He's doing push-ups that way.

715
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,520
going up and down. Yeah, Herbie goes to prison. Pretty much one of the best movies ever. Yeah.

716
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:14,480
Herbie's family vacation. Kind of a raunchy Herbie movie. Yeah. Herbie the naked mile.

717
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:20,320
That'd be pretty good. I can be Herbie all by myself. That's another one. Yeah. Which

718
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:34,740
Halloween. Yeah. Herber Shop. Herber Shop. Chop Shop. That's what it'd be called. Yeah.

719
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:44,960
Chop Shop with Herbie. Chop Shop with Herbie. Chop Shop with Herbie. No way, my dog is looking

720
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,560
at the door. He wants to get in on this Herbie stuff. Yeah. You can't have any of the money

721
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,960
we make from this dog he's got all the Herbie jokes he's got Herbie fever yeah

722
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:01,200

723
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,440

724
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:11,520
Wisconsin mm-hmm you get Herbie take place knows here we take place all over

725
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,800
the world isn't he like an old Volkswagen like a Nazi like a Nazi era

726
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:22,280
Volkswagen. Herbie was a Nazi project. Yeah, they brought him over in an Operation Paperclip.

727
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,680
Yeah, he was like, he was Wernher von Braun. Yeah. He was his car. Yeah, they imported his

728
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:36,360
consciousness. Yeah, as soon as there was a little heat on him, they just threw him in a car. Yeah.

729
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:44,120
And now he fucks Lindsay Lohan, I guess. We are going to give you big eyes. And she will drive

730
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:51,300
you are at your partner around do the cars from cars have a brain they do it's

731
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:59,500
the engine no the engines the heart okay then the end the brain the brain the

732
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,300
brain would be the top of the car I would say there's and there's this movie I

733
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:09,380
said there's like a some production company that makes like like Southern

734
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:13,880
evangelical Christian movies they like made all the left-behind movies but they

735
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,180
They also made this movie called Flywheel, which was about...

736
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,280
It's about fly leaf.

737
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,640
My parents made me watch it when I was a kid and it's basically about a guy whose car gets

738
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:29,180
haunted by God.

739
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:34,360
And it's like God is using the car to speak to him about his...

740
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:38,280
Because all those movies, it's just like a white guy whose marriage is failing because

741
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,640
he watches too much TV.

742
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:47,980
And then like, and then it's like, oh, he has to find God so he knows to like not ignore

743
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,980
his wife.

744
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Yeah.

745
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:53,440
And so like he keeps telling his wife like, "I gotta go work on the car."

746
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,240
And then he walks out and the car just keeps like spraying oil simultaneously like on his

747
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,320
face and then also on like an open page of the Bible and then he picks it up and the

748
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,920
Bible verse is like, "Stop watching TV."

749
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:05,920
John 3, 16.

750
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,920
Yeah, stop.

751
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,880
work on the car and hang out with your wife.

752
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,320
(laughing)

753
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,160
It's awesome, dude.

754
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,280
I wanna make a movie like that,

755
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:16,440
but about a different religion.

756
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,800
About freaking Satan.

757
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,360
Yeah, about the devil.

758
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:20,920
Yeah, about the flying spaghetti monster.

759
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,960
It's kinda what Herbie is.

760
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,600
Herbie kind of is a possessed demon car.

761
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,680
Yeah, he's an Anunnaki.

762
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,400
Yeah, the Anunnaki of infected cars.

763
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,840
Yeah.

764
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,120
Yeah.

765
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,640
He's kinda, now it's crazy that Herbie,

766
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,320
You know how like, you watch movies like Idiocracy

767
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,040
and you're like, whoa, that's like becoming real, you know?

768
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:41,880
But then also--

769
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,700
Yeah, Herbie's becoming real too.

770
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,640
You watch movies like Herbie, yeah,

771
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:47,280
with the Tesla self-driving vehicle, you know?

772
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,840
Did you see his fucking rocket exploded?

773
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,680
Yeah.

774
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,000
Yeah, I'm the one who did it.

775
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,120
Yeah, I did it too, actually.

776
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,480
Yeah, actually, I put a thumbtack under the rocket seat.

777
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:58,320
(laughing)

778
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,160
I popped it.

779
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,180
It was pretty awesome.

780
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,020
Yeah.

781
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,920
Was there like guys on that?

782
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
I don't think so.

783
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
I think it was just...

784
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,200
They definitely should be putting guys on it.

785
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,800
Because I feel like every single time he tries to launch a rocket, it explodes.

786
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,800
Well, they...

787
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,800
No, it...

788
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,880
They did a test launch of it and it worked.

789
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,480
And then it was just like sitting in the rocket chair.

790
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,100
I don't know, whatever they put it in.

791
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Whenever it's not flying...

792
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
It's a chair.

793
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,600
Yeah, it's a chair that they put it in.

794
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,600
And then it just blew up and they don't...

795
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,680
When I read the article about it, they didn't know why it happened.

796
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,560
Yeah, but I think it was...

797
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:34,520
Got the freaking car- you know who did it? Carole Baskin.

798
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,920
Yeah, I'm thinking it's the freaking Tiger King TV show that got this happening.

799
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:41,000
Carole Baskin did it.

800
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,840
She married the rocket and then killed it.

801
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,760
She covered it in sardine oil.

802
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,160
Yeah, and she had a tiger- she had a tiger plant C4 at the base of it.

803
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,480
Yeah.

804
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:52,680
And then exploded it.

805
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:57,720
Wait guys, I think this just gave me a new idea for a Twitter display name.

806
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,840
Get it.

807
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:02,120
Joe Exotic on Musk.

808
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,960
Elogic.

809
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,680
- Carol.

810
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,520

811
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,340

812
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,180

813
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,020
- Carolian.

814
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:09,840
- Carol Explosion.

815
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,680
- Carolian Musk.

816
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,520
- Kanye Exotic.

817
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,680
(laughing)

818
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,280
- Joker Exotic.

819
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,120
Can you imagine?

820
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:16,940
- Joker.

821
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,780
- Joker.

822
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,600
- Joker Fight Exotic.

823
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,440
- Joker Donald Trump.

824
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,600
- Hmm.

825
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,280
- Oh my God, that's terrifying.

826
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,120
- I saw something.

827
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,600
I saw a post that made me laugh so hard.

828
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,480
There's somebody like all indignant about just like people.

829
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,640
It's so funny when people get mad about when people,

830
00:34:32,640 --> 00:34:34,920
other people like don't post something.

831
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,280
And somebody was posting about like the Minneapolis stuff

832
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,640
and they were like, yeah,

833
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,600
so where are all the white male Joker fans at now?

834
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,860
(laughing)

835
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,560
And I was like, what a crazy,

836
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,160
what a crazy fucking group to be like, yeah,

837
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,480
where are the white male Joker fans?

838
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,640
- Yeah, hey, you guys remember those people we said

839
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,360
we're gonna do terrorism everywhere

840
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:59,000
and kill a bunch of people when this movie open?

841
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,800
Why aren't they on our side right now?

842
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,640
- Why aren't they?

843
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,840
- Why aren't all the school shooters helping us?

844
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,440
(laughing)

845
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,720
What's up with that?

846
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,560
Yeah, it's just--

847
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,380
- That's not a bad idea.

848
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,200
We can put all the cops in school.

849
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,920
(laughing)

850
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,760
Yeah, put all the cops in school

851
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,120
and then let loose a white male Joker fan.

852
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,080
- Yeah.

853
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,880
- Yeah, just a Craigslist ad.

854
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,120
Looking for white male Joker fan who hates school.

855
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:32,680
school and police. Yeah, that's how they put out the searches for like crisis actors.

856
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,360
For the shooter, like for Steven Paddock, they found him by just saying, they posted

857
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:42,000
on Craigslist, looking for a guy who wants to see the Joker movie. And they, just looking

858
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,600
for... They hit him with a bunch of strobe lights and he's like, I need to go to Vegas.

859
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:53,320
They played the Joker movie backwards. Yeah, that's what it does to you if you play it backwards.

860
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,520
yeah they played him in one of those exclusive screener copies before it was

861
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,600
even made but they played an extra fucked up version where it's the they digitally

862

pounds and now he's some sort of vacuum in space-time. Yeah he's kind of like an

00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:36,720
Couple of beer bottle ying-ling Coors Light caps.

00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,840
My man buying ying-ling.

924
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,660
Yeah.

925
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,240
He's buying ying-ling 'cause he looked at it

926
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
and he thought he was buying a youngling.

927
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:43,740
Yeah.

928
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:44,940
I'll bring home with him.

929
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,440
Nah.

930
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,040
You wanted a youngling.

931
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,640
You wanted to be a Jedi Master.

932
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,140
Nah.

933
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,240
Yeah, I killed twelve younglings.

934
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
I crushed twelve younglings last night.

935
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,240
But you had the Yingling.

936
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,740
Yeah, you crushed twelve younglings.

937
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,240
Yeah, you crushed twelve younglings, dude.

938
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
I was drinking.

939
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,740
You were drinking out of a youngling?

940
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,740
No, I was drinking out of a Yingling.

941
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
Caleb was drinking a youngling's juice.

942
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,940
I wasn't. There's no juice in a kid.

943
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,740
You get juice when you turn thirteen.

944
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,040
But, duh.

945
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,240
I'm Patrick.

946
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,600
I think you get juice before you turn 13.

947
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
You idiot.

948
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
You get juice all the time as a kid.

949
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,120
You stop getting juice and get older.

950
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,680
Maybe you did and that was the problem.

951
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,680
Why?

952
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,680
Because I'm diabetic now?

953
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,320
Because he's diabetic now.

954
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
I'm not actually diabetic.

955
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,320
Because of all the juice.

956
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
He is.

957
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,240
Patrick is diabetic, but the kind of diabetic who like didn't even eat, wasn't even allowed

958
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,240
to eat candy.

959
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:35,160
He just like turned 21 and ate too many apples when he lived by himself.

960
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,480
And now he has diabetes.

961
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,840
You know, the most embarrassing kind of diabetic.

962
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,400
- I got diabetes from Cliff Bars.

963
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,240
- Yeah, whoops.

964
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,560
(laughing)

965
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,960
Yeah, I was drinking, I drank Insurer

966
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,080
until I fucking got diabetes and lost my foot.

967
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,920
- Yeah.

968
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,480
- Tom, I went to the TB12 store,

969
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,940
took too many of them damn supplements.

970
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,780
- Yeah.

971
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,620
- I got supplemental diabetes.

972
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:03,160
- I was scared that I was gonna get diabetes as a kid.

973
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,680
- Yeah, I wasn't.

974
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,720
- I thought, 'cause my mom told me I could get diabetes

975
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,040
if I put too much jelly on my sandwiches.

976
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,300
(laughing)

977
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,560
- So I was pretty terrified.

978
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,200
I didn't even realize,

979
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,760
I thought it was just if you do something wrong,

980
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,760
you get diabetes.

981
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,960
(laughing)

982
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,360
- It's a punishment.

983
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,200
- Yeah.

984
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,780
- Yeah, it's your body's punishment

985
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,760
for doing something it doesn't like.

986
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,880
- Yeah, too much jelly.

987
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:30,760
Did you guys have health nut moms?

988
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:35,160
- My mom tried to get us into health food and shit,

989
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:39,320
And then I was like, okay, well, I'm just not gonna eat it.

990
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,440
- Yeah, you went on a hunger strike.

991
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,920
- She tried to get me to eat like sun butter or something.

992
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,920
I don't remember what it was.

993
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:47,760
- She was trying to--

994
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,120
- My mom tricked me once.

995
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,480
She bought this blueberry pomegranate V8 juice

996
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,800
and then she told me that there were so many

997
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,760
antioxidants in it that if I drank more than one glass a day

998
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,880
I would die.

999
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,000
(laughing)

1000
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:06,360
'Cause she didn't want me drinking her juice 'cause it was good.

1001
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,360
That rocks.

1002
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,040
When I, uh, my mom was like super into, I mean we just only had like whole wheat bread and

1003
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,760
like natural peanut butter and shit.

1004
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,480
And I remember this kid, Dennis, I took, he, I, I like did some favor for him and I was

1005
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,600
like, uh, yeah, you just have to- Oh yeah, we know what kind of favor you did for him.

1006
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:24,960
Nah, yeah, you know, it was probably like I saved his life from like a burning building

1007
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,960
or something.

1008
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,920
Yeah, you saved his life, you had a buildup of cum inside of his dick and you had to suck

1009
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,960
it out like a, like a snake bit him out of a bite.

1010
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,680
Even if I had done that, which I didn't, if it had saved his life, it would have been worth

1011
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,920
it.

1012
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,600
You got married to him after.

1013
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,800
I didn't get married, but basically I did a favor for him.

1014
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,480
It was probably like fucking his girlfriend or something because he couldn't get his dick

1015
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,480
hard.

1016
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,680
We were 10, but I was like, yeah, just we'll trade lunches in exchange for this.

1017
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:50,680
And he was like, yeah, sure.

1018
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:57,520
And then lunchtime comes around and he has a normal peanut butter and jelly, like Wonder

1019
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,740
bread, Jif peanut butter, red raspberry jam, and I have like all organic like dog shit crunchy

1020
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:10,020
oatmeal bread with like the hard oily, you know the peanut butter that's like half of

1021
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,020
it is oil?

1022
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,020
Yeah.

1023
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:13,020
You have to mix it.

1024
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:14,020
Yeah.

1025
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:16,380
I have that peanut butter and I was like, "All right, so let's trade."

1026
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:23,180
And he was like, "Oh, I'm actually, I'm allergic to organic stuff."

1027
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,740
And I was like, "No, you're not.

1028
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,740
It's bullshit."

1029
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:28,940
And then he got the teacher over and he was like,

1030
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:33,240
yeah, he's like trying to throw this organic thing in my face

1031
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,460
but I'm actually allergic to organic things.

1032
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:36,860
And she was like, wow, I had no idea.

1033
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,560
I'm gonna write that in your file.

1034
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,940
It was awesome, dude.

1035
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:43,020
That was back when nobody knew what organic meant.

1036
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,940
Yeah. Yeah.

1037
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:44,940
I still don't really know.

1038
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,340
I think it just means small.

1039
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,620
It just means small and high priced.

1040
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,620
Yeah, like me.

1041
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,700
It means they put sand in it to give it texture.

1042
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,700
That's true.

1043
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:57,020
I wish. Sodium chloride or whatever.

1044
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,020
Yeah, sand is sodium chloride.

1045
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,020
Sodium dioxide?

1046
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,020
That shit is awesome.

1047
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,020
What tablets?

1048
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,020
The tablets that people are eating to like...

1049
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,020
iPads?

1050
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,020
Yeah, yeah.

1051
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,020
Hamburger iPad. That's what I meant.

1052
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,020
What are you talking about? What tablets?

1053
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,020
People are eating like sodium something tablets.

1054
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:21,020
Like basically chlorine to like try and kill COVID in their bodies.

1055
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:23,020
Oh, hydroxychloride or whatever.

1056
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:26,380
I mean, hydroxy cut.

1057
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:27,380
It could work.

1058
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:29,420
People are taking hydroxy cut.

1059
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,620
Yeah.

1060
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:34,300
My dad took hydroxy cut and I think he stopped taking it because his penis, it ruined his

1061
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:35,300
penis.

1062
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,940
It ruined, how does it ruin your penis?

1063
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,940
I have no idea.

1064
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,740
It splits in half like a hot dog when you don't cut the line.

1065
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,580
It's like when you microwave a hot dog and it shrivels.

1066
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,940
It shrivels and it splits in half and shit.

1067
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,940
Well I just said it.

1068
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,360
(burps)

1069
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,400
Oh man.

1070
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,500
(burps)

1071
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,340
Shut up dude.

1072
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:57,180
That sounds good.

1073
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,000
Whoops.

1074
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:58,840
That does not sound good.

1075
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,440
I just ate some, I will say before I did this,

1076
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,580
I feel good but I did eat a piece of fried chicken.

1077
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,320
(groans)

1078
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,800
So this may never see the light of day.

1079
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,160
There's gotta be a rule, no chicken the whole day.

1080
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:15,760
I got Subway today, I don't know if that counts.

1081
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:16,780
You had what?

1082
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,240
I got Subway.

1083
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,080
Did it have chicken?

1084
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:24,300
rotisserie chicken at Subway? I did put a whole rotisserie chicken between two

1085
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:39,220
loaves of bread. Two loaves. You brought your own rotisserie chicken? And I brought my own loaves of bread. And I sat down in that Subway and I said "reopen the state!"

1086
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:42,860
Has anything, like a restaurant, restaurants have reopened here. It's crazy.

1087
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:46,440
People walking around fucking and sucking in public in a restaurant.

1088
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,440
People have been walking around here just a lot in general.

1089
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,440
Yeah, no, it's like anyone who's like never been jogging before is jogging now.

1090
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:55,440
Yeah.

1091
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:02,440
Finally I have a good use for my 100% realistic replica Darth Vader outfit, including mask.

1092
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,440
Yeah.

1093
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,440
I just walk around completely protected and scaring people who are infected.

1094
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
Yeah.

1095
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,440
You can use your lightsaber and use that as a six feet marker.

1096
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:21,680

Kingpin is Marvel, you fucking idiot.

1123
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,340
Okay, well you'd be him.

1124
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,560

00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,400
'Cause I'm too cool.

1129
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,700
- I would be the Joker in the sequel to Joaquin Phoenix Joker

1130
00:48:10,700 --> 00:48:12,580
where they would replace Joaquin Phoenix with me

1131
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:13,720
and I would get the face paint,

1132
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,300
but I would also get technological weapons to use

1133
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:18,260
that I could use in a power exo suit

1134
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:20,200
that would actually grow to immense size.

1135
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,620
If I use the code phrase, I could grow up to supersize

1136
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,100
so I could fight any giant monsters

1137
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,340
that might attack the city.

1138
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:27,180
'Cause I'm actually a good guy in the sequel.

1139
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:28,980

I'm in Joker 2, no, no.

1142
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:34,060
- Cameron would be Poison Ivy

1143
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,320
and he'd have two little leaves covering his nipples

1144
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:39,820

You know how in all the like gritty reboot like superhero movies

1159
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:53,160
There's like a scene where they like finally like say the superhero name for the first time like that's like the name drop

1160
00:49:53,160 --> 00:50:01,000
Like you in Caleb's we are you watchmen? Yeah? Well, it's just like yeah like in Man of Steel like it's not until the end

1161
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,920
and they go like, "They're calling him Superman."

1162
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,500
Just like shit like that.

1163
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,340
But, and you guys--

1164
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,760
- They're calling him the guy.

1165
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,760
- Yeah, you guys, in you guys' movies--

1166
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:11,840
- The famous guy.

1167
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,560
- Be the moment where you'd finally,

1168
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,840
you know your parents got killed by women,

1169
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,440
so you turn gay, and then you say,

1170
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,260
"Boys and guys, please!"

1171
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:24,700
And that would be the end, and then it has the title card.

1172
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,480
- If you were a superhero, you would be,

1173
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,200
you'd probably be Harley Quinn.

1174
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,920
- No, she's not a superhero.

1175
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,920
She's a villain. She is to you.

1176
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:35,920
No. She's a villain to boys but a hero to women.

1177
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:36,920
[laughs]

1178
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,920
No. No.

1179
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,920

No.

1181
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,920
You'd be a flightless bird of prey.

1182
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,920
You'd be a turd in bed.

1183
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:45,920
You'd be a chicken or a turkey.

1184
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:47,920
I'd be the penguin. I know you guys are gonna say that.

1185
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,920
You'd be like an emu with really short legs.

00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:52,920
Just like a big ball.

1188
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:53,920

00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,720

1198
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:27,560
- Oh my god.

1199
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:28,380
- I would use it to just have more pocket space.

1200
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:29,220
- I always thought it'd be cool,

1201
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:32,260
it'd be cool to be able to flatten your shit out

1202
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,260
and just dump it all out at once like a trash chute.

1203
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,100
- Yeah, I was thinking--

1204
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,300
- It just falls like a pancake.

1205
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,500
- Like a month or two ago,

1206
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,780
like if you had enough control over your asshole

1207
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,380
that you could like contract it fast enough

1208
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:44,500
that you could like chop things into coins.

1209
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,940
Like you could poop and like--

1210
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:46,780
- Whoa.

1211
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:47,620
- Oh, you could make poop coins?

1212
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:49,300
- Chop it, poop coins, yeah.

1213
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:50,140
Or if somebody tried to--

1214
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:50,960
- Or you could be like an artist.

1215
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,580
- Fuck your ass, you could--

1216
00:51:52,580 --> 00:51:53,420
What?

1217
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,300
(laughing)

1218
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:58,020
You could be an artist and you could make sculptures.

1219
00:51:58,020 --> 00:51:58,860
Out of poop?

1220
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,400
A 3D printer.

1221
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,420
You could, my ass is a 3D printer.

1222
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:06,260
Yeah, with just a bit of poop though.

1223
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:07,940
Technically, if you think about it,

1224
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,100
a regular printer's a 3D printer too.

1225
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,540
I don't think so.

1226
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,300
Yeah, I don't think so, pal.

1227
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,460
Can you, what is the limit of like things

1228
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,020
you can make a gun out of,

1229
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,900
if a 3D printer can make one out of plastic?

1230
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,740
What?

1231
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:22,180
Probably make one out of candy.

1232
00:52:22,180 --> 00:52:23,780
You could probably make a candy gun.

1233
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,580
Yeah, you probably could make a sugar gun.

1234
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:31,340
You could, I mean, it's like those videos,

1235
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:32,900
the knife videos.

1236
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:37,220
I'm sure if you got the right Asian guy to do it,

1237
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:39,300
you could probably make anything into a gun.

1238
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,980
Yeah, I would do a bang up job.

1239
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,380
MacGyver is the Asian guy I'm referring to.

1240
00:52:44,380 --> 00:52:45,820
Can make anything into a gun.

1241
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:49,980
I wanna be, I just wanna buy one of those knives

1242
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:50,820
off that guy.

1243
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:51,740
Yeah.

1244
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:54,240
But I want it to be like sharpest pussy knife.

1245
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:55,380
(laughing)

1246
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,500
And it's made out of a pussy.

1247
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,500
Yeah.

1248
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,320
- Yeah, out of yours.

1249
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,780
- Sharpest, sharpest boobs knife.

1250
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,620
- Yeah, out of your pussy.

1251
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,020
- Sharpest boobs.

1252
00:53:05,020 --> 00:53:07,500
- Sharpest boobs, world's sharpest boobs.

1253
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,340
It's just him sanding his mom's tits for hours

1254
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,380
to big pointy things and then he kills himself on it.

1255
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,220
- Yeah.

1256
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:17,740
- He commits seppuku with his mother's breast.

1257
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:20,900
- That's every Japanese man's dream.

1258
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,740
to commit seppuku with your mother's breast.

1259
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,860
Yeah, that's what Japanese Freud said.

1260
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,020
(laughing)

1261
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,660
Fuck.

1262
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:31,480
It's getting hot in here too.

1263
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,580
It's been, there's like a tropical storm here now.

00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:35,580
Yeah.

1265
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,780
It's getting rainy outside.

1266
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:39,660
Oh, it's a tropical storm.

1267
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:41,460
It's getting nice in here.

1268
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:42,480

A million cousins and two million tech decks, so we have something to do.

1297
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,780
I got you the Ryan Sheckler ramp.

00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:23,940
It has photos of all of his sponsors on them.

1299
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:24,940
I got you a Wii.

1300
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:25,940
A brand new Wii.

1301
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:29,260
So you can play with your cousins.

1302
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,260
It only has Wii Sports on it right now, but the bowling game's pretty good.

1303
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:37,140
It only has Wii Sports, but it's one of the later ones that has Wii Motion Plus built

1304
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:38,140
into the Wiimote.

00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:42,380
Actually, wait, I think I have Raving Rabbids around here somewhere.

1306
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:44,060
Yeah, here it is.

1307
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,620
Oh, it's a bit scratched up.

1308
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:48,060
Do you have any Windex and a microfiber cloth?

1309
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:51,020
We can buff that out.

1310
00:56:51,020 --> 00:56:56,260
I'm gonna try the toothpaste trick.

1311
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:59,820
I have banjo tooie but you need to blow on the cartridge.

1312
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:03,420
I think there's some dust in the cartridge.

1313
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:04,420
How are your cousins doing?

1314
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,940
You'll have to take turns.

1315
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,820
Each of you can play for one second.

1316
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:16,300
I've only brought enough controllers for two cousins.

1317
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:19,780
I brought an xbox but we can play more if you have another one.

1318
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,780
We can do system link.

1319
00:57:20,780 --> 00:57:22,780
*laughter*

1320
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,780
We can do system link, hang him high.

1321
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,780
Or blood gulch on Halo 1.

1322
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,780
*laughter*

1323
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,780
Yeah. Stop yelling at me dog!

1324
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,780
Get the fuck out of here. I don't have any bones.

1325
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,780
I hate when my dog...

1326
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:38,780
I don't have no bones!

1327
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,780
My dog asks for bones.

1328
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,780
Yeah, my dog's always coming up to me and asking for bones.

1329
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,780
Yeah, in English.

1330
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,780
Yeah, I say no can do.

1331
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:48,780
Can I have some bones? And then they say fuck you mom.

1332
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:50,060
'cause they think you're a mom.

1333
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:50,900
- Yeah.

1334
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,100
- Dogs think you're mom.

1335
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:56,600
- Gods, dogs, dogs think that Cameron's their god mom.

1336
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:58,820
- Yeah.

1337
00:57:58,820 --> 00:57:59,660
- Yeah.

1338
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:00,480
Do you guys have god parents?

1339
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,320
- I do.

1340
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,160
- Yeah, I do.

1341
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:03,980
- You have fairy god parents.

1342
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:04,820
- No.

1343
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:05,660
- My uncle DD and my uncle Jack.

1344
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:06,860
- Timmy Turner, bitch.

1345
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:10,060
- If I had fairy god parents, that'd be pretty cool

1346
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,780
and it wouldn't be something to insult me about

1347
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:13,380
but I don't have them, so.

1348
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:14,220
- Yeah, I would wish for--

1349
00:58:14,220 --> 00:58:15,040
- I do.

1350
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:15,880
- I would wish for--

1351
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,720
- I have fairy god parents

1352
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:17,540
and they don't grant any of my wishes.

1353
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,780
I would wish for unlimited wishes.

1354
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:20,780
Yeah.

1355
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,900
I would wish for unlimited fairy godparents.

1356
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:28,260
I would wish that my parents would die so they'd be my real parents.

1357
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:30,500
Be my legal parents.

1358
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:35,580
Yeah, if you had fairy godparents and then your parents, real parents died, couldn't

1359
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,060
you just wish them back to life?

1360
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,620
Wouldn't that suck if like-

1361
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:41,260
Wouldn't that be a da rules violation?

1362
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:45,780
What if the fairy godparents fell into the hands of like Adam Lanza?

1363
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:47,220
(laughing)

1364
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:49,220
Wouldn't that be catastrophic, dude?

1365
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:50,740
(laughing)

1366
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:51,580
That'd be pretty bad.

1367
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,740
Yeah, they just hop out and they're like,

1368
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,280
"So what do you wanna do?"

1369
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:55,420
(laughing)

1370
00:58:55,420 --> 00:58:57,180
And he's like, "First I need some hair dye."

1371
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,140
(laughing)

1372
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,300
Yeah.

1373
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,620
Yeah, does the kid have to go through screening

1374
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,460
to figure out--

1375
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:05,500
Yeah, no, yeah, 'cause if every--

1376
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:06,340
Psychological.

1377
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,300
Before he gets fairy godparents.

1378
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:11,160
(laughing)

1379
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:12,720
Yeah.

1380
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:13,900
Yeah.

1381
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:20,900
if you have a floating part of your hat that's not attached to your head, you're fine.

1382
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,460
But...

1383
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:26,000
Yeah, if you're a bad kid, they just give you two Cosmos.

1384
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,500
Yeah.

1385
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:32,900
You save the Wandas for the really good kids.

1386
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:36,340
Sometimes they mess up. Like Steven Paddock, people say, "How did he

1387
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:41,100
shoot 52 consecutive clips from an AR without pausing to reload?"

1388
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,380
yeah you ever noticed you ever noticed the AR was green and pink?

1389
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:46,380
*laughter*

1390
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:50,140
you ever noticed the bullets were pink and the gun was green?

1391
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:52,140
and they both had faces?

1392
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,140
and little crowns on them?

1393
00:59:54,140 --> 00:59:56,140
yeah i think we cracked the case

1394
00:59:56,140 --> 01:00:00,140
that's what Dan Bilzerian saw that's why he needed a gun

1395
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,140
get me in there

1396
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,140
get me in there

1397
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:06,140
get me in there i have Darule's book right here

1398
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:08,140
this is clearly against Darule's

1399
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:10,140
this is a violation of Darule's

1400
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:17,140
was that he did

1401
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:23,220
well

1402
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:24,720
uh...

1403
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,140
was the the teachers name

1404
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,460
dubster crocker mister

1405
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,020
her

1406
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:31,780
here

1407
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:34,140
he was actually

1408
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:35,960
yeah

1409
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:39,520
but what did he find

1410
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:44,780
shut up it's not real mister roger

1411
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,020
you crazy mister crocker

1412
01:00:50,020 --> 01:00:53,940
yet that's what mister crocker was a good idea to a man from

1413
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:56,940
uh...

1414
01:00:56,940 --> 01:00:59,940
the

1415
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:08,980
Mr. Crocker was the good guy because he knew how dangerous it could be to allow fairies.

1416
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:14,500
They're adding an amendment to the constitution to limit the use of fairies.

1417
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:17,100
It's pretty fucked up.

1418
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,100
Fairy control?

1419
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:19,100
Yeah.

1420
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,100
I agree with it.

1421
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:22,500
Oh man, I need to take a shower.

1422
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,500
I'm like sweaty.

1423
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,500
I already took a shower.

1424
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:25,500
I already took a shower.

1425
01:01:25,500 --> 01:01:27,940
I'm sweaty from last night still.

1426
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:31,820
I'm sweaty from the marathon I just ran.

1427
01:01:31,820 --> 01:01:32,660
Yeah.

1428
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:34,340
Yeah, I ran it as a joke.

1429
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,020
I didn't even care about it.

1430
01:01:36,020 --> 01:01:36,860
Yeah. Pretty cool.

1431
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,420
I ran a big marathon.

1432
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:40,820
Yeah, I basically ran a marathon with my eyes closed.

1433
01:01:40,820 --> 01:01:41,860
Not that hard to do.

1434
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,420
As long as it's a straight line.

1435
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,660
(laughing)

1436
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:50,620
I'm so smart I could listen to music with my eyes closed.

1437
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:51,460
Yeah.

1438
01:01:51,460 --> 01:01:52,300
(laughing)

1439
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:53,140
That's how smart I am.

1440
01:01:53,140 --> 01:01:54,340
And I don't even get scared

1441
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:56,540
and think the band is in the room with me.

1442
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,040
Yeah.

1443
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,040
[LAUGHTER]

1444
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:00,540
All right.

1445
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,380
We're done.

1446
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,300
Yeah, that's a dab.

1447
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,140
We're done.
