25
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,100
What's it called?

26
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,300

00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,380
They sing that song twinkle twinkle little star. Yeah. Oh really?

30
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:42,740
Damn, I'm sure that's not how you say that fucking band's name, and they're gonna damn little made of it's so they have a made-up

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,440
Language a band that sings entirely in a made-up language

32
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,020
What yeah?

33
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,540
I've never heard one of their songs though.

34
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,540
Really?

35
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,540
I just know that about them.

36
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,780
I've heard that name, I've heard Seeger Rose before.

37
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,420
I've heard their name before, I think they probably like...

38
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,700
I thought it was Sugar Ross.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,020
They probably like performed at like Boston Calling or something.

40
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,340
That's the type of place that I would have seen their name.

41
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,340
Dude, that's like one of those...

42
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,260
I didn't know they had a made up language though.

43
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,820
That's one of those like millennial bands that like everyone in like a dude who's probably

44
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,980
like 32 now and he was like our age was like I just saw them it's like one of

45
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,020
the greatest shows you'll ever go to. Yeah I is they they they they I feel

46
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,380
like they're in the same category in my brain as a band like and I don't know if

47
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:33,220
I'm pronouncing this right Toro y Moi. Toro y Moi is very different.

48
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:39,980
I love Toro y Moi. It might just be because they have weird names. Yeah yeah. But in my brain it's like oh

49
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:43,300
those are the same band. In my brain both of those bands are centered

50
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,820
around banjos no torui was like like they were like the the start of the chill

51
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,380
wave thing I gotta check out reacting Benjamin they weird as hell

52
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,060

there's dying Ned kicks out they're actually really good yeah hey where are

57
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:54,420
they sweet I'm bad didn't but it didn't a bunch of bands do a similar version of

58
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:59,460
their of their songs for the city Perry did yeah Katy Perry did it so did my

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:06,460
hot and cold. Mike Posner. Oh yeah. You mean Katy Perai? Yeah. And Mickey Posner.

60
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:17,140
Posner. Mickey Posner. Mickey Posner. Yeah. I bet Mike Posner is like huge in some

61
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:21,140
like like like you know how like the Bloodhound gang is really big in Russia.

62
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:29,140
I didn't know that. Yeah I bet he's huge in Sim City. He is huge in Sim City yeah. Did you uh did you know

63
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:34,240
that Mike Mike Posner when he did his one song and then he got real rich. He did

64
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,780
another way to get took a pill in Ibiza. He but after I took a pill in Ibiza

65
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,940
after that or before that he went he walked across the entire country like

66
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:48,780
Forrest Gump. Really? Yeah he went full Gump. Damn. Why? Yeah he just was like I

67
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm I need to be I need to do something awesome. So it's funny that that is like

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,160
he did it cuz he's like in there like Zen Buddhism stuff and he's like let's yeah

69
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,040
and then he was like I'm gonna take a pill with the Vichy yeah which by the

70
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,880
way pretty bad taste to put out a song after a Vichy died of that was before

71
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,240
was it no it's after no it was before it had to be after did it before he died in

72
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,240
like 2015 that's I took a pill in Ibiza 2014 no Vichy died in 2016 cuz I do as

73
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:20,880
it was I swear the first casualty of the Trump I'm gonna go I took a bill in his

74
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,840
- If BeTha came out like two years ago.

75
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,680
- No.

76
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,480
You're just like, literally,

77
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:28,200
I looked at a picture of myself from seventh grade

78
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,120
and saw the time stamp in the corner was 2010,

79
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,480
and I got so freaked out.

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,960
- 2016, I took a pill in a BeTha.

81
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,280
- Then Avicii must have died 2018.

82
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,120
- Let's see.

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,640
- No, I think it was 2016, wasn't it?

84
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:44,640
- Avicii, Swedish DJ, born 1989, died 2018.

85
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,400
I bet you feel stupid as hell.

86
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
- I just said that.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
- Whoa. - What?

88
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,800
I said 2018. No you didn't. You were right. No you, no yeah I was right. Oh my god. No not you.

89
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,680
Yeah I was right. Not you. Because it was, it was that, it was that, it was June and it was like

90
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,360
Chester Bennington and Avicii. Yeah yeah I remember everyone. Chester Bennington, I feel like Chester

91
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,400
Bennington died ten years ago. No. Really? That wound is still fresh. Damn. It's still a very fresh

92
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,320
wound. Yeah. Not for me. Yeah. I'm glad you know. You know who killed him. You know, you know Avicii

93
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,480
and Chester Bennington are jamming together in hell right now. That's right. You know Chester.

94
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,160
Rockers go to hell yeah when Chester Bennington died he turned into liquid

95
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,000
metal like really bad like really 2000 cc yeah he went down a shower during it

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,740
went down like a like a snake like a snake yeah I heard he died exactly like

97
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:38,040
his death in in saw seven where all his skin got ripped off in a car oh yeah I

98
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,160
heard that he was in saw seven yeah he's cool dude he is all his skin gets ripped

99
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,080
ripped off and he screams he goes like like his like his Lincoln Park scream.

100
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:52,080
Oh my freaking skin! It's peeled from my bones!

101
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,960
He literally does like just his singing, he just like he's like like pull his

102
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,920
skin is getting peeled off he goes like. I can't stand Lincoln Park I hate

103
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,840
screamo stuff. Really? Yeah. I hate screamo and I hate emo because it's gay.

104
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,120
I mean something about emo. Something about gay having guys having long hair.

105
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,320
Screamo is basically about who can be screaming about having a pussy the best.

106
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,120
You're so stupid, because when it comes to Screamo, some artists like Chester

107
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,080
Bennington, they may have the screams of a devil, but they have the singing of an

108
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,320
angel. I don't even care. And the rapping of a gangster.

109
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:28,480
Linkin Park was, Mike Shinoda was basically the biggest thug on earth.

110
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:35,320
Pretty much, if you ask me. Why is he not in prison for being such a gangster thug, dude?

111
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:39,720
Did you see him? You should have heard his side project. Oh yeah, there's a lot of

112
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,800
song about being in prison for a large population of people being in prison for

113
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,120
being gangsta thugs. Yeah. And he named his song after- he named his

114
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:54,440
band after making a fort with children. What was he on? Styles of Beyond?

115
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,080
No, Fort Minor. Fort Minor. Yeah, he also named a song after what my

116
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:07,960
grandma can't do anymore. Remember the name. I forgot that was him. I thought that

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,820
song was called 10% look for a split second I was like that's what it's called

118
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,360
yeah I know those songs were swag was it am I misremembering this is there a

119
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,340
Linkin Park music video where they're in a giant sink no okay you're thinking of

120
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:31,060
Gnarls Barkley you know Gnarls Barkley gone daddy gone where there bugs I'm

121
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,440
your thing of the movie flushed away

122
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,560
very specific memory of a Lincoln Park music video where they're in a giant

123
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:43,400
like bathroom sink and they're all really small and they're singing like

124
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,720
the truth you can't I think I think you're thinking it was supposed to look

125
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:55,400
like like a ruin an ancient ruin maybe I thought that it was yeah I don't know

126
00:08:55,400 --> 00:09:00,120
you thought it was insane yeah cuz I mean that early 2000 CG yeah I was all

127
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,720
they do have a but yeah I feel like they're probably a three different music

128
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,720
videos where they look like they're in a sing. Yeah. The thing about Linkin Park

129
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,080
that sets them apart from other bands is most other bands will be too scared to

130
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:16,280
perform for Transformers. Yeah, they actually. Dude, their songs in

131
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,720
Transformers are so sick. Dude, going to see the new Transformers

132
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,440
movie every year on my birthday and be like damn what Linkin Park song are they

133
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,560
gonna put in next. The first Transformers, the first time I ever had caffeine. Yeah. I stayed up

134
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,120
to go see it at midnight. Dude, those movies are so good. And then I sat, I had a

135
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,820
small Red Bull and then I sat in my bed until 8 in the morning just like shaking

136
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:41,740
my legs like that. I had a time, my dad took me out of school one day and took

137
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,020
me to this like skate demo outside of Snowboard Jones in Manchester and I had

138
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,060
my first Red Bull there and my dad is like yeah it won't kill you. I was nine

139
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,380
years old had my first Red Bull. I was so annoying for the rest of the day.

140
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,060
Honestly now that I'm thinking about it I think that maybe that Red Bull ruined my

141
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,760
my life. Me too dude. I'm like that Red Bull, maybe one of the extreme sports

142
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:02,920
for

143
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:08,520
my first Red Bull until probably like three years ago. Really, I was always a

144
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,080
I feel like I got I never I didn't I don't think I had I was in the cafe, but

145
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,980
I never I never drank energy drinks until I met you. Yeah, only coffee. Yeah

146
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,940
damn yeah. I mean I still don't drink. I don't I didn't doesn't I'd maybe had

147
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,700
ten energy drinks in my life. I could probably still yeah. I was probably

148
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,180
- I'm still gonna count on two hands

149
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,960
how many energy drinks I've had in my life, yeah.

150
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,800
- I've had a lot now.

151
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,780
- I didn't get into energy drinks

152
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,160
until I transferred into Emerson.

153
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,640
I was like, I wouldn't drink coffee,

154
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,080
I was on Adderall anyway, so I figured I don't need this.

155
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,920
- That's the thing too, yeah.

156
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,960
- It's like I was on Adderall too.

157
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,160
- I feel like an energy drink probably would've killed me.

158
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,400
- When I was like 16, when I was like 16 or 17,

159
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,040
I would like, I wasn't, I was like somebody

160
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,920
who like tried to be, like I was like,

161
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,400
yeah, I would smoke cigarettes, but I was like,

162
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,400
energy drinks, that shit's so bad for you.

163
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,280
And then like, once I turned like 19, 18, 19,

164
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,200
I was like, everything that I like did in high school

165
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,340
was like, yeah, fuck it, like I don't care anymore,

166
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,160
like I'll just like drink like two Monsters a day.

167
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,000
- Yeah. - Yeah, I was--

168
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,680
- Dude, I was, like it's documented on this show,

169
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Like I was up to like two monster zeroes a day.

170
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,600
- That's not that crazy.

171
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,600
I feel like you used to drink a bang, right?

172
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,960
- Yeah, well there was that week where I was drinking rain

173
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,660
and I would just have panic attacks.

174
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,680
- Yeah, that's too much.

175
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
That's too much stuff.

176
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,020
- Too much too fast 'cause I fucking chug every,

177
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:36,000
like look at how gone this coffee is already.

178
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,400
- That coffee's gone as hell.

179
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,920
- Yeah, you're supposed to drink a coffee

180
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:40,800
throughout the day.

181
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,640
You're not supposed to like--

182
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,520
- That's not true.

183
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,360
- You're lying.

184
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
- Yeah, I am?

185
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,360
- You're, stop lying to me.

186
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,720
- I thought you were supposed to drink it

187
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,560
throughout the day. - You're supposed to

188
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,400
drink it in the morning. - Fuck no.

189
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,240
- Yeah.

190
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,360
- I had a really, this morning I woke up

191
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:54,800
and I had a cup of coffee and I was like,

192
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,040
it like made a noted difference in my day.

193
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,200
Which I haven't had that in a while.

194
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,040
- Yeah. - Like a cup of coffee

195
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,920
I'm like, whoa.

196
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,160
- I love chugging a mug of hot coffee.

197
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,000
- Dude, just drink. - It's the best.

198
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,840
- Taking one sip of it. - And just feel,

199
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,320
just the worst feeling of your life for one hour.

200
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,280
- You can feel just a pump shotgun of shit

201
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,680
just like in your ass.

202
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,520
- That's what I, yeah. - Just like, yeah.

203
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
- And it's just fully loaded. - It's so sick, dude.

204
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,720
- You walk into the bathroom.

205
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,480
boom it I mean it's literally a second yeah it's a five second scatter shot yeah

206
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,400
all over the toilet every cleaned out yeah but the toilet isn't and there's

207
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:30,160
just a black like there's a little one a little black spot above the that one

208
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,040
spot where the water doesn't hit yeah basin mm-hmm

209
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
y'all don't get your toilet it gets on the bottom of the scene you know that's

210
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,120
how explosive - it's on the bottom of the seat yeah dude I'll pull the seat up to

211
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,400
go pee and there will be like a ring of my shit all the way around ever looked

212
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,560
at the bottom of the toilet. I mean, I live with three men.

213
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,400
That's true. So you always keep the seat down.

214
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,600
Yeah. That makes sense. Yeah.

215
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,080
So what's the thing girls get mad at?

216
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:58,760
If you leave the seat up. If you flush because they want to look at it.

217
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,040
Yeah, they want to inspect your bed. They get mad if you flush.

218
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,160
They can tell by your poop if you're cheating on them. They can.

219
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,800
It has your wedding ring in it.

220
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,000
You're like, "Oh my god, a hot girl!" And you ate your wedding ring.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,680
Oh, I think you're getting fingered by a guy joke.

222
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,680
I would never do that.

223
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,800
That's gay.

224
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,760
It's like when witches in medieval times could read animals' intestines to tell the future.

225
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,640
A girl can read a poop to tell the past.

226
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,200
All women are witches.

227
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,680
That's actually true.

228
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
These are the daughters of the witches.

229
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
I don't think they're witches.

230
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,680
I think they're queens.

231
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,680
Yeah, evil queens.

232
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,480
Yeah, these are the daughters of the witches that we couldn't burn.

233
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,040
So let's finish the job.

234
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,400
you know what I'm saying? You know here's something I was thinking about the

235
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:48,280
other day. You know so you know snow white, so you know the story, you know

236
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,180
how like the evil queen yeah, the evil queen has like a magic mirror and every

237
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,160
day she goes to the magic mirror and she's like who's the fairest of all

238
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,320
who's the most beautiful woman in the land and I'm familiar yeah, the magic

239
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,440
mirror says it's you and what

240
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,240
one day snow white turned eighteen

241
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,560
- That's a good point. - The magic mirror changed its answer.

242
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,560
- Yeah, well let's be real. - What was the difference on that day?

243
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,060
Was it her eighteenth birthday? That was the only explanation I could think of.

244
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,460
Did she do her hair a slightly different way that day?

245
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
- I mean, let's be completely- - And that just gave her the leg up.

246
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,660
What is the real practical difference to this mirror?

247
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,260
The mirror's never gonna fuck her.

248
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,460
- Yeah. - It doesn't care.

249
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,460
- Also, it's medieval times. - Unless you know it's magic.

250
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,460
- It's medieval times. - Unless you know it knows objectively.

251
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,960
- She must have turned like thirteen, actually. - Yeah.

252
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,960
- That's true. - It's way worse.

253
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,760
- That mirror. - And the mirror's probably like a demon, so-

254
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,240
the mirror and the mirror was you know the mirror like checking in every day

255
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,240
that's the thing the Queen goes up to the mirror every day and acid and it's like

256
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,000
scan the case also fairing every pussy in the world

257
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,800
fairest the fairest so through the whitest is the yeah yeah who's the white

258
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,720
is no way to fair if I'm going by rhythm game standards should be who's the who's

259
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:16,080
the perfect of them all yeah we need black as night the new Disney Princess yeah

260
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:26,240
what's no pitch black yeah like blackface version of snow white they're like yeah

261
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:31,840
got like a really bad snow black. I think it was called coal black. I was gonna say

262
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,060
that

263
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:38,960
I said that's probably better than what I was gonna say. I was thinking cold black.

264
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,320
Why do you have the why do you have an inside the knowledge of race parities

265
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,760
princess ologist really? I just you know ever since I was a kid. I thought

266
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,960
princesses are beautiful. So no I just read it. I just tried to research

267
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,820
- Which princesses are mighty fair?

268
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,740
- Which princesses are problematic?

269
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,220
Which ones have done certain things?

270
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,000
- I'm glad I didn't go to Disney as a kid,

271
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,560
speaking of princesses. - Me too, yeah.

272
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,540
- Glad I didn't go, 'cause if I saw the Disney princesses

273
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,980
at like age three or four-- - Oh, you could not

274
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,820
hold me back.

275
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,200
- No, no, I probably would've turned out

276
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,040
like a much gayer child.

277
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,400
- I would've knocked him with a tree branch

278
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,640
and put him in a bag. - It was funny to go to--

279
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,200
- I would've been there. - What's the one in Florida?

280
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,540
- I would've asked my mom if I could land there.

281
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,820
- I don't even know. - It's probably Disney World

282
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,080
or something. - It's Disney World?

283
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:26,360
I went to go into that the first time last year. I mean like this sucks ass

295
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,960
So yeah, you're all you get it on my bike you get to choose if you're on a motorcycle

Motorbike motor back adventure or in the sidecar you would be in the sidecar. Why would I be?

297
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,380
What's there about is I'm loyal like a dog. Yes. Yes, I would

Your brain goes to what cousin it's I guard dog you watch too many cartoons. I mean have you ever seen a real sidecar?

Yeah, yeah

300
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,180
I don't think so

301
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,700
No dogs with goggles

302
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:52,860
I honestly think I still think sidecars are for dogs.

303
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,980
Why would you want to be embarrassed if you were if you were a human relating in a sidecar

304
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,140
and dogs?

305
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:04,580
It does make the riding the motorcycle way easier.

306
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,500
Yeah you can't fall over and if you do like a training wheel.

307
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,900
You just land on your damn dog.

308
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Yeah.

309
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,900
It's a fucker.

310
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,900
Right.

311
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:12,900
That's a good point.

312
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:16,440
I almost got Phil a backpack to put him in.

313
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,280

- You have to get your dog boots.

322
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,660
- He hurts his paws when he--

323
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,100
- That's a normal thing to get a dog.

324
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,940
- You know, he came back from a walk.

325
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,820
- In the city, in New York, yeah.

326
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,660
- In general.

327
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,500
- 'Cause there's a needle on the ground.

328
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,220
- 'Cause salt hurts their feet in the winter.

329
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,860
- He came back from a walk a couple days ago,

330
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:46,060
and I wipe his paws when we get inside and I was I wiped on a saw blood

331
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,560

I spit all over my feet of poop and pee all over them.

364
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,260
- Do you guys remember when your dad,

365
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,900
he would bend over to take the trash out

366
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,100
and you'd sniff his butt?

367
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,620
(laughing)

368
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,540
Do you guys remember that?

- That your dad smelled.

374
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,540
Hey dad, take credit cards, 'cause my nose is a credit card,

375
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,860
and then you slide your nose up his butt crack.

376
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,000
Yeah, like a credit card.

377
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,340
Like a credit card would?

378
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,180
Yeah.

379
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah.

380
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,180
It takes chip.

381
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,020
(laughing)

382
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,840
Yep.

383
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,680
Yes.

384
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,340
All right, so we gotta talk about the news, man,

385
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,920
the big news that happened the other day

386
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,320
that everybody's talking about.

387
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,820
Oh, everybody wants it.

388
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,920
Everybody wants to hear our take on this issue.

389
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,640
Everybody wants to hear about what we think

390
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,480
about Trump getting a hole in one.

391
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
- Yeah, that was pretty big news.

392
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,000
- I think it's awesome and I'm really happy for him.

393
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,160
- I think it's cool, yeah.

394
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,920
He obviously practiced a lot.

395
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
- Did you see the video of him walking up

396
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
to get the ball out of the hole?

397
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,360
- No. - No.

398
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,340
- It's so cool. - I actually didn't see this.

399
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,400
- Trump got a hole in one.

400
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,480
- You show me the video. - I didn't see it either.

401
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,800
- Dude, I'll find it, yeah.

402
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,320
It's like-- - I really wanna see this.

403
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,800
- Dude, he walks up and he's just like--

404
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,280
- At Trump Links?

405
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,520
- No, it was at a Trump golf course.

406
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,800
It's the only place he goes. - Yeah, Trump Links.

407
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,640
- No, it wasn't that one.

408
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,120
He has like fucking 50 of them.

409
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,120
Wow, that's so cool. He should be president.

410
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:03,620
He honestly, I watched this and I was like, we have to get him back, dude.

411
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,620
I hope he runs again.

412
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,620
He's like, it definitely recharged him.

413
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,120
Yeah.

414
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
Like doing this, you know.

415
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,620
Oh, fuck.

416
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:09,620
He should, dude, he should play Frolf.

417
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,620
Did I not like it, bro? Oh, God.

418
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,620
Dude, Trump should play Frolf.

419
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,620
True.

420
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,620
He should be, Trump should be an unlockable character in Ribbit King Plus 2 if they ever make it.

421
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,120
I would love to see Trump playing mini golf and getting really confused.

422
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:21,620
Oh, yeah.

423
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,120
Hitting the golf ball into the windmill over and over and over and over and over and over.

424
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,120
What is this? I can't even get into it.

425
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,120
It's broken. The windmill's broken.

426
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,120
The windmill is broken? I can't...

427
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,120
The golf course is broken. I can't open it.

428
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,120
He walks... That's a good impression.

429
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,120
You look like Gilbert. I know.

430
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,120
I can't open up the windmill!

431
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,120
Folks, you're not going to believe this. The ball did a loop-de-loop.

432
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,120
The ball went around the loop-de-loop.

433
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,120
Is that... that's not real...

434
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,120
That's John Daly.

435
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,120
It's there.

436
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,120
It's there.

437
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,120
He picks it up.

438
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,440
you know everybody comes walking out of the way.

439
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:00,280
I got a picture with you sir.

440
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,040
Just the fattest guys in the biggest polos of all time.

441
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,600
It's so funny that he says it's there because you can tell he's just losing

442
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,440
object permanence. He just doesn't, he wasn't sure it was going to be there.

443
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:15,800
It's there. He didn't even hit a ball. Yeah. I uh, uh, dude, hole in one.

444
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,000
I mean, as a golfer dude, that's, that's insane. That's like, I mean like you can

445
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,440
do a lot of presidents have a lot of achievements, a hole in one.

446
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,640
He might be the first president to ever have a hole-in-one.

447
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:24,640
Yeah, that's true.

448
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,640
Hole-in-one is like most...

449
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,000
Well, that's not true.

450
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Who has a hole-in-one?

451
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Obama.

452
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Does he?

453
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah, was that wedding?

454
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,680
That's right.

455
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:41,120
That's right.

456
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,360
He's standing up to salute me right now.

457
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,360
He's saluting me.

458
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,520
(humming)

459
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,520
Take your hat off.

460
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,360
- Yeah.

461
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:57,200
- That's a hero.

462
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,020
That's a hero.

463
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,720
- I took Obama.

464
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,040
Obama, if you listen to this,

465
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,080
your playlist last year sucked.

466
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,920
- Yep.

467
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,740
- Obama may have got a--

468
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,580
- I don't think you even listen to all the,

469
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,480
who has time to listen to 30 songs in a year?

470
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,680
- Obama may have got a hole in one,

471
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,880
but I heard Bill Clinton put his one in a hole.

472
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,720
- Yes, sir.

473
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,680
(laughing)

474
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:14,520
- Yep.

475
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,340
- Uh-huh.

476
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,920
- We have a take no prisoners attitude.

477
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,260
- I want a cigar.

478
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,260
- Yeah, hey.

479
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,120
- Did he really put a cigar in her thing?

480
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,320
- Yeah, and it was on fire and she exploded.

481
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,640
- She smoked it through her thing.

482
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,480
- Yeah, just take a dynamite.

483
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,700
She just was so stupid, she thought it was a cigar.

484
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,540
- She's not stupid.

485
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,600
- Monica Lewinsky?

486
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,280
- I'm a huge Monica defender, dude.

487
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,440
- Yeah, I bet you wanna defend her.

488
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,860
- I love her, dude.

489
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:37,100
- I wanna defund her.

490
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,080
- No.

491
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:38,920
- Defund Monica Lewinsky.

492
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,600
- I'm gonna give her as many funds as I can.

493
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,440

512
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,020

00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:23,020

515
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,140
doesn't care. He's not like that. He's literally the richest man in the world.

516
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,620
There's more money than anybody on earth. I mean he just like he knows what's up like he

517
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:35,140
understands the community. He does everything for the culture. Yeah it's not

518
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,240
- It's not about money, he knows that.

519
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,880
- That's true, he loves the culture.

520
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,980
- He loves the culture, yeah, the community.

521
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,880
- Have you seen, there's not a lot of photos of it,

522
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,480
'cause he's always in a suit, he's always bossed up,

523
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,820
but when he's in his plain clothes,

524
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,980
like him going to the store, he's in full Ame Leon door.

525
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:58,020
But when he's at the club, when he's in the bape hoodie--

526
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,140
- He turns up. - Oh my God.

527
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,340
- He's got the full zip.

528
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,840
- Stewie pajama pants.

529
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,240
Trump in the bait putty in the Stewie pajama pants.

530
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,920
He takes a lot of inspiration from Luke Blauvod.

531
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,680
And the Teva sandals.

532
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,920
(laughing)

533
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,600
He had, there was like--

534
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,200
And the cowboy hat.

535
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:19,140
The cat underneath, 360 waves.

536
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,400
Perfectly lavish, 360 waves.

537
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,280
Dude, did you see that picture of him in 7-Eleven

538
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,400

539
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,240
Yeah, dude.

540
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,060

gonna be one of the members of Brockhampton but they just moved forward

546
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,040
without him because he didn't want to move to LA. You see when he went to the

586
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,080

- On Triple G, let's be real, he crushed it, okay?

596
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,520
If one, it was him against Kenji in the final,

597
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,120
and then he, you know, he kinda,

598
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,400
I think he had the better dish.

599
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,480
I think they just gave it to Kenji

600
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,680
'cause he had a book coming out.

601
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,520
- That's true, yeah.

00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,960
You know, but who beats Bobby Flay?

605
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,800
- Right.

606
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,640
- Nobody, except Trump.

607
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,460
- He was also--

608
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,680
- He made ice spaghetti.

609
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,080
(laughing)

610
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,320
- Yeah, dude, so it was crazy 'cause it's like,

611
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,000
you think he wouldn't have enough time

612
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,600
to put the spaghetti in the ice cube trays

613
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,000
with the ice, but like, his whole thing was,

614
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,360
he already had the spaghetti pre-cooked

615
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,880
and then he put it in the ice cube trays,

616
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,200
put the water on it, and then just--

617
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,040
- Blast freezer.

618
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,960
- Stood there with his arms crossed

619
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,360
while it froze in the freezer.

620
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,480
is really remember when he was a contestant on the bachelorette and he

621
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,760

626
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,880

812
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,040
He's awesome dude.

813
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,040
Dude, he's so funny.

814
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:58,540
Fucking love that guy.

815
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,040
I love that guy.

816
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,040
People don't talk about this performance from Kung Fu Panda that much, but Stephen Kieran

817
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,040
as Gong Pig/Grateful Bunny was actually like next.

818
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
Fire.

819
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,040
Like it was flames.

820
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:10,540
Yeah, it was.

821
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:14,800
My nephew got into, I don't know how he found out about 16 candles, he's five years old,

822
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
he called me the other day and said...

823
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,080
- You should be watching Five Candles.

824
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,360
- Yeah, he should be, that's way too many candles

825
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,560
for him to be watching.

826
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:24,320
He called me the other day and just said,

827
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,720
"Donger needs food."

828
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:27,720
And I was like, "Oh, geez."

829
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,160
- Yeah, that's not a good movie for a child to watch.

830
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:33,520
- No, I don't know how he, I think maybe my dad

831
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,320
said it in front of him or something, but he...

832
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,840
- My son just turned five, we're watching 16 Candles,

833
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:42,520
Breakfast at Tiffany's, and Team America.

834
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:43,400
(laughing)

835
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,400
but just the Kim Jong-un part.

836
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,400
We're getting him prepped.

837
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,400
Yeah.

838
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,400
That's crazy. That's a crazy move.

839
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,400
Number one is Rick Roll.

840
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,400
Yeah.

841
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,400
He called me, so he called me and then

842
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,400
he'll call me and then do that and then

843
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,400
"No, this is Patrick" now.

844
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,400
He does "No, this is Patrick" to you?

845
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
What the fuck, man?

846
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,400
He calls me and says "Is this the Krusty Krab?"

847
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,400
You need to kill this kid.

848
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,400
Do you say "No, this is Patrick"?

849
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,640
(laughing)

850
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,480
- Here's a better question, dude.

851
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:18,000
Why does your nephew have a direct line to you, bro?

852
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,360
- My sister's phone.

853
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,860
- You should just never answer.

854
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:21,700
- Yeah.

855
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:23,360
- There's nothing important that this kid's gonna tell you.

856
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,340
- It's not true.

857
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,360
- What has he ever told you that changed your day?

858
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,780
- He got a new Lego set.

859
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:28,620
- And you thought about that later?

860
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:29,800
- That is pretty big.

861
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,920
- He got the Batman Lego set.

862
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:32,760
- Nice.

863
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,040
- I was with my family this weekend.

864
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:38,960
My cousin Jeffrey, he picked up the Catwoman

865
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,800
and looked at me and said,

866
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,240
"You gonna put this in a jar or something?"

867
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,760
and I said, "Whoa."

868
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:43,600
- That's pretty funny.

869
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,520
- That's a good joke, but don't say it

870
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,200
in front of these damn kids.

871
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:50,560
- If I was a kid and I got a Batman Lego set,

872
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:53,360
I would eat all the villains so they couldn't kill Batman.

873
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,240
Those villains are small.

874
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,080
- Yeah, listen, I'm a monster compared to you.

875
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:57,920
- You know the--

876
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,240
- The Joker has no, I can't do anything to him.

877
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,600
- I will chew you up.

878
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,400
- You know the fucking, it's like, oh, no,

879
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:07,160
like ages three plus, we don't want younger kids

880
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,840
to take a choke on these, right?

881
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:13,420
My little brother, when he was like three years old,

882
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:17,320
his whole thing, he would eat every fucking tiny action figure

883
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:18,160
that we had.

884
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,400
We had Star Wars micro machines.

885
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,920
He would eat the fucking things.

886
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:21,760
- He was gulping?

887
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,740
- He would eat all the like figures.

888
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:26,980
Like there's a tiny Chewbacca that came with this,

889
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,280
the fucking, I think it was the Endor one.

890
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,680
He fucking ate it.

891
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,120
I remember him taking it out of my hand and swallowing it.

892
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,920
- I think that you were an immoral child

893
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,760
if you were not eating the evil toys in your collection.

894
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,120
- One time my little brother, he--

895
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,460
He was eating the good guys, dude.

896
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,220
My youngest brother.

897
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:44,280
He was going to grow up to be a dark overlord.

898
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,700
He walked into the living room, like crying his eyes out, and he was like,

899
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,780
"What?" He was like, "I put a Lego or there's a Lego in my nose." And I was

900
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,700
like, "No, there's not." And I looked up with a flashlight and like an inch

901
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,380
into his nasal cavity, there was like a little red Lego. Like I have no idea

902
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,700
how he got up there. And I took him to two different doctors and they finally

903
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:05,780
like, when he had to like stick a balloon in his nose and inflate it from

904
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:09,640
the other side to pull it out and he hated it. He was like four and he was

905
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:13,200
like okay, I'm going to do this for my family. He said that out loud and then

906
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,920
he did it and then when we finally got the leg out, we were like why did you do

907
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,740
this and he was like oh, I didn't even do this. The dog did it. The dog put the

908
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:21,040
leg

909
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:27,300
and he maintains his day. He's like a teenager now and he's like yep, the dog

910
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:27,820
put the leg

911
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:35,520
so cool did yeah. Number two is doge. I think this is the dog that did it. He

912
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,540
does look a little bit suspicious.

913
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:38,380
- Yeah.

914
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,820
- Did you guys ever put anything up your nose?

915
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:40,660
- No, but I did.

916
00:47:40,660 --> 00:47:43,220
I swallowed, I was like laying on my back.

917
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:44,220
- You can say that.

918
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,620
- Yeah, I've put some things in there.

919
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:47,580
I was laying on my back when I was five.

920
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,420
- Tissue, finger.

921
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:51,900
- And I put a Lego in my mouth and it like went down.

922
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:52,740
(laughing)

923
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:54,340
And I got up and I like looked at my parents

924
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,220
and I just went (slurping)

925
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,580
and it was the first time I ever had the Heimlich done on me.

926
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:59,940
- The first time?

927
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,420
You had multiple Heimlichs?

928
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,140
- I've never had the Heimlich done on me.

929
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,660
- I've never even.

930
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:07,660
I come close to choking every once in a while. I'm eating this because I

931
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:11,360
thought the Heimlich and CPR were interchangeable. Oh, that's bad yeah.

932
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,580
Yeah, I yeah, I'll eat. I eat sometimes I'll eat too fast and it'll be like one

933
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,320
second where it's like well. I can't breathe or swallow I'm dead and then

934
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:22,420
it's fine every time, but I've it's it's happened enough times that I'm getting

935
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:24,060
registered to get really scared when I eat.

936
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:31,540
I try not to eat a little chew your food better. I don't know something. I just

937
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:36,100
I never learned my little I never learned. I don't problem with that in

938
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:40,020
preschool. Yeah, yeah, my parents tell me you have to chew your food more.

939
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,620
You're going to say no. I'd be like

940
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:48,500
why would you want to chew your food? It's a good point. Do I want to taste

941
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:53,940
that bullshit? Get it get it out of my mouth. Get it in my book. My tongue's in

942
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:57,760
there. My stomach that's where the flavor gets. That's what the flavor gets

943
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:00,120
process. I never learned how to chew my food is

944
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:07,720
you're on a day with a girl. So one thing about me is

945
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:14,120
so cool. My little brother choked on water one time and we told that happens

946
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,280
to me. I told him yeah. Oh yeah, that was like the kitchen table, like

947
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:20,840
and we're like what are you doing? I just drink water.

948
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:26,280
That is it was choking on the water. Oh, I mean yeah, just eat something. I

949
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:30,520
Yeah, yeah, if you're drinking water you got to eat something a set. Otherwise you'll die

950
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:37,520
It's true number three Chuck Norris jokes. Hell. Yeah, shit is funny as hell man. What's your favorite?

Tom Brady is like Chuck Norris

953
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:49,360
That's the dip. Yeah, here's my Chuck Norris joke one time Tom Brady and Chuck Norris were playing football Chuck Norris one

954
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:55,680
That's actually really good. Yeah one time Chuck Norris and Michael Jordan were playing basketball and Michael

00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:03,120
Chuck Norris were doing what Andre Agassi does

957
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:03,600
Yeah

958
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:08,900
And Chuck Norris won it one time one time Robert De Niro and Chuck Norris were acting and Chuck Norris was better at it

00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:12,680
Then you're a De Niro Chuck Norris and Chuck Norris killed Darth Vader. Yeah

00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,240
Yeah, basically if you use

Yeah, Chuck Norris is made out of Nokia phones. Basically Chuck Norris did better

962
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:27,720
did better karate than Jackie Chan the other day. Yeah. Chuck Norris beat Jackie Chan.

963
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:37,640
Yeah. Yeah and Chuck Norris did that for real. Chuck Norris counted to zero.

show looked like scary it was cool look it looked like a Robert Rodriguez I

998
00:53:28,820 --> 00:53:31,940
thought yeah I think that's a cool-ass show I've never seen it but I know I

999
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:37,420
used to watch that shit when I was like a kid I don't think I came out well

1000
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,940
after we that was when I was they came out on a seven I watch it when I was

1001
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:44,180
2007 I don't think that's true yeah it is I think this was like a like 2011 no

1002
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:48,900
pretty sure no LazyTown came out like 2004 and it was came out first in

1003
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:54,180
Sweden or some shit I have no he's always right about this kind of thing I

1004
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:02,980
learned from the ended right now 2004 dude what is wrong with you bro August

1005
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:07,620
16th I'm gonna stop trying to you're always right about stuff like that every

1006
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:11,400
single time and it was it was from it's from Iceland Iceland that's what it is

1007
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:16,860
same thing they all come from damn Viking sperm Norris is even colder than

1008
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:21,420
Iceland yeah he's colder than green oh he actually named guys like green I

1009
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:25,580
learned something really cool yesterday did you know that people used to believe

1010
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:32,220
that that that sperms can had a tiny guy inside them and that's how babies were

1011
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:35,580
born showed me the diet I showed you a diagram of this but so it goes it's

1012
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,020
that's deeper than that right. So they believe that that's a sperm had a tiny

1013
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:42,320
guy inside that would grow into the child, but then like philosophers were

1014
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:46,160
like well, then doesn't that mean that every like the guy inside the sperm

1015
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:49,660
also has a sperm inside him that has a guy inside it and a sperm inside that

1016
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:53,760
guy that has a guy to infinity and then the the the science the people who

1017
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:59,000
believe this who are called spermists were like yes, that's that's true.

1018
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,240
that's how it is and the

1019
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:07,200
they disproved it because they're like well, then why were they? Why how come

1020
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:11,160
sometimes babies look like their mothers and the the sperm is or is like I don't

1021
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,480
know

1022
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:18,680
sperm is as what they call me down a damn glory hole. What's up your yeah? I'm

1023
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:23,400
sucking all them off. I would have ate the comments. It doesn't taste like

1024
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,720
anybody to me. This doesn't taste like chicken. This doesn't taste like

1025
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:33,500
buddy I've ever ate. This doesn't taste very small. This doesn't taste, I've eaten a small

1026
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:40,300
guy before. This tastes pretty substantial I would say. What do you guys think it's like

1027
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:48,620
to be sperm? I remember. What was it like? I remember everything. Have you ever seen?

1028
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:53,860
Do you guys think that you guys were like popular as sperm? Yeah probably. I mean that's

1029
00:55:53,860 --> 00:55:57,060
That's the thing about all of us were the most popular sperm.

1030

1085
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:24,800
into the vat of latex. Those movies are so good. It's crazy. Every one of those

1086
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:28,280
movies is good. That shouldn't be true. How did he reach the kitchen counter to

1087
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:31,800
grab the knife? He climbed up on the stool. Okay and how does he use the

1088
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,840
bathroom? He doesn't have to. He uses diapers. Yeah. That's kind of

1089
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:39,600
embarrassing well that's also a telltale sign of a serial killer was it how does I

1090
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,120
haven't seen I haven't seen child's play four and five that's realizing they

1091
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,720
also Jennifer Tilly comes back to life Jennifer Tilly is for his bride of

1092
00:59:49,720 --> 00:59:53,840
Chucky yeah and if I watch that at a bar with Neil actually five is seed of

1093
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:59,760
Chucky that's my Glenn and Glenda yeah yeah and then oh have you seen the new

1094
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,920
series where he's like I gotta yeah yeah I'm binary that's I mean that's

1095
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,920
That's literally already what it is in Seed of Chucky.

1096
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,920
Chucky is a non-binary kid in the fifth one.

1097
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,920
Yeah.

1098
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:10,920
And then there's...

1099
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:11,920
But then they split them into twins.

1100
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,480
...Curse of Chucky and Cult of Chucky.

1101
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:16,680
At the end of Seed of Chucky, they split them into twins.

1102
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:17,680
Dude, I don't remember.

1103
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,680
I don't think so.

1104
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:23,360
Yeah, that's because the concept of non-binary in movies in '03 was just so foreign that

1105
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,720
they were like, "Well, they can't be a boy and a girl."

1106
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,720
I don't remember that.

1107
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,480
They have to split up into...

1108
01:00:29,480 --> 01:00:31,480
I think you invented that in your brain because you don't...

1109
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,480
No, the final scene of the movie.

1110
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:33,480
...you think you can't understand non-binary kids.

1111
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:39,880
The final scene of the movie, it's Jennifer Tilly at Glenn and Glenda's birthday party.

1112
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:40,880
I don't remember.

1113
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,440
And then Chucky comes back at the end.

1114
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,440
No.

1115
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,440
No.

1116
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,440
Like a screamer ending.

1117
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,440
Don't tell me Chucky comes back at the end.

1118
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:50,200
Dude, Curse of Chucky and Cult of Chucky are the ones where they have Brad Dourif's daughter

1119
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:51,400
as the main character.

1120
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:52,400
Oh really?

1121
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,360
Yeah, and those ones are really good.

1122
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,640
And then they're in an insane asylum.

1123
01:00:57,640 --> 01:00:59,240
The remake I thought was fine too.

1124
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:00,240
Really?

1125
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:01,240
Yeah, I didn't hate it.

1126
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:06,080
the one where Chucky says that's a game you can only play when you're high. Is

1127
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:10,640
that the remake? I've never seen a single that's the no that's that's I got them

1128
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:14,500
all on DVD. If you want to come over and watch them all in a row, really want to

1129
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,600
watch child's play. Great dude, very scared the shit out of me when I was a

1130
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,220
kid because the fucking the kid who jumps on the grenade that the best part of

1131
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:25,880
child's play three is that is one of my favorite like like side characters in a

1132
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:30,720
horror movie ever where it's like in said in military school and there's like a

1133
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:35,340
characters just like an evil barber who's just never explained any dislist like he

1134
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:39,740
just like sneaks up on kids and it's like i'm gonna cut your hair.

1135
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:44,740
I remember really vividly he like there's a scene where he like really

1136
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,780
violently cuts one of the kids hair and then he goes presto your bald.

1137
01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:53,460
That's not very and that's just like one of the things like oh yeah, there's an

1138
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:59,220
evil bar at the military school like that dude. It's so funny like like

1139
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:05,380
Military school is like the most evil place a kid can go in movies. Did you guys ever know when I went to military school?

1140
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:10,220
No, I I knew someone who wanted to but who didn't I knew this one kid

1141
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:15,420
He was he was literally he was too cool and he they sent him to a military school. Yeah, his name was Dylan

1142
01:02:15,420 --> 01:02:16,940
He was fucking awesome, dude

1143
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:21,560
He's the coolest kid I ever met and his parents were like we're like you're too you're too fucking cool

1144
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:25,460
He used to snort pixie sticks. Oh, you would pull it in one rip dude

1145
01:02:25,460 --> 01:02:28,660
Damn. And they were like, "You have to go to military school," and then he got really

1146
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:31,940
good at soccer. That's tight. Yeah, so it's really upsetting to talk about.

1147
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,140
Yeah, but like, you know, as a kid the scariest thing you can go to is the

1148
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:39,300
military school and then, you know, when you're when you're grown up they expect

1149
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:43,860
you to go into this damn draft to fight for Zelensky. Fuck you, Zelensky, you little bitch.

1150
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:47,620
Here's my fear about going to a military school. What if I become like the perfect human weapon?

1151
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:51,620
Yeah, exactly. You know, and I'm responsible for thousands of civilian casualties.

1152
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:53,140
and I'm the perfect human weapon,

1153
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:55,500
and I have to go over and fight for this

1154
01:02:55,500 --> 01:02:57,340
Funko Pop president of Ukraine?

1155
01:02:57,340 --> 01:02:58,420
Fuck that shit.

1156
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,820
- What if during a hazing ritual,

1157
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:01,660
I discover a taste for blood?

1158
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:02,480

- They call me the butcher of Syria.

1164
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,100
- Exactly, just because I went to military school,

1165
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,380
because I played too much video games.

1166
01:03:12,380 --> 01:03:15,380
- What if I'm the first soldier who fights in space,

1167
01:03:15,380 --> 01:03:17,660
and they call me the Hound of the Stars,

1168
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:20,740
