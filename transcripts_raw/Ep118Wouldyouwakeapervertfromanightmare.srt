- We were trying to fall asleep

92
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,600
and we just kept going back and forth and saying,

93
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,880
I'm that little ass homie

94
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,280
who fell between the couch cushions.

95
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,640
- I'm that little weird guy.

96
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,840
- I'm that little weird guy that fell between the couch.

97
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,960
- I'm that little ass homie

98
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,240
who gets into the nooks and crannies.

99
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,200
- It is a nightmare sleeping one room over from you two.

100
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,040
- I know.

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:30,880
- And just hearing you guys just keep going.

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,960
- You guys were watching TV all night.

103
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,920
- I was asleep, Janna was fucking watching TV.

104
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,960
And you guys were just.

105
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,380
(Janna and Matt laughing)

106
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,240
- We were trying to stay in our entire bedroom.

107
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,240
I'm back to being tired all the time.

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Yeah?

109
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
Yeah.

110
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
Did you leave being tired all the time?

111
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,240
No, I mean the past couple weeks I've been feeling good.

112
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,240
Really?

113
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,600
But I don't know, I think it's just hanging out with you guys.

114
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,000
It drains the energy and life from you.

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Stop, stop.

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That hurts you though.

117
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Stop.

118
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It'll wake you up.

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, I don't want to get hurt.

120
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,120
I don't want to get hurt again.

121
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,040
I think it's just like...

122
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,480
I pinched his bottom.

123
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,800
I pinched it.

124
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,360
All we did the first day, the first day we got here we stayed up drinking until like five

125
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,040
I should have waited until the last day to do that.

126
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Yeah.

127
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,040
That was so stupid.

128
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,440
And then, yeah, it drained me.

129
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,680
Like I got like, I ate a Euro and walked eight miles yesterday.

130
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,920
I'm like, I feel like fucking shit.

131
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Eight mile.

132
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Oh my god, eight mile.

133
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,360
But I'm also psyching myself out.

134
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,360
That's that soundtrack.

135
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:33,400
I'm also psyching myself out because it's like, oh man, I feel like shit.

136
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:39,120
And then it's like, I already had all the COVID symptoms, like, all the time.

137
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,720
I already had all the COVID symptoms in the car. I already had a fever and a cough and a sore throat when I was in the car with you guys.

138
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,320
I had them as soon as you guys picked me up.

139
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
I had those before COVID existed.

140
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,720
Every day I think I have COVID and then I realize I just am over.

141
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,720
I've been living in the fucking woods with my parents.

142
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Yeah, and I've been living there too.

143
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,120
Yeah, I've been staying with your mom.

144
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,620
No.

145
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,120
Yeah.

146
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
You didn't move in with my mom.

147
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,120
I didn't move in. I'm just staying there.

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,120
I'm that underground homie who lives in the dirt.

149
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
You're a worm?

150
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:07,620
Don't.

151
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,040
- Yeah, I'm that wormy little homie that squirms around.

152
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:11,880

153
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,920
(laughing)

154
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,360
You're like my only worm homie right now.

155
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,200
- You're my only worm friend.

156
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,040

157
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,680

159
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,480
- Do you have a pet worm?

160
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,720
- I do now, it's Cameron.

161
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,960
(laughing)

162
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,920
- I do have a pet worm. - Man, I miss my worm.

163
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,880
- I paid $16,000 for a purebred worm.

164
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,840
(laughing)

165
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,680
- Yeah, yeah.

166
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,640
- They breed it to have legs.

167
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,480
- I think you take a nap after this.

168
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,160
- It crawls on my couch.

169
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Yeah, yeah.

170
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,160
He squirms on there, dude.

171
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
Mm-hmm.

172
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
He squirts on me.

173
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
He squirts on me.

174
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,720
My purebred worm is a freak.

175
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
Worms have...

176
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,720
Is it true that worms...

177
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,720
I've never seen a worm poop.

178
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,760
Is it true that worms are easily confused?

179
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Yeah.

180
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,760
Yeah.

181
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
Yeah?

182
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Is that true?

183
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,760
Yeah.

184
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,760
If you tell a worm it's not opposite day, it blows its freaking mind.

185
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
It doesn't even...

186
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,760
Never tell a worm a riddle.

187
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
Yeah.

188
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,160
If you tell a worm a riddle, it'll go underground and hide.

189
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
That's scary.

190
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,440
The opposite day paradox.

191
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
Have you seen that?

192
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,280
what's that explain it can't it can never be opposite day because that means that

193
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:19,800
there is a day that's called not opposite day it can never be opposite day I really

194
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:26,160
sound like that no that's just what like supposed to be she really sounded no oh

195
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,040
yeah we've been fighting all day because this morning Kayla made us lattes and

196
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,760
Patrick asked for Caleb to make a pretzel on his lawn and make the art

197
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,000
Thanks for outing me as a gay artist who makes coffee.

198
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,800
I just feel like we need to be transparent about what's going on.

199
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Yeah.

200
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
Yeah, you want to be a transparent.

201
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,800
You want to be Jeffrey Tambor.

202
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
You want to be Jeffrey Tambor.

203
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
You like yelling at people on set.

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
That's right.

205
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
Did he get in trouble for sex or being too funny on set?

206
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,560
I don't remember right now.

207
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,600
It was definitely one of those.

208
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,600
He's too funny when we do the show with him.

209
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Yeah.

210
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,600
He makes us laugh.

211
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,600
We don't get any work done.

212
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,600
No, that would be ridiculous.

213
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
That doesn't make any sense.

214
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
He's not even that funny, dude.

215
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Yeah, come on.

216
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,600
You know he's not that funny, it's just the good scripts.

217
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
True.

218
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,600
It's really the writers.

219
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,600
It's really Michael Bateman.

220
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I love any time that...

221
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
It's really Jeffrey Bateman.

222
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Jeffrey Bateman?

223
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
Is that his name?

224
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
It's really Matthew Bateman.

225
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
Matthew Bateman.

226
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
It's really...

227
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:34,260

232
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:01,800
Yeah. I'm making you a stew. I need all four burners. Do you have like a huge cauldron?

233
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,920
Do you have a cast iron pot? Do you mind if I make a fire in the middle of your living

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,360
room? Put my cauldron on? I need to smoke this dinosaur leg. Yeah, I'm making potions

235
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:17,640
in your kitchen. Is that sick or what? Do you have mud? Do you have mud I could bake

236
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:24,560
into a mud I can use for a potion and little bits of leafs leafs leaves today

237
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,080
we're doing the most romantic things you do with her mm-hmm all men want to be

238
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,960
the most romantic person in the lives of their partners so when Valentine's is

239
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,960
around we always start thinking for long hours how to make this day the most

240
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,480
beautiful and romantic one here are some ideas for the beautiful couples to make

241
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:44,840
this day an unforgettable one mm-hmm unforgivable one here's a very

242
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,800
unforgivable Valentine's Day. I spent my Valentine's Day with the

243
00:09:48,800 --> 00:10:00,840
unforgivable one. I didn't have a choice. He filled my heart with chocolate. Yeah it

244
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,360
was really scary. Yeah he cast a spell on me. Number one kiss her slowly so she can

245
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:11,160
feel every spark. That's right. Oh my god. Top comment I plan on kissing my future

246
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,360
woman for the first time slowly and intimately and I'm hoping she will do

247
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,360
the same on February 14th. Women love when you kiss them slow as hell.

248
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,360
Slowly and intimately. When you kiss a woman sensually. Future women love that.

249
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,560
I'm about to go slug on that mouth if you're not careful. It really works out for both

250
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,080
of you. She might not even want the moment to end. It's true. So slow that it's forever.

251
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:37,160
That's right. Wow. That's what the unforgivable one does. He puts you in an infinite roll

252
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:44,160
that it lasts forever. He puts you in the phantom zone.

253
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,880
So does the unforgivable one. Definitely the best. Always works and it makes

254
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,880
her feel very special. Women love the yumminess of your lips touching.

255
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,080
Let her enjoy it. Be like. Damn.

256
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,440
Damn. If my boyfriend did this and it was perfect.

257
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,040
Would you love the yumminess of my lips touching you, Patrick?

258
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,520
Yes. Do they have like barbecue sauce chapstick

259
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,200
and shit? They have like Skittles.

260
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,080
I'm sure they have like bacon chapstick.

261
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,080
They probably do.

262
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,080
They better.

263
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,080
It's just bacon fat.

264
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,080
It's not even like...

265
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
Yeah.

266
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Yeah.

267
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,080
Cow, beef tallow.

268
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,040
Just eating it like chapstick.

269
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,080
Just going out on a walk and just getting mauled by a pipple.

270
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,960
Getting your lips ripped off.

271
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:24,680
A Reddit guy wearing bacon...

272
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,160
My lips were too juicy.

273
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,640
Wearing bacon flavored, bacon scented underwear to attract Reddit women and just getting his

274
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,200
dick ripped off by a dog the second he sets foot outside.

275
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
I don't think even reddit women like bacon.

276
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I think bacon is a treat for a male.

277
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Fine, a gay reddit man.

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,200
Okay. Alright, maybe that's it.

279
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Alright. Okay, maybe we could write a script about this.

280
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,200
A gay guy on reddit.

281
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
A gay guy? What would a gay guy on reddit act like?

282
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
Probably a guy.

283
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Yeah. Probably like a gay guy.

284
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
Yeah. On reddit.

285
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
He'd probably type kind of funny. Yeah.

286
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,200
He would probably go on relationship advice and say, "I'm gay, what do?"

287
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
[laughter]

288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:07,120
Yeah. Instructions unclear. Became gay. I accidentally became gay. I will probably

289
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,040
try this when we are dancing. FML. TIFU. It is the first thing a girl want to be is kissed.

290
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:20,160
That's true as hell. Where the hell is sex? It should definitely be on top one.

291
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:26,880
Does sex... sex isn't romantic. Romantic is the stuff that you do so that somebody will have

292
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:46,840

I'm going to stick my head down your throat and bob for your Adam's apple from inside.

340
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,300
I'm going to turn up for you, dad.

341
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,180
Just watch.

342
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,300
The top comment on this is, "This is the most intense way to express your true feeling for

343
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,860
her, knowing more romantic than this.

344
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,780
Got me the best sex."

345
00:16:55,780 --> 00:17:01,580
I love listening to slow music.

346
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:07,420
There's a comment that says, "When this I did this, she got nude and striped me and we

347
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,820
had some really nice sex.

348
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,220
Guys, it really works."

349
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,780
Someone striped me.

350
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,420
A little too much information, buddy.

351
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,860
And then another guy says, "Too much information.

352
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,860
Thanks for that."

353
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,860
I love information.

354
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:19,860
What a pervert.

355
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,780
Yeah, come on.

356
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,220
Don't tell people your girl striped you.

357
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
Be romantic.

358
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,280
- Yeah. - You're a sexual dude.

359
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,120
- What do you mean?

360
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,420
- Say I fell in love with my girl physically.

361
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,500
- Yeah. - Don't say we striped

362
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,460
each other. - Mm-mm.

363
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,500
- No, I mean, let's try and think

364
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,860
of some romantic things to do.

365
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,820
- Yeah. - Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,420
- You could-- - Would you wake up

367
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,860
a pervert from a nightmare?

368
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,860
(laughing)

369
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,860
- No, that wouldn't be romantic.

370
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,060
(laughing)

371
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:44,900
- Would you?

372
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,060
- You're not supposed to wake people up from nightmares.

373
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:47,900
- Yeah, you are.

374
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,060
- They could die. - No, they could die.

375
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
(laughing)

376
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,620
The nightmare could become real.

377
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,660
- That's true.

378
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,820
- That's like the rule.

379
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,660
- Mm-hmm.

380
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,420
Would you wake up a sensitive pervert and make his dreams come true?

381
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,620
Is he having a nightmare?

382
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:02,620
Because yeah, maybe.

383
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,620
Because a pervert's nightmare is me sticking my boot down his fucking face.

384
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:07,620
Fucking face.

385
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,620
Fucking face.

386
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,780
Trying to think of a romantic thing to add to this list.

387
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,820
Maybe like bending yourself into their name.

388
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,700
Maybe becoming a pretzel.

389
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,620
Becoming a pretzel that spells their name out.

390
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,180
Yeah, that might be a good idea.

391
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,180
Yeah.

392
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,180
language.

393
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Just for them.

394
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,180
Learning how to become a sign language interpreter.

395
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,340
Learning Spanish so you can talk to them.

396
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,340
That's romantic.

397
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,340
That's true.

398
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:36,580
Not screaming at them for doing yoga in the middle of the living room.

399
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,580
Asking them to marry you.

400
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
Yeah.

401
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,700
What's more romantic than that?

402
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
That's true.

403
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Asking them to marry you again.

404
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,540
Yeah, well, can you renew your vows?

405
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,100
Will you marry me all over again?

406
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,300
Will you marry, would you marry, if we could go back in time, would you marry your little

407
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:51,020
as homie?

408
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:53,380
Who's the one that got away for you guys?

409
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Cameron.

410
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,380
Patrick.

411
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,380
He's right there.

412
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,340
Wait, you're each other's one who got away?

413
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,340
What?

414
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,780
This might be a huge development, dude.

415
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,780
We might start a new season of the show right now.

416
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,060
We got away from each other.

417
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:08,020
We got away from each other earlier.

418
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,180
You're right next to each other right now.

419
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,020
No, we got away from each other.

420
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,020
Get back with each other.

421
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't think it can happen.

422
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,420
I can't do that.

423
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,860
Not after what happened.

424
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,860
Not after the things that happened to between us.

425
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,860
Too much happened.

426
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,100
Did someone make some decisions?

427
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
There was a nightmare involved.

428
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,100
Really?

429
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,540
was a nightmare. Sometimes love is a nightmare and life is a highway. Mm-hmm.

430
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:32,580
Yeah. Yeah. One day here the next day gone. Yeah. Sometimes the cow jumps over the

431
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,980
moon. Mm-hmm. Sometimes the farmers in the dell. I hate when that happens. That's too

432
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:43,580
scary for me. This is a sad and sensitive emotional episode. We're deciding to be

433
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,660
sort of a slower and emotional podcast. This is a quiet, this is a, this is if you want to have

434
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:53,480
lovely dreams yeah put this on or bed we're pivoting to lovely dream podcast

435
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,780
yeah let's do like let's do a guided meditation for someone to go to sleep

436
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:02,100
ready all right and look in the mirror before you go to sleep you look in there

437
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:05,540
you look there and you stare in the mirror for five minutes until you see a

438
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:09,620

440
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:18,660
you need to go to sleep so you can forget all about yourself. You smell like dog shit.

441
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:25,700
Patrick's asleep. We're walking Patrick through this. All right, now get in bed. Tuck yourself in.

442
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:31,860
Tuck yourself into a spot. If you do not have a mom around, tuck yourself in. That's right.

443
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,660
It might be tough. Avoid the wet spot. Avoid that stain. Avoid the wet spot in your bed.

444
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:41,140
Oh, what's that stain? Do you spill? What's that stain? You spill salsa in your fucking bed? What

445
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,580
What the fuck is that?

446
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,420
It's all right.

447
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,340
Give it a smell.

448
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,180
Double check before you go to sleep.

449
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,740
- Sprinkle some salt on your pillow.

450
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,260
- Oh fuck, you forgot to brush your teeth.

451
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,420
Get back out of bed. - Oh, get up, get up.

452
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,260
Wake up. - Go brush your teeth.

453
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,080
- Go to the bathroom.

454
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,220
All right, now we're back in the bathroom.

455
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,220
- Put your finger in your mouth.

456
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,860
- Put your finger in the toilet.

457
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,700
- Then put it in your mouth.

458
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,540
- Put your finger in the toilet

459
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,620
and then check to see if there's any wind in the room.

460
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,140
See what direction it's coming from.

461
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,140
Find the draft, right?

462
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,780
You feel the wind coming out from a wall.

463
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,900
- Go to the wall. - There's a hole in the wall.

464
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,300
Break the wall open.

465
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,980
Oh my god, you're in the Truman Show.

466
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,820
You see the set.

467
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,020
You're Truman.

468
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:17,020
You're Truman from the Truman Show.

469
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,220
You see the set, there's cameras everywhere.

470
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,420
Just go back to the bathroom.

471
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,220
Go back, go to bed in the tub.

472
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,700
If I found out that I was on the Truman Show,

473
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,900
I'd probably just keep doing it.

474
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,740
Yeah, why not?

475
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,960
I'd be like, it's a job, it's a living.

476
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,060
(laughing)

477
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,380
You know, you got a pretty cool life.

478
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,980
I would actually start just hamming it up a lot.

People know that and that follows me everywhere I go.

People say he laughs through the pain like a thug clown.

What the hell?

502
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,820
Just because.

503
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,820
It's a bad choice.

504
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
Yeah, that's bad optics dude.

00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,820
You're making bad choices right now.

You're making bad choices today.

507
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,820
I think I'm making good decisions.

508
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,380
Number seven, lay with her in her bed and wrap your arms around her. Maybe stroke her hair.

509
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:34,100
No. He's not even sure. He can maybe stroke her hair. Yeah, maybe. Here's a comment. Joey

544
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:29,740
That's true. A jawbreaker is what they called Ed's cock. That's why it was called a jawbreaker.

545
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,980
Because he was busting. He was busting up his jaw. It was too big dude. It was too thick.

546
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,100
Yeah, and that thing on Double D's head, that's right, it was a condom.

I sing to my girl every time I like to wake up with a beautiful song.

668
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,040
I love you when your hair turns gray.

669
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I'll love you if you gain a little weight.

670
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,040
'Cause she is the rose that blooms in my garden.

671
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,840
Gosh, I'm so in love with her every sec of my day.

672
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
It will be three years next month.

673
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,340
Baby, can I sing for you?

674
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,840
Can I freestyle for you real quick?

675
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,840
I love little girls, they make me feel so good.

676
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Hi-ho the Dario, the farmer in the dell.

677
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,840
She loves when I do my ukulele version of "Shippin' Up to Boston."

678
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,840
I'm that diddly darn doge.

679
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,840
How much is that dog in the window?

680
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:58,040
How much could that little dog be?

681
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,840
Well yes, but timing is everything.

682
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
If she's trying to discuss something with some friends

683
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,920
and you pull her away and start Rickrolling her,

684
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,120
there's a 50/50 chance you're doomed forever.

685
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,200
It's gonna work.

686
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,680
Nah, the Rickroll, bitches love getting Rickrolled.

687
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,500
'Cause you're telling them

688
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,840
that you're never gonna give them up.

689
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,400
Yeah.

690
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,040
When me and Jennifer started dating,

691
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,720
she didn't know what that was, dude.

692
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,560
Damn. What?

693
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,880
Can you imagine somebody not knowing what a Rickroll is?

694
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,780
Yeah, I know.

695
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,620
That's crazy, dude.

696
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,600
My first Rickroll.

697
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,440
Yeah.

698
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,160
Spotify ads now that Rickroll you.

699
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,480
It was like dating a caveman.

700
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
That sounds fun though.

701
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,480
Yeah.

702
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Here's the bottom comment.

703
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,840
I would ask him if he is crazy because he sounds like a cock crowing.

704
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,920
You sound like a serious crowing cock right now.

705
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920

706
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,920

00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,520
Your sound makes my cock growing.

711
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
Okay.

715
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:06,200

718
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:18,480

They're talking about the Dan Soder show. Yeah, that's true. Listen to the bonfire.

Listen to the bonfire with your wife. She's gonna go crazy for the Gillis episodes.

732
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,320
Ah, no bonfire in the house or in my room. This will not make me want to have sex with you.

733
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,800
It will make me want to call 9-1-1 and say fire.

734
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,320
Mm-hmm.

735

Did you say tire?

741
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:47,000
If her favorite movies are crappy rom-coms,

00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,440
then fuck no from Beatles fan 1964.

743

I hate when my bitch like rom-coms.

744
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,040
Holding hands while walking on a private beach,

745
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,200

746
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,040

Yeah, he actually just did that.

750
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
When my boyfriend takes me on a private beach,

751
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,260
I go on Google, I search holding hands

752
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,440
while walking on a private beach,

753
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,920
and I comment on the first thing they say.

754
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,760
He just did it.

755
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,360
I literally just did that shit right there.

756
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,920
Number 21 goes skinny dipping.

757
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,240
You guys ever gone skinny dipping?

758
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,080
No. No.

759
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,600
I did it one time. In the tub.

760
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,440
(laughing)

761
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,240
I go skinny dipping in the shower.

762
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,080
Yeah.

763
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,440
I went skinny dipping in Yosemite,

764
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,840
and there's a picture of me

765
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,400
with the smallest penis in the world.

766
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,400
Yeah. Can I see?

767
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,080
Yeah, it's somewhere in this house.

768
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,000
But you have to find it.

769
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,680
And you have to solve my riddle.

770
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,520
I want to play a game.

771
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,240
Under the couch, it may lie.

772
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,080
That's the riddle.

773
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,320
(laughter)

774
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:42,160
- That's the riddle.

775
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,480
- That's the entire riddle.

776
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,320
- Number--

777
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,800
- In the fridge you may find the photo.

778
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,760
- Number 22, take her to the terrace under the moon

779
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,040
and say even the envious moon is hiding behind the clouds.

780
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:53,880
- Hey baby.

781
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,580
- And the top comment is, it's terribly crap.

782
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,960
- It's true.

783
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,160
- Even the envious moon is hiding behind the clouds.

784
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,040
- Even that envious moon is hiding behind the clouds.

785
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:04,860
- It's terribly crap, isn't it?

786
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,540
- I'm in the terrace under the moon, by the way.

787
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,580
I know it's a hall.

788
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,340
- Number 23, watch a movie with her.

789
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,860
- No, this never works. - Top comment.

790
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,820

793
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:23,460
- Did this to my wife and gave her a back rub

794

797
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,220
Do this for her when you are in a fight

798
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,140
or for any occasion.

799
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:30,980

and blushing which was so adorable and make sure the movies are scary movies

893
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,660
because she will scoot closer to you and you just wrap your arms around her and

894
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,380
hold her tight and assure her that she is safe with you it works trust me so the

'cause songs that you have sex to

963
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,180

'Cause it's like an instruction book, you know?

00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,060
If I had Wi-Fi it would be over for me.

1006
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,100
And a TV in there.

1007
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,060
Would you be homeless if you got a billion dollars from it?

1008
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,860
Yesterday we walked by a kid around here who was wearing a t-shirt, like a little kid who

1009
00:50:09,860 --> 00:50:14,460
was wearing a t-shirt that was the Wi-Fi logo, but each of the bars had words in them and

1010
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,260
it said, "What's the deal with Wi-Fi?"

1011
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:17,260
What the fuck?

1012
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:18,260
New York is a crazy place.

1013
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,260
What the fuck?

1014
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,260
That's a good shirt.

1015
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,260
New York is a crazy place.

1016
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,260
The thing is, everybody's trying to be a comedian.

1017
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,260
Yeah.

1018
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,260
Yeah.

1019
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:28,260
So you got kids.

1020
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,260
The kid's working on his type 5.

1021
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,260
Listen, kid, that's the funniest shirt I've ever seen, but I'm kind of the comedian in this neighborhood.

1022
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,260
I'm the comedian of New York.

1023
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:35,260
I'm going to drive you out of here.

1024
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,260
Mm-hmm.

1025
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,260
I'm that New York comedian.

1026
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,260
You have to leave.

1027
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,260
I'm that New York comedian with the funny-ass jokes.

1028
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:43,260
I'm that New York comedian that talks about his parents.

1029
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:46,260
I'm that tiny little comedian you can't see on stage.

1030
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:47,260
Yeah.

1031
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:52,060
Spotlight can't find me. Yeah. Because I'm too small. I'm that invisible comedian.

1032
00:50:52,060 --> 00:50:55,740
I'm that tiny little comedian that uses the mic wire like a jump rope.

1033
00:50:55,740 --> 00:51:00,540
Mm-hmm. We should all, when stand-up comes back, we need to, I mean it's

1034
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,820
different now. We got to come up with some characters to be doing on

1035
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:07,100
stage. Yeah. You know, some funny kind of meta like Neil Hamburger type shit.

1036
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:11,860
Basically I'll be headlining a lot of shows as your tiniest homie. Yeah.

1037
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:16,820
true I gotta be the prince yeah the prince of poppers the prince of poppers

1038
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:29,580
yeah yeah yeah yeah it's sliding down my fucking leg just about to be good I'm

1039
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,860
that tiny ass homie who visits a crack in the sidewalk like it's the Grand

1040
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:41,460
Canyon do you think ants have like parts of the sidewalk that they think are cool

1041
00:51:41,460 --> 00:51:47,560
This is my favorite part. This is my favorite ant hill kids were coming up on the best part of the sidewalk right now

1042
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,260
You think ants have playdates with each other? Oh, you can't have wives and sons

1043
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:56,040
Yeah, they have the one queen is the one wife, but do you know it's just other girl ants?

1044
00:51:56,040 --> 00:52:01,220
No, but they don't they're not married, but they get those are those single those are those single freak females

1045
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:06,320
They get a little side ant though. Yeah a little side ant. Yeah, here is the queen side ant man

1046
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,320
I'm trying to get some thorax from a side and

1047
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,400
My side ain't got that good-ass thorax.

1048
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,400
You got a good thorax.

1049
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,400
That's some real shit, dude.

1050
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
Ooh, wouldn't the thorax crunch on you?

1051
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,400
Oh, man.

1052
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:18,400
Is it ants?

1053
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:19,400
I'm trying to get some mandibles.

1054
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:21,800
Let me look to see what an ant's penis looks like.

1055
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,160
I'm trying to get pedipalps from a spider.

1056
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,160
Can you look it up?

1057
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,160
Look it up on the laptop.

1058
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:27,160
I want to see what it looks like.

1059
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:28,160
An ant's penis?

1060
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,160
An ant's penis?

1061
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:30,160
Do they have a penis?

1062
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,600
No, they have sex with their minds.

1063
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:34,720
Ants could be psychic.

1064
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,760
You could tell me ants use psychic powers.

1065
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:38,760
I would say yes.

1066
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:41,680
I would say science is true.

1067
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:42,680
I believe science.

1068
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:43,680
Science is real.

1069
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,680
Oh, it looks like this.

1070
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,680
Oh, okay.

1071
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:46,680
Let me see.

1072
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,680
Interesting.

1073
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,960
It's an anthill in the shape of a penis.

1074
00:52:49,960 --> 00:52:51,440
Did you search an ant's penis?

1075
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:52,440
Do ants have penises?

1076
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,440
Strangest creatures.

1077
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:58,360
That thing is pretty strange.

1078
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:01,180
That's a penis.

1079
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,560
I don't think that ants have penises.

1080
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,800
Let's just look at penises for the rest of this episode.

1081
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:05,800
It doesn't look like it.

1082
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,080
I think it's an answer, but what does that go up?

1083
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:14,240
Justin Bieber where they circled his like crotch and it says a penis for ants.

1084
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,520
That damn.

1085
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:18,160
Zoolander shouldn't have said that.

1086
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,040
Yeah, Zoolander kind of messed the game up with that.

1087
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,280
Zoolander went off when he said that.

1088
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,080
Zoolander snapped and said is this a school for penises?

1089
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:28,480
What is this a school for penises?

1090
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,360
My little penis?

1091
00:53:29,360 --> 00:53:31,600
That's what he says when he has sex with a girl.

1092
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,240
What is this?

1093
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,160
What is this a vagina for penises?

1094
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,600
What is this college for my wiener?

1095
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:41,560
You like my wiener?

1096
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:42,560
It went to college.

1097
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,940
Yeah, I have the smartest wiener in the west.

1098
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,200
That's just some real shit, brother.

1099
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:49,680
We're out of items on this list.

1100
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,680
Oh, damn.

1101
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,680
Yeah.

1102
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:52,680
That's alright.

1103
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,680
Let me get another beer.

1104
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:54,680
Yeah?

1105
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:55,680
Yeah.

1106
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:56,680
I think I might get another beer, dude.

1107
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,680
Alright, get another beer.

1108
00:53:57,680 --> 00:53:59,200
Let's do a list of what's in Caleb's fridge.

1109
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,200
Okay.

1110
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,800
Eggs, yogurt, beer, a jar of dots.

1111
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:14,400
there's a jar of dots. No, it's garlic. That's just a bunch of white dots. Jam, broccoli, an urn.

1112
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:21,000
A frozen condom. Eggs. Oh shit. Oh shit. We sped through this list.

1113
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:24,600
We sped through this list. Oh yeah, we started at 10 minutes because you were crying.

1114
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:30,300
Oh yeah, that's true. Why do you keep crying, Pat? Yeah, there we go. Get this.

1115
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,300
The noise of beer.

1116
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,300
Makes me so hungry for a beer sandwich.

1117
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,300
There's something delicious about the noise of beer.

1118
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:38,300
When you guys were kids, did you ever have beer bread?

1119
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:40,300
The noisiest beer of all time.

1120
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,300
I don't think so.

1121
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:44,300
I always, I always thought that that was a

1122
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:46,300
You just don't want to have to finish the episode.

1123
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:48,300
Yeah.

1124
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:50,300
That's fine. He's gone.

1125
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,300
Now we finally get to go on our date.

1126
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,300
Yeah. Hey. Hey.

1127
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,300
What's your favorite song?

1128
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:58,300
Anything that you like.

1129
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,940
I like that you like I like the wheels on the bus

1130
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:07,580
Okay, I take it back. Yeah. Yeah, I was trying to trick you. I don't like song. My favorite song is

1131
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:10,020
changes by Tupac

1132
00:55:10,020 --> 00:55:14,020
That's right. Favorite song is the that puberty song from the Brady Bunch

1133
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:17,100
I'm a fan of tickle biddies myself

1134
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,020
Yeah, tickle biddies is kind of my jam

1135
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:25,980
I'm a big fan of that Mortal Kombat parody rap take all the goodies. You know, that's fine as a first song I ever heard

1136
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,980
Yeah

1137
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:33,740
That was actually the first one. We did that on the last episode. It's funnier if you do it with

1138
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:38,860
Tiggle Bitty. If you do it every episode. Yeah. If just for the rest of my life

1139
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,980
anybody says yeah do you like that song? I'll be like yeah. That's actually the

1140
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,180
only song I've ever heard. It's really weird. Patrick's on mic in the bathroom.

1141
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:51,860
I'm in the bathroom. I'm taking so many pees. This is the noise of

1142
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,100
Patrick peeing. Mm-hmm. Pat is peeing on the ground right now. That's my noise.

1143
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,100
shaking up his penis to prepare to pee.

1144
00:55:58,100 --> 00:56:01,380
That's true.

1145
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:03,380
That's what it sounds like when Patrick jacks off.

1146
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:05,380
Get out of here mom, I'm trying to get, I'm trying to start peeing soon.

1147
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,380
I'm trying to start it.

1148
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,380
I'm trying to get the pee to come to the end of my thing.

1149
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:11,380
I'm trying to start it up.

1150
00:56:11,380 --> 00:56:13,380
What was the worst thing, did you guys ever get?

1151
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:15,380
Lying down in the night next to Patrick and just hearing.

1152
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,380
(laughing)

1153
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:19,380
Did you guys ever get caught

1154
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:21,380
jacking off as a kid?

1155
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,380
No, I never did.

1156
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,380
What? I did not either.

1157
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:28,180
porn in my search history, but I never got caught like jacking off.

1158
00:56:28,180 --> 00:56:32,340
I got caught. I got caught my I had a bathroom that did not have a lock on the door and my

1159
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:37,300
little brother walked in and he saw he just he just saw me holding my penis and jacking off and

1160
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,700
he's like what the fuck are you doing and that's not how you pee. I just panicked and said I was

1161
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:49,300
reading. I'm reading. I was like I'm reading. I'm reading the braille. I'm reading. You know how you

1162
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,060
play with your wiener while you read to focus? You know how you play with your thingy? I'm a

1163
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,140
- Like a tactile learner.

1164
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:57,660
That's just how it is, dude.

1165
00:56:57,660 --> 00:56:59,900
It's like a fidget spinner.

1166
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:00,740
- Yeah.

1167
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:02,700
- Yeah, my penis is called a ring spinner.

1168
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,340
- When it's your penis, it's more of a midget spinner.

1169
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:06,180
- Oh!

- Pretty much anything you've asked me, I would do.

1178
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:21,820

You piece of shit.

1196
00:58:05,220 --> 00:58:06,220
He doesn't even think it's funny to find a little guy.

1197
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,620
Do you want to go get like a Red Bull or something before we do D&D?

1198
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:09,620
Yeah.

1199
00:58:09,620 --> 00:58:11,620
Yeah we got to do some D&D action a little bit.

00:58:11,620 --> 00:58:12,620
Oh yeah that's right.

Or just nap.

Yeah maybe.

1205
00:58:16,620 --> 00:58:17,620
We can all just hop in my bed.

1206
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,460
- Like a doll hop.

1207
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:19,300
- Ooh.

1208
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,120
- Yeah.

1209
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,820
- Ooh, yesterday Caleb took a three hour nap

1210
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:23,100
and locked us out of his house.

1211
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,940
- It's true.

1212
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:24,760
- I gave you my keys.

1213
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:25,700
- Yeah, we did have the keys.

1214
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:26,700
- They didn't work.

1215
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,860
You gave us fake keys.

1216
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,820
(laughing)

1217
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:30,220
- You gave us the baby keys.

1218
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:34,620
- Yeah, I'm handing you a thing of,

1219
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,420
like a plastic toy key,

1220
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,540
and I'm like, okay, this one opens the front door.

1221
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,140
This one opens the deadbolt.

1222
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:40,980
- Yeah.

1223
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:41,800
- And this one--

1224
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,060
- This one opens the toy chest.

1225
00:58:43,060 --> 00:58:44,140
- This is the tastiest one.

1226
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:44,980
- Yeah.

1227
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:45,800
- If you're gonna suck on them.

1228
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,060
(laughing)

1229
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:49,060
This is the best one for chewing on.

1230
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:53,620
Caleb locked us out of his bedroom when he was spending special time in there.

1231
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,280
He should let me sleep at the foot of his bed.

1232
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:00,260
Yeah, we were scratching at the door and whining and he wasn't doing anything about it.

1233
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,920
You guys, I tried sliding food under the door.

1234
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:07,200
But my pot roast was too big. It wouldn't fit.

1235
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,300
I got that tall-ass pot roast.

1236
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:09,800
Yeah.

1237
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
You're gonna want to take a bite.

1238
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:13,800
I think he did a flat pot roast.

1239
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:17,560
I asked my mom to make the pot roast flat so I can slide it under my brother's door.

1240
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,400
Yeah, so I don't have to talk to him.

1241
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:24,040
I think I do. I have a huge gap in the bottom of that door. We could slide some stuff.

1242
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:25,800
If you guys want to like pass each other stuff.

1243
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:28,200
Yeah, can we whisper under there at night?

1244
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:31,960
Yeah, I can't hear everything you guys say at night. That's kind of why.

1245
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,000
What did we say last night?

1246
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,200
We didn't say that.

1247
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,640
We didn't say that.

1248
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,080
That might have been the TV.

1249
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,040
That was the TV.

1250
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:40,760
