1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,160
(sipping)

2
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:04,320
(sipping)

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:11,880
(burping)

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,280
- You're listening to Beers We Drink,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,080
America's number one beer broadcast.

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,280
(record scratching)

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,860
(upbeat music)

8
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,280
- What's up all my chuggers?

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,520
Trying to get that move out.

10
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,960
(gagging)

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,640
- This is a journey into--

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,480
- Into the middle of--

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,320
- Plain and simple--

14
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,140
- Bud Light.

15
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:36,820
And welcome back.

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:40,660
Oh the thing.

17
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,660
You don't need to clap.

18
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:43,460
We haven't had to clap for so long.

19
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:48,820
It's like a, it makes me feel like it's a, it's a snoot joke and it's completely stupid.

20
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,820
It's not.

21
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,820
Saturday we did a snoot joke.

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,780
Is your new joke sitting four feet from the microphone too?

23
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:55,260
This is part one of your other jokes?

24
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,380
I don't know what you're talking about.

25
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,380
There we go.

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,300
- He's addicted to never talking into the mic,

27
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:01,500
he's addicted to clapping,

28
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,980
where we don't need to clap.

29
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,500
- That's 'cause he's, it's fun to be,

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,740
he's a noob, he's new to all this.

31
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:08,900
- He's also addicted to living.

32
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,740
- He's addicted to living.

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,580
- I'm addicted to living.

34
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,220
- Messiest room of all time.

35
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,540
- It's not that messy.

36
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:16,380
- Every time, every time.

37
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:18,020
- All right, wait, let's take a look at this.

38
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,660
Lived in, that's what the realtor would say,

39
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,940
walking through.

40
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,820
As you can see, it's lived in.

41
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,140
There's 40 piles of t-shirts.

42
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,940
No man on earth needs this many clothes, man.

43
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,300
- I just have to get rid of them, you know?

44
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,140
- Mm, yeah.

45
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:35,960
- I just buy them.

46
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,800
- Is that what you say?

47
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,020
If trash piled up, you'd say that too?

48
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,980
Yeah, I just have to get rid of all that trash.

49
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,860
- Last week, he just like impromptu,

50
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:45,140
like sends me a message while I'm like streaming,

51
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:48,140
and it's just like a screenshot of his Amazon purchases,

52
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,780
and it's like, almost like 30 socks, 30 pairs of socks,

53
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,540
and he just says, "Men's shopping."

54
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,980
(laughs)

55
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,420
And I have to ask him what his deal is,

56
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,540
And he's like, I just keep losing my socks.

57
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,540
And I was like, okay.

58
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,960
- That is a really bad problem to have.

59
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,580
All right, let's talk beer, man.

60
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,420
- Okay. - Yeah.

61
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:09,140
- Last week, I really enjoyed not having to go out

62
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,540
and get my own beer.

63
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,260
So for the people at home, this is a makeup episode.

64
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,740
We were supposed to do this last night.

65
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,100
And then the most,

66
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,980
Jubio came through with the most Mexican excuse

67
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,780
I've ever heard in my fucking life.

68
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:22,520
Which is, yeah, my entire family showed up.

69
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,420
And they have to watch a football game,

70
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,220
which is a soccer game at my house for three hours.

71
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,380
And then it was just, it wasn't gonna happen.

72
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:34,860
- Well, the thing was there was a huge car accident

73
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,300
that it completely closed down the road.

74
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,140
So it was completely out of my power.

75
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,060
- So does that diverted all the football traffic

76
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,900
to your house?

77
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,740
Well, it makes no sense.

78
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,580
- Yeah, sort of, exactly, that's what happened.

79
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,700
- I think that these people are making excuses.

80
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,820
They're being rude, they're staying too long.

81
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,980
The point is, my wife picked up my beers again

82
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,800
and I said this time,

83
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:57,300
Please don't give me a fucking bush light, you fucking dildo.

84
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,840
Don't, please don't do that.

85
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:00,040
- You call her a dildo?

86
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,520
- No, I don't know, I've never said that before.

87
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,680
I've never used that as an insult until right now.

88
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,520
- Dip.

89
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,600
- I think I'll probably never say it again.

90
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,640
It did not feel good.

91
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,960
I felt like I was in the office.

92
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,200
- That felt very awkward.

93
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,600
- Yeah, you dildo.

94
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,800
(laughing)

95
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,520
I wanted to say the C word,

96
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,880
but I was like, she's in the other room.

97
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,400
I also don't, I don't like, I don't like saying that word,

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
but it was what came.

99
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,740
Cuck? You thought I was gonna call my wife a cuck?

100
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,320
Yeah.

101
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,920
No, I was thinking the anti-Semitic C word.

102
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,000
But what I ended up getting, which she brought me...

103
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,360
A circle.

104
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:39,600
Was a Victory Berry Monkey

105
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,360
Fruited Sour Triple, which is nine

106
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,320
and a half fucking ABV points.

107
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,440
Yeah, that's a beast of a beer.

108
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,960
She got, she did you right.

109
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
This is a good beer?

110
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,560
Yeah, Victory's good.

111
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,020
I took my sip.

112
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,520
Oh!

113
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,840
Oh! You drink these, man?

114
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,680
What, the Sours or the Victories? The Sours.

115
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,440
Yeah, I drink them. You know he just drinks everything in the world.

116
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Yeah, well this is only a double. It's a double deluxe.

117
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Oh, okay. What does that mean if it's been fruited? What does fruited mean? That just means

118
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,760
that they put fruit in it, right?

119
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,120
Yeah, probably they put fruit in multiple times in the brewing process.

120
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,400
Oh, and I just had a fucking.

121
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,560
And I just learned of a giant splinter on my finger.

122
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,760
Ouch.

123
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,760
How or I put myself on my rucksack or something.

124
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,560
All right. So here's what I've got.

125
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,700
OK. Yeah, you got a steamrolled.

126
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,620
I've got a crabby cake, double deluxe.

127
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,820
That's like it's it's got to be kaka.

128
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:53,020
Well, it's this crappy cake with a K, which is a

129
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:58,000
a smoothie style sour ale of double

130
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,400
mary and berry, double blueberry, double marshmallow,

131
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,060
cake mix and vanilla cream.

132
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,440
Yeah, and the marshmallow kills me, man.

133
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,500
I don't know about that.

134
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,240
Here's take a look at the color.

135
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,420
Wow. That is a thick fucking.

136
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,420
Whoa, check it out.

137
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,840
Fancy, fancy receptacles to drink beer out of.

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,940
Look at this. You're still using cans of beer.

139
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,340
You're right. This is a great idea.

140
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,980
From now on, we should be drinking this in something transparent

141
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,520
so that you can see what it looks like.

142
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,760
Yeah. You guys are 100 percent right.

143
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,620
I feel like a fool.

144
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,020
I need to get a a Stein, a clear glass Stein.

145
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,500
This is a Bubba Gunk novelty cup.

146
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,400
Whoa.

147
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,540
Bubba Gunk.

148
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,440
That's the kind of that's you drinking Bubba's Gunk right now.

149
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,740
That's what that looks like.

150
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,140
Not while I'm drinking the fruity sour.

151
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,140
[laughter]

152
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,140
Smoothie beer.

153
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:58,140
How fucking far away are you from just

154
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,140
what a man should be, man?

155
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,140
You're drinking a smoothie beer

156
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:04,140
out of a Bubba Gump novelty.

157
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,140
Well, as a peak millennial,

158
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
I have immense nostalgia for

159
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Spongebob Squarepants.

160
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,140
Mmm, yeah, okay.

161
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:14,980
- Hmm, yeah, okay.

162
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,980
- So you marketed it to me with a happy pattern.

163
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,540
- You don't care what's in it at that point.

164
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,380
- Yeah.

165
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,420
- It just caught dawn on me.

166
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,760
Why is it like, it's a smoothie, it has marshmallow.

167
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,580
It doesn't, it's not a burger.

168
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,380
(laughing)

169
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,540
- Yeah, also-- - It's not a burger food?

170
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,060
- Also, before the record, if somebody told me

171
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,380
that they were drinking a smoothie

172
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,460
that had marshmallow and cake in it,

173
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,020
I would tell them that is not a smoothie at all.

174
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:40,860
- That's a milkshake.

175
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,780
- That is a milkshake.

176
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,980
You're drinking a milkshake beer.

177
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,760
- Milkshake burger beer.

178
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,300
- It's a fruity milkshake burger beer.

179
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,260
- You're a pretty bershick burger beer.

180
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,260
- What?

181
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,820
You're a pretty bershick burger beer?

182
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,320
- Have you been tying a few on

183
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,100
before we started beers we drank?

184
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:57,940
- I actually did.

185
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,980
- How's it taste?

186
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,320
- Speaking of beers that we've drank,

187
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,620
I did have two Coors Lights with my barbecue lunch

188
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,460
that I had today.

189
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,100
I had some brisket and some chicken.

190
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:09,340
- Yeah, that's classic beer food.

191
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:10,420
- That is classic beer food.

192
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,700
- All right, you're up.

193
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,220
I'm taking a stand.

194
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,300
I'm drinking the good shit, as they say.

195
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,420
- Ooh, a Miller Lite.

196
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,660
- Miller Lite.

197
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,480
- Oh my God.

198
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,740
- Over the week, it's been of note

199
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:26,500
that also I didn't feel like I might pour this thing around.

200
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,460
There's absolutely no head on that.

201
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,100
- You have no head on your shit.

202
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,100
- Damn, you don't get no head.

203
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,100
- Yep.

204
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,380
- Well, what's about to--

205
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,380
- You don't get no head on your head.

206
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:39,220
- Okay.

207
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,140
- You don't even have a head.

208
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,180
- That's what I'm saying.

209
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,180
You're just a fucking torso.

210
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,860
(laughs)

211
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,540
- You're a pair of hands in a boot.

212
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,860
- Yeah.

213
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:49,700
Sorry, continue.

214
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,060
- Tastes pretty bad.

215
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,780
I don't like them.

216
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,120
- Miller Lite tastes bad?

217
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,540
- I'm not a fan of Miller Lite.

218
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,380
I'll be honest.

219
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,420
- I like, okay, I had the Coors Lite today

220
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,340
and I could not believe how good it was.

221
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,180
It was like--

222
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,000
- Coors is good?

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
- It was cold. - Banquet beer.

224
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,340
- It was so, so good.

225
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,220
It was incredible.

226
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,300
Coors Banquet's one of my all-time favorite beers.

227
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,300
I think partly just the bottle, though.

228
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,600
Yeah, I had a I had a roommate.

229
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,900
He used to drink nothing but Miller Lite, no water.

230
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,360
Nothing else was Miller Lite.

231
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,300
He would sit on the porch with no shirt on.

232
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,960
Oh, 120 degree weather.

233
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,860
Yeah. Watch baseball from the moment he got home from work

234
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,000
till the moment he went to sleep.

235
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
So cool.

236
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Oh, Mike, to nothing but smoke Marlboro

237
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:39,940
Golds and whatever the gold packages.

238
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,600
I don't know if they're called.

239
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,900
Yeah, Marlboro lights.

240
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,940
Yeah, lights.

241
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,040
It smoke lights.

242
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,640
Drink seven Miller lights.

243
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,620
Out of one of the he any didn't he didn't have any frills.

244
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,140
There's no frills in his life.

245
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,180
Didn't have anything nice.

246
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,720
Only nice thing he had suction cup beer cozy.

247
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,960
It's like vacuum sealed that he would drink the Miller light out of

248
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,540
Because otherwise, from a Brookstone in the scene on TV section.

249
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,140
Exactly. That's so amazing.

250
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,540
And I would go, Aren't you dehydrated?

251
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,240
Don't you need to drink water at some point?

252
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,180
And he go, Well, the the beers have dogs.

253
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,280
Is it here? It's got water in it, man.

254
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,280
He's completely right. Yeah.

255
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,280
Yeah. This.

256
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,220
I miss him. He was 44 and he had 60 years.

257
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,660
Wow. That's actually

258
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:31,120
that's pretty good, man.

259
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,220
That's more than more than one a decade.

260
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,320
Assuming you had one before he was 10.

261
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,660
Mm hmm. Yeah, he was tying him on.

262
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,560
You know, that's that's your new favorite thing to say.

263
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
I've said it twice. You're right.

264
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:50,000
Yeah, I do that, too, where I say I will have one phrase

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,800
that I say for an entire night and then I get home from whatever.

266
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,120
And I'm like, I can't believe that I said

267
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,920
I said, you got to hand it to him 10 times tonight.

268
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
(laughing)

269
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,520
And somebody at some point definitely noticed that I

270
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,360
- Oh, they always notice. - I think I said it

271
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,280
to the same person five times.

272
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
Well, you gotta hand it to 'em.

273
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,520
And they went home and they're like,

274
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,600
what the fuck, does that like,

275
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,040
he's trying to make it his catchphrase?

276
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,000
- Is he trying to make for a thing?

277
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,720
What's wrong with him?

278
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,880
Do we need to check him into the nursing home?

279
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,360
- I think it happens a lot. - I do need to go

280
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,200
to the nursing home.

281
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,200
- That happens a lot with our group

282
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,640
because someone will just start saying something stupid

283
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:27,240
and the rest of us will just parrot it for like weeks

284
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,880
until someone says something stupider.

285
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
Definitely, yeah.

286
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:35,720
It's, I have a problem with,

287
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm too good at assimilating with the people that I'm with.

288
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,720
I'm too good at being in a group of friends.

289
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,800
You're too good at being a friend.

290
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm just too good of a friend.

291
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,600
Last night, last night Juvia says,

292
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,680
"Yeah, we can't do this."

293
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,280
Brex steaming mad, so angry.

294
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,120
He has never gotten worse news.

295
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,080
Caleb, so understanding.

296
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,480
I'm texting Julio, I'm saying,

297
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,400
man, don't even worry about it, bro.

298
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,280
It's not a big deal at all.

299
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,600
Don't worry.

300
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,920
Shit happens.

301
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:10,560
You know, meanwhile, if I did this to Julio, he would, he would be, he'd make,

302
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,280
he'd send me a picture of his grumpy face.

303
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,160
I would never do such a thing.

304
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,520
You would, you would, he would be mega grumpy.

305
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,760
I have a picture of the car accident.

306
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,480
Look, everyone's people are outside the cars.

307
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,760
They completely blocked up the road.

308
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,240
Who took the photo?

309
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
Um, God.

310
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,040
So you're telling me they were on the road driving,

311
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,440
they got 40 feet from the car accident and then they were already in the line

312
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,240
and they decided, you know what? No, we're going to go to Julio's house.

313
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,140
Let's turn around and drive.

314
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,240
That's a picture of someone else's photo.

315
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,040
My family wouldn't do that to me.

316
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,540
I don't think they did it to you.

317
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,640
They did it to you.

318
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,140
Kind of.

319
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,740
Yeah, you got it.

320
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,640
It was upon.

321
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,640
Did you at least did they at least bring like food and drinks and you got

322
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,640
fucked up.

323
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,040
So what what the deal was,

324
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
I was telling Rex about this.

325
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,080
My day was like seemingly

326
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,320
going to be like so awkward

327
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,280
yesterday, but it like

328
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,300
slowly started like taking

329
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,400
shape. And I was really happy

330
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,520
about like, oh, I'm going to

331
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,840
stream in early on that I want

332
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,160
to record. And then we're going

333
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
to watch this game.

334
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,380
I'll just tell him to come over

335
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,360
to my apartment. We can watch

336
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
the game here.

337
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,840
They can bring some food and

338
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
some drinks or whatever.

339
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,760
And they were like, no, we're

340
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,240
not going to go to your

341
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,520
apartment. And then I'm like,

342
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
OK, I'll just record.

343
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,880
And then at 4 p.m.

344
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,000
My dad just like drops off one of my sisters here.

345
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
He's like, "Okay, she's gonna hang out here for a bit."

346
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,800
And then my mom and my other sister get here

347
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,560
and they're like, "Actually, there's so much traffic,

348
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
"we're just gonna hang here."

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,320
And they're like, "All right, yeah,

350
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,640
"we're gonna leave in like an hour."

351
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,000
And they just don't leave

352
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and they just stay here until like 11 p.m.

353
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:45,840
- Oh my God. - And they're like,

354
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:49,640
"Oh, we should go get some drinks, some snacks."

355
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,880
And I go with them to the supermarket

356
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,840
and I buy the snacks and the drinks.

357
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,640
There is nothing in this world that I hate more than family.

358
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:02,700
Family is so fucking, thank you, thank you.

359
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:05,760
Family is so awful, they're so imposing,

360
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,820
they're disgusting, they don't understand you,

361
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,160
they make you do the dishes for 18 years of your life

362
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,600
and then they expect you to call them.

363
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,000
I don't wanna talk to you.

364
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,320
I used to be scrubbing, I used to see the food

365
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,120
that you would eat and it fucking disgusted me.

366
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,960
- Yeah, I do understand sometimes the appeal

367
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,640
of moving away from the city because I just,

368
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,840
there's so much, there's things that happen

369
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,120
even after I moved out of my dad's house,

370
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,760
it's still like so annoying.

371
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,360
- I just had the conversation with my mom

372
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,880
about moving to New York and you know,

373
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,160
it's like, I moved six hours away to California.

374
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,240
- Yeah.

375
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,920
- She's not come to visit me one time.

376
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,240
-But she wants the option to be easy, right?

377
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,000
-Yes.

378
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,800
-Now it's like--

379
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,680
-She's like, oh, you're so far away.

380
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,280
When are you going to come back?

381
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,400
And I'm like, the same amount of times I come back now.

382
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,120
-Yeah.

383
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,560
-That's when you will see me.

384
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,040
-Yeah.

385
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,240
It's an easy flight, and it probably happens

386
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,480
15 times a day from JFK.

387
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,480
-Yeah.

388
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,400
I was like, trying not to be mean and being like,

389
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,320
well, whenever I feel like it.

390
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,840
-Yeah.

391
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,640
-Whenever I feel like coming home.

392
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Also, if she wants to visit, it's a nicer place to visit.

393
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:22,480
- It is.

394
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,840
- Yeah, come hang out.

395
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,400
- I hope she never visits.

396
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,000
I didn't want her to visit here.

397
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,940
- If she does, you will tell me

398
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,920
so that I can hang out with her, right?

399
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:34,600
- You would be so annoyed by my mom.

400
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,440
- I would take all of it.

401
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,840
I would just sit there and I would just smile.

402
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,760
I'd go, yeah.

403
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,720
- Your mom would rather go to New York

404
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,400
than LA for some reason.

405
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,220
Someone tells me that's--

406
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,060
- My mom's from the Bronx.

407
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:47,400
She grew up in the Bronx.

408
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,560
I would pretend to be gay to seduce her.

409
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,840
I'd be just fully--

410
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,800
- I don't think that would work.

411
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,000
- I'd go to dance classes with her.

412
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,640
I'd do Pilates with her, yoga.

413
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,880
- I will say she is dating a bald man right now.

414
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,440
- You're kidding me.

415
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,520
- I wish I wasn't.

416
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,600
- So she's single.

417
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,800
(laughing)

418
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,640
- Maybe to a different bald man.

419
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,200
Maybe if you shine some light in your head,

420
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,280
she'll get so blinded she doesn't know who you are.

421
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,020
- I'm going to blind your mom

422
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,040
as soon as she jumps off the plane.

423
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,480
I'm going to throw a lie in her eyes

424
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,740
and just instantly blind her forever.

425
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,580
- I would love that.

426
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:26,420
I would love to have my mom be trapped in the subway realm.

427
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:30,240
- We need to make your mom homeless

428
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,880
so that she can't call you.

429
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,720
We need to like ruin her life, chop her leg off,

430
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:39,640
make her one of the people who lives underground in Vegas.

431
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,480
- Yeah.

432
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,080
- Like only like pops up every once in a while

433
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,680
to like steal a computer and bring it down there.

434
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,940
I want to make her live in a costume in Times Square forever.

435
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,440
(laughter)

436
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,600
- That's a great idea.

437
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,440
Get your mom into an Elmo costume.

438
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,520
It's clear that the Elmo only has one leg.

439
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:59,180
It's like a fully wooden second leg.

440
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,280
(laughter)

441
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,400
Dude, here's what I never understood

442
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,760
about those homeless people in Vegas.

443
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,620
Why not set up a little box on the street,

444
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:11,620
a fake slot machine, and sit in it?

445
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,000
And then when people put their money in,

446
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
You just steal it.

447
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,340
- You know what they should do?

448
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,140
They should just steal a slot machine

449
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,780
and then take the money that they make

450
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,620
from the slot machine.

451
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,540
- Exactly, yeah.

452
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,700
- The slot machines only make money.

453
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:32,020
- It's the one place in the world where there is

454
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,380
more money being thrown around than anywhere else.

455
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:39,040
Or just buy yourself a vest, steal a vest,

456
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,340
and bring somebody a fuckin' gin and tonic

457
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,740
every once in a while and they might tip you 500 bucks.

458
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,660
Yeah. Have you heard about the fact that Vegas is decaying and dying and

459
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:51,140
becoming ugly and disgusting?

460
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,340
I was there maybe

461
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:57,340
six months ago and I enjoyed it.

462
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,540
It started happening five months ago.

463
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,740
They said what's happening to it.

464
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,900
They said circus circus is trash now.

465
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,220
They said the buffet.

466
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,780
That's like the worst one.

467
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,940
They say, they said that the buffet,

468
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:13,500
The buffet is completely not even the cheapest option to eat.

469
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,380
At Circus Cir-- what are you talking about?

470
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,540
The worst fucking--

471
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,820
I don't know.

472
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,980
Who said this?

473
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,820
My channels.

474
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,500
My--

475
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,340
You have a YouTube video?

476
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,340
No, the news.

477
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:24,140
The news said that.

478
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,220
The news didn't say this.

479
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,300
CNN did never--

480
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,700
The news was covering Las Vegas, and they were like,

481
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,180
there's so many homeless people.

482
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,580
There is a lot of homeless people.

483
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,020
It's stinky.

484
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:37,500
The hotels are falling piece by piece every day.

485
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,260
[INAUDIBLE] is throwing up.

486
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,160
I like what the nation.

487
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,320
You did just do a full throw up face wipe.

488
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,340
Oh, no, it's just because I drank like

489
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,260
where you like when I get a piece of carrot out of your teeth

490
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,500
while you do this, it feels like I just drank an actual smoothie.

491
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,940
It's so like thick, it sticks in my my mustache.

492
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,200
Yeah, you're going to have that civil.

493
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,940
Yeah, you know, I don't know.

494
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,240
I don't know. Yeah.

495
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,520
So do you at least I will say this is so yummy.

496
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,320
and I'm a third of the way through.

497
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:13,060
And this is probably the drunkest I've been in.

498
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,920
That's why sours are awesome.

499
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,560
Do I can't believe how fucked up I'm getting.

500
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,420
I'm I'm with it, dude.

501
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,120
We should drink.

502
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,100
We should get some mega fruity sours.

503
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,500
I'm down when you're in town.

504
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,920
We should get a gram or something.

505
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,320
Yeah, one of those fucked up places.

506
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,260
Sours.

507
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,900
No, I really like that place.

508
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,260
But speaking of, no, I had a Paloma yesterday

509
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,120
and I was thinking about him the whole time.

510
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,420
I was like, I wish I shut out, shut up, get that boy out of my head.

511
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,520
Why does Noah remind you of what is a Paloma?

512
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,620
Remind you of Noah?

513
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,820
Because he's the one that talks about Palomas all the time.

514
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:52,060
I think Chad likes the Palomas because Chad makes it or Chad had one

515
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,220
one time and now he makes them at home, but he just makes them with squirt

516
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,380
instead of grapefruit juice.

517
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,660
He just makes him a fucking squirt out of the can.

518
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:03,060
That's awesome.

519
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,120
Which I don't think they make squirt anymore, unfortunately.

520
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,560
- Maybe they do. - So what's it use?

521
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,400
Like what, Haritos?

522
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,660
- Squirt, the soda?

523
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,920
- You're just supposed to use grapefruit juice and tonic,

524
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,840
but you can use any grapefruit soda, I guess.

525
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,560
- They make Squirt?

526
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,400
You're crazy. - They still have Squirt?

527
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:18,840
I just, I mean, I don't see Squirt on the East Coast much.

528
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:22,260
Squirt and Cactus Cooler are, in my brain,

529
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,160
mostly West Coast sodas.

530
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,000
- That would make sense.

531
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,920
Cactus Cooler, definitely a West Coast.

532
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,720
- I saw Squirt recently because I went to a steakhouse

533
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,080
for my mother's-- - I saw Squirt recently.

534
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:32,920
- My, okay.

535
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,800
(laughing)

536
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,640
(laughing)

537
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,120
- Are you done making stupid jokes now?

538
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,400
We're supposed to talk about the beers

539
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:43,280
and what they taste like and the hops

540
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,800
and the percentages of them.

541
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,240
This one tastes like shit.

542
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,080
I don't like it.

543
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
- Dude, I'm telling you, this one's only 5.3%.

544
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,240
- That is so bad 'cause you know it's like 700 calories

545
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,560
for that tall boy.

546
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,860
- I know, dude.

547
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,760
- This thing is nine and a half percent,

548
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,280
which is way beyond what I would ever get normally.

549
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,400
- Yeah. - Yeah.

550
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,320
- That's really high.

551
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,360
Yeah, like I mean, this is like drinking.

552
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,720
These are a tall boy to this, like drinking two of them

553
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
of what I would normally drink, basically like I like.

554
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,620
I really enjoy light beer.

555
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,760
Light beer is so refreshing.

556
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,060
You can drink a lot of it.

557
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,460
It's not too sweet.

558
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,320
I agree with this.

559
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,160
This has a bunch of berries in it.

560
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,120
Yeah, it's very sleek.

561
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,960
I really need to start getting into it.

562
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,820
Do you guys think that maybe once a month

563
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,220
we could do kind of a casual Friday style episode

564
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:36,440
where we get stuff that is like not beer.

565
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,800
And I know we've done non-beer before,

566
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,860
but I mean like alcoholic drinks,

567
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,200
maybe from a different country.

568
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,840
Maybe we get sake.

569
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,540
- Okay.

570
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,120
- What if we all got the same kind of,

571
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,140
what if we all got sake?

572
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,020
- Okay.

573
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:50,860
- Wouldn't that be amazing?

574
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,340
- That sounds like an amazing idea.

575
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,780
- Or what's another,

576
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:58,520
there's gotta be some kind of melon wine.

577
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:01,600
- I mean, I guess we could do like soju.

578
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,480
- I'm not a genius.

579
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,420
Soju gives me a headache.

580
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,660
Soju is too much.

581
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,760
- I drink melon wine, it's gonna give you a headache.

582
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,080
- Well, maybe melon wine doesn't even fucking exist, asshole.

583
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,920
I just made it up and I'm hoping it exists.

584
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,760
- I mean, it's got sugar.

585
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,360
You could probably bake it into some sort of.

586
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,000
- But it probably tastes like shit.

587
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
- Soju is fucked up.

588
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,760
I think that one time I went to like this soju place

589
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,400
and I had one thing of soju

590
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,040
And it I felt so drunk and I was like, OK, I need I need to drive.

591
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,240
Yeah. So I used to drink a lot of sake.

592
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,000
You should drink a lot of sake.

593
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,640
Do you drink it hot or cold?

594
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,080
Well, I do both on its own hot.

595
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,080
I would do. Here's the thing.

596
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,380
I used to you know how you drink like a hot toddy when you're like not feeling well?

597
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:50,540
Yes. Well, I don't do that.

598
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:54,340
That's disgusting. But yeah, I would do that whenever I got a cold.

599
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,340
I would basically like do sake bombs.

600
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,740
And I would I honestly worked every time.

601
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,680
I've heard you say that before that you thought of sake bombs as medicine.

602
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:07,480
Yeah. That is so crazy.

603
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:09,080
That is good work.

604
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,580
The only person I know who who I've ever known who drank soju

605
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,140
a lot was John from Philly.

606
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:19,540
And he really he would like show up to parties and stuff with like

607
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:22,340
six bottles of soju.

608
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,840
And I thought it was like not.

609
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,980
Yeah, it's super cheap.

610
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:30,060
and I thought it was like, I basically thought it was one of them was like a beer,

611
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,580
but they're like this big. And if you, if you split it with somebody,

612
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,780
you get fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. They're like diabolical.

613
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,900
Yeah. Cause they're really sweet. It's deceptive.

614
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,140
And then it will give you the worst hangover you've ever had in your life.

615
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,180
Cause it's like, yeah,

616
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:51,100
I found out that a margarita bar is opening near me.

617
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,540
Yeah. I think I told you that.

618
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,340
I think so.

619
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,340
A margarita bar.

620
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,340
I'm very, very excited.

621
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,340
Yeah.

622
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,340
I've only ever had margaritas at Chili's.

623
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,340
I've only ever had two margaritas.

624
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,340
You live in fucking Mexico?

625
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,340
You've only had margaritas once?

626
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Twice.

627
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
They're not from the margarita region of Mexico.

628
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:06,340
Yeah.

629
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
Okay.

630
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,340
That's not funny.

631
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,340
Stupid.

632
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
That's a stupid joke.

633
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,340
That is kind of funny.

634
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
We've talked about that before.

635
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:13,340
We've talked about this before, but that's not a stupid joke.

636
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,340
That's not funny.

637
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,340
What's the regional food and drink where you live?

638
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,340
I don't know.

639
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,340
I don't know.

640
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:18,340
I don't know.

641
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
I don't know.

642
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,340
I don't know.

643
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,340
I don't know.

644
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,340
I don't know.

645
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,340
I'm not sure.

646
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,340
I'm not sure.

647
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:25,340
I'm not sure.

648
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,340
I'm not sure.

649
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,340
I'm not sure.

650
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,340
I'm not sure.

651
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
I'm not sure.

652
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,340
I'm not sure.

653
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,340
I'm not sure.

654
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,340
I'm not sure.

655
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,340
I'm not sure.

656
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,340
I'm not sure.

657
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,340
I'm not sure.

658
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,340
I'm not sure.

659
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,340
I'm not sure.

660
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,340
I'm not sure.

661
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
I'm not sure.

662
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,340
I'm not sure.

663
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,340
I'm not sure.

664
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,340
I'm not sure.

665
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,340
I'm not sure.

666
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm not sure.

667
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
I'm not sure.

668
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,340
I'm not sure.

669
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,340
I'm not sure.

670
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,340
I'm not sure.

671
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
I'm not sure.

672
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,340
I'm not sure.

673
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
I'm not sure.

674
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,420
- Sour beer.

675
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,740
It's good for, if you have a cigarette, it's good.

676
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,580
- Yeah.

677
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,900
- Also, it's really funny,

678
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,340
living in a city where the number one industry

679
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,060
or the biggest industry is a brewery,

680
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:08,500
they would just take us on school trips,

681
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,420
just to look at the brewery,

682
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,900
just look at the process of them making the beer.

683
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,860
- That's actually awesome.

684
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,620
- This is it, yeah.

685
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,500
It was fun.

686
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,300
- I used to go on the most insane field trips,

687
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,660
'cause I went to a charter school.

688
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,420
And when I was a kid, I thought that was just a public school.

689
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:28,420
But a charter school is basically people with no,

690
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:31,160
like, they have no accreditation,

691
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:34,020
they have no degrees in teaching or anything,

692
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,540
and they just say, "Well, we want to like, steal money,

693
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:39,700
"so we'll start a charter school."

694
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,900
And so the field trips,

695
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,020
they would just get authorized no matter what.

696
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,140
And we did one field trip where we went,

697
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,820
we literally went to one of those places

698
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,740
where they have the like those bungee things

699
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,180
that they have at like Six Flags,

700
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,580
where you sit in a thing and then it shoots you way up.

701
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,140
That was the entire field trip,

702
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:00,880
was just putting 12 year olds into the bungee thing

703
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,660
and then just everybody's so scared launching them up.

704
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,700
- Was it supposed to be educational or something?

705
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,940
Like what were you learning about?

706
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,940
- So the first one we did that year

707
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,740
was we went to the dentist

708
00:25:11,740 --> 00:25:13,260
and the dentist talked to us about,

709
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:18,060
yeah, this is how being a dentist works or whatever.

710
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,900
- Oh, we do have a dentist school.

711
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,860
- And then we did a couple other ones.

712
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,700
We went to the library once.

713
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,380
And then the last two that we did were like,

714
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,820
we just went to the movies.

715
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,060
And then by that fourth one,

716
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:29,460
it was like the teacher just wanted to go to this thing.

717
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,020
So they, she just like,

718
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,300
the school will fucking pay for it

719
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,000
if I bring all these kids.

720
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,620
And it was very fun.

721
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,780
- It's pretty sick. - Was it like a fair

722
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,620
or some shit?

723
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,300
- No, no, it was like a ropes course.

724
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,660
It was like a long drive away

725
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:45,260
and it was like a ropes course that we didn't do at all,

726
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,140
and then a giant bungee slingshot.

727
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:48,980
- Okay.

728
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:53,980
- And a couple of kids got so scared, like crying scared.

729
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,180
- Did you get on it?

730
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,820
He didn't get on it, he was so scared.

731
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,660
He was so scared to get on it.

732
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,020
- Well, but I didn't scream because I didn't get on it.

733
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,460
But I did go, 'cause my mom was a chaperone.

734
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,180
- You were crying on the silence,

735
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:11,280
just looking at all the brave kids do it.

736
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,060
OK, first of all, Hunter was not brave.

737
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:19,800
OK, he was the biggest screamer of anybody in the whole class,

738
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,000
and he would scream at anything.

739
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,100
Cool name, cooler than yours.

740
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:25,800
Well, what if I told you his dad owned a clothing store?

741
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,760
That's pretty cool.

742
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,300
What kind of clothes?

743
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
Like high end women's clothes.

744
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,600
That's pretty cool.

745
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,760
What if I told you he started surfing when he was six?

746
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,440
Now, you still let me guess.

747
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,740
You think that's cool, too?

748
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:41,040
I think that's cool, yeah.

749
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,480
Can you set up a camera in the women's changing room?

750
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,800
He never did that.

751
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,080
That's a 13 year old son of a high end woman's clothing store owner thing.

752
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:51,800
Well, maybe he did.

753
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,240
I kind of lost touch with him.

754
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:59,240
I think he kind of I think he was went past my social and economic

755
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,280
level pretty quickly out of middle school

756
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,600
to the point where I just never saw him again.

757
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,160
Yeah, but I hope it's like to hear about people you went to school with recently.

758
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:17,640
But this weekend I found out that one of the guys I went to high school with, one of those

759
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:25,680
people that you remember being just a moron that very little people liked, he's just on

760
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:31,400
Instagram doing the car influencer thing where he's just taking pictures of someone else's

761
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:37,640
cars and I caught these weird glam shots and I was like, "Dude, what?

762
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,400
How do you become this?"

763
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:44,040
And he still just looks like a completely ugly guy.

764
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,600
Wait, his issue is that he was ugly?

765
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:49,120
Yeah, he's a weird looking guy.

766
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
I'm not going to show you a picture of him.

767
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,600
That would fly in the show.

768
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:55,440
He won't listen to us, it's in English.

769
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,120
Yeah, but I don't want people to know his name or his face.

770
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,520
Or what high school you went to,

771
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,040
because they would find that shit out.

772
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,680
They would find out.

773
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,880
Yeah, I feel like I went to,

774
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,720
I think I've talked to somebody about this before,

775
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,720
I feel like I went to a, I lived in a town where most people

776
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,360
have or will die very tragic deaths.

777
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,320
Where nobody dies of old age, everybody dies

778
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:24,080
in drunk driving, drugs, boating accidents, suicide,

779
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,840
some the most insane cancer branch you've ever heard of.

780
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,100
Nobody dies. - That's pretty cool though.

781
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,880
- Well, it would be if I wasn't from there.

782
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,820
Yes I do.

783
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,180
Do you think I want to die?

784
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,000
Dude, no.

785
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,860
The other day I thought I was at the gym

786
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,260
and I had like, what I think was just like my GERD acting up,

787
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:48,200
my like esophagus spasming.

788
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,940
But I thought that it was like a massive heart palpitation

789
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,480
and it lasts for like three minutes after a deadlift.

790
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,460
And I completely was convinced I was going to die.

791
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,020
And I was thinking, I was like,

792
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:03,020
not only am I going to die at a gym with my gym buddy,

793
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,960
but also my last thought will be,

794
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,800
"Oh my God, I just died at a gym."

795
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,160
(laughing)

796
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,320
It will not be like, I realized in that moment,

797
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,720
I was like, if you die somewhere like that,

798
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,120
your last thought will never be,

799
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:21,240
"I lived a great life, I love my family."

800
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,080
If you die in like a panicked, awful situation,

801
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,440
your last thought will be like,

802
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,400
"Oh, fuck, I fucked up so bad, I'm such an idiot."

803
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,280
- No, your last thought, everyone's last thought

804
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:36,560
is remembering where something they lost 30 years ago is.

805
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,080
(laughing)

806
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,360
- Oh my God, if I remembered exactly

807
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,100
where my Nintendo DS was, my blue Nintendo DS,

808
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:46,840
I thought I left it in a taxi cab.

809
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:50,040
- You'll be 90 years old on your deathbed,

810
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,240
and you'll go, "Oh my God, the Nintendo DS is in my room,

811
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,840
"it's under the bed!"

812
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,680
- Yep.

813
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:58,120
- And just die right there, unable to act on it.

814
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,720
- That's what's going to kill me,

815
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,200
Is it one day I'm going to remember something so hard

816
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,540
that it will instantly kill me?

817
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,800
Die of stroke.

818
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,360
- Yeah.

819
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,040
My heart fucks up all the time.

820
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,240
Feels weird almost every day.

821
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:14,640
- But this was like three full minutes of like--

822
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,220
- Yeah, it's like 30 minutes for me, man.

823
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,060
It's fine.

824
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,040
You'll get over it. - Really?

825
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,600
You need to go to the hospital.

826
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,960
- Yeah, I stopped.

827
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,440
I was like, okay, I'm leaving the gym.

828
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,280
I need to go to the hospital.

829
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,400
And then I got in the car.

830
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,480
- You're just not 27 yet.

831
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,200
- That's your only problem.

832
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,040
You just need to get two years older.

833
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,080
- We were on stream with Patrick,

834
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,360
and they were like, "So, we're talking about this shit."

835
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,600
Patrick was like, "Yeah, well, next year,

836
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,600
"I'm gonna lose my health insurance,

837
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,740
"so right now I'm eating shit,

838
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,960
"drinking energy drinks every year."

839
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,800
- That's wrong.

840
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,680
- And as soon as I switch over to 26,

841
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:51,160
I'm going vegan, I'm gonna be healthy,

842
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
I'm stopping all this shit,

843
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,320
because I need to stop at that point.

844
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,680
And I was like, "Why don't you just stop now?"

845
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,960
And was just sitting there like, yeah, you should do that.

846
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,240
That's a good idea to do that.

847
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,480
Yeah, I lost my health insurance.

848
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,840
I only had it for one year.

849
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:10,480
I didn't have health insurance for like five years.

850
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,560
And then my mom got a job that gave her health insurance

851
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,360
when I was 24.

852
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,000
And so I had one year of health insurance.

853
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,280
I got checked up one time, never followed up.

854
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,960
Picked up my blood work.

855
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,880
Eight months later, found out I had hepatitis A

856
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,180
for the like a long time.

857
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,720
And then, um, yeah, I haven't been to the doctor since.

858
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,580
I did one online doctor consultation and then they and I thought

859
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,720
that it was covered by my insurance.

860
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,560
Turns out it wasn't.

861
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:44,960
They've been sending me a bill for $400 every fucking day

862
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,720
and just be like, Hey, remember, you got to pay this bill.

863
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,960
And so now I'm like, OK, never going again.

864
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,620
I tried it.

865
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,780
Didn't like it.

866
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,660
Not the doctors.

867
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,260
It's not for me, man.

868
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Not for me.

869
00:31:57,260 --> 00:32:00,060
Listen, yeah, it's

870
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,860
mind over matter.

871
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,180
Exactly.

872
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,240
If you tell yourself you're fine,

873
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,100
you are fine.

874
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,060
A lot of these people who die of

875
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,480
strokes, heart attacks, cancer.

876
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,740
It's because they're having anxiety.

877
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,580
And they're just they're just not,

878
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,860
let's be real.

879
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,860
When was the last time you heard of

880
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,160
someone dying with cancer who was

881
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,660
like really smart?

882
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,660
Pretty much never.

883
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,860
Steve Jobs.

884
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,440
That's about the last time 20 years ago.

885
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,980
Steve Jobs. Yeah, exactly.

886
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,820
So it's a it's like a it's like Haley's Comet.

887
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,980
Like it just comes around every once in a while.

888
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,280
Somebody who's really smart dies of cancer.

889
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:38,320
Steve Jobs also had that thing where basically was just like proto-Rex,

890
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,080
where he was just like, I'll just drink energy drinks and I'll be

891
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,860
it'll cure my cancer.

892
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,860
Well, he did like he did Dr. Stevies shit.

893
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,780
He only ate fruit for the last couple of years of his life,

894
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,200
and it made his cancer a lot worse than pancreatic cancer.

895
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,640
So now he's drinking he's eating 500 grams of sugar every single day. Yeah

896
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,600
Trying to get that through a tumor is not a great idea

897
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:04,760
And he lived a very fulfilling life

898
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:11,760
That's the other thing he if somebody who's a brilliant guy does dive cancer is like who gives a shit

899
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:18,280
He had an amazing life. He squeezed five lives into that. What is this last thought was do you think?

900
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,080
Well, his last words were I should have invented the iPhone

901
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:26,080
- I should have went to the iPhone 14.

902
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,880
- I should have started with the iPhone 14.

903
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,680
That was his last words.

904
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,180
- The iPhone needs more cameras.

905
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,480
- They went, okay.

906
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,080
- Wait, AirPods.

907
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:36,880
And then he just died.

908
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,480
- It takes him years and years to even understand what the fuck that means.

909
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,980
- No, I believe his last words were--

910
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,480
- Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

911
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,220
(laughter)

912
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,720
Ow, my cancer, ow!

913
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,320
(laughter)

914
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,660
Ow, ow, ow.

915
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,960
- I know, we can move on.

916
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,000
His last words were, "Oh my God, oh my God,

917
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,300
"it's so beautiful," according to his sister.

918
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,140
- Really?

919
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:06,960
- Yeah.

920
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,080
- That's such a lie.

921
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,540
- It's 100% a lie.

922
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,580
Definitely his last words were like,

923
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,120
he looked at her and he was like, "You're hot,"

924
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,920
'cause he's so high on drugs.

925
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,000
He's like, to his sister, he's like, "I wanna fuck you,"

926
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,000
and he farted so loud, like four full minutes,

927
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,500
his last, just like a death rattle fart,

928
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,380
and then he finally passed on.

929
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,440
- Yeah, people don't know that when you're on your deathbed

930
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,600
you turn into Peter Griffin.

931
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,180
- Yeah, I mean, pretty much.

932
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:35,280
I mean, I know somebody who had a medical emergency,

933
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,180
they were on all sorts of drugs,

934
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,960
and they tried to grab a family member's boob.

935
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,600
- Wow. - Yeah.

936
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,520
- Indeed I.

937
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:51,400
- My grandpa had dementia and he would just hit on my mom

938
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,160
and we would go and visit.

939
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,080
- Damn.

940
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,080
That's honestly, that's the big fear of dementia, right?

941
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:58,920
- Yeah.

942
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:02,360
- Is that your daughter walks in one day and you're like,

943
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,320
what the fuck is up?

944
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,940
What's up, sweetie pie?

945
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,780
- Literally, that's exactly--

946
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,720
- She goes in for a hug, you start fucking--

947
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,640
- Just grinding.

948
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,600
- Yeah, you think it's your wife.

949
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:15,960
Yeah, you grab her ass and stuff, that's bad.

950
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:16,780
- That is bad.

951
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:20,940
- Because in that shows, he always thought this, man.

952
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:24,620
He always thought his daughter was hot.

953
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:25,940
- Yep.

954
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,080
- How sad is that?

955
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:27,920
- And it's so sad.

956
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,760
- It's what it shows.

957
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,060
- It's what it shows.

958
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,120
- That's what it shows.

959
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,820
- That's what it shows.

960
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,660
- Okay, I agree with you.

961
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,540
I think you're a medical expert.

962
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,780
- Listen, I'm not a medical expert, but I'm a sexpert.

963
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,540
I'm a sex expert in every way.

964
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,820
- Your daughter is medically hot.

965
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,740
- That would, I hope to God that I have the ugliest kids ever

966
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:50,060
that nobody ever wants to be involved with at all.

967
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,340
And then maybe one day, because they're so good at chess,

968
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,540
somebody finally says, I mean, you know what?

969
00:35:56,540 --> 00:36:00,540
You look like a fucking frog, but I guess I'll marry you.

970
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,500
Because the idea of my children having sex

971
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,260
and me having to see that happen,

972
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,020
that would kill me. - You have to see it happen?

973
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,200
Why do you have to see it happen?

974
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,660
- Because of all the cameras you put up in their bedroom.

975
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,620
- Well, but also I just have a wild imagination, you know?

976
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:18,540
So regardless of if I see it, I'm going to see it in my head,

977
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:20,220
my mind's eye.

978
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:22,260
- Are you already seeing it?

979
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,180
- Yeah, and I don't even know what my kids' names are

980
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,760
right now, you know?

981
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,660
- Would you, is it a fear of yours that when your children

982
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,420
are born, they're taller than you by the age of 12?

983
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,900
- I would be so happy for them, but yes.

984
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:41,620
- I've pretty much, because of the genes,

985
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:44,500
Because of the woman I've decided to mate with,

986
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,540
I've pretty much guaranteed that will happen.

987
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:53,700
All of her brothers are like 6'2" and like insanely athletic.

988
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,540
Everyone in my family is completely fat.

989
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,820
Like everybody looks like a mountain.

990
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,740
Yeah.

991
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,940
So I'm really, really hoping that we get a tall,

992
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:08,220
athletically ripped bunch of kids.

993
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:11,420
I think if you're like Caleb and I, where you're like a genius,

994
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:14,860
but you know, maybe five foot eight, five foot nine,

995
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:18,980
not very athletic, but you know, we've got,

996
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,420
we've got our own stuff going on. You got a woman that has

997
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:26,380
in life. I think it would be if Caleb got a,

998
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,580
got a white NBA player son.

999
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:32,100
Oh, that'd be so funny.

1000
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,540
I would be wearing Steve Harvey suits.

1001
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:37,620
Oh my God. That is

1002
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,820
You are kidding?

1003
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,580
That just gave me chills.

1004
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:47,320
That is like my fucking dream, dude.

1005
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,660
That is my dream.

1006
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,580
If my kid is not an NBA player,

1007
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,420
I fucked something up so bad, man.

1008
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,260
That is a meal ticket for the rest of your life.

1009
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,120
- From the moment they can hold a basketball,

1010
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,100
they're out there shooting free throws.

1011
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:00,500
- Absolutely, man.

1012
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,340
- Their technical game is flawless.

1013
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:04,980
- And by the way, they're getting,

1014
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,260
they're not, I'm not going easy on them.

1015
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,740
I'm calling fouls.

1016
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:09,140
We're in the middle, I'm gonna call fouls

1017
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,940
when they're playing against like, like our dog,

1018
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,860
like doing that thing where you dribble the ball.

1019
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,480
I'm going to be like, no, you traveled.

1020
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,220
Like I will be such a fucking stickler.

1021
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,860
Just walking around with a whistle 24/7.

1022
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:24,540
Dude, that is so good.

1023
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,200
Oh, my God.

1024
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,280
What a beautiful dream.

1025
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,540
They give me such an insane rush of dopamine

1026
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,160
thinking about my child being in the NBA, playing for the Hornets.

1027
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,040
I get to move back to North Carolina.

1028
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,800
I've had like the lowest level of success

1029
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:41,680
as a comedian that you can possibly have, like I just stay at this level forever.

1030
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,280
And then I get to be bailed out instead of having to actually

1031
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,480
chase the actual thing.

1032
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,260
I get to be bailed out by an NBA player son and be rich.

1033
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,080
Yeah, that is so awesome. Yeah.

1034
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,220
I've been thinking about, you know, what's the the worst fear?

1035
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,680
You know, what's the worst thing your son could be?

1036
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,780
And the answer to me is just kind of stupid.

1037
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,900
If I had a son that was just kind of stupid, I'd be so pissed.

1038
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:13,300
I would say worse is probably mass shooter or serial killer.

1039
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,640
Yeah, I'd rather have a genius son.

1040
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,600
That's both of those rapists.

1041
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,800
Yeah, rapist.

1042
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,400
I would rape him out.

1043
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,340
I will bail him out every time.

1044
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,280
Suicidal maniac.

1045
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,640
Yeah, and totally fine.

1046
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,120
But if he's like just a little slow.

1047
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,620
He's on his own.

1048
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,780
Like, yeah, I get it.

1049
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:35,120
Like slow in a way where, you know, it wasn't your fault.

1050
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,880
Yeah, like you were like, I did everything right.

1051
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,420
Taught him everything at the right time.

1052
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,280
He just never really got there.

1053
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,520
I'd be very pissed.

1054
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,420
I mean, yeah, I guess that.

1055
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:49,760
What's the one thing that I would not love him? Yeah.

1056
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,720
How can you?

1057
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,220
How the fuck can you?

1058
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:57,580
What's the one thing that you would

1059
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:02,160
you would try to like imprint on them like those like Reddit parents are like,

1060
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,120
Oh, I'm going to get I'm going to make my my my kid play Super Mario.

1061
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:08,920
imprint on him, his last name on the back of his head,

1062
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:13,920
with a brand, an ice brand on the back of his head.

1063
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:20,520
I'm gonna get a baby-sized heavy bag and have him execute 200 perfect punches a day.

1064
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:26,120
Yeah, I honestly will have to think about when he's born,

1065
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:31,920
project 20 years in the future, and say what will make,

1066
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,120
what it will be the thing that makes the most money in the world in 20 years.

1067
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,400
And I'll just start training for that.

1068
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,160
Yeah. OK, if it's a girl, you know,

1069
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,360
can replace surgery every day.

1070
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:46,140
I'll pretty much just check out, honestly, if it's a girl. OK.

1071
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,440
You know, can't do my

1072
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,500
brother in law.

1073
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,840
Just it's such a dude. It's so funny.

1074
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:58,540
He just his wife is pregnant, and he just did like a gender

1075
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:02,620
reveal party with a golf ball and he's really into golf.

1076
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:07,700
He's a great guy. He, he, in the video, he, uh,

1077
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:12,020
it's like his whole family around and he's like, Oh,

1078
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,900
I'm nervous. Right. He goes to swing. The golf club comes down,

1079
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,700
hits a golf ball, blue smoke goes everywhere.

1080
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:21,220
And the second that he sees the blue smoke, he goes,

1081
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,860
to have a boy.

1082
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,040
And it was so clear that he was like,

1083
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,780
if I ever grow up, I will kill myself.

1084
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:36,880
It's so funny, dude.

1085
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,040
I was like, yeah, man, I get it.

1086
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,420
That's what I would do, too.

1087
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:42,220
Yeah, that's I don't I think

1088
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,220
we should stop doing those

1089
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,380
because exactly those other people.

1090
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,480
Yeah, that's what a high who

1091
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,260
what what they actually want.

1092
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,060
But then it happens

1093
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,860
and they're just like so, so happy,

1094
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,360
so excited that it's actually

1095
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,140
a little bit strange.

1096
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,140
It was so awesome.

1097
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,440
I was like, dude, you really, really wanted a boy, didn't you?

1098
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:03,720
He's like, Oh, man, you know, I was just yeah, I was just excited either way.

1099
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:07,820
Just realize that you should not have reacted.

1100
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,960
Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,760
I mean, it was clearly such a like primate reaction.

1102
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:15,660
He had of just like, yeah, just a relief.

1103
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,900
Yeah. And like his his brothers and his dad are both in the background,

1104
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:23,140
like, yes, yes. Fist bumping, high fiving.

1105
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:28,200
I think my issue is if I had a daughter, she would be like diabolical.

1106
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,400
She'd be getting into so much trouble.

1107
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,040
She'd be just...

1108
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,380
If you had a daughter, you would breed a racist to her daughter.

1109
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,280
Yeah, I would.

1110
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,140
Yeah.

1111
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:43,480
And if you had a boy, he would just refer to you as his weird dad

1112
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,120
and he would never...

1113
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,520
I'm just afraid of how...

1114
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:48,820
I was actually thinking about how my kids will perceive me earlier today,

1115
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:52,120
because I don't think anybody goes their entire life being like,

1116
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,080
Man, my dad is so cool.

1117
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,300
People either think their parents are cool

1118
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,800
or they think that their parents love them.

1119
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,840
It's never both.

1120
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:03,520
It's they think their parents are cool because they have the mystery,

1121
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,180
because they don't know them very well, or they think their parents

1122
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,560
are like the biggest losers in the world, but they care about them a lot.

1123
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,720
So there's no way that you can have both.

1124
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,320
Like you will just turn into the basically the biggest loser ever

1125
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,520
or be a really cool but bad dad.

1126
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:21,340
Yeah, I would definitely rather be the latter.

1127
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,760
They don't need me.

1128
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,120
They don't. I gave them everything they got nine months before they were born.

1129
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,860
They have what fucking they have literally

1130
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:34,660
a thousand hours of audio of me speaking if they want to learn something from me.

1131
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,020
And it would be probably a lot more about the time.

1132
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,860
I don't need to.

1133
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,960
I mean, I'm going to fucking I'm not going to do shit.

1134
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,260
I'm going to shut down.

1135
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,320
I'm with you, man.

1136
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,960
Yeah. Make a version of my voice.

1137
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,220
I'm going to school.

1138
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,220
I'm their teacher every year.

1139
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,260
Yeah. Yeah.

1140
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:54,320
Age progressed.

1141
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,420
I'm the same age as them.

1142
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:57,560
But I don't do anything the rest of the time.

1143
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,900
You're the same age as them?

1144
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,160
They're learning from three year old me.

1145
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,400
Oh, OK.

1146
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,660
Yes. Here's a great idea.

1147
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,100
You can you you program in AI talks.

1148
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,360
It looks exactly like you.

1149
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,700
You leave the country, you start going to China.

1150
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,060
You're impregnating more women, spreading your seed.

1151
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:14,220
You know how it is.

1152
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:17,100
You're trying all sorts of different Michelin star restaurants.

1153
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:20,220
But then everybody tells your kid,

1154
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:23,180
by the way, you see that box over there, that computer,

1155
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:24,980
your dad is in that computer.

1156
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,260
And when you turn 18, he'll come out of the computer.

1157
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,900
On his 18th birthday.

1158
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,900
Yeah, he'll become real.

1159
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,580
We'll download him.

1160
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:37,140
On his 18th birthday, front door, knock at the front door.

1161
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,780
Well, yeah, you don't show up.

1162
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,860
A letter that says, sorry, I did not want to come.

1163
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:47,400
Oh, you much fun.

1164
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:50,500
They open the front door fog machine behind you.

1165
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:52,660
You walk out in like a silver jumpsuit.

1166
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:56,560
Oh, and really long flowing black.

1167
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,300
Yes. Yes. And then at that point, you don't have any legal reason.

1168
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,060
You get to kind of play it by ear.

1169
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,660
Do I like this kid? Do I think he's whack?

1170
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,360
Yeah. If it's whack, it's like, you know, you're 18.

1171
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,220
I'll fucking peace out.

1172
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:13,720
But if it's cool, you get to enjoy like having a kid finally. Yeah.

1173
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:17,780
- I was thinking how dope it would be.

1174
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,900
- I think I would like to raise a kid at like age 12.

1175
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:23,780
That's, and for just that one year.

1176
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,700
I could do a lot of impact there.

1177
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,540
- You being 12? - The rest of that,

1178
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,140
mom will take care of it.

1179
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,140
- Oh.

1180
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:31,600
- It should definitely be asymmetrical.

1181
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:32,700
- Yeah.

1182
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:35,460
- Can you imagine if somebody was raised by their mom

1183
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:39,360
for 12 years and then had one year with their dad?

1184
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:41,620
That would honestly be the same level of impact.

1185
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,180
- It would, it would.

1186
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,020
- You don't remember. - It would be the

1187
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,020
Highlights of their life.

1188
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:46,020
What's a dad going to do for you?

1189
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:47,020
From 8, from 0 to 12.

1190
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,020
When you're a fucking 9.

1191
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,020
Nothing, nothing.

1192
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,020
Yeah.

1193
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,020
You're useless.

1194
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,020
Not a damn thing.

1195
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,020
You sit around and you bring home bacon.

1196
00:45:54,020 --> 00:45:55,020
Yeah.

1197
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,020
Right?

1198
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:57,020
Age 12, golf course.

1199
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,020
Yep.

1200
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,020
Age 12, boxing gym.

1201
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,020
Age 12, Tijuana.

1202
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:05,020
I'm looking at your homework and saying I used to know how to do that.

1203
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:08,020
I loved that, man.

1204
00:46:08,020 --> 00:46:09,520
I loved that, man.

1205
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,220
And you know, my mom, when I was a kid, my mom was like,

1206
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,420
"You know, your dad is like a math genius,

1207
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,920
like really, really talented at math."

1208
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:18,620
And then I would bring home Long Division,

1209
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,120
and be like, "You know what, son? I'm stumped.

1210
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,120
I just don't—you're gonna have to ask your younger brother about this one."

1211
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:27,620
That's just so cool, man.

1212
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:30,220
I can't wait to be so useless.

1213
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,620
Well, you can just slide in them.

1214
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,320
They will just believe anything.

1215
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,520
It's a thing.

1216
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:35,920
It's true.

1217
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:38,680
- Because like, Photoshop yourself being the CEO of Apple,

1218
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:41,240
and they were like, "Oh my God, my dad has cancer."

1219
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,840
- I actually invented the iPhone.

1220
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:46,640
- I actually invented having cancer.

1221
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,340
Speaking of--

1222
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:50,160
- It'd be cool if you could just lie to your kids.

1223
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,080
- You definitely can. - For a decade.

1224
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,080
- My dad lied to me.

1225
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,000
I don't even know what is real about my dad's life.

1226
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,680
He's told me stories that are so fucking crazy

1227
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,400
that I'm like, and when I was a kid, I was like,

1228
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,640
"Man, my dad's had a wild ride."

1229
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,880
And then I'll be watching a movie,

1230
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:05,680
see the exact same scene happen.

1231
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:06,520
(laughing)

1232
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,600
I go, "Huh, what a coincidence,

1233
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,100
"that happened to my dad too."

1234
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:12,840
But I'm afraid to ask him,

1235
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,080
hey did your friend's head really get chopped off

1236
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:19,220
by a tunnel 'cause he stuck it out of the top of a van?

1237
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:22,200
And if it's real and he's like,

1238
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,160
"Yeah, it was actually really, really bad."

1239
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,000
Then now I'm like--

1240
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:27,080
- What movie will you pretend that is your life?

1241
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,160
I think I will go with "Ugly Jays."

1242
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,200
- "Breaking Bad."

1243
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,040
- Forrest Gump.

1244
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:32,200
- I said movie, you fucking,

1245
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,860
you go with "Breaking Bad."

1246
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:35,700
I didn't hear what you said.

1247
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:39,140
I mean, movie TV, what's the difference these days?

1248
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:41,500
I don't know, name a movie.

1249
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,340
That's too hard.

1250
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:44,180
You know that's too hard.

1251
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,340
Just name one movie.

1252
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:49,140
I would say, I would do Free Guy with my kids.

1253
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,260
It's so weird, man.

1254
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:52,940
I used to be in a video game.

1255
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,500
Oh, J. Gamer's so good.

1256
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,260
Gamer is great.

1257
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:57,820
I used to be on Death Row.

1258
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,300
Let me tell you something about--

1259
00:47:59,300 --> 00:48:00,580
you know what you just did?

1260
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:01,660
You just lied to your brother.

1261
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,240
Let me tell you something about lying.

1262
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,000
I used to be on death row and there was a rich guy,

1263
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,660
some kid who was controlling my body

1264
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:11,720
while my wife was in another game

1265
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,320
and she was getting fucked, your mom.

1266
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,160
- Yeah.

1267
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,640
- And actually that's how you were born.

1268
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,680
And I used to have a collar on my head

1269
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,360
and if I did the wrong thing it exploded.

1270
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,860
I used to have to kill all these different guys

1271
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,900
with gang tattoos.

1272
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,520
And then I earned my freedom.

1273
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,880
And I'm not really sure what the point of the story was

1274
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,480
but just know that that did happen to me.

1275
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:30,320
- Right.

1276
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,840
- I don't remember what, oh, Gamer goes.

1277
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:34,920
- I remember watching it way long ago,

1278
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,560
but I have no idea what happens in Gamer,

1279
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:38,360
except that there's nudity.

1280
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,560
- Yeah, I watch Gamer at Chad's house

1281
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:41,800
in his mom's bed with him.

1282
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,880
- Okay.

1283
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,720
- Yeah.

1284
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,440
And we were, and then she walked in and she--

1285
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,400
- Of course, at that exact moment.

1286
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,560
- It was right at the exact moment, she skipped,

1287
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,240
she was cool, she skipped past it

1288
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:57,560
and then let us watch the rest of the movie.

1289
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,440
- She put a timer, she looked online when it came up.

1290
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,480
- She had to have known, she had to have fucking known.

1291
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,600
She looked on Conservapedia to see

1292
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,960
what the entry was for Gamer.

1293
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,800
- No.

1294
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,520
I, you know, movies are hard, man.

1295
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,460
I can't, name another movie, I can't do it.

1296
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,880
Super Mario.

1297
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,160
- Madagascar.

1298
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,520
- Yeah.

1299
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,600
- Madagascar, I don't remember what movie it was,

1300
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,680
but I had some fucking movie that I would watch

1301
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,040
all the time when I was a kid on like VHS or DVD

1302
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:28,080
or something, and at the beginning of the movie

1303
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:33,040
It had a preview for Madagascar, which can you believe they used to do that?

1304
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,040
They used to put-

1305
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:35,040
I know.

1306
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:36,040
Ads for other movies.

1307
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,040
That's so insane.

1308
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:38,040
Yeah.

1309
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:43,920
They put a commercial for Madagascar, but had no video from the actual movie.

1310
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,400
It was just Ben Stiller in a big white room, and he was like, "I want to tell you guys

1311
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:51,920
a little bit about a island called Madagascar."

1312
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,920
And then he pulls out a globe, and he's like, "It's this little tiny island off of Africa."

1313
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,920
It made me so mad and I wanted to hate the movie so bad, but then it came out and I saw it

1314
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,060
And you saw it was pretty good. I want to move it move it and you're like

1315
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:14,140
I want to move it move it Sasha Baron Cohen the lemur and I was I got I loved it. I love that movie. Yeah

1316
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:19,540
I would like to change it. I saw it dropped it gorgeous the other day, which I don't know if you've seen that movie

1317
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,620
No from the like late 90s

1318
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:25,160
Will Sasso is in it

1319
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,460
Look, it's Will Sasso and he's playing a character that's literally just the retarded guy

1320
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:34,740
Love that

1321
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:38,120
So a fat guy that they called the retard

1322
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:45,240
The joke is that he's jacking off to underage girls. Oh, okay. They used to do it differently in the 90s, man

1323
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,440
They did I loved it. I look it was like such a treat seeing Will Sasso

1324
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:54,080
Do you guys ever had speaking of the 90s? I've been listening to a lot of Nirvana recently

1325
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:59,640
You know how people fantasize about winning the lottery?

1326
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:04,440
Like a lot of men will like one time a day fantasize about winning the lottery, what you would do.

1327
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,440
Yeah.

1328
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:13,440
Do you ever listen to a song and you fantasize about what if you had come up with this song instead of this band?

1329
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:14,440
Yeah.

1330
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,440
Um, no.

1331
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:22,440
I have found myself doing that a bunch recently where I was like, man, if I came up with this song, my life would be so fucking awesome.

1332
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,440
With their vinyl songs?

1333
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,840
Yeah, with different Nirvana songs I've been listening to.

1334
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:26,840
Which ones?

1335
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,840
"Come As You Are."

1336
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:35,340
I was literally at the park the other day with Phil throwing a ball and I was like,

1337
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:45,340
"I think if I had a genie, one of my three wishes, of course I would wish for world peace and hair."

1338
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,340
Yeah, more hunger.

1339
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:52,340
But with my third one, my throwaway wish, because that's what you do with a genie.

1340
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:57,340
two, you do two benevolent large scale wishes.

1341
00:51:57,340 --> 00:51:58,340
Yeah.

1342
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,620
World peace and me having hair.

1343
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:04,280
But then on the third one, you go weird and you need to do something that nobody else

1344
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,280
would do.

1345
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:08,740
Because the genie's heard it all before and he's going to fucking trash you.

1346
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,740
That's going to be the rough thing.

1347
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:12,020
Yeah, he's going to be like, not a very good choice, sir.

1348
00:52:12,020 --> 00:52:13,020
Yeah.

1349
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,020
Pretty boring.

1350
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,020
He's going to try to turn it.

1351
00:52:15,020 --> 00:52:18,140
The thing is, if you don't wish for things that affect everybody, he's going to do his

1352
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,140
little trickery.

1353
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:20,140
Yeah.

1354
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:24,460
third one I would probably delete or Nirvana song and then and then just like

1355
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:28,500
do that that Beatles movie or that movie about the guy with the Beatles yeah yeah

1356
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:32,660
and I would do that with Nirvana and people go bye see okay so that's a

1357
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:35,820
perfect example of course men have had this fantasy forever because somebody

1358
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:45,660
wrote that movie yeah yeah I got a hypothetical for you okay okay you get your hair

1359
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:52,660
back but your wife becomes bald. She can't grow hair anymore.

1360
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:57,660
That's what you take away out of this situation.

1361
00:52:57,660 --> 00:52:58,660
Okay.

1362
00:52:58,660 --> 00:52:59,660
Wait.

1363
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:04,660
You wish for world peace, everyone becomes bald. You wish for hair, you're the only one

1364
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:06,660
with hair, they kill you on the spot.

1365
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:13,660
I, I, that doesn't scare me at all. I'm not afraid to die if it means saving the entire

1366
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:20,860
But I would definitely go me have hair because she can wear wigs that's

1367
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:24,580
culturally acceptable. You can wear wigs. I can't walk around with wigs dude.

1368
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:30,900
People will... Yes you can dude. No I can't. And also I'm you know on camera talent dude I

1369
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:37,180
want to be a news anchor one day I need hair. Yeah do you have a like a news anchor

Um...

The...

1374
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:50,300
A dog just died.

1375
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
A dog got exploded by ISIS

1376
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,300
in Texas.

1377
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:56,300
Breaking news!

1378
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,300
This afternoon, a dog

1379
00:53:58,300 --> 00:54:00,300
in Texas has been blown up

1380
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:02,300
by ISIS.

1381
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:04,300
Stick with us, 6pm. We got the rest of the details.

1382
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,300
Back to Rex

1383
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:08,300
with the weather.

1384
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:10,300
That was really good, man.

1385
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:13,300
I'm very impressed. Well you need to do the weather now.

1386
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:18,300
What does a weatherman do?

1387
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:22,300
He throws this. That is the gayest hand I've ever seen.

1388
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:26,300
I have never seen somebody throw their hand up in a gayer way.

1389
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,300
Is this gay? Yes it is. You're the weatherman.

1390
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:32,300
What does a weatherman do?

1391
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,300
What does a weatherman do? What does he do?

1392
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,300
He just points behind him and he's like yep.

1393
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,700
78 degrees.

1394
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:40,660
Yo, what the fuck is up?

1395
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,780
There's about to be hella clouds in the north.

1396
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,820
The sun is gonna rise.

1397
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:46,660
The sun's gonna go down.

1398
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:48,540
I think you've also never watched the Weather Channel.

1399
00:54:48,540 --> 00:54:50,740
At least it settles in a fine location.

1400
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:51,580
Probably doing Red Hot Chili Peppers lyrics.

1401
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,300
We got some wind coming this way

1402
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:56,380
and some air coming this way.

1403
00:54:56,380 --> 00:54:58,500
You know what they do on the running videos

1404
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,100
is they accidentally draw some kind of cock and balls.

1405
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:03,700
Yeah, you know, you got the wind here

1406
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,700
and you got the fucking wind also here.

1407
00:55:05,700 --> 00:55:06,540
That's what I'm doing.

1408
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,940
Day one of being a weatherman,

1409
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:12,940
I would draw like the most photorealistic pussy you've ever seen on the thing.

1410
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:15,340
Just to get one for the girls.

1411
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:18,460
And there's also going to be a category five hurricane.

1412
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:19,300
It's going to kill.

1413
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:24,300
There's going to be a tornado right here pointing with my tongue.

1414
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:33,340
That's dope.

1415
00:55:33,340 --> 00:55:36,820
Asking the guy who runs the sport board if we have brown.

1416
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:39,080
(laughing)

1417
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:42,600
- Brackety brown with the pen.

1418
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,220
- How do you even get into that kind of job?

1419
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,440
- You know, it's very funny.

1420
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,020
There is a weatherman that I know, an ex-weatherman.

1421
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:52,860
- Okay.

1422
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:55,740
- Ross, who's in our Discord,

1423
00:55:55,740 --> 00:55:57,540
that he doesn't play any games with us,

1424
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:59,180
but he used to be a weatherman.

1425
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:00,020
- Really?

1426
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,580
- He was a weatherman for like a West Virginia,

1427
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:05,860
like small town things, like his opening gig.

1428
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,260
Everybody starts small in the weather game.

1429
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:13,260
And he made like $20,000 a year being a weatherman

1430
00:56:13,260 --> 00:56:15,620
for this crappy little news station.

1431
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,540
And then he ended up quitting

1432
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,700
'cause he was like, "This sucks dick, dude."

1433
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:21,380
- How much do you have to work if you're a weatherman?

1434
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:23,380
Is that like a 40 hour a week job?

1435
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,300
- Well, 'cause you're also a full-time meteorologist.

1436
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,540
You're just on camera a combined 40 minutes a day.

1437
00:56:30,540 --> 00:56:32,020
But the rest of the time you're trying to figure out

1438
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:32,860
what the fuck you're gonna,

1439
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:35,180
you're coming up with material for the weather thing.

1440
00:56:35,180 --> 00:56:38,020
Yeah, they're just looking at you're in a coffee shop trying to come up

1441
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:46,700
Fuck dude, I got a fucking full page of weather

1442
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:50,140
I got a forecast due by tomorrow, and I don't know what the fuck I'm doing

1443
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:56,140
I don't even have the first idea what tomorrow's gonna look like yeah, right so much coffee. You're shitting in the bathroom

1444
00:56:56,140 --> 00:57:00,180
I got it the thing is man. It's always gonna shit

1445
00:57:00,180 --> 00:57:02,940
Rain is such a safe bet

1446
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:05,200
(laughing)

1447
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,980
- Tomorrow's basically gonna shit all over

1448
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,820
the northern part of town.

1449
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:11,040
- It's gonna shit tomorrow, guys.

1450
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,640
(laughing)

1451
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,100
- But yeah, you just, you gotta sit there,

1452
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,540
you gotta be turning dials, pressing buttons,

1453
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:23,060
flipping switches, and then you, I don't know.

1454
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:25,500
I have a real desire to get into a hobby like that,

1455
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,260
like meteorology, like either meteorology or hand radio.

1456
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:29,820
- It's very math intensive.

1457
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:31,500
- Something with a, yeah, something that is like--

1458
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:33,840
- We should start our own radio station, dude.

1459
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:34,900
- I want ham radio.

1460
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:36,680
I wanna be talking to guys

1461
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:38,800
and accidentally falling in love with men.

1462
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,840
- Breaker breaker.

1463
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,780
- Yeah, yeah.

1464
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,760
Breaker, yeah, I mean that is so cool, man.

1465
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,600
I went to a guy's house one time.

1466
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,600
- You can't do ham radio in New York City.

1467
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,640
- Yeah, you can.

1468
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,480
- Yeah, you can, I've heard of it.

1469
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,440
- Yeah, you can do ham radio anywhere.

1470
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,800
I went to, I had to install a glass shower door

1471
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,080
one time for a guy.

1472
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,880
And he was like, he just liked me

1473
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,400
and my partner's kind of vibe.

1474
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,880
And he was like, "You guys want to see something really cool?"

1475
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:04,880
And we were like, "Yeah."

1476
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:11,960
And he brought us into his garage and he showed us probably a $20,000 ham radio setup.

1477
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:17,980
And he was like, "This is like, basically has ruined my wife's life that I have spent

1478
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,980
all our money on this."

1479
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,980
That's so expensive.

1480
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,980
And he showed us.

1481
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,980
That's sick, dude.

1482
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:25,200
He had like so, I mean, walls and walls of shit.

1483
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
Yeah.

1484
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,200
That's awesome.

1485
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:32,720
Ham radio is one of those hobbies that you can get into at any, like to any level of

1486
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:33,720
investment.

1487
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,040
You can like spend so much money on that shit.

1488
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:37,040
Yeah.

1489
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:38,440
Uh, most people just never do.

1490
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:42,720
But this guy, he had like, and he lived pretty modestly, didn't have a big house.

1491
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,600
He just had a glass shower door.

1492
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:48,240
He said the glass shower door is the one thing that his wife is like allowed to buy.

1493
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,880
And then he buys $500 of radio equipment every week.

1494
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,440
That's fucking insane dude.

1495
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,080
Yeah, I don't, I don't know anything about ham radio, so I don't really know.

1496
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,760
I barely know, I don't even know how it works really.

1497
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,400
It's just a way that you can,

1498
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:05,400
it's some like person to person radio thing.

1499
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,080
- Yeah, well model trains,

1500
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:09,440
I would assume it just like gets a bigger model.

1501
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,240
Like how much bigger is the radio gonna be

1502
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,880
for it to be like $20,000?

1503
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:15,720
- Well it's not just the radio,

1504
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,400
it's basically the same investment as like audio equipment.

1505
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,520
- Yeah. - Okay.

1506
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:22,200
- Yeah, but you just do it plugged

1507
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,520
into this crazy radio thing

1508
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,480
and then you get one that can have an even bigger

1509
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,280
field I guess, like that kind of thing.

1510
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,120
- Okay.

1511
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:30,960
- It's pretty dope.

1512
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,780
- Yeah.

1513
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:33,280
- This is ridiculous. - Very diminishing returns

1514
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:34,560
on that as well.

1515
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:37,880
Spending money on audio equipment.

1516
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,160
- I wanna get into model trains

1517
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,400
because I would do model disasters.

1518
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:47,600
That would be my-- - Like a little model Ohio?

1519
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:48,440
- Yes. - A little model

1520
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:49,360
chemical spill?

1521
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,160
- Well I would have model fucking,

1522
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,000
speaking of models, a beautiful model woman

1523
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:57,440
Just ride up on the tracks and keep an eye on the track there.

1524
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:01,480
And then a guy looks a lot like me going to save her, but he doesn't save her.

1525
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,000
Or you can do it.

1526
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,140
You can put your actual wife on the model train tracks.

1527
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:07,580
Kind of higher down.

1528
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,400
And then, you know, she's like, Oh, what a fun little game.

1529
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,480
It's it's not going to hurt.

1530
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:14,380
And then she notices as it's coming around, then there's a knife

1531
01:00:14,380 --> 01:00:16,980
tied to the front of it with duct tape.

1532
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:20,080
Then she also realizes that I've set it up like a trolley problem.

1533
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,480
But the other side of the thing is like a watermelon, like something

1534
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,480
It doesn't matter at all.

1535
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:28,480
I'm like, I don't know, it's a tough decision.

1536
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,480
Either kill you or lose what looks like an amazing summer watermelon.

1537
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,480
Speaking of this type of situation and billionaires,

1538
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:45,480
I think you've taken up an idea that another great mind in our time has thought of before.

1539
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:46,480
Which is?

1540
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,480
According to the fabled man, Steven Spielberg, who was just like this.

1541
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:52,000
when he was a kid he would, in the movie,

1542
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,720
according to the movie, he would just like

1543
01:00:53,720 --> 01:00:57,080
have a model train and just like crash it and record it

1544
01:00:57,080 --> 01:00:58,360
because he saw it in a movie once

1545
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,360
and he was like so obsessed with that.

1546
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,200
- That's kind of cool.

1547
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,780
- So I think you could be the next Steven Spielberg.

1548
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,600
- I think there's pretty much no doubt

1549
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,480
that I could be the next Steven Spielberg.

1550
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,760
How hard is it to direct a movie?

1551
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,320
Probably not very hard.

1552
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:13,400
- Have you seen some of the movies that come out?

1553
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:14,240
- They're bullshit.

1554
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,460
- I mean I haven't, but I assume they're pretty bad.

1555
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:18,320
- I haven't seen almost any movie,

1556
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:20,920
but I know that it's as easy as fucking anything.

1557
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:23,560
Yeah. If you just market a movie for China,

1558
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:26,200
you can get like an insane amount of budget. Uh,

1559
01:01:26,200 --> 01:01:29,160
but you do have to put like the war sweating in the, in the world.

1560
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,040
And also you have to put a T-Rex somewhere in there.

1561
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,520
I will see how China will just like take movie posters and then Photoshop

1562
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:42,060
Chinese faces onto the people in the movie poster and make like an identical

1563
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:43,120
copy of the movie.

1564
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:48,080
Just yeah. Yeah. But just the poster. That's so cool. Yeah.

1565
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:57,120
There's like one with like the rock and they like poorly photoshopped a watch off of his hand and then just like put a Chinese guy on his face.

1566
01:01:57,120 --> 01:02:01,120
I think China's incredible. I think we should all go there at some point.

1567
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:08,120
We would love to go to China. I would love to go to basically any city honestly. Any of the big cities.

1568
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:09,120
Yeah, maybe Chongqing.

1569
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:13,120
Yeah, I would love to go there. Shanghai.

1570
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,120
Shanghai, yeah

1571
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:23,760
You hit you said Shanghai, but then for Zhang Qing you said Chongqing. It's literally called Chongqing. I don't know

1572
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,760
Do you think I'm being racist

1573
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,480
No

1574
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:38,880
Not even a little I do think I do think it's I do think it's definitely a little funny you instantly went to Chongqing

1575
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,420
As the as the city I said

1576
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:52,620
We can disprove the racism right now, what do you want to see in in Chongqing? I don't know probably some stores

1577
01:02:52,620 --> 01:03:00,940
Okay, I want to see the rivers that converge that's cool. They have one dirty river and one clean river that can

1578
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:05,160
Say there are two rivers

1579
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:12,680
All right, bye. See you next week guys. Bye. Bye
