2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Think of the tender things that we were working on

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Slow change may pull us apart

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
When the light gets into your heart, baby

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Don't you forget about me

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Don't you forget about me

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:01:03,000
[Music]

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,800
So, well everybody, so before we begin, I want us to all, we're all going to start

10
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,680
rolling for our characters, so everyone who's listening or watching, we're doing

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:18,520
a very special episode. You might be able to tell if you can look at all of them,

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,920
but if you're not able to... I don't think that somebody could tell. Yeah. Actually the more I

13
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,080
look at it, it's like this all the time. Pat is the keystone. Pat is the one where if you look at him, he'll figure it out.

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,640
Pat is the only one, actually, who makes the most, who makes... You actually, you're kind of crushing it.

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,040
I didn't even see that thing in there.

16
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,040
Oh, the bracelet.

17
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,740
Yeah, so we're doing a breakfast club.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,740
I made these.

19
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,740
Very nice.

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:43,740
We got the Home Planet guys here to help us out, to round out the cast.

21
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
What up, what up?

22
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
That's right.

23
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
[LAUGHTER]

24
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,740
So let's start by--

25
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,740
Skip ahead to 14.11 to skip the rolling for stats part and straight into the rolls.

26
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,740
Home Planet guys, the new character sheets arrived.

27
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,740
You guys are used to them.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,740
Oh yeah, the system is so much better than the old one.

29
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,740
The system has been pared down a little bit.

30
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,740
I think you'll enjoy our new system.

31
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,420
So the stats are arm, balance ball, heart, brain, owl, and talking.

32
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:13,140
Yeah, and there's also heart, big heart, band-aid, bunny, exclamation point, bang, and shield,

33
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,140
and name as well.

34
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:21,140
Band-aid is going to be your least important, but big heart will maybe be your most.

35
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,140
That's a good point.

36
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,380
Yeah, we very rarely use short rest.

37
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,100
So don't worry that much about band-aid.

38
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,100
Band-aid is basically...

39
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,500
Band-aid is like an advanced kind of thing.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,900
for players like us who really know what we're doing.

41
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,860
- I think we all have a good band-aid score.

42
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,860
- Yeah, I got four numbers.

43
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,900
- So, you'll see asterisks next to each

44
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,100
of those individual stats with the exception

45
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,220
of Caleb, your character, because your character,

46
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,260
there's really all, so those asterisks mean

47
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,700
when you guys roll all your stats and you assign them,

48
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,660
you have to put the highest numbers

49
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,380
into those asterisks that you get.

50
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,220
- Okay.

51
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,060
- You just can't--

52
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,980
- Wait, can you repeat that?

53
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:02,820
So when you guys roll for your you're gonna roll stats right now. So yes, you're gonna roll three d6s

54
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,340
So three regular die

55
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,660
Add those together and write those on the side

56
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,200
Just so you can keep track of them and then assign them to the big box where your stats are

57
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,380
Okay, you should put your highest numbers

58
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,140
Where there's an asterisk next to them and then you can put the rest wherever

59
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:21,020
Okay, cuz that's what defines your character your character though

60
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:24,020
It just has like a little null symbol because I'm talking

61
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:27,640
Yeah, cuz you're just bad at talking like you can put your stats wherever you want

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,940
You just can't put your highest in talking. Okay, because you're not good at talking does talk though. She

63
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:38,860
What she she does talk I said, you know, I think she's not gonna be her best at talking

64
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,340
Oh, she's not gonna be her best. You think she

65
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:44,860
The character you just roll 3d

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,100
3d 6 and I'm gonna go over the ground rules and member to add them together

67
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,460
- Add them together and write them down on the side

68
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,540
so you remember and then you'll put them

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,380
and you'll assign them.

70
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,500
If you have any questions, I'm right here.

71
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,340
- How many times do we roll?

72
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,020
- Six times.

73
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,300
- Oh, so each thing is a different score.

74
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,460
Okay.

75
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,300
- Why are you saying it like that?

76
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,140
- Mm-hmm.

77
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,060
- Mm-hmm.

78
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,780
- Each thing is a different score.

79
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,220
Four.

80
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,340
- Nine.

81
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,300
Okay, yeah, write that down on the side.

82
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,980
You keep that to yourself though.

83
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,700
- Nope.

84
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,700
No sweat, no sweat.

85
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:25,700
You guys listen to that sound, listen to that chorus of die rolling.

86
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,700
It's the worst sound in the world.

87
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
It's a great sound, you're so wrong.

88
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,700
True gamers now.

89
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,700
17.

90
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,700
So I just have to put my lowest in talking?

91
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,700
Yeah.

92
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,700
Damn it, I suck.

93
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,700
It's okay.

94
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,700
Okay wait, so owl is wisdom and talking is talking?

95
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:53,240
Talking's like charisma. Okay. Yeah. Wisdom. Yeah. Okay. How did you know owl is wisdom?

96
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:57,500
Have you played this before? Kind of the universal sign. I don't think I said owl is wisdom.

97
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:02,880
I said wisdom. Oh. Yeah. But I understood it immediately. Yeah. I have terrible rolls.

98
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,080
I got a good one. Mine are pretty bad too. Mine are middling. Well this is going to impact

99
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,200
my gameplay. Yes. Heavily. It's going to impact it for sure. That's part of the reason why

100
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,860
there are numbers there. These gloves are so uncomfortable. See, having just watched

101
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:18,780
the movie I don't think Claire is particularly super wise I think if

102
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,940
anything she's feigning as though she is. Go with just the talking then I

103
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,860
think it's not I don't think it's incorrect. Do what you feel. I was trying to give her another stat that I thought.

104
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,660
Why is talking one of my biggest ones? I think Bender is really good at talking.

105
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:36,940
He's the top talker in the movie. He's sort of like a rogue.

106
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:42,300
That always happens. Remember when he like when he like licks her vagina in the movie?

107
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,300
Yeah, we're gonna get there. Don't spoil that for the fans.

108
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Can't do that nowadays. I gotta do that to Joe.

109
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,300
I have a question. What does the brain mean?

110
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
Brain is intelligence.

111
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
That makes sense.

112
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
Sweet. Great question.

113
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
So we do this every single time.

114
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
I actually know what they all are.

115
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:07,300
So what is the difference between, is it strength and then like agility?

116
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
Yeah, balance ball is like dexterity.

117
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,300
Oh, I thought he was playing soccer.

118
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,540
That's a good-ass point.

119
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,100
Damn, we should call it soccer.

120
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,100
We should call it soccer.

121
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,100
That's faster to say than balance ball.

122
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,100
From now on, it is soccer.

123
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,100
It's soccer.

124
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,100
And then heart is what?

125
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,100
Your health.

126
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Here in Afternoon is soccer.

127
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
Oh, wait, which heart?

128
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,100
The beating heart.

129
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,100
Real heart.

130
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,100
Real heart is constitution.

131
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,100
Okay, you're gusto.

132
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,100
So your ability to withstand pain.

133
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,100
Am I fucking things up if I put my second highest one there?

134
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,100
Not at all.

135
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,100
Nothing, it doesn't matter at all.

136
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
It's all made up for a game.

137
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,100
Okay, cool.

138
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,100
Everything's made up and the points don't matter.

139
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,100
This is just so if I roll something, I don't have to worry about it.

140
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
I don't have to worry about it.

141
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
at all it's all made up for a game.

142
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
Everything's made up and the points don't matter.

143
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,100
Oh this is just so like if I roll something and it's like oh blah blah blah.

144
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,100
Yeah I know.

145
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
Oh and then I add two if it's my good ones.

146
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Mmhmm. Okay.

147
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,100
We add two if it's our good ones?

148
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,100
Yeah that's what all the asterisks are.

149
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
So what the hell?

150
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
You got the modifier right there.

151
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Got the modifier on the ladder liar.

152
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Whatever my modifier is.

153
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
Yes. Okay so two.

154
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,100
So two.

155
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,940
(laughing)

156
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,780
- Yeah, so two.

157
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,860
- So you don't have to add it now,

158
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,700
you can just add it after.

159
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,520
- Zendaya.

160
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,360
- You can add it now if you want to.

161
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,300
- Okay, so-- - What?

162
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,440
- There's something there. - When would I add it

163
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,280
if I don't add it right now?

164
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,100
- Well, because it's your proficiency also.

165
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:13,940
- This is really good radio.

166
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,780
- You're also writing it to your text.

167
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,620
- There are people watching this,

168
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,440
so I don't know if I have anything.

169
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,280
- Oh, so I don't, yeah.

170
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,100
People are watching and they're gonna be--

171
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:18,940
- This is-- - Noted, but right now--

172
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:19,780
- If they made the Breakfast Club--

173
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,060
- It's a lot of crosstalk. - 2023.

174
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:22,900
- Zendaya!

175
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,980
This is my favorite part of the Breakfast Club movie.

176
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,580
You think Joe would play Zendaya?

177
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,380
So, next--

178
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,380
Zendaya would play Joe.

179
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,180
Once you guys have your numbers associated,

180
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:33,780
let's do the modifiers for those numbers.

181
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,580
OK.

182
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,080
So--

183
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,060
I already did that.

184
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,020
OK.

185
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,100
So 10 is 0.

186
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,980
Oh, wait, what?

187
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:44,140
So right-- you see the circle next to the big square?

188
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,640
Yeah.

189
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,740
You're going to add like a plus 1 or 2 or a minus 1 or 2.

190
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,900
Maybe we shouldn't have filmed this part.

191
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,340
Some people like this part.

192
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,220
I can skip through it.

193
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,020
We'll time stamp it.

194
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,820
We can skip it, too.

195
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,320
We get time.

196
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,660
This is going to play in the-- it's just in the same--

197
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,860
If you don't want to see us--

198
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,020
I'm just listening to this.

199
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,580
Yeah, I think this is crazy.

200
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,900
I think some people love this.

201
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,820
This is crazy.

202
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,580
I feel like it should be a separate video.

203
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,900
The microphone feels so good against my lips.

204
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,780
I was thinking of doing this as like a separate video,

205
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,620
and then we all showed up in our costumes.

206
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,140
Yeah.

207
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,340
And like a cut.

208
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,620
But you can just cut, right?

209
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,740
We can take all of our clothes off and do it naked.

210
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,620
We'll just finish it.

211
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,420
We'll finish it out.

212
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,260
Let's finish it out.

213
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,980
So I think this is also a good opportunity

214
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:25,360
of rebroker the breakfast club and see like you know if it were made today what

215
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,360
would change. Who would get cancelled? We're about to find that out. We're about to do the breakfast club if it were made today.

216
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:34,780
I have some questions about the setting but we'll get to that. How do we do the

217
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:38,640
modifier? So the way to add your modifier is look at the number that you have

218
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:45,560
there in your boxes. 10 is 0. 10 to 11 is 0 to your modifier. You put that in the

219
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:54,040
circle. 12 to 13 is plus 1, 14 to 15 is plus 2, 16 to 17 plus 3 and so on.

220
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,960
So what would be a 4? So here, let me... 4? You have a 4? 1000. Does anyone have anything lower than an 8?

221
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:09,400
Yeah, he said a 4. A 4? Okay. So 7 is minus 2. 7 and 6 and 7 is minus 2. If anyone has a 6 or 7, write minus 2 next to it.

222
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:14,000
If you have an 8 or 9, write -1 next to it.

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay?

224
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Oh, okay.

225
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,680
And then a 4 is maybe like a +7?

226
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,680
Pat, not yet.

227
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,120
10 or 11 is 0.

228
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,360
12 or 13 is +1.

229
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,840
14 and 15 +2.

230
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,840
We already have those.

231
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:32,840
Oh, we are?

232
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Everything's filled in?

233
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,840
Yeah.

234
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,920
Now for the 4, that 4 that you have there, that is -4, I believe.

235
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Think about it though.

236
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Ok, so...

237
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
I put that under my brain.

238
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,920
I put that under my brain.

239
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,920
I am completely

240
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,920
developmentally disabled.

241
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,920
-16 is a +3.

242
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm probably in here

243
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
because I did something I didn't know.

244
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
Even though I've already added...

245
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
My roll was 14, I added 2 with the modifier.

246
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
You'll add that after

247
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,920
the fact. So it's +2 for you,

248
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,920
and you'll add...

249
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,320
plus two. And then...

250
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,920
Fourteen and then plus two in the circle. And then you'll add plus two whenever you roll for a save.

251
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:17,820
The big number doesn't matter at all. It's only the... It's only there to help align it to it.

252
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,480
I hate the big number.

253
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,520
Okay, so then I...

254
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,720
my ten is an eight.

255
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,280
And my eight is a minus one.

256
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,700
Yeah. It'll also be fine.

257
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,280
You have minus three intelligence, right?

258
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,600
Yes. Well, I have a four minus three.

259
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800
- A four minus three?

260
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,040
- His modifier is minus three, and he has a four.

261
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
- How is your modifier minus three?

262
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,560
- 'Cause I got a four.

263
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,880
- Oh, okay, sorry, I thought you had it on top of it.

264
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:42,840
- No, no, no, no.

265
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,480
- Five is minus three also.

266
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,840
- So you are a weak lady.

267
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,880
- Oh my God, you're a wimp.

268
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,520
- Oh my God, you have like, your sheet is terrible.

269
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,360
- I'm pretty bad, yeah.

270
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,960
- This is why usually people do the roll four D6s,

271
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,360
drop one, but this is more fun

272
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,240
because you get stuff like that, to be honest.

273
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,080
- Mine is pretty bad.

274
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,040
- How about we roll a D20?

275
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:06,440
I'm kind of good at on this. I got a 17 because then you'll get the ranges will go even crazier.

276
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,340
The chances of being super 1d 20.

277
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,440
Just what do you mean?

278
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:13,140
You just roll 1d 20 instead of 3d 6.

279
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,040
It's different.

280
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,640
It's different.

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
How's it different?

282
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,940
Because there's different math.

283
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,440
It's different.

284
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,940
Think about like the minimum you get on 3 is 3.

285
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,540
We shouldn't explain bell curves today.

286
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,040
Okay, cool.

287
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,540
Well, yeah, but wouldn't it be funnier to get a one for your armor class?

288
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,220
it would be your armor class so that you see that there's shield shield shield on

289
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:43,620
the shield oh shield shield shield shield is 10 plus your balance ball modifier or

290
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,140
your soccer modifier so the number in the circle it can also be - plus 10 just

291
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:56,140
didn't put it in there yet Alex. What did you do? Did you roll six times? Yeah, oh, oh no I didn't. I rolled four. You're still holding the dice too. He was staring at me and was counting. And I was like oh ok he's on the right track.

292
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
No one, I don't know if anyone's gonna wanna watch this.

293
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,500
What is a 12?

294
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,500
We can put a time stamp.

295
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,500
A 12 is a +1.

296
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:24,500
That's good, that's 11.

297
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,500
That's nice.

298
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,500
Okay, then what goes in the shield?

299
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,500
11 is +1.

300
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Oh, I thought it was 0.

301
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,500
No, 11 is 0.

302
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
11 is 0.

303
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,500
I'm sorry.

304
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
You're fine, you're fine.

305
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Alex, your armor class will be a 11.

306
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Your armor class is a 0, is 10 actually, sorry.

307
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,300
actually sorry. No it's 10 plus. Oh it's balance ball I'm sorry thank you. Soccer. So go it's 10

308
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,900
plus soccer. Brother. 10 plus soccer all on the shield. 10 plus soccer all on the shield.

309
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,980
An initiative. Sorry your exclamation point. Thank you. Thank you. Is just soccer ball modifier.

310
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:04,780
Plus one. Soccer modifier. Wait what's the soccer one? The balance ball. The circle next to soccer.

311
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,980
Oh, oh, so then plus one?

312
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:08,980
Yeah.

313
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,980
Cool.

314
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
Excellent.

315
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
I love numbers.

316
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,380
I think that the talking should impact these more.

317
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,940
No, so you just got a bad sheet.

318
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,940
Just put plus one.

319
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,380
Which ones would you like the talking to impact?

320
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,380
Just put plus one.

321
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,380
I don't know, speed maybe?

322
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,380
No.

323
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,380
No, speed never changes.

324
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,740
Well, except in this one, the athlete over here does have 40.

325
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Because you commented that.

326
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
You should have made it...

327
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
Let me try that one.

328
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:40,740
it

329
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,420
glass by screaming. Not with speed. Well maybe it does. That's talking. That's speed of sound.

330
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:50,780
So. Bro got grills in. Alright cool. We got all your stats assigned. It's bracing. The

331
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:55,180
other thing we'll need to do is when we get to your attacks and stuff. But I'll deal with

332
00:13:55,180 --> 00:14:00,620
that later. I'd rather not. We could just screw that on the fly. I'd rather keep going.

333
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:05,580
So I'm going to explain to you how this game works. It's a little bit different from what

334
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,900
we usually do. This. Here yeah. Everyone get your stuff on because this is what we would

335
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,900
want to keep in. Okay. This next part.

336
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,900
Um...

337
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
[laughter]

338
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,900
Yeah, so get yourself ready.

339
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,900
Um...

340
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,900
Throughout the Breakfast Club campaign

341
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
there are seven phases to your day,

342
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
to your detention day.

343
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
When you arrive, there's your first

344
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
bathroom break, an exercise

345
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
break, a lunch,

346
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
arts and crafts, your second

347
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
bathroom break, and then the final hang

348
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:43,700
with all your new friends. Every 10 or so minutes in real life, this is me, I'll use this as

349
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:51,140
a timer, I will be counting down until the phase is over. I'll make a call depending

350
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,580
on how the phase is going, like maybe it'll go a little bit over, maybe you will get bored

351
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,860
and want to just end it, but after each phase ends, the fatigue of detention wears on. I

352
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:05,060
will roll a d4 and then I will subtract that number from your HP.

353
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:08,060
So, we can die.

354
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,060
If you guys work together.

355
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,060
Now it is in 2023.

356
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,060
I didn't want to go there but I had to bring it up.

357
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,060
You can die now?

358
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,060
You can die.

359
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,060
What happens is you get a tummy ache and you have to be taken home.

360
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,060
That's not that bad.

361
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,060
And you have to go to detention the following week.

362
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Wait, that's better than having detention.

363
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,060
You get to go home and watch TV.

364
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,060
You have to go to detention twice technically.

365
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,060
But that's in the future, it doesn't matter.

366
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
We're only playing one day.

367
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,060
Yeah, for you that's good.

368
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:37,300
you that's good. Yeah, well I already have that. Yeah, I gotta work it out. You'll get

369
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:41,500
another detention. How about he just shoots me? How about the principal just fucking shoots

370
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:46,500
me? I don't think Coach is gonna let that happen. If you guys work together, character,

371
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:53,500
and break past your stereotypes, and do things that show me your character is growing, you

372
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,620
will get a token. Which is, shit I forgot to get the tokens. But, where are they? I'll

373
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,620
Just any figurines. Just get the bag of figurines.

374
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,620
I'll get them.

375
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,620
Get them.

376
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,620
Okay.

377
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:12,620
You can spend these tokens either to add to your rolls in the game,

378
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:14,620
so plus to your rolls,

379
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:19,620
or subtract from the damage you take at the end of each phase.

380
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,620
Cool.

381
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,620
That's perfect.

382
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Can we get the GI Joe ones instead? They're metal.

383
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,620
I know, but hold on.

384
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:32,140
The most concrete way to get tokens is to talk about a rumor that is out there

385
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:36,460
about either yourself or another character and resolve that kind of whole

386
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:40,300
thing. I don't agree with that because that is bullying. Or about why you ended

387
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:44,460
up in detention. Yeah, just not sure. That will generally guarantee you a token to

388
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,020
spend. You probably you'll handle it. If I talk about why I got detention? Well if

389
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:52,180
you just open up. Aren't we supposed to do that anyway? No, but it has to be organic.

390
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,340
I'm closed off. I don't want to talk to you guys. I don't even know you guys.

391
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,940
Yeah, but I brag about detail.

392
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,740
Hold on, here we go.

393
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,540
So if you're...

394
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,940
Yeah, you got your problem, buddy.

395
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,340
Here's the thing.

396
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,040
You're proud of it.

397
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,040
Your HP will likely go to zero during this game.

398
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,740
Like it's very hard to like...

399
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,040
The possibility of...

400
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,740
The probability of like...

401
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:11,940
You guys not going to zero,

402
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,640
rolling a d4 and you only have 10 HP.

403
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,940
It's pretty low of you guys like...

404
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,340
But if you're still in the game,

405
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,740
you will still be in the game.

406
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:23,240
So you can get your HP back up to half.

407
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:28,440
if you admit to one of the rumors that is floating around you

408
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,920
or you tell everyone why you're in detention. So you might want to pocket those

409
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,920
instead of just using them as ways to get tokens.

410
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,600
As in there are other ways to get tokens just by conversing, hanging out, doing other things.

411
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,480
Those are like, let me automatically get a token by having this moment.

412
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,920
So are other people sort of organically discovering other people's rumors

413
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
as we go along?

414
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,560
Are there clues to the rumors?

415
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,560
He's got them right now.

416
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:50,560
When you shuffle all these, you've got all your rumors right here.

417
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,440
And they're being distributed to all of us.

418
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,040
Holy shit.

419
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
So we kind of come equipped with some...

420
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Each of you are going to get three of the rumors.

421
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Some tea on other people.

422
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,540
Uh-huh.

423
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
Yeah, it's like the Kermit meme.

424
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,540
Can we go around and say everyone's character's name?

425
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,040
Yeah.

426
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,540
Kermit!

427
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,040
Kermit!

428
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Yeah, come on.

429
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,540
Kermits have been on that damn...

430
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,540
Or I guess we can wait.

431
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:10,040
That will just be at the start, huh?

432
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,540
Never mind.

433
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,040
Kermit's tea.

434
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,540
I basically took command when I shouldn't have.

435
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,540
Kermit's tea.

436
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,040
Your mic is off.

437
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Kermit's tea.

438
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,540
I was going to try to tie my hair.

439
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:22,040
The only thing is, if you get one of your own...

440
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,520
- Each of you guys take three rumors.

441
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,760
If you get one of your own rumors,

442
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,960
put it back until you don't have your own rumor.

443
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,800
All right?

444
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,920
- I'm gonna throw it away.

445
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,760
- And also, sorry for my handwriting.

446
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,160
Here, put this in the center.

447
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,140
- If you wrote three again. - Everyone take three.

448
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,200
You said everyone take three?

449
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,880
- And the rumors say who they're about.

450
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,040
- Yep, everyone take three.

451
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,600
They say who they're about in my chicken scratch.

452
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,280
If you get one with your own name on it.

453
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,680
- I didn't get any of my own.

454
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,720
- I got all of my own.

455
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
[Laughter]

456
00:18:52,720 --> 00:19:02,720
Oh that one's flipped.

457
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
So before...

458
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
Whoa! Some of these are pretty juicy.

459
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Before we did this, everyone at home, I asked the guys...

460
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Oh I got all of one person.

461
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,720
You got all of one person? That's very good.

462
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,720
That's really funny.

463
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:22,080
I asked all the guys to send me three rumors about their character, two of which are true,

464
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,000
one of which is false.

465
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,720
So that's part of what's going on here.

466
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,820
So again, these rumors and the reason why you're in detention are things you can use

467
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:36,220
to make sure you don't, you're not dead forever.

468
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,560
So you might want to save them, but they're also guaranteed tokens, so you might want

469
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,560
to use them.

470
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,720
So it's up to you guys how you want to do that.

471
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Okay.

472
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,720
Next, if you cause too much of a ruckus,

473
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,720
the hall monitors will watch you more closely

474
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,120
in the room, in the hallway, when you go to the bathroom.

475
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,480
They may even start to attack you.

476
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,760
However, sometimes causing a ruckus

477
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
is a great way to make friends.

478
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,360
So think about that too.

479
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,280
We're gonna figure it out, you know.

480
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,600
Importantly, you cannot,

481
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,160
you cannot attack Principal Sullivan.

482
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,000
- Shut up. - What?

483
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,840
(laughing)

484
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,640
- You made the one campaign - What do you mean?

485
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,640
where we can't kill him and it would be the funniest thing for us to do immediately?

486
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,640
We just can't? You can't attack him, please!

487
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,640
But we can torment him in other ways. Of course!

488
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,640
Can we emasculate him? Can we emasculate him?

489
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,640
Wait, what did you say about the... You're gonna be so much meaner to him, I already know because I said that.

490
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
Sometimes being friends... What's that? Sometimes causing a ruckus.

491
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Sometimes causing a ruckus makes the most friends.

492
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,640
That should be like the tagline for your guys'... for just Pod About Less in general.

493
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,640
And? On the poster, that'd be pretty cute.

494
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,920
you can't escape the school either you have to sit through detention

495
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,320
that's how the game work here let me let me correct this you can do those things

496
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,560
to in care

497
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,800
you can kill Sullivan and then escape the school and then we're I'm just gonna

498
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:58,320
have to fucking make a bunch of shit and I will do that if I have to do that but

499
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,640
if we want to do it the breakfast club the story where the principal here in

500
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,640
detention, those are the things that have to stay the same.

501
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,640
I'll leave it at that.

502
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,640
That makes sense to me.

503
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,640
That's the only reason why I'll say that.

504
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,640
I really can do it, I should say that, but I will have to just make a bunch of shit up.

505
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:21,640
Okay, during the exercise phase, a gym teacher will visit you.

506
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:25,640
There'll be a specific challenge for that. During the arts and craft phase,

507
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:29,640
an art teacher will visit you. There'll be a challenge for that. There's more tokens you can get

508
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,720
in those instances. During each bathroom break,

509
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,000
you'll be able to retrieve one item from your locker

510
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,000
only if you're able to sneak past the hall monitors. For Bender,

511
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,600
that's drugs to share. Ooh, nice. And if you get those drugs and you use them,

512
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,360
that's 2x tokens for any positive social interaction for everybody

513
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,000
in the party. Give me those drugs, doobage. For the nerd, that's

514
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,440
a, um... Pencil.

515
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,760
I can't tell you because it has to do with your reason for being in detention.

516
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Oh yeah.

517
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:05,000
For Molly Ringwald's character, that's one hundred dollars

518
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,160
you can use to bribe people.

519
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,160
Yeah, rich money.

520
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,400
That's a baseball bat you can use for fights.

521
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,240
Oh, nice. With the hall monitors.

522
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:16,200
And for weird girl, it's a real frog.

523
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,320
Yeah. Why does that make so much sense?

524
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:23,640
OK, we all had the frog girl in high school, remember?

525
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:26,040
So I dated her.

526
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,280
- Is everybody... - Oh, I fucked her.

527
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,280
- That was the frog.

528
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,480
- We're in a good enough spot right now, right?

529
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,440
- When do we get these items?

530
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,280
- We just own them. - During the bathroom break.

531
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,120
- Oh, got it. - You're in our locker.

532
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,320
- If you want to sneak to your locker.

533
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,440
- Got it. Cool.

534
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
- Is my locker next to the bathroom?

535
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,920
(laughter)

536
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,840
- I just want to make sure I'm not talking to you both.

537
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,720
- When we get into the campaign,

538
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,000
you guys can ask me about your abilities.

539
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:45,960
You have abilities there.

540
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,840
I'll let you know what they do if you ask me about them.

541
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,360
Like, right now, I think,

542
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,440
we can think it's enough preamble.

543
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,320
Let's get started.

544
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:57,320
So it's a beautiful Saturday morning.

545
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,200
It should be a day that you guys are all hanging out,

546
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,520
watching cartoons and hanging out with your friends,

547
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,520
but you're not.

548
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,440
It's a beautiful Saturday morning in Duluth, Brooklyn.

549
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,240
And instead, you're getting dropped off.

550
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,960
At Sullivan, the Frog High School.

551
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,240
Sorry, Sullivan, the Frog Enterprises High School.

552
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,320
- They named it after him?

553
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,160
The principal?

554
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,000
(laughing)

555
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,760
after the principal. It's the weirdest school ever. It's not normal. Let's wait until you

556
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:35,080
learn about the children who go there. What? And you're all getting dropped off at the

557
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:41,160
school. Are you getting dropped off by your parents, by your siblings? Let's go around.

558
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:45,800
Let's start with you, Alex. Okay. Emilio Estevez. Who's dropping you off at school? I'm getting

559
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:52,520
dropped off in an unmarked SUV and a man with a suit is pushing a box up to the

560
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,480
front and then I punched through the box.

561
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:01,120
Okay. It's kind of cool. And then I run into the school, the fastest you've

562
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:08,960
ever seen anyone run. You sprint 20 feet into the school? Yeah. Like that. "Go get him son!"

563
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:18,640
your dad says not my dad who is in the car then agent M it's me go get out son

564
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,360
agent M your mom yes no that's I can't get into that okay and then what about

565
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:31,520
you Molly my driver is actually taking me at least that's how close me and my dad

566
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,960
have been recently it almost feels as though he is a servant in servitude of

567
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,440
of me and my awful mom.

568
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,400
- With a slave dad, yeah.

569
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,000
- Yeah, my dad is just like my mommy's whipping boy,

570
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,840
sort of.

571
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,720
- I know I'm just your mother's whipping boy,

572
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,560
but could you maybe be nice to me?

573
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,680
Just this once.

574
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,000
- Whatever, dad.

575
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,360
- Well, I hope you have a good time in detention.

576
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,800
Oh, if that doesn't make any sense, I'm sorry.

577
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,160
- Whatever.

578
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,120
I'm going in now.

579
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,700
- Okay, here's your lunch.

580
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,380
- Agent M is your dad?

581
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,380
Now he's playing multiple characters.

582
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:13,380
Oh, okay.

583
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,380
Okay, bye honey. Yeah, bye.

584
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Damn, alright, that's harsh. And what about you?

585
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,380
I'm walking around in the front of the building with a cigarette in my mouth.

586
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,380
No parents. Yeah, no parents.

587
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:33,380
They are in the car though. Yeah, fuck you!

588
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,380
I'll fuck you, dad!

589
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Fuck you!

590
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,380
Bitch!

591
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,380
I'll fucking kill you!

592
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,380
You'll fucking kill me!

593
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,380
No, stop it!

594
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,380
I bet you will!

595
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,380
Stop it!

596
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
How do your mom's trying to stop him from getting out of the car?

597
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
I'll fuck you up, bitch!

598
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,380
I'll fuck you up!

599
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,380
I'll fuck you up!

600
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,380
I'll fuck you up!

601
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,380
I'll fuck you up!

602
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,380
I'll fuck you up!

603
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,380
I'll fuck you up!

604
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,380
I'll fuck you up!

605
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,380
I'll fuck you up!

606
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,380
I'll fuck you up!

607
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,380
I'll fuck you up!

608
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,380
I'll fuck you up!

609
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,380
I'll fuck you up!

610
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,380
I'll fuck you up!

611
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,380
I'll fuck you up!

612
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,380
I'll fuck you up!

613
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,380
I'll fuck you up!

614
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,380
I'll fuck you up!

615
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,700
And then I just kind of walk in.

616
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Kind of meep in?

617
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Yeah, meep in.

618
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
And you?

619
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
Uh, I'm...

620
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:12,300
My family has a car where it's a minivan but it has three seats in the front, so I'm sitting

621
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,460
in between my mom and dad up front and I'm reading a book.

622
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,460
What book?

623
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:19,460
What?

624
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
What book?

625
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,460
The Origin of Mathematics.

626
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,460
By Charles Darwin.

627
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,460
It's a good book.

628
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,460
Gregorian.

629
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,500
I thought you would have already have read that book.

630
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
Oh, I have.

631
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
I'm just reading for pleasure.

632
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Now that's my good boy.

633
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:35,100
And I climb out over my mom's lap and I go, "Oh wait, other side."

634
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:38,100
And I crawl back and I crawl across my dad's lap.

635
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,660
That's it, son.

636
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,660
You don't touch your mother.

637
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,660
Come on out of the car.

638
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,500
And I get out of the car and I trip and I fall and I get up.

639
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,860
You trip and you fall and you get up.

640
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,860
Okay.

641
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:54,380
And you all file into the Sullivan the Frog Enterprises library where Principal Sullivan

642
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,380
is waiting for you.

643
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:59,380
*laughter*

644
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,380
*laughter*

645
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,380
*laughter*

646
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,380
Principal Sullivan is here to greet you all.

647
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,380
*sigh*

648
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,380
Um, alright.

649
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,380
Well, I'm sorry.

650
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,380
Um, *clears throat*

651
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
I'm sorry that you have detention, but you got

652
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:17,380
detention.

653
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,380
And, um, you guys gotta sit here the whole day

654
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,380
and, um, just think

655
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,380
about what you did, and don't worry,

656
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,380
don't worry about it, it happens. People,

657
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:32,460
People make mistakes, you know this morning I got up and I went to brush my teeth. I just had orange juice. So, uh, you know

658
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:40,740
Principal Sullivan you're far too understanding with all of us Cretans here in the detention. You don't need to put on a brave face. It's okay

659
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,860
Thank you. Thank you, Molly

660
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,500
You know, I got a I

661
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500

663
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,960
Stop, what are you, fuc-

664
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,960
Hey, I got a question. Does Froggy Manilow know you raided his wardrobe?

665
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
Yeah, that's...

666
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
His lily pad?

667
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Does Froggy Manilow know you raided his lily pad?

668
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,960
Alright, hey, uh, my mom got me these, man.

669
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
Yeah, is your mom Froggy Manilow?

670
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,960
No, she is not, and that's another week in detention for you.

671
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Pfft, eat my shit.

672
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,960
Damn.

673
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,960
Hey, hey.

674
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,800
What'd you just say?

675
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,240
Eat my shit.

676
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,600
Frogs actually eat flies.

677
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
Not shit.

678
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,600
And another week for him!

679
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
No, he does not-

680
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,520
He gets detention with me for speaking out of line like I just did.

681
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,480
No, you just are the one getting detention because-

682
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
Eat my shit!

683
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,280
I'll happily take detention if that's what you deem necessary.

684
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,240
No, you're good, man.

685
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,120
You gotta not do that to yourself.

686
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
I'm sorry.

687
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Don't be so- You've got three weeks in detention now.

688
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,620
Good!

689
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:55,620
You- I don't wanna do this!

690
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,620
So?

691
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,620
I'm not a disciplinarian by nature!

692
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,620
Who gives a shit?

693
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:00,620
Freakazoid, stop it!

694
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Shut up!

695
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:02,120
I have to!

696
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,620
Slut!

697
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
Hey!

698
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
Hold on, that's gotta be at least three more weeks.

699
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,120
We don't even know that word.

700
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,620
You're a slut, and you're gay.

701
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,620
No, no I'm not.

702
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:11,620
Okay, look man, I don't know what to do.

703
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,620
You're raped!

704
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,620
You're a nerd.

705
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
You're put- Stop it!

706
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:15,620
And you're the weird girl.

707
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:18,620
You're put- Stop- You keep naming them- Their names!

708
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,620
I can't-

709
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,620
and you're a little pro, bitch.

710
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,620
This is why Breakfast Club would never happen today.

711
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,620
Because of labels. People have labels now.

712
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,620
I'm trying to write this down.

713
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
That's like six months of detention.

714
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,620
I already had six more months of this shit, bitch.

715
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
Hey, Principal, at this point,

716
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:35,620
I think that detention's probably not solving the problems

717
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,620
that we have with this guy, okay?

718
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,620
You should shoot me right now, because I have a bad home life.

719
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
What?

720
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
Shoot me in the fucking head!

721
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,620
Shoot me with two guns!

722
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,620
I'm not going to do that! You're really scary!

723
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,700
Okay, okay, okay, how about this, how about this, how about this?

724
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,200
I'll call you now.

725
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,920
I want detention forever!

726
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,760
Let's just, let's just-

727
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,420
So what if a good punishment would be not giving me detention?

728
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,120
Oh, hmm.

729
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
'Cause I want detention forever.

730
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,620
Don't do it.

731
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,260
So that I can go home right now.

732
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,620
Don't do it, Principal.

733
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,260
Don't do it.

734
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,760
I don't know, he's making sense, so maybe I should-

735
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,020
No, he's on drugs, probably.

736
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,100
Yeah, I'm on drugs and I have him in my locker!

737
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,180
He just admitted it.

738
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,140
You want me to kill him?

739
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,140
Oh, man, you can't- don't tell me you got drugs in your locker.

740
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:17,480
I got drugs in my locker, we should go investigate it together right now.

741
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
ball and kick you out of here.

742
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
- You're gonna kick me out?

743
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,480
- Okay, that's not, obviously I'm not enough of an authority figure.

744
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,480
- Hey, put some Sullivan, Sullivan.

745
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
- To calm this down.

746
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
- Go, frogs!

747
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
- That's right, thank you.

748
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
Hey, I like it.

749
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:38,480
- He made the school after himself and made the mascot himself.

750
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
- The mascot isn't a mascot.

751
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,480
- The Sullivan the frog frogs.

752
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,480
- He called the Sullivans.

753
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,480
- Thank you, that's really nice.

754
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:51,980
Look man, okay, you have now five years of detention.

755
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:54,780
Rich, I already stayed back five years.

756
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:55,900
(laughing)

757
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,740
Look.

758
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:57,560
What?

759
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,400
How old are you?

760
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
25.

761
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,080
Whoa.

762
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,900
And I really don't--

763
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,740
That's my number.

764
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,320
Yeah, and I stayed back two years

765
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,300
in middle school too, bitch.

766
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,020
So are you 27 or?

767
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,100
No, he did that to--

768
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,940
Oh, okay.

769
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,420
My address is a negative three on here.

770
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,260
I can't really do this math.

771
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,580
Yeah, that makes sense.

772
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,700
I'm gonna come back later.

773
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,940
I'm gonna be right outside that door.

774
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:21,020

You want us to draw an essay?

819
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
No, I mean...

820
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,080
They should have called her the stupid girl.

821
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Hey, hey, hey.

822
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,080
I'm walking out.

823
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,080
I'm walking out of here.

824
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,080
I'm going away.

825
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,080
Principal Sullivan, it feels very irresponsible for you to leave after all the stuff he said about...

826
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Look man.

827
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
I don't feel safe with him.

828
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,080
I'm going to tell you bye.

829
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,080
I'm going to shoot up the school now.

830
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,080
And the timer has started.

831
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,720
The timer has started.

832
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,440
So, you guys are just getting to know each other,

833
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,640
you're just hanging out.

834
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,980
What's going on?

835
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:44,040
- I get to work on drawing a Hispanic guy

836
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,360
from South Central LA.

837
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,200
- Yeah, that's what I thought you meant.

838
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,040
- Nike Cortez, big white t-shirt.

839
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,880
- Yeah.

840
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,080
- Doing my stretches.

841
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,000
- You're doing your stretches?

842
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:51,840
- I'm doing calculations, I guess.

843
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,960
- I look over and I think that you're drawing me.

844
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,920
(laughing)

845
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,760
- Cut it out!

846
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,680
Knock it off, that's not me!

847
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,800
- Oh, I'm putting my pencil up my nose.

848
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,360
to smell it or to...

849
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,640
Just as a... I just like doing stuff like this.

850
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,240
Oh, okay.

851
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,280
It's what nerds do.

852
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:13,440
I'm kind of surveying the room and I'm seeing how all these kind of freakazoids are like

853
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,040
in these completely like alien outer space planets, like complete, like Jupiter and Mars.

854
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,920
Yeah.

855
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,440
Whereas I'm kind of a normal girl from Earth.

856
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,920
Is this the 80s?

857
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,640
It's the 80s. It's very much the 80s, yes.

858
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,160
I'm looking at both of you.

859
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,400
That's...

860
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,360
You're jacking it?

861
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
Jacking off and pointing at them.

862
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,120
Strike one.

863
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,320
What's he doing?

864
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
What is that?

865
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,560
Hey, be happy.

866
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,560
It's called jacking off.

867
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,560
Because I'm a freakazoid.

868
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,520
I'm a freak.

869
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:41,240
That's the first thing you said all day that makes sense.

870
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,880
Freak.

871
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm going to go rip up a book.

872
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,040
All right, do you get up and go rip up a book?

873
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,040
OK, you go over.

874
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,720
Can I stop him from ripping a book?

875
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,720
You can definitely try.

876
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,440
I'm going to jump on him like a spider monkey.

877
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,760
So you have an ability called wrestling.

878
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,480
OK.

879
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,480
You can use.

880
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,020
(laughter)

881
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,560
- Here's the thing. - You're so done.

882
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,400
It's over.

883
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,240
- Yeah. - You're done, man.

884
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,800
- Guys are getting knocked out of the game.

885
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,800
- If you want, you can use it as a grappling move,

886
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,300
but you can actually just do grappling,

887
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,380
just straight vanilla grappling,

888
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,120
so just a strength contest.

889
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,560
- Can I roll wisdom, or what would be the--

890
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,300
- Perception, to see him coming?

891
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,760
Well, you will just see him coming either way,

892
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,920
so it'll be like-- - Okay, then I pull out my knife.

893
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,240
- Pull out your knife.

894
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,080
- You have a knife?

895
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,920
- Oh you do, holy.

896
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:31,760
- I have a knife and brass knuckles.

897
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,000
- So you get up, you go to approach him and--

898
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,320
- I don't do that anymore.

899
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,160
- Okay.

900
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:36,980
(laughing)

901
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,080
- I'm actually, I pretend I'm going to him,

902
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,920
but then I like turn away at the last second.

903
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,740
- Where do you turn to?

904
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:44,800
- I go to the yearbook section and I look at all my--

905
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,040
- Why don't you rip it to show me how strong you are?

906
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,800
Then we can have a strength contest.

907
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,000
- I'm not listening to him, I'm lost in the yearbook.

908
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,840
- Lost in the yearbook.

909
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,080
(laughing)

910
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,840
- You're running your fingers over the pages.

911
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,840
- I started my essay and I wrote in big letters,

912
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,040
wrote "Dear Principal" and that's as far as I got.

913
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:03,000
- Okay, cool.

914
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,400
- And I put dot, dot, dot.

915
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,160
- Nice, I like that.

916
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,600
- I keep looking to the weird girl on the other side

917
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,160
and I keep kind of pointing to the boys around

918
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,000
and going like.

919
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,520
Like these guys are kind of crazy.

920
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,360
- Yeah.

921
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,240
- I think we're talking.

922
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,480
(laughing)

923
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,720
I say, "Hey."

924
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,120
- Hey.

925
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,960
- My name is Molly.

926
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:28,160
- My name is Molly.

927
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,760
What's your name? Molly.

928
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,840
Are you just repeating everything that I say? No, no.

929
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,480
Are you, are you, do you even go to school here? I've never seen you before.

930
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:48,160
Hey, there's what I'm talking to you. There's something over here.

931
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
I got to look at, you know, when someone talks to you,

932
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,440
you usually have to answer back and you have to like respond to them and be like

933
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,280
a normal person.

934
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,860
actually kinda cool

935
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,780
you like that

936
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,040
yeah i like it more than i like you

937
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,800
why are you being mean to me?

938
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,480
how am i being mean to you?

939
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,520
you wanna have a slut battle with me bitch?

940
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:12,880

942
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,240

944
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,240

00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,200

946
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,560
because it's it's a whole thing the last time you said that a lot

947
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,560
i had to do a whole thing

948
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,200
and i had to go through an entire... you had to apologize to the newspaper

949
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,360
no i had to

950
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,840
i had to take

951
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,560
i had to sue the newspaper

952
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,640
for saying that because you're crazy

953
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,360
so stop saying i'm gay with you

954
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,600
yeah i'm gay with the principal y'all

955
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,560
i can't do this

956
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:00,240
uh... i'm actually curious how that would even physically work

957
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,560
you have to stretch your book before you can put it

958
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,800
that's fast

959
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,600
uh...

960
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,320
uh...

961
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,180
but right back to the

962
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,880
no it's a little wider than that

963
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,880
i'll make the adjustment

964
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,800
i think that's a good

965
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,400
protractor

966
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,400
it's a perfect

967
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,840
i like that

968
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,880
and this would be the feces

969
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:31,520
not that's already gone

970
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,000
how do you get it out

971
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,360
the tube

972
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,960
what kind of to put his head is just a piece of water that you put in there

973
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,120
but he's a little bit of a lot of you through it

974
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,880
through a piece of water

975
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,960
to get some tokens

976
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:51,620
world what the fuck right diagram leading to the issue that i have been drawn a

977
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,240

983
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,400
one before i look at it you think i'll find it to be what

984
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,260

985
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:17,340

it could be anybody's butt, it's not particularly his

988
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,360
no look there's the freckle

989
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:28,500
i drew that when you weren't looking

990
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,440

991
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,740

You just try to try to write it this time. Oh, sorry. Yeah, you're amazing. I just get wait

Okay, I'm I guess I'm crying

00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,460
As he didn't like my essay. Why are you crying? That's my essay was crap. I got an F essentially

998
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:07,740
Well, he turned it down and I finished it and I did mathematics on it. So yeah, I'm crying

999
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,900
I'm doing push-ups

1000
00:40:10,900 --> 00:40:14,900
He didn't like my butthole

1001
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:23,860
I'm hugging him now

1002
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,420
I'll give you one more for that no more of that

1003
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:46,220
They both get tokens for that mm-hmm cuz they're good only cuz they're milk in it

1004
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,300
We need to get some tokens you guys need to get some time if you want tokens

1005
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,660
Maybe you you know talk like a normal person and you kind of be nice to me, okay?

1006
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:57,320
I had a suggestion earlier that you guys brushed off. What even is a slut battle. It's like

1007
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,380
Seriously, I started eating it like

1008
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:02,940
What are you eating?

1009
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,980
I'm trying to have a slut battle with you

1010
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,860
I'm not eating anything. I know there's no food in the air.

1011
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:14,620
She's eating pussy! No, I'm not. In the air? I've never done that before.

1012
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:18,180
She's eating the air's pussy. Why are you like on this guy's team? Like us girls kind of have to stick together

1013
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:21,300
if we want to get through this detention. He wants to stick us together

1014
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:25,980
in the slut battle, but I'm not gonna do that. You're not doing the slut battle, but you're sticking out your tongue

1015
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,540
and you're eating like ice cream in the air.

1016
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,380
Do something about it then. Why do you debase yourself like that?

1017
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:33,620
(mumbling)

1018
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,460
- Okay, I grab her tongue when she sticks it out.

1019
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,300
- Okay.

1020
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,140
- What are you doing?

1021
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,780
- I say, you need to stop it right now.

1022
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,100
You don't know who you're messing with.

1023
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,940
- Whoa, she's winning the sweat battle.

1024
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,060
(mumbling)

1025
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,220
- I can't even understand.

1026
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,300
- I start putting my tongue in and out of your hand.

1027
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,500
(mumbling)

1028
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,420
- I'm grabbing onto it and it's going into your mouth

1029
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,400
and I'm still holding onto it.

1030
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,820
My grip is so strong.

1031
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,140
- I bite her fingers off.

1032
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:58,180
- Roll unarmed attack.

1033
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:07,660

I don't want to hang out with these fucking dildos anymore.

1042
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,340
Can I go to them? I'm not going to try and run away to my rock locker.

1043
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:22,340
[Laughter]

1044
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:24,980
Before we go to that, what were you about to say?

1045
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:28,500
I was gonna say I take one of the LED light bulbs from the ceiling and I start

1046
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,580
eating the electricity.

1047
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:33,580
The electricity? The electricity. That's gotta give them a power.

1048
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,940
yeah yeah at least a token at the very it's created a token

1049
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,560
i feel that's a token

1050
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,760
i think that's like five tokens to be honest

1051
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,020
only me with the five tokens but it will say is you do have electric powers

1052
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:45,700
though

1053
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,260
haha

1054
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,900
you're gonna get plus three damage your tax and they're going to be electricity

1055
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,420
for us

1056
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,900
the

1057
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,500
uh... and i'd eat another one

1058
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,820
the

1059
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,740
okay plus

1060
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:02,740
one more plus four and that's a low

1061
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,060
okay great so we get we're gonna get another chance to go to our lockers

1062
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,340
right this is the only chance alright cuz i don't know what to bring i was in

1063
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:13,060
mind lockers is there any downside to sleeping speaking my locker not you get

1064
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,980
caught by the hall monitor so i'm about to review

1065
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,620
the review self

1066
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:18,900
you can't you have

1067
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,100
there usually around

1068
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,900
three or so all monitors between you and your locker

1069
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:26,140
and through your circle

1070
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:30,260
three or so corners you're gonna have to sort of sneak around to get there

1071
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:31,940
each of you guys do...

1072
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:35,940
fuck my ass you have abilities. I'm trying to do that to the principal and to the newspaper

1073
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,100
that can help out

1074
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:37,900
so

1075
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:41,460
to varying degrees you have dandruff which helps create a cloud that can kind of

1076
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,420
blind people

1077
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,900
oh wow

1078
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:44,940
uh...

1079
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:49,980
you have observation. She has black hair that's just all I have. I have observation

1080
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:54,660
what? I have observation. Observation which is sort of like a investigation but on steroids

1081
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:59,660
It allows you to actually understand a situation to the point where you can give people advantage

1082
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:05,300
on rolls, you can see the weakness in an enemy or a hall monitor.

1083
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,300
What do you have?

1084
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
What did I fuck you?

1085
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,300
I have charm.

1086
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:09,300
You have charm, yes.

1087
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,300
You have charm, so you can charm a hall monitor if you want to.

1088
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,980
So it's sort of like charisma, but on steroids, where if they fail a DC, they're trying to

1089
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:14,980
charm a person.

1090
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:15,980
Do the hall monitors have real weapons?

1091
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:16,980
Yeah.

1092
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,300
So they have guns and stuff?

1093
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,300
They have guns.

1094
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,420
Do they have batons?

1095
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,420
They have batons and guns.

1096
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,540
Do they have an axe on the other end of a sword?

1097
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:42,540
a

1098
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,540
Glock head.

1099
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:46,380
Yeah, they have the gun blade from FFA.

1100
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,700
Or a taser on a chain.

1101
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:48,700
What?

1102
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,700
A taser on a chain.

1103
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:50,700
You are running out of-

1104
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:51,700
They got like the-

1105
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:52,700
Swing it around.

1106
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,700
They have the Iron Man.

1107
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:54,700
Okay, okay.

1108
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:55,700
Alright, okay, okay.

1109
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:56,700
I'm not even gonna play along.

1110
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:57,700
What do you want?

1111
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:58,700
Iron Man suit.

1112
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,700
I'm not-

1113
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,700
You are electricity.

1114
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,700
I gave you electric powers for being a-

1115
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,980
A word I'm not gonna say.

1116
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:03,980
And my skin-

1117
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:04,980
No, it's not.

1118
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:05,980
I'm not gonna-

1119
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,980
My skin is blue from the electricity.

1120
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:07,980
Yo, yes.

1121
00:46:07,980 --> 00:46:08,980
That's pretty cool.

1122
00:46:08,980 --> 00:46:09,980
Yes.

1123
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:10,980
Yes.

1124
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:11,980
I go to the girls room-

1125
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:28,980
to

1126
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:49,540
are

1127
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:55,580
a little bit more creative. I pulled a fire alarm. That's creative. I'll give him a token.

1128
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,460
No because I took a crazy shit. I don't even get a token for that? I pulled a fire alarm

1129
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:05,660
because I thought the smell of her crazy shit was a fire. That's not, no. The token is for

1130
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:11,820
you, well it is for you guys working together, you do get tokens for that. But it is, it

1131
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:18,820
is

1132
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:23,400
it's important to look for a little water man

1133
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:24,360
the waterman

1134
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,160
the

1135
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,160
we all know what i think that

1136
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,660
the

1137
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:33,940
the

1138
00:47:33,940 --> 00:47:36,240
the water

1139
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,840
what i read about that it's about a hundred

1140
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:42,200
the principal of my trip to a bottle of

1141
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,480
uh...

1142
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,840
to leave c_u_

1143
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,920
as i'm taking my shit i try to hold molly's hand under the under the stall

1144
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,640
but

1145
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:54,240
i keep pulling it away but then at a certain point is give up and i kind of

1146
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,680
hold it

1147
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,440
but so i i

1148
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,360
but i put the fire alarm

1149
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,200
we'll see how i'm what you guys do that

1150
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,640
i'm paying in a stall

1151
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,760
yeah you heard that right

1152
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:05,760
Not at the urinal.

1153
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:07,760
Alright, so you want to pull the fire alarm.

1154
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,760
Yeah.

1155
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:09,760
Okay.

1156
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,760
So the hall monitors are scrambled at that point.

1157
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:13,200
Oh, I didn't need to do that.

1158
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,920
You're going to have advantage on sneaking past them, but you're also going to have to,

1159
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,960
I mean, you know, consequences are going to happen.

1160
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,720
So let's first start with that, see if you can get your drug.

1161
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:28,680
So start rolling a soccer check.

1162
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,440
That is an eight.

1163
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,640
your plus your soccer it's a nine minus roll you roll again you have a you know

1164
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:45,800
yeah I'd say I'm gonna take an eight you weren't caught by the hall monitor you

1165
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:50,800
are running around you pull the fire alarm you just sprint into one of them

1166
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:56,800
just like I did this on purpose because I want the attention well get back here

1167
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,640
No! Wait, yeah. What? Because I want the attention.

1168
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,040
Because I want the attention because I don't get paid attention to at home.

1169
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:15,040
Roll talking. Yo, real talk, that's sad. That is a 14. He's like, aww. And you get to run by.

1170
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:19,120
It's one roll of my iron dice. You've got two more. Okay, the two more in a row?

1171
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:25,920
Did you hear what I said before to the other guy?

1172
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,400
Yeah, this guy who doesn't see you yet goes, "Nope!"

1173
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,400
He's just looking around.

1174
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,400
"My dad hit me with a cigar!"

1175
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:38,880
He hit me with a cigar that was the size of his arm and it burned my whole skin off and

1176
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,880
I had to grow new skin.

1177
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:41,880
This was five years ago.

1178
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,880
Is that your soccer?

1179
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,880
I thought I was rolling talking.

1180
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:44,880
You're rolling soccer.

1181
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:45,880
Oh, then that is an 11.

1182
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,880
Oh, you're going to try to talk through all of them.

1183
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,880
Yeah, I talk through all of them.

1184
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:48,880
So that was a 13.

1185
00:49:48,880 --> 00:50:13,880
I

1186
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:19,560
the third one you can try saving him because i overheard him say that your finger in an outlet

1187
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:23,960
and then shoot and shoot you could travel you could tell me where to another outlet right right

1188
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:29,080
he could travel through electricity like mario like right in front i appear in front of the

1189
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:35,560
yeah you're like a jojo character yeah yeah you want to do that whoa whoa that's working together

1190
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:39,880
just roll a d20 tokens are destroying this one yeah

1191
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,200
would you get one

1192
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,200
you get lost in the electricity forever

1193
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,200
i'm in the electricity realm

1194
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:50,200
you get stuck in the wiring of the school

1195
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,200
and you take

1196
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:54,200
your fully lawnmower man

1197
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,200
and my face shows up on the tv in the hallway

1198
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,200
you only take one damage from that

1199
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,200
but you take one damage

1200
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,200
the big heart becomes six

1201
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,200
ok so i'm talking to the third lawnmower

1202
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,200
you see like an outlet nearby go

1203
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,200
and that's it

1204
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,200
you see his face just appear for like a split second

1205
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,460
(laughing)

1206
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:13,300
- Out.

1207
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:14,140
- Out.

1208
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:14,960
- Out.

1209
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,800
- Out.

1210
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:16,640
- World.

1211
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:17,460
- All right, cool.

1212
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,300
So yeah, you see the third eyelid monitor.

1213
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:22,060
He says, "You're not gonna charm me with your dad shit."

1214
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,200
- Nope, my friend just died in the outlet.

1215
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,580
(laughing)

1216
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:26,420
- Friend.

1217
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:27,240
- He's my friend now.

1218
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:28,080
- We're friends.

1219
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:29,520
- Roll, roll it.

1220
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,960
- Two.

1221
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,000
Am I seeing you two?

1222
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,840
- It's a three.

1223
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:35,660
- Okay.

1224
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,500
- Plus one.

1225
00:51:36,500 --> 00:51:37,320
- Oh, 'cause of the plus one?

1226
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:38,160
- Uh-huh.

1227
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:39,000
- He goes, "That's not your friend.

1228
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:39,920
That's a jock.

1229
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:40,760
You're a bully.

1230
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,480
>> Mm.

1231
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,840
>> [LAUGH]

1232
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,680
>> You just pulled out my knife.

1233
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:45,560
>> Holy shit.

1234
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,800
>> Okay, roll an attack roll.

1235
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,320
Roll a d20.

1236
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:49,680
>> Three.

1237
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,880
>> Okay. >> Jesus, I never, you just blew.

1238
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:52,400
>> Whiff.

1239
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,040
>> God damn it.

1240
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,240
>> And then this guy is gonna hit you back with his baton.

1241
00:51:57,240 --> 00:51:58,400
>> And he misses.

1242
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,800
>> Okay, I'm gonna swing again.

1243
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,160
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we're gonna do here.

1244
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,400
>> Okay, 14 plus.

1245
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,160
>> That hits.

1246
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:05,720
>> 13.

1247
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:06,360
>> Roll for damage.

1248
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,480
It's 1d10, I believe.

1249
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,640
>> 1d10.

1250
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,800

1251
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,800
- Three.

1252
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,160
- Plus soccer.

1253
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,000
- Okay.

1254
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,100
- So that's a two.

1255
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:15,940
- Okay, cool.

1256
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,760
- You go, "Aah!"

1257
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,680
You slice him.

1258
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,280
You have a chance to grab it to your locker now.

1259
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,560
- Okay, I'm gonna do that.

1260
00:52:20,560 --> 00:52:21,400
- Okay, cool.

1261
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:24,280
You do, you get your wee, your drug.

1262
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,740
- It is fentanyl.

1263
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,080
(laughing)

1264
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:29,920
- What?

1265
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,760
- It's a pound of fentanyl in my locker.

1266
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:33,240
- I got a token for trying to help.

1267
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,200
- All right!

1268
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,040
- Cool.

1269
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,640
- Hey man, I heard you called me your friend back there.

1270
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:41,300

Hold on, I don't know how to save him! I just have to operate!

1276
00:52:58,520 --> 00:53:02,800
He's cutting open Waterman! It's just like biology class!

1277
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,800
and i'm going to get out of here

1278
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800

1279
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,800

1280
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800

1281
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800

1282
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,800

1297
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,680
I'm really hurt right now. Is anyone?

1298
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,480
Ow!

1299
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,480
Yeah, we all at the same time go, "Ow!"

1300
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:03,680
Token!

1301
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,680
That trip to the bathroom really took a lot out of me.

1302
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:10,180
Um, is there anyone who maybe has a token who could like,

1303
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,680
maybe help me out? 'Cause I'm like, kind of low-key on the brink of death right now.

1304
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,180
You're acting like a whore.

1305
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:19,180
Hey, what are you gonna do for the token? Suck all the guy's dicks at the same time?

1306
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,180
Alright!

1307
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,180
Wait, that would be the ultimate act of friendship you see.

1308
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:24,680
I guess that might work.

1309
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:27,680
(laughter)

1310
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:28,680
What say you, nerd?

1311
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,680
I've never even considered something like that before, but I guess I didn't care that much.

1312
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,680
She did so well!

1313
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,680
(laughter)

1314
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:37,680
Alright, this big, dumb me had bust through.

1315
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:40,680
It's the gym teacher, Coach Scoot Marino.

1316
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:41,680
It's my boy.

1317
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:42,680
And he comes in.

1318
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,680
I don't wanna see him.

1319
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,680
What's up, Emilio?

1320
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,680
What's up, Coach?

1321
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,680
I'm under my desk.

1322
00:54:46,680 --> 00:54:47,680
Alright, that's it.

1323
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,680
It's time for dodgeball.

1324
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,680
You guys need to get your exercise in detention.

1325
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,680
I pretend to be a book.

1326
00:54:52,680 --> 00:54:57,680
I pretend to be a dodgeball and they go "Oh wait, no!"

1327
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:00,680
Somebody get that book with dandruff out of here!

1328
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:03,680
Alright, it's gonna be 2v2 for the rest of you.

1329
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,680
Coach, I have powers now.

1330
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,680
That is amazing, you're gonna crush it.

1331
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:12,680
Alright, who's team? Who's on what team?

1332
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:15,680
I choose him, I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him, I want him.

1333
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:17,680
No, no, no, no.

1334
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,680
He's on my team.

1335
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,680
He gets to choose the book.

1336
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,680
Alright, I want you four to fight this book.

1337
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:28,680
Alright, so it's one side with the book.

1338
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:30,680
How many balls are there?

1339
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:32,680
How many balls? Infinite.

1340
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,680
Infinite?

1341
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:34,680
Infinite.

1342
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,680
Ok, I win the whistleblows.

1343
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:36,680
I've got an idea.

1344
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,680
Is it going to be 2v2 or is it actually you four versus the book?

1345
00:55:38,680 --> 00:55:41,680
I mean, it can't be 2v2. There's five of us.

1346
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,680
Unless you're a book.

1347
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:45,680
But I want the reward.

1348
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,680
I know there's a reward here.

1349
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,680
I know that somebody's going to get tokens.

1350
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,680
I have 4 HP.

1351
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,680
i've been for really at the beginning of the whistle and i grab as many balls as i

1352
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,300
can bring them back to my side regardless of what you want

1353
00:55:56,300 --> 00:56:00,140
okay so the point of dog was not to get as many balls of possible but we have a

1354
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,880
question we have a lot of people we put all the balls together and then alexa

1355
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:05,920
electrocutes them and we make ball man

1356
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,200
the i'll tell you all ball manny's

1357
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,800

the i'm afraid i thought i was like a great design connects the atoms to get

1359
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:18,920
I'm like, guys, I don't think I like a ball man.

1360
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,920
I'll be on whatever team.

1361
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:21,920
Wait, wait, wait.

1362
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,920
Attack the coach!

1363
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,920
Yeah, we all start throwing balls at the coach.

1364
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:26,920

1431
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:09,740

1432
00:59:09,740 --> 00:59:13,660
along finally i thought they were all on the same page

1433
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:16,860
it's kind of like you just always take it to this new level where you like need to

1434
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,340
lash out and need to be violent for some reason

1435
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:24,540
wait this is great i like to hear this i have a feeling that

1436
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:28,940
bender actually does evil things like blowing up the nerd's dog

1437
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:29,940
with an M80.

1438
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:32,100
(laughing)

1439
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,540
- Well that's-- - And that is just cruel.

1440
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:34,860
- That would be pretty easy to confirm,

1441
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:35,900
we could just ask the nerd.

1442
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,140
- Yeah, wait, I don't know--

1443
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:38,780
- Hey nerd, has your dog ever,

1444
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:41,700
has anything cruel or crazy ever happened to your dog?

1445
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:43,860
- No, my dog lives on a farm upstate now.

1446
00:59:43,860 --> 00:59:46,940
- Hmm, why don't you do the math on that one, buddy?

1447
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,340
And why don't you-- - Okay.

1448
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:49,180
- He loves math. - 300 miles.

1449
00:59:49,180 --> 00:59:50,540
- Don't tell him to do that.

1450
00:59:50,540 --> 00:59:52,380
- Three and a half hours. - He's gonna be there all day.

1451
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,620
- Do you happen to live by the bus stop

1452
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:56,820
where you get off at?

1453
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:58,740
- Yeah.

1454
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:01,500
- And have you ever gone to the bus stop with like an M80

1455
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:03,980
and maybe done some damage to like a dog?

1456
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:06,340
- Leave me alone, I don't even know about this.

1457
01:00:06,340 --> 01:00:07,420
- Just answer.

1458
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,500
Maybe just say the truth for once in your life.

1459
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:11,860
- I'm just gonna back out of the room.

1460
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:13,940
This seems not about me.

1461
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,380
- Wait, do I get points if I admit to it?

1462
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:17,900
- Let's see.

1463
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,300
- Why don't you just for once in your life,

1464
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:20,800
just say something that's real.

1465
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:23,400
- Okay, that actually isn't true.

1466
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,020
That was just a rumor.

1467
01:00:26,140 --> 01:00:29,140
who's making up rumors about you you freak

1468
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:31,020
probably the nerd

1469
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:34,860
i don't know how do you say this about him i've never heard of principal sullivan

1470
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:40,660
for making me say that he's gay in the newspaper or i said that he was gay

1471
01:00:40,660 --> 01:00:42,560
stop saying i'm gay

1472
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:46,700
you're gay with me in the news

1473
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,500
i think no matter what you two have something that you need to work out i did

1474
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:54,260
not blow up your dog with an m80 i thought an m80 was a computer code

1475
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:58,580
computer and if i if it wasn't a computer code you would actually like

1476
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,980
that so

1477
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:03,420
i feel like you would like that it was a science experiment so i think that maybe

1478
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,620
we can

1479
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:07,620
get past this you know bender for the first time you're actually making some

1480
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,660
sense

1481
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:11,420
and you're actually sounding like you're like a real human being and not some

1482
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:13,700
freakazoid who wants slap battles okay

1483
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:15,540
so

1484
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:19,780
you're putting the work in right now girl maybe if you realize that like

1485
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:22,700
being cool like this is actually kinda cool and you don't have to be like be a

1486
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:29,220
bad guy. I think that's okay because I think that's allowed in the 80s. It's allowed in

1487
01:01:29,220 --> 01:01:37,540
the 80s? Thanks for telling me that! My token now. Alright. That's the round. I cash in

1488
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:42,460
my three tokens. Alright, we'll wait to see how much damage you're going to take. I think

1489
01:01:42,460 --> 01:01:46,700
I'm going to die. Two. Okay, I cash in all four of mine. I'm going to cash in mine too.

1490
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:49,700
Yeah, I'm also going to cash in mine. You can only cash in the amount that you're subtracted

1491
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,700
from you.

1492
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:51,700
You're not going to gain health back.

1493
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,700
Ok, I'll cash in two to stop two.

1494
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,020
Ok, I guess I'll cash in two to stay at the same health.

1495
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:57,420
Ok, I also cash in two.

1496
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,420
Me too.

1497
01:01:58,420 --> 01:01:59,420
Me too.

1498
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,420
I'm afraid of the health.

1499
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,420
2017.

1500
01:02:01,420 --> 01:02:02,420
I'm a let's play.

1501
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,420
I'm a let's play.

1502
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:04,420
I can go pee.

1503
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,420
Yeah, you can go pee.

1504
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,420
It's lunch time!

1505
01:02:06,420 --> 01:02:07,420
Exercise is over.

1506
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:08,420
What do you guys have for lunch?

1507
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:09,420
What's going on?

1508
01:02:09,420 --> 01:02:15,860
I didn't even bring lunch because my parents wouldn't pack me one and I do not have any

1509
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,860
money to even get myself lunch because I'm so fucking poor and my dad abuses me.

1510
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:29,860
Yeah. I ate a bowl of guacamole. I'm eating a paper sandwich. It's just a truck.

1511
01:02:29,860 --> 01:02:33,860
Alex, what are you eating? I'm drinking oil.

1512
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:42,860
Wait a second, because I actually heard a, I don't see that he's doing that yet.

1513
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,940
and i i turned to to we're going to go

1514
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,500
i heard recently and i don't know i'm telling you this

1515
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:50,100
i heard that actually

1516
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:52,380
that milio drinks oil

1517
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:55,220
i heard a rumor that he drinks oil. That can't be true!

1518
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:02,220
I feel like it's not true. And then I look over and we look over and we see it.

1519
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:09,700
Out of a hamster water bottle.

1520
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:14,060
that could be anything that i could be a little bit of a santa but i'm not loyal

1521
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:18,540
and it has a rainbow sheen it does look a lot like a little while ago i noticed

1522
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:22,100
you know that they forgot i know you forgot that there's was the two-fold you

1523
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:26,180
have to follow someone true for some for some reason classically and there isn't

1524
01:03:26,180 --> 01:03:28,140
too large

1525
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:30,940
well you would be a fortune model

1526
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,900
the yeah i think that has won the year

1527
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:36,680
that's right

1528
01:03:36,680 --> 01:03:38,580

and I had a right I that turned to one round you get double double tokens for

1533
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,700
that can turn to just in

1534
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:57,400
at home a rumor yeah her if I do fentanyl I get double tokens

1536
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,620
double tokens for that round I do it

1537
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:07,280
by defend not only do it if you want to be ready to defend it all with waterman

1538
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,780
and we lost waterman we didn't get any tokens.

1539
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,780
Is that what you did?

1540
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,940
You used it up, you ruined the whole smoking weed scene.

1541
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:22,260
We still got a little left. We should delete that.

1542
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:26,580
That's what I said. We need the fentanyl. You're supposed to all do it together and that's when we cry.

1543
01:04:26,580 --> 01:04:29,100
How did waterman OD then?

1544
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:33,620
He just became a pot of love. We loved him too much.

1545
01:04:33,620 --> 01:04:39,940
Yeah, sorry. Sorry everyone who was so excited about Waterman ODing.

1546
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:41,940
Damn it!

1547
01:04:41,940 --> 01:04:43,940
Can I turn to Molly and tell her?

1548
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:45,940
Yeah, for sure.

1549
01:04:45,940 --> 01:04:54,940
Yo, I heard that, uh, because he's talking about his dad, apparently his dad's brother, his uncle, is Bender from Futurama.

1550
01:04:54,940 --> 01:04:56,940
So he's actually half robot.

1551
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:03,300
That's really crazy. Do you think that that maybe impacts his like his brash

1552
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:07,140
behavior and like the way that he acts like towards other people maybe?

1553
01:05:07,140 --> 01:05:10,140
Scanning, scanning, scanning.

1554
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,140
Should we say something to him?

1555
01:05:12,140 --> 01:05:14,140
I'm hearing a rumor about myself.

1556
01:05:14,140 --> 01:05:18,140
Hey, hey, I slide my oil across.

1557
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:26,140
There's a half robot. I never would imagine there's a half robot person around us and it was not the guy who's drinking oil and also has electricity powers.

1558
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:32,260
Hey buddy, I know how you feel.

1559
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:36,580
You drink oil and you have electricity powers.

1560
01:05:36,580 --> 01:05:37,580
And then we go like...

1561
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:38,580
Why is this happening?

1562
01:05:38,580 --> 01:05:48,340
I'm like looking around to see if anyone's staring at me and then I just pick up the oil

1563
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:51,060
and just chug it.

1564
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:55,240
And then he throws the can back to me and I catch it and I eat the can.

1565
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,920
The rest of the can.

1566
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:57,920
That's friendship right there.

1567
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,920
That's two robots.

1568
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:00,560
Do I get one for confiding in the secret?

1569
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,560
No.

1570
01:06:01,560 --> 01:06:02,560
No you don't.

1571
01:06:02,560 --> 01:06:04,560
Hey buddy, while you're talking to me.

1572
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,160
I don't want to talk anymore.

1573
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,160
Keep it in the mic, keep it in the mic, before you spend that.

1574
01:06:08,160 --> 01:06:13,720
Excuse me, I want to remind you guys that if you spend, if you save your rumor, fuck,

1575
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,640
if you save your rumor or your...

1576
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:18,120
I think the principal is drunk.

1577
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,860
(laughter)

1578
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,860
- Guys, I see the person was drinking in his office.

1579
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:24,220
- If you're rumored, a reason for going to detention

1580
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:28,580
for when you have zero health, you then can come back.

1581
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:29,420
- Oh.

1582
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:30,340
- So if you spend all your rumors,

1583
01:06:30,340 --> 01:06:32,180
and you spend your reason for detention,

1584
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:33,820
you can't come back.

1585
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:35,260
So there are other ways, I just wanna make sure that you--

1586
01:06:35,260 --> 01:06:36,780
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, can I still, I--

1587
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:37,620
- Do it, do it, do it.

1588
01:06:37,620 --> 01:06:39,900
- I've heard some things about you,

1589
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,380
and I was just wondering--

1590
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:44,020
(laughter)

1591
01:06:44,020 --> 01:06:46,620
You know, you seem like a really great guy right now,

1592
01:06:46,620 --> 01:06:47,460
and you're like--

1593
01:06:47,460 --> 01:06:48,460
I appreciate that.

1594
01:06:48,460 --> 01:06:51,900
You're acting cool and you're really standing up for like the gals in here, which like we

1595
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,140
kind of need that right now.

1596
01:06:53,140 --> 01:06:55,040
I was raised.

1597
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:59,340
Have you like maybe heard anything about me going around here?

1598
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:03,540
Just like maybe any information about like kind of where I'm, what you heard about me

1599
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:04,540
maybe or like something?

1600
01:07:04,540 --> 01:07:05,540
No.

1601
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:06,540
Hey, remember when this bitch turned into a book?

1602
01:07:06,540 --> 01:07:11,260
Remember when this bitch turned into a book?

1603
01:07:11,260 --> 01:07:12,620
I didn't turn into a book.

1604
01:07:12,620 --> 01:07:14,620
I was acting a little bit like a book.

1605
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,620
Honestly, my perfect woman would be a book.

1606
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:16,620
I'm gonna be a book.

1607
01:07:16,620 --> 01:07:17,620
She can't read.

1608
01:07:17,620 --> 01:07:18,620
What?

1609
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:19,620
What did you just say?

1610
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:25,300
This bitch can't even read, she turned into a being a disguised disabled.

1611
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:28,060
Hey bro, some people have learning disabilities.

1612
01:07:28,060 --> 01:07:29,300
I don't have a learning disability.

1613
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:30,300
I have a learning disability.

1614
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,300
Can you read?

1615
01:07:31,300 --> 01:07:32,300
That's why I'm 27.

1616
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:33,300
I do too, I can't get an erection.

1617
01:07:33,300 --> 01:07:34,300
In two more years.

1618
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,300
In two more years I'm 27?

1619
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,300
Whoa.

1620
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,100
You should try out for the volleyball team, bro.

1621
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,180
Sullivan the frog is asking me if I can't read?

1622
01:07:44,180 --> 01:07:46,720
no security

1623
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:47,980
i can read

1624
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:51,660
that's okay and that's fine i never learned how to read i got a book for you

1625
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,140
and he's in the bloods

1626
01:07:53,140 --> 01:07:55,020
uh...

1627
01:07:55,020 --> 01:07:58,060
like that one's not like what my hand over my mouth

1628
01:07:58,060 --> 01:07:59,900
and i think that i'd like to

1629
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,460
and the electricity like covers

1630
01:08:01,460 --> 01:08:03,860
covers your mouth no thank you

1631
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,940
and it goes to my braces and it kills me

1632
01:08:06,940 --> 01:08:08,140
the uh...

1633
01:08:08,140 --> 01:08:10,260
uh...

1634
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:11,940
What do you have for lunch, nerd?

1635
01:08:11,940 --> 01:08:12,940
I have a paper sandwich.

1636
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:13,940
A paper sandwich?

1637
01:08:13,940 --> 01:08:17,620
That is not going to fill you up, mate.

1638
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:20,100
It's four slices of bread, so it's a lot.

1639
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,940
There's no bread in it.

1640
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:24,260
Four slices of bread and then paper in between.

1641
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,260
It's a triple-decker paper sandwich.

1642
01:08:26,260 --> 01:08:27,260
That sounds good.

1643
01:08:27,260 --> 01:08:28,260
A club?

1644
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:29,260
What kind of paper?

1645
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:30,260
A super club?

1646
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:32,780
It has a toothpick in it, yeah.

1647
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:34,260
What kind of paper is it?

1648
01:08:34,260 --> 01:08:35,260
Book paper.

1649
01:08:35,260 --> 01:08:38,260
Yeah, well, I said it.

1650
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:40,260
Whoa, what's happening?

1651
01:08:40,260 --> 01:08:42,260
No, we never use a rumor.

1652
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:44,260
I know. I used it.

1653
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,260
You only have one left, motherfucker.

1654
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,260
It's easy for me to have all three of mine.

1655
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:50,260
Have you guys heard about the AIDS epidemic that's happening in the 80s right now?

1656
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:52,260
[laughter]

1657
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:54,260
It's kind of scary.

1658
01:08:54,260 --> 01:08:56,260
Wait, that's happening in the 80s right now?

1659
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:58,260
Right now? I haven't even heard it.

1660
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:00,260
Wait a minute, I'm gay with the principal!

1661
01:09:00,260 --> 01:09:02,260
That's why I brought it up, bro.

1662
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,260
These two should be quite worried. I think that I don't have a problem.

1663
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:06,260
Oh, shit.

1664
01:09:06,260 --> 01:09:09,060
Yeah. I'm just glad it's not true.

1665
01:09:09,060 --> 01:09:11,660
And you got a red microphone too.

1666
01:09:11,660 --> 01:09:13,660
And you're wearing red.

1667
01:09:13,660 --> 01:09:15,660
What does that have to do with it?

1668
01:09:15,660 --> 01:09:17,660
'Cause AIDS is in blood, idiot.

1669
01:09:17,660 --> 01:09:19,660
It's in his blood cells, slut.

1670
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,860
Do you have a problem with me?

1671
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,060
Yeah, I have a problem with you.

1672
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,660
Okay, I swing a punch at her.

1673
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,660
Oh my god, he's swinging a punch.

1674
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:27,660
Slut that out!

1675
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:29,660
Roll a d20.

1676
01:09:29,660 --> 01:09:33,660
I just try to pin her down so she can stop this.

1677
01:09:33,660 --> 01:09:34,660
Oh yeah!

1678
01:09:34,660 --> 01:09:35,660
15.

1679
01:09:35,660 --> 01:09:36,660
15 minus 3, 12.

1680
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:37,660
You got a 1?

1681
01:09:37,660 --> 01:09:38,660
Yes.

1682
01:09:38,660 --> 01:09:39,660
17.

1683
01:09:39,660 --> 01:09:40,660
Okay, yeah.

1684
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,660
So you try to pin her down and you...

1685
01:09:41,660 --> 01:09:42,660
Oh, but I have minus 1, so 16.

1686
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:43,660
But she still... you still win.

1687
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:44,660
She tries to pin you down, you guys are like, "Oh."

1688
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:45,660
According to my calculations, you will not be able to pin her down at all.

1689
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,660
It's already happening.

1690
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:47,660
I pin you back down the other direction.

1691
01:09:47,660 --> 01:09:48,660
Okay, I try to not get pinned.

1692
01:09:48,660 --> 01:09:49,660
I roll a d20, both of you.

1693
01:09:49,660 --> 01:09:50,660
I'm going to pin you back down.

1694
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:51,660
I'm going to pin you back down.

1695
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:52,660
I'm going to pin you back down.

1696
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:53,660
I'm going to pin you back down.

1697
01:09:53,660 --> 01:09:54,660
I'm going to pin you back down.

1698
01:09:54,660 --> 01:09:55,660
I'm going to pin you back down.

1699
01:09:55,660 --> 01:09:57,940
not be able to pin her down at all.

1700
01:09:57,940 --> 01:10:00,980
I pin you back down the other direction.

1701
01:10:00,980 --> 01:10:04,740
Okay, I try to not get pinned.

1702
01:10:04,740 --> 01:10:08,140
One. Oh, you're fucked.

1703
01:10:08,140 --> 01:10:10,300
Fourteen. Even if she got a one.

1704
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:12,700
Yeah, you pin her down very easily.

1705
01:10:12,700 --> 01:10:17,500
What are you going to do? You going to hit me? I'll probably lick your big boobs.

1706
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:21,580
I start doing the robot. Yeah, we both start doing the robot.

1707
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:24,820
Oh!

1708
01:10:24,820 --> 01:10:28,900
They're huge. How'd you get boobs so big? Did you get a boob job? No,

1709
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,860
this is just naturally. This is how I came. I don't even know.

1710
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,140
I just look at my body in the mirror one day and it looked like this.

1711
01:10:33,140 --> 01:10:36,180
How old were you when you got your boobs? I have no idea.

1712
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:44,500
That's a token. That's that's that passed the Bechtel test, bro.

1713
01:10:44,500 --> 01:10:45,980
That's a fuzz reel.

1714
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:52,740
And lunch is over.

1715
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,460
Yeah, I stopped pinning her down.

1716
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:56,340
I got my--

1717
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:59,500
I took a peek.

1718
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:00,820
Three damage, all of you.

1719
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:03,140
OK, I'm using two tokens.

1720
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:04,380
I'm using two--

1721
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:05,660
Yeah, I'm using three.

1722
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,180
Wait, is it better to use my tokens

1723
01:11:07,180 --> 01:11:10,140
or should I kind of operate from the death?

1724
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,620
I'm going to use my two tokens.

1725
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:12,780
I'm also going to use my--

1726
01:11:12,780 --> 01:11:15,180
I used three to take no damage.

1727
01:11:15,180 --> 01:11:16,660
I won't use my tokens yet.

1728
01:11:16,660 --> 01:11:18,140
No, no, no, no, no.

1729
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,060
You misunderstand.

1730
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:23,020
You can only use your rumor or your detention.

1731
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,020
You can't use your tokens in death.

1732
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:30,460
Come on, Bender. You're smarter than this, bro.

1733
01:11:30,460 --> 01:11:32,060
No, actually I don't understand.

1734
01:11:32,060 --> 01:11:34,860
So your tokens are spent to reduce the roll...

1735
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:35,580
Until you die.

1736
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:38,940
...or to boost your roll in game.

1737
01:11:38,940 --> 01:11:41,100
And I'll use them, so now I'm at 3 HP.

1738
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:44,220
So if you're not boosting any of your rolls, you're better off just spending them.

1739
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:44,700
Okay.

1740
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:47,020
It's a flaw in the mechanic. I'm testing out this game.

1741
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:48,140
Thank you for playtesting.

1742
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:53,220
HP now from four because I gave you three tokens. Well what?

1743
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:58,220
We took three - you would take zero damage nothing changes if you give him three tokens

1744
01:11:58,220 --> 01:12:04,020
You're taking the damage no matter what well no if you give three tokens it reduces it was three damage right?

1745
01:12:04,020 --> 01:12:09,060
Yeah, so you take you took no zero you nothing changes, so don't erase anything nothing. I have one token back

1746
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:12,420
Why

1747
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:17,340
So now you take one day. Okay, so now you take three yeah, or no you take one. That's what I meant to do

1748
01:12:17,460 --> 01:12:19,460
I'm strategizing

1749
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:22,260
Where my sheets your Charlie's toilet?

1750
01:12:22,260 --> 01:12:24,900
What are your sheets? I had?

1751
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:32,780
Paper the effing toilet papers is it those papers you know that's a scrap. Oh, I see them in your backpack easily

1752
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:35,300
I easily saw them

1753
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:46,500
Farts and baths yeah, it sounds like something that you may be good at we're like beats by dad

1754
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,500
That's at home.

1755
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:50,500
You take a piece of paper.

1756
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:52,500
Some of you it's going to be my fault.

1757
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,500
Is this mine or is this?

1758
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:58,500
I thought the higher quality paper was like depending on our characters.

1759
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,500
No it just happens.

1760
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
Thank you Principal Solomon.

1761
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,500
I want to say this because I'm a teenager.

1762
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,500
I'm playing a teenager in the 80's.

1763
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,500
I get a pencil and a piece of paper

1764
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:10,500
and immediately

1765
01:13:10,500 --> 01:13:12,500
and I don't condone this

1766
01:13:12,500 --> 01:13:14,500
but this is something that a teenager in the 80's would do.

1767
01:13:14,500 --> 01:13:20,060
80s would do. Swastika. Just immediately drew a swastika. That's fine. Feel free to take

1768
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:27,780
markers. Ms. Snooze Pulebo the art teacher comes in. What? Ms. Snooze Pulebo. Joe you

1769
01:13:27,780 --> 01:13:33,260
got too many markers I didn't get one. Bitch. Why does this slut get all the markers? She

1770
01:13:33,260 --> 01:13:40,620
arrives wearing a foppish frock under a stinky smock and she gestures to each of you. Now

1771
01:13:40,620 --> 01:13:46,020
Now I understand that each of you has done something wrong, and art can be wrong too.

1772
01:13:46,020 --> 01:13:47,780
Yeah, look at this!

1773
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,340
Do you see that?

1774
01:13:49,340 --> 01:13:50,340
He drew a swastika.

1775
01:13:50,340 --> 01:13:51,340
Does that scare you?

1776
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:52,340
Do it in real life.

1777
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:53,340
It's not scary.

1778
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:54,340
Why are you so afraid to do it?

1779
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:55,340
You're in character.

1780
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:56,340
I'm not good at it.

1781
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:57,340
You have to do it.

1782
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:58,340
All search inside yourselves.

1783
01:13:58,340 --> 01:13:59,340
Joe's good at it.

1784
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,340
Joe's really good at it.

1785
01:14:00,340 --> 01:14:01,340
Yeah, Joe, you draw one.

1786
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:02,340
He draws the best one in the group.

1787
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,340
You're the one who doesn't, though.

1788
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:04,340
You're the one who's doing it.

1789
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:05,340
Yeah, but you draw it and I'll hold it up.

1790
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,340
It's not true to my character.

1791
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:07,340
I would never do it.

1792
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:08,340
Do it backwards.

1793
01:14:08,340 --> 01:14:12,660
it backwards so it's the piece one. I don't even know which way is forward. Boys, boys.

1794
01:14:12,660 --> 01:14:19,140
Choose to either paint, do clay sculpture or collage. So you guys, you guys have the

1795
01:14:19,140 --> 01:14:25,620
time right now to draw. Draw your art. That's some good radio. I'll help out. I'll make

1796
01:14:25,620 --> 01:14:31,580
it worth it. I'll make it worth it. Give a speech. So she's walking around, she's trying

1797
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:37,100
to observe all of your art. She's asking each of you what you're drawing. She goes up to

1798
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:38,380
you first, Bender.

1799
01:14:38,380 --> 01:14:40,380
Uh, Bender, what are you drawing?

1800
01:14:40,380 --> 01:14:42,380
I'm drawing my dad beating the fuck out of me!

1801
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:44,380
I... well...

1802
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:46,380
Why are you drawing that?

1803
01:14:46,380 --> 01:14:58,380
'Cause I get my ass kicked every single day by a piece of shit and he sucks so badly that it makes me think that it's the only thing that I can think of.

1804
01:14:58,380 --> 01:15:00,380
[laughter]

1805
01:15:00,380 --> 01:15:02,380
Well...

1806
01:15:02,380 --> 01:15:04,380
And it makes me hate my life completely.

1807
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:07,500
Well, you don't have to just draw him, you can draw the feeling.

1808
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:10,340
I'm drawing him and he's getting buttfucked.

1809
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,860
Well, okay, well what makes you happy, Bender?

1810
01:15:12,860 --> 01:15:14,860
My dad getting buttfucked.

1811
01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:20,100
Okay, the nerd, Brian, what are you drawing for me today?

1812
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:23,460
I'm drawing a picture of her drawing her picture.

1813
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:27,500
And I'm adding just measurements and statistics and mathematical calculations.

1814
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,060
Why do you always think so rigidly?

1815
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:32,380
Why are we so mathematically?

1816
01:15:32,380 --> 01:15:42,700
because I'm smart. Touche. And you are Emilio. I drew me and all my new friends together

1817
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:49,580
in the electrical currents. Because I made so many friends here at the Tension and now

1818
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:56,660
I have electric powers. That's so lovely. Which one is you? That's me in the middle.

1819
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:57,580
okay

1820
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:58,840
and then that's

1821
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:00,100
that's bender

1822
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:04,380
and that's a weird girl. You should face it towards the camera. And then that's

1823
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,140
uh... molly and her red hair

1824
01:16:07,140 --> 01:16:11,460
and that's the nerd that's you. Ah you look great. And these are the...

1825
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:16,820
This is representative of my damn feelings and my soul. Show everyone the camera.

1826
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:20,540
This is what I feel like after my dad beats the crap out of me. It's actually kind of a

1827
01:16:20,540 --> 01:16:22,580
cool drawing.

1828
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:23,980
It sucks.

1829
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:25,320
I suck!

1830
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:26,320
No, don't say that.

1831
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:27,320
Oh no!

1832
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:29,980
Oh no, the art is working again.

1833
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:33,980
The art, it's hurting him!

1834
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:34,980
That is cool.

1835
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:35,980
What about you, weird girl?

1836
01:16:35,980 --> 01:16:40,980
I drew the big stinky shit that I took earlier in the toilet.

1837
01:16:40,980 --> 01:16:44,980
Alright, you gotta toast it for that.

1838
01:16:44,980 --> 01:16:47,980
Smells like markers, not like the shit I had.

1839
01:16:47,980 --> 01:16:50,480
And finally, Ms. Molly.

1840
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:55,280
I was drawing my eyes like rolled back into my head and I like couldn't really

1841
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:03,340
control my body and I was just drawing out something and you know and I was

1842
01:17:03,340 --> 01:17:06,220
moving so fast and like my pen was moving quicker than like you could

1843
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,080
possibly humanly imagine and I don't even know what I drew but when I look at

1844
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:18,440
it I gasp and I and I start to breathe heavy

1845
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:20,440
I think she's orgasming.

1846
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:22,440
She just came all over my face.

1847
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,440
She just hands free nutted.

1848
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,440
I sit under her pants. I push it away from myself.

1849
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:28,440
And the room stinks. What is this?

1850
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:34,440
I grab it and I'm looking at the drawing and I'm going,

1851
01:17:34,440 --> 01:17:39,440
"Oh my goodness, this paper is approximately 8.5 by 11 inches in diameter."

1852
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,440
Wait. Wait a second. I know this story.

1853
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,440
You traded identities with a Girl Scout in the woods, didn't you?

1854
01:17:48,440 --> 01:17:49,440
What?

1855
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,440
That's a rumor I heard.

1856
01:17:50,440 --> 01:17:52,440
How'd you even hear about that?

1857
01:17:52,440 --> 01:17:54,440
I heard it from the janitor.

1858
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:56,440
The janitor? Is the janitor here right now?

1859
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,440
The janitor is in the game.

1860
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,440
So yeah, we'll have him show up I guess now.

1861
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:03,440
Yeah, you see walking by, Eric, the janitor.

1862
01:18:03,440 --> 01:18:05,440
Hey kids, what's going on?

1863
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,440
Yo, what up, boy?

1864
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,440
Eric, tell Molly what you told me about her.

1865
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:11,440
And her... what happened to her body.

1866
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:14,080
Weird girl, I told you that in confidence man.

1867
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,080
How do you even find that stuff out about me?

1868
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:21,080
Well you go around drawing this in every fucking art class you take, people are gonna get the idea.

1869
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:22,080
It happens to me.

1870
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,580
So it did happen to you.

1871
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:26,580
I go in the garbage man, I see all kinds of stuff.

1872
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:31,080
I know and you see every single time she discards one of these drawings.

1873
01:18:31,080 --> 01:18:36,080
It's okay Molly, I switch bodies with a Girl Scout too, but I switch back immediately.

1874
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:39,400
okay

1875
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,120
maybe it did happen to me

1876
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,760
and maybe it's hard to

1877
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:47,160
kinda you know wrap my head around it but like... bender going ham on his art right now

1878
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:51,720
IT'S MY FATHER!

1879
01:18:51,720 --> 01:18:55,440
I can't even see him as a normal person because he beats the shit out of me

1880
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:57,400
you see him as a green and black guy

1881
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,600
see him as an army man

1882
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,920
he's irish and african

1883
01:19:03,920 --> 01:19:05,920
The black Irish, they say.

1884
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:08,240
Alright.

1885
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,080
Well, it seems like this really helped some of you come to terms with things.

1886
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,080
I'm still shaking.

1887
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:16,120
There, there. I say there, there.

1888
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,120
Who were you before?

1889
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,320
Admit it, you were a porn star.

1890
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:22,760
Why would you even...

1891
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,600
That's why she's so good at slutting out.

1892
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,160
That's why she shows her tits all the time.

1893
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:27,320
I'm not good at slutting out.

1894
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,520
You made me do that. You pinned me down.

1895
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:29,960
I didn't make you do anything. I pinned you down.

1896
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:31,720
You showed your huge tit.

01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:35,340

1907
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:01,120
I don't know, I just was like trying to figure out...

1908
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,620
I put... okay, you want the details?

1909
01:20:02,620 --> 01:20:03,120
Yeah.

1910
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:05,860
I put his cock in my pussy.

1911
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:07,780
Is that what you want me to say?

1912
01:20:07,780 --> 01:20:08,640
Damn!

1913
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:11,820
I put the goldfish's cock inside my pussy.

1914
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:14,600
That's what you want me to say?

1915
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:15,360
I'm turning beet red.

1916
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:17,600
I'm embarrassed even hearing this.

1917
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:18,160
And I like it!

1918
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:21,000
Where is the goldfish right now?

1919
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:22,760
It fucking died!

1920
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,800
[Laughter]

1921
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,520
What do you think?

1922
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:29,080
You think a goldfish can survive that?

1923
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:32,200
It's like a bee with its stinger it dies. Did you break the chair Alex?

1924
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,200
No my jacket got caught.

1925
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:36,200
Oh.

1926
01:20:36,200 --> 01:20:38,200
That's how the goldfish died.

1927
01:20:38,200 --> 01:20:40,200
Yes. The goldfish died that way.

1928
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
He died happy though.

1929
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,200
I guess at least he had experience pleasure.

1930
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:46,200
Most goldfish go their entire lives

1931
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,200
of fucking a human-ish woman.

1932
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:50,200
And I saw this in the bathroom.

1933
01:20:50,200 --> 01:20:52,200
Where it happened.

1934
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
You weren't in the bathroom.

1935
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:56,200
I was hanging out in the girls room.

1936
01:20:56,200 --> 01:21:01,960
out in the girls room. Pervert alert, pervert alert, he hangs out in the girls room. Okay,

1937
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:09,960
okay, settle down, settle down. And he does that. What is that pissing shit? Is that why

1938
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:17,800
you always draw the turd in the water? I ate the turd. Nice. This is, okay, to be honest,

1939
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:23,480
this was his final resting place. The turd? In the shit? I took his shit and then I fucked

1940
01:21:23,480 --> 01:21:25,480
and then I died and I flushed the man.

1941
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,480
You did that during the bathroom break?

1942
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,480
When I was protecting you?

1943
01:21:30,480 --> 01:21:32,480
No, that was for a different time.

1944
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:34,480
The rumor went around.

1945
01:21:34,480 --> 01:21:36,480
Fast work, that rumor.

1946
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:40,480
Did you fuck the fish and then you ate it and then you pooped the fish?

1947
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,480
What?

1948
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,480
Yes.

1949
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:45,480
Is that what was making Arby's noises in the bathroom?

1950
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:46,480
Yes.

1951
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:48,480
It was Samuel.

1952
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:49,480
I thought I could smell that.

1953
01:21:49,480 --> 01:21:51,480
Samuel the salmon in your shit.

1954
01:21:51,480 --> 01:21:52,680
- It's a salmon.

1955
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:54,680
- And did you then run to the bathroom

1956
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:57,480
and put the poop inside the tank of the fish

1957
01:21:57,480 --> 01:21:59,480
so it seems like the class pet is still there?

1958
01:21:59,480 --> 01:22:00,320
(laughing)

1959
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,280
Yes, and then tomorrow when everybody notices,

1960
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:03,920
I'll say, "It's a water snake."

1961
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,960
(laughing)

1962
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:06,840
- Oh my God.

1963
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,120
- I find water snakes really fascinating.

1964
01:22:08,120 --> 01:22:08,960
- It's a male.

1965
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:10,240
- I was really excited.

1966
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,560
- The problem is, is you can see the fish bones

1967
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:13,640
through this shit.

1968
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:17,160
- Okay, wait, I have an idea.

1969
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:18,000
- What?

1970
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,080
- This fucking weird jock guy who has had a bone--

1971
01:22:20,080 --> 01:22:21,040
- He's the weirdest one of all of us.

1972
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:21,880
- He is weird.

1973
01:22:21,880 --> 01:22:22,720
(laughing)

1974
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:23,840
- He has electric powers.

1975
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,280
- This guy, ever since he used the electric powers

1976
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:27,880
these two times, he's kind of just been like

1977
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:29,520
pulsating with energy.

1978
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,560
I've been noticing this pulsating with his energy so much.

1979
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:37,560
And I think we could maybe get him to go make the fish.

1980
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,360
- Or we could trap him in a battery.

1981
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,720
(laughing)

1982
01:22:40,720 --> 01:22:42,320
- It's, oh, our class is over.

1983
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,480
Time for a bathroom break.

1984
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,080
And first time to take some damage.

1985
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:47,680
- Did we make a breakthrough there?

1986
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,960
Did we all get tokens?

1987
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,520
- You got a shit ton more tokens, see that?

1988
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,920
- Did you guys hit a lot? - I only got one.

1989
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:55,420
- Did we get a breakthrough? - You didn't do enough breakthroughing.

1990
01:22:55,420 --> 01:22:57,420
- How much damage? - How much damage?

1991
01:22:57,420 --> 01:22:59,420
- Four. - Oh!

1992
01:22:59,420 --> 01:23:01,420
- Four?! - Wait, I'm dead.

1993
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:03,420
- Me too. - What do we do?

1994
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,420
- Wait, oh wait.

1995
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:08,420
- Can I give you one of my rumors? Is that what it is?

1996
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:11,420
- You can start to admit, yeah, you have to admit to more rumors.

1997
01:23:11,420 --> 01:23:14,420
- I'm gonna give my three so I don't die.

1998
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:16,420
- I'm alive. - So I'm at one.

1999
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:19,420
- Wait, I have to admit to rumors, but I, I,

2000
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:21,760
all my rumors have already been talked about.

2001
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:23,080
- You can talk about the rumors you have.

2002
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:23,920
- Oh, okay.

2003
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,180
- Those are what you can cash in.

2004
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,020
- Okay.

2005
01:23:26,020 --> 01:23:28,520
- Wait, I have one, so I have three things.

2006
01:23:28,520 --> 01:23:31,420
I need to then do two more rumors on top of that.

2007
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:32,620
- Wait, wait, no, the rumors--

2008
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:33,460
- Sorry, let me explain.

2009
01:23:33,460 --> 01:23:35,780
When you hit zero, your rumor gets you back

2010
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,940
to automatically half health if you have a rumor to spend

2011
01:23:37,940 --> 01:23:39,220
or a pension to spend.

2012
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:40,060
However--

2013
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:40,880
- These are the rumors?

2014
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:41,720
It's not our own?

2015
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:43,620
- Yeah, no, it's not your own, it's not your own, sorry.

2016
01:23:43,620 --> 01:23:45,180
It's the rumors that are in your hands.

2017
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:46,780
- Oh, actually, can I take back my tokens

2018
01:23:46,780 --> 01:23:48,460
and die instead and use my thing?

2019
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:49,300
- Yeah, absolutely.

2020
01:23:49,300 --> 01:24:04,300
is

2021
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:08,660
right now when I may yes wait I have a question about the yeah sure if I if it's

2022
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:12,700
negative for dive one it's not a good for just goes to zero and then okay but can

2023
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:16,520
I just use one token then and live still be either rumored attention the tokens

2024
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,500
are only so I'm just gonna hold on my tokens are like to mitigate harm okay and

2025
01:24:20,500 --> 01:24:28,780
the rumors and the detention help you just like okay yeah so I'm gonna be some

2026
01:24:28,780 --> 01:24:35,740
admitting. Yeah. I'd like to. You guys are walking to the bathroom. Some of you hit

2027
01:24:35,740 --> 01:24:41,900
zero so you're feeling so fatigue. I'm kind of like floating over the ground. We were walking to the bathroom. Guys, I had, I want to tell you

2028
01:24:41,900 --> 01:24:53,300
something. You're floating with your electricity powers. And I'm like, speak. And I form a microphone. Guys, I know I seem like the

2029
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:59,540
happiest, coolest guy in the school, but things aren't always easy for me.

2030
01:24:59,540 --> 01:25:04,500
Actually, this, the reason I'm in detention, you wouldn't even believe if I told you,

2031
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:10,220
but so I shouldn't tell you, but I'll tell you basically what happened was I got an F

2032
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:15,380
in my lunch period and it was lowering my GPA by almost a huge amount.

2033
01:25:15,380 --> 01:25:18,060
And my parents, they were going to kill me.

2034
01:25:18,060 --> 01:25:19,500
You guys don't know how it is.

2035
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:20,620
Your parents are great.

2036
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:21,980
My parents are so mean.

2037
01:25:21,980 --> 01:25:23,980
You talking about idiot my dad piece of shit

2038
01:25:23,980 --> 01:25:27,340
My parents are so mean they're always like you have to do your best and stuff like that

2039
01:25:27,340 --> 01:25:29,620
so I basically

2040
01:25:29,620 --> 01:25:34,460
It's hard for me to admit this and honestly would help me to admit this if I could smoke a little phenanyl first

2041
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:37,020
Yeah

2042
01:25:37,020 --> 01:25:39,020
Do you have aluminum foil and a pen?

2043
01:25:39,020 --> 01:25:41,020
I have aluminum foil right here

2044
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,020
I take out my pen

2045
01:25:43,020 --> 01:25:45,020
Can you flatten it out?

2046
01:25:45,020 --> 01:25:47,020
No

2047
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:49,020
Woah

2048
01:25:49,020 --> 01:25:51,020
We're gonna smoke up in the bathroom together

2049
01:25:51,020 --> 01:25:58,020
the

2050
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:00,980
and basically i tried to kill myself

2051
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:05,500
the

2052
01:26:05,500 --> 01:26:07,660
brought to school

2053
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,660
dancing robot

2054
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:10,700
like size

2055
01:26:10,700 --> 01:26:12,100
and i put

2056
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,700
with my ankles and one is one hand and my neck and the other and based on his

2057
01:26:16,700 --> 01:26:19,580
dance where it was like

2058
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,580
He was gonna snap my spine.

2059
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,580
Wait a second.

2060
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:24,580
But...

2061
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:25,580
Hold on.

2062
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:30,580
The dancing robot did not succeed in killing me and instead it created a party in the hallway.

2063
01:26:30,580 --> 01:26:34,580
And that is the reason I'm in detention today is for starting a party.

2064
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:38,580
And that very dancing robot, my friends, is in my locker.

2065
01:26:38,580 --> 01:26:40,580
Right now.

2066
01:26:40,580 --> 01:26:42,580
5 HP.

2067
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:47,580
Did he tell you to bite his shiny metal ass at any point?

2068
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:51,180
No, he is a dancing robot, not a wisecracking robot.

2069
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:53,900
Does he like beer and smoking?

2070
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,380
No, he likes dancing.

2071
01:26:55,380 --> 01:26:58,420
Okay, then it's not my uncle.

2072
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:59,740
Can I ask you a question, nerd?

2073
01:26:59,740 --> 01:27:00,740
Shutting it down.

2074
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:01,740
Yes, affirmative.

2075
01:27:01,740 --> 01:27:02,740
Affirmative.

2076
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:07,540
Was this robot Blorbtron 3000?

2077
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:09,720
Yes.

2078
01:27:09,720 --> 01:27:10,720
So it's my mom.

2079
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:14,940
Some people have been saying that my mom is Blorbtron 3000.

2080
01:27:14,940 --> 01:27:16,660
Oh, has she been missing lately?

2081
01:27:16,660 --> 01:27:18,660
Because she's in my locker. Yeah

2082
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:26,420
You're so brave for that you're so

2083
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:32,840
Honestly, I don't feel very brave. I feel like a field mouse. No, you're so brave and I walk over to him

2084
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:36,300
And I gets down

2085
01:27:36,300 --> 01:27:44,500
Yeah, I

2086
01:27:46,060 --> 01:27:50,620
I shoot my electricity into the AV room and all the cameras come on and start filming.

2087
01:27:50,620 --> 01:27:59,340
That's fun. I go up, I unzip the iZods, I unbutton them, I pull them down. I knew it!

2088
01:27:59,340 --> 01:28:06,300
You have a heart-shaped pube. What? Who told you about that? The janitor.

2089
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:13,260
Hey guys, this is me, Eric, again. I thought I told you not to tell anybody about that!

2090
01:28:13,260 --> 01:28:15,260
I told you that because I thought it was cool!

2091
01:28:15,260 --> 01:28:17,260
Weird girl!

2092
01:28:17,260 --> 01:28:19,260
It's the second secret I told you that you just...

2093
01:28:19,260 --> 01:28:21,260
Why do I keep telling you shit?

2094
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:23,260
Hey Eric, check this out.

2095
01:28:23,260 --> 01:28:25,260
Why do we hang out so much?

2096
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:27,260
I just start...

2097
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:29,260
Oh he's smoking jello.

2098
01:28:29,260 --> 01:28:31,260
See I'm the coolest character.

2099
01:28:31,260 --> 01:28:33,260
I get it man.

2100
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:35,260
I get you kids.

2101
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,260
AHHHHH!

2102
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:39,260
AHHHHH!

2103
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:41,260
I'm back to 5 HP.

2104
01:28:41,260 --> 01:28:44,600
- Ron, did you admit you did your rumor, right?

2105
01:28:44,600 --> 01:28:46,540
- I said, "Hey, Bozo, give me some of that."

2106
01:28:46,540 --> 01:28:47,800
- Oh yeah, I'm also at five.

2107
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:48,780
- Yeah, you're at five.

2108
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:49,620
- Did a rumor.

2109
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:50,380
- Okay, well you maybe think this

2110
01:28:50,380 --> 01:28:52,220
Blorb Throne Tron 3000 thing is so crazy,

2111
01:28:52,220 --> 01:28:53,360
and I heard about that before too,

2112
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:54,940
but I didn't even want to say anything.

2113
01:28:54,940 --> 01:28:56,380
- Thank you for not saying anything.

2114
01:28:56,380 --> 01:28:58,080
- Because I'm trying to protect my friends

2115
01:28:58,080 --> 01:28:59,980
who seem to have my back.

2116
01:28:59,980 --> 01:29:01,320
But while we're doing this,

2117
01:29:01,320 --> 01:29:03,500
did you know that Emilio actually has a girlfriend

2118
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,140
who goes to a different school?

2119
01:29:05,140 --> 01:29:05,980
(gasps)

2120
01:29:05,980 --> 01:29:08,220
(laughing)

2121
01:29:08,220 --> 01:29:09,740
- I just, I just, I just--

2122
01:29:09,740 --> 01:29:10,580
- You can't.

2123
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:15,580
Yeah, I faint. I swoon and I faint.

2124
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:16,580
No!

2125
01:29:16,580 --> 01:29:22,080
I'm smacked. There's so much glass and blood all over my fists right now.

2126
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:28,580
He's been using his electric powers and he's been charming the ladies in this room and the principal and the two boys.

2127
01:29:28,580 --> 01:29:30,580
And he hasn't even told us that he has a...

2128
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:34,580
I have glass in between all the webs of my neck.

2129
01:29:34,580 --> 01:29:35,580
Is it true?

2130
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:39,580
I'm on campus on the ground and I'm doing the thing that dogs do where they run in their sleep.

2131
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,580
(laughing)

2132
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:42,420
- Is it true?

2133
01:29:42,420 --> 01:29:44,180
Do you have a girlfriend that goes to a different school?

2134
01:29:44,180 --> 01:29:46,340
- Are you going steady with another chick?

2135
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:47,180
- No.

2136
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:48,020
(gasps)

2137
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:48,860
- It's a lie.

2138
01:29:48,860 --> 01:29:49,680
- Whoa.

2139
01:29:49,680 --> 01:29:50,520
- I bolt away.

2140
01:29:50,520 --> 01:29:51,420
(gasps)

2141
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,180
- Guys, it's not true.

2142
01:29:53,180 --> 01:29:54,020
- I dreamed it.

2143
01:29:54,020 --> 01:29:56,500
- Thank God, 'cause that's the craziest thing I've ever heard.

2144
01:29:56,500 --> 01:29:59,760
- You guys, I'm losing a lot of blood in my veins right now.

2145
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:01,420
- Why did you lie?

2146
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:02,700
- 'Cause I wanted everyone to think

2147
01:30:02,700 --> 01:30:04,900
that I've lost my virginity.

2148
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:05,740
- Damn.

2149
01:30:05,740 --> 01:30:06,560
- Wait.

2150
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:07,400
- Wait, you're a virgin?

2151
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:08,240
I've had sex like a thousand times.

2152
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:09,060
(laughing)

2153
01:30:09,060 --> 01:30:10,700
- Yeah, I had sex with a principal.

2154
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:13,260
- We've all had sex 5,000 times.

2155
01:30:13,260 --> 01:30:14,460
- So I had to make it up, man.

2156
01:30:14,460 --> 01:30:16,060
I just wanted you to think I was cool.

2157
01:30:16,060 --> 01:30:17,900
- Because in my world, the nerd is cool.

2158
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:19,660
- And the jock is lame.

2159
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:20,500
And that's how I perceive the world.

2160
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:21,340
- Is that why it's like an electric world?

2161
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:23,380
- That's what it's like in the electric realm.

2162
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:24,380
Everything's the opposite.

2163
01:30:24,380 --> 01:30:25,380
- I guess that makes sense.

2164
01:30:25,380 --> 01:30:27,300
- Wait a minute, you have electricity.

2165
01:30:27,300 --> 01:30:29,260
I now have Wolverine claws.

2166
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:31,320
(laughing)

2167
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,020
- You're like going spotty vision.

2168
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:38,180
- We should kill the principal.

2169
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:53,180
to

2170
01:30:53,180 --> 01:30:57,180
i'm like losing three damage i'm going to cash in my tokens

2171
01:30:57,180 --> 01:31:00,840
three damage i'm not cashing in any tokens

2172
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:06,520
i'm taking it to the face, three damage to the face

2173
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:09,820
because why the fuck not?

2174
01:31:09,820 --> 01:31:15,140
wait is it better, the tokens are points or the HP is points?

2175
01:31:15,140 --> 01:31:20,780
which makes us win

2176
01:31:20,780 --> 01:31:24,900
also going to get you. This is the last round of tension. You still take damage at the end

2177
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:31,900
of it. I'm going to admit my reason for being here. What's up? The problem is I'm losing

2178
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:37,740
a lot of blood from my fists and I smoked a bunch of fentanyl. Are you all smoking fentanyl

2179
01:31:37,740 --> 01:31:44,740
now? Is this it? Yeah. You're all lighting up fentanyl now. You're hanging out in the

2180
01:31:44,740 --> 01:31:49,940
library. You guys. Oh wait, you didn't get your dancing robot. We got him. Wait did we

2181
01:31:49,940 --> 01:31:54,180
go to the bathroom a second time? Well we just never get snuck to my locker, should we? Let's

2182
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:59,460
get him. It's my mom! Let's do this! Can I say my thing so that I don't die? Before you do your thing,

2183
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:04,580
before you do your thing, don't worry about your damage right now. Okay. Let's do, cause this was

2184
01:32:04,580 --> 01:32:09,220
in the bathroom. We're a retcon, go back to you sneaking to go get your room. And maybe they can

2185
01:32:09,220 --> 01:32:14,340
help me sneak if they want to have a dance party in the end of detention. Okay, cool. Oh I do the,

2186
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:18,500
I do the light, my electricity to the light so it's dark so the hall monitors can't see. I love

2187
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,900
- That's a great idea, you're gonna get a token for that.

2188
01:32:21,900 --> 01:32:23,060
Okay, cool.

2189
01:32:23,060 --> 01:32:25,180
- There's another hall monitor and I go in front of him

2190
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:26,180
and I purse my lips.

2191
01:32:26,180 --> 01:32:27,260
- Use your charm.

2192
01:32:27,260 --> 01:32:28,100
- I use my charm and I purse.

2193
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,660
- So they're gonna roll against your DC.

2194
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,480
- What's that?

2195
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:32,320
- They fail.

2196
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:33,460
- And I use my observe.

2197
01:32:33,460 --> 01:32:35,660
- They're charmed by you, what do you want them to do?

2198
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:39,060
- I go like this, ooh, and then I kind of wave my finger

2199
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,340
and I'm walking down the hallway.

2200
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:42,180
- Oh boy.

2201
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:43,000
- And I go.

2202
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:43,840
- They just like start walking towards you.

2203
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:46,140
- And I keep doing a walk and I go, ooh,

2204
01:32:46,140 --> 01:32:47,860
and then they're doing the same walk behind me.

2205
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:53,140
And I use my observe to notice that and I get a boner.

2206
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:57,860
I take a photo of it and then I show the hall monitor and I say, "Oh, you're trying to fuck

2207
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,480
a kid!"

2208
01:32:59,480 --> 01:33:00,780
The hall monitors are also kids.

2209
01:33:00,780 --> 01:33:01,780
Oh, they are?

2210
01:33:01,780 --> 01:33:02,780
Why do they have guns and batons?

2211
01:33:02,780 --> 01:33:03,780
Yeah.

2212
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:04,780
I thought they were grown men.

2213
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:05,780
They're cool kids.

2214
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:06,780
That's why I killed them.

2215
01:33:06,780 --> 01:33:07,780
You didn't kill them.

2216
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:08,780
Oh, I killed one of them.

2217
01:33:08,780 --> 01:33:09,780
Or stabbed one of them.

2218
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:10,780
You stabbed one of them, that's fine.

2219
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:11,780
I thought they were grown men.

2220
01:33:11,780 --> 01:33:12,780
Why would, why, you're a child.

2221
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:13,780
Why would stabbing an adult be okay?

2222
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:14,780
Yeah, well you can't go to jail.

2223
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:15,780
Actually, no, I'm a grown man.

2224
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:17,780
I'm a grown man.

2225
01:33:17,780 --> 01:33:18,780
Oh, you are grown.

2226
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:20,780
Yeah, that's why I'd stab him.

2227
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:21,780
Oh well.

2228
01:33:21,780 --> 01:33:23,780
Roll stealth.

2229
01:33:23,780 --> 01:33:26,780
With advantage, you only have to roll once now.

2230
01:33:26,780 --> 01:33:27,780
I would say.

2231
01:33:27,780 --> 01:33:28,780
Where's my die?

2232
01:33:28,780 --> 01:33:30,780
Between your charming and your... what did you do?

2233
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:32,780
I guess we're just going to retcon that.

2234
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:34,780
Can I observe too as well?

2235
01:33:34,780 --> 01:33:36,780
You can observe as well.

2236
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:38,780
Alright, so that's balance ball?

2237
01:33:38,780 --> 01:33:39,780
Yeah, no, no, balance ball.

2238
01:33:39,780 --> 01:33:42,780
I thought I was about to die and I don't know what's happening at all.

2239
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:44,780
You can observe first to try to learn about...

2240
01:33:44,780 --> 01:33:48,380
I get plus three actually because of the star, right?

2241
01:33:48,380 --> 01:33:54,540
Yes. You should roll sneak balance ball twice, but you can roll your observe once to see if

2242
01:33:54,540 --> 01:33:57,100
you can learn something about it to reduce your rolls.

2243
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:59,340
Okay, I'm going to start out with observe.

2244
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:02,340
I can't even with you right now. I farted.

2245
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:04,220
That's 14. You did not fart.

2246
01:34:04,220 --> 01:34:10,500
You learned that one of the hall monitors is afraid of dandruff.

2247
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:11,620
I had a fart earlier.

2248
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:35,980
of

2249
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:38,480
odds of this go to hate dandruff

2250
01:34:38,480 --> 01:34:41,740
well it happens so i want to present

2251
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:42,500
europe

2252
01:34:42,500 --> 01:34:44,440
okay now i see only once now

2253
01:34:44,440 --> 01:34:47,060
and with advantage to the lights are off

2254
01:34:47,060 --> 01:34:50,500
okay that's six

2255
01:34:50,500 --> 01:34:54,620
and in nineteen you got your dancing robot you got my open i open my locker

2256
01:34:54,620 --> 01:34:59,100
and immediately disco ball lights are coming up with a lot of her eyes on

2257
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:00,980
there's not a lot of you

2258
01:35:00,980 --> 01:35:02,980
and then we uh...

2259
01:35:02,980 --> 01:35:07,780
- Wait, I run to my locker and I get what's in my locker too

2260
01:35:07,780 --> 01:35:08,880
while the distraction's happening

2261
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:10,500
and I run to the store across the street

2262
01:35:10,500 --> 01:35:11,860
and I buy White Claw.

2263
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:13,140
- Okay, cool.

2264
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:13,980
- Okay.

2265
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:14,800
- You got a bunch of White Claw in the AC.

2266
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:15,820
- So we have it.

2267
01:35:15,820 --> 01:35:17,020
- And then, all right.

2268
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,340
- I get my frog, I guess.

2269
01:35:18,340 --> 01:35:19,220
- You get your frog.

2270
01:35:19,220 --> 01:35:20,060
- Yeah.

2271
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:21,260
- Well, I have the fentanyl already,

2272
01:35:21,260 --> 01:35:23,780
so I think we're all set to have the final part.

2273
01:35:23,780 --> 01:35:25,100
- And then I go to my locker too.

2274
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:25,940
- You get your baseball bat.

2275
01:35:25,940 --> 01:35:27,440
- I get my baseball bat.

2276
01:35:27,440 --> 01:35:30,340
- Okay, you're back in the library now.

2277
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:32,540
- Okay, but I was dying, right?

2278
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,540
'Cause I have a new hero.

2279
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,940
You don't have time to do your thing.

2280
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:40,540
Okay, I'm losing all the blood, I have Wolverine claws of glass in my fingers 'cause I punched

2281
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:43,340
the mirror after finding out that he...

2282
01:35:43,340 --> 01:35:44,340
Had a fake girlfriend.

2283
01:35:44,340 --> 01:35:45,340
Had a fake girlfriend.

2284
01:35:45,340 --> 01:35:49,260
You should have just waited two minutes.

2285
01:35:49,260 --> 01:35:52,420
White as a sheet, and I'm standing there like...

2286
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:56,220
'Cause the fentanyl and the blood loss, and I'm just like...

2287
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:57,220
Yo!

2288
01:35:57,220 --> 01:35:59,940
Let me just say one thing real quick.

2289
01:35:59,940 --> 01:36:00,940
Okay?

2290
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:01,940
Speak your truth.

2291
01:36:01,940 --> 01:36:12,940
I may be the most abused kid at school. Clearly. I may be a bit of a jerk sometimes.

2292
01:36:12,940 --> 01:36:14,940
What do you think fentanyl does?

2293
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:16,940
It's the blood loss.

2294
01:36:16,940 --> 01:36:18,940
It makes you kind of homo-sensitive.

2295
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:24,940
No, it's the blood loss and I can't, but I'm only alive just based on the pain killer.

2296
01:36:24,940 --> 01:36:26,940
Oh, okay, okay, okay, I'm sorry.

2297
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:31,940
So, I'm just gonna come out and say it.

2298
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:35,080
- What?

2299
01:36:35,080 --> 01:36:35,920
- I--

2300
01:36:35,920 --> 01:36:36,820
- What is it?

2301
01:36:36,820 --> 01:36:39,380
- There was a bomb explosion

2302
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:45,940
of boogers and jizz and poop and throw up and pee.

2303
01:36:45,940 --> 01:36:48,580
- Wait, I heard a rumor about this.

2304
01:36:48,580 --> 01:36:49,900
- In the teacher's lounge.

2305
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:55,900
And yes, it was actually, it's not a rumor

2306
01:36:55,900 --> 01:36:59,020
that that was an explosion

2307
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:03,620
it was true and you did it okay i did it

2308
01:37:03,620 --> 01:37:07,320
but only because i wanted to eat all the proven that he has said that the in the

2309
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:11,260
bookers because i don't get food at home and it's only thing i know how to eat

2310
01:37:11,260 --> 01:37:15,500
you only know you don't know why so you know what you didn't have lunch did you

2311
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,180
no

2312
01:37:16,180 --> 01:37:20,060
quickly to have a little bit of food let's test this with the other characters

2313
01:37:20,060 --> 01:37:22,100
paper

2314
01:37:22,100 --> 01:37:26,200
but it's not a fool anybody know that's what he's picking that's the way you

2315
01:37:26,200 --> 01:37:27,940
get the radio your frog

2316
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:31,120
here really only had real food you have a lot of only

2317
01:37:31,120 --> 01:37:34,760
yeah i can only have some to prove that i'm right more than one of the car

2318
01:37:34,760 --> 01:37:37,340
payment of what the police are today's that it looks brown

2319
01:37:37,340 --> 01:37:38,140
picture here

2320
01:37:38,140 --> 01:37:42,460
here i really want to score completely i'd take your frog a dip it in and give

2321
01:37:42,460 --> 01:37:44,560
it to them

2322
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:48,060
i was gonna fuck that

2323
01:37:48,060 --> 01:37:49,220
it

2324
01:37:49,220 --> 01:37:50,060
it

2325
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:51,780
i can't eat it

2326
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:54,420
also cameron invented a new type of pencil

2327
01:37:54,420 --> 01:37:56,860
the

2328
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:57,860
well

2329
01:37:57,860 --> 01:37:59,220
it

2330
01:37:59,220 --> 01:38:02,180
that's not true guys

2331
01:38:02,180 --> 01:38:06,900
and i think that the pencil it's absurd pencil perfect mathematically perfect

2332
01:38:06,900 --> 01:38:09,280
are we dancing or what

2333
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,260
that's what i want to run a lot

2334
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:13,460
uh... okay

2335
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:16,620
she's dancing but that rumor was not true i just want to clarify it's

2336
01:38:16,620 --> 01:38:19,060
basically impossible to invent a new type of pencil

2337
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:22,180
is that affect pencil and a mechanical pencil it's pretty much a pencil the

2338
01:38:22,180 --> 01:38:23,060
sword on it

2339
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:26,140
that's not even a pencil they can shoot no more you know either way i didn't

2340
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:29,700
invent any of those it's a false rumors to don't spread that any i go up to

2341
01:38:29,700 --> 01:38:34,780
alex's robot mom and i open up my circuit of the way and then her boobs come out

2342
01:38:34,780 --> 01:38:36,500
and she shoots a little

2343
01:38:36,500 --> 01:38:38,180
uh... i think

2344
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:41,540
only after that and it brings him back to life

2345
01:38:41,540 --> 01:38:44,140
i mean you know

2346
01:38:44,140 --> 01:38:45,780
and he's got a full h_p_

2347
01:38:45,780 --> 01:38:49,460

and that's my glass door

2366
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:41,160
- Damn!

2367
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:42,560
- You know, looks can be deceiving,

2368
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,560
and what you're doing now is actually kind of cool,

2369
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,120
and not like a nerd.

2370
01:39:46,120 --> 01:39:49,360
- Wow, you're the last guy in school to me now.

2371
01:39:49,360 --> 01:39:50,200
- Oh!

2372
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,560
- But honestly, you say that now,

2373
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:54,320
but like tomorrow, if I came into school

2374
01:39:54,320 --> 01:39:57,280
and I had a glass door, you'd probably kill me.

2375
01:39:57,280 --> 01:39:59,800
- The thing is, I've been acting a certain way in school,

2376
01:39:59,800 --> 01:40:01,560
like every single day, like when I see you guys,

2377
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,880
I act like I'm like, don't even know you and stuff.

2378
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:04,840
- Like a slut.

2379
01:40:04,840 --> 01:40:06,960
- But I think it's because I like low-key

2380
01:40:06,960 --> 01:40:09,680
don't actually even know who I am myself.

2381
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:16,320
What's gonna happen tomorrow when I wake up and I go to work at Blockbuster?

2382
01:40:16,320 --> 01:40:20,080
Am I ever gonna see you kids again?

2383
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:21,080
What?

2384
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:22,880
Honestly, I'm not a kid.

2385
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:24,880
I think we've established this.

2386
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:29,480
This is my last day on earth before I enter the electricity realm for good.

2387
01:40:29,480 --> 01:40:31,600
Wait, can I come with you?

2388
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,280
I heard nerds are cool in the electricity world.

2389
01:40:34,280 --> 01:40:35,600
I heard a rumor.

2390
01:40:35,600 --> 01:40:37,360
And then I give the nerd powers.

2391
01:40:37,360 --> 01:40:39,360
Oh my god, I get powers.

2392
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:41,360
Kiss the nerd on the lips.

2393
01:40:41,360 --> 01:40:45,360
But seriously, will you kids come into the blockbuster I work at?

2394
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:47,360
I will go to blockbuster.

2395
01:40:47,360 --> 01:40:49,360
I'm going to be real with you guys, I do not go to this school.

2396
01:40:49,360 --> 01:40:50,360
Oh wow.

2397
01:40:50,360 --> 01:40:52,360
I just wanted to come here and kind of hang out.

2398
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:55,360
I was stuck on the back of your car for a couple days.

2399
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:57,360
Oh, is that why you're dressed all in white?

2400
01:40:57,360 --> 01:41:00,360
I thought there was supposed to be a goth girl here and maybe that's why.

2401
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,360
Because I thought it was weird you're dressed all in white, you have white hair.

2402
01:41:02,360 --> 01:41:03,360
I tripped her.

2403
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:07,360
I opened the closet, the janitor closet.

2404
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,720
the head of the head

2405
01:41:09,720 --> 01:41:12,720
dead

2406
01:41:12,720 --> 01:41:13,600
she's

I should. You have electricity powers now. Roll d20. Okay.

2488
01:44:19,440 --> 01:44:27,280
I'm writing your name on here like electro like an electro man or something.

2489
01:44:27,280 --> 01:44:30,560
Wait no no just roll on the table. Yeah roll on the table. It only counts if it's on the table.

2490
01:44:30,560 --> 01:44:36,400
Uh eight. Eight does not hit. So your electricity

2491
01:44:36,400 --> 01:44:40,320
shoots out from your fingertips and courses around.

2492
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:44,320
But it creates, oh it creates like a cyclone around it.

2493
01:44:44,320 --> 01:44:45,320
It certainly does.

2494
01:44:45,320 --> 01:44:46,320
I've got a 14.

2495
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:47,320
I've got a 14.

2496
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:48,320
You did?

2497
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:49,320
Pat.

2498
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:50,320
Pat?

2499
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:51,320
Alright, you're up man.

2500
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:58,520
Alright, I am going to, so I have a brick of fentanyl.

2501
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:02,800
I'm going to blow it in their face.

2502
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:05,720
That would be, what's it called?

2503
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:10,280
And then can I blow the thing and then go at them with my brass knuckles?

2504
01:45:10,280 --> 01:45:16,160
knuckles. Oh yeah, no no no. My brass knuckles with my Wolverine claws. Oh yeah, you'll add

2505
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:21,400
plus two to damage. So you blow at them. I'm gonna go P. They're gonna have lower their

2506
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:27,680
AC. Go. Okay. Well I got a seven. Alright, it's not gonna be that low. But you still

2507
01:45:27,680 --> 01:45:31,480
do something cool. They go "Ah, ah!" It gets in their eyes, right? The way they're moving

2508
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:36,760
around, it's still somehow, it's almost like it accidentally worked out where the way they

2509
01:45:36,760 --> 01:45:40,060
they were moving around from like getting the fentanyl in their face allowed them to dodge

2510
01:45:40,060 --> 01:45:44,060
your attacks. It was just like an unfortunate thing. But they are sort of like blinking,

2511
01:45:44,060 --> 01:45:45,940
they're kind of in trouble there.

2512
01:45:45,940 --> 01:45:46,940
You're up.

2513
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:47,940
Um, I...

2514
01:45:47,940 --> 01:45:48,940
You got the 8 right?

2515
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:49,940
Huh?

2516
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:50,940
You got the 8 right?

2517
01:45:50,940 --> 01:45:52,780
Yeah. I'm going to use, I guess my dandruff.

2518
01:45:52,780 --> 01:45:55,620
Alright, they're going to have to roll against that.

2519
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:56,620
Okay.

2520
01:45:56,620 --> 01:45:58,540
So that makes them blind and lowers their attacks.

2521
01:45:58,540 --> 01:45:59,540
So DC 13.

2522
01:45:59,540 --> 01:46:06,460
They get disadvantage on attack. They, one of them fucked up. The other one did make

2523
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:34,660
it

2524
01:46:34,660 --> 01:46:39,620
to the book though? The sexism is too much. What? Does anything happen to the book when I throw it?

2525
01:46:39,620 --> 01:46:45,620
He lands, he turns back into you and you're naked. No, no, no, no, I'm still a book. No,

2526
01:46:45,620 --> 01:46:51,220
no, no, no, no. Nice try, but I'm a book to him. How would I know how to turn back?

2527
01:46:51,220 --> 01:46:55,300
Wait, I run over to the book and I just try to start reading it. I'm reading what it says inside

2528
01:46:55,300 --> 01:47:01,620
the book. The hall monitors are up. They're going after you first, Bender. What the flip did I do to

2529
01:47:01,620 --> 01:47:17,500

01:47:17,500 --> 01:47:20,800
you know i think one and i'm and i'm and i'm not we're going to that you did one

2531
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:23,620

2535
01:47:30,940 --> 01:47:32,560

2537
01:47:35,740 --> 01:47:42,100
he was a very hard and i don't know if you know that that's fine

2538
01:47:42,100 --> 01:47:42,700
we would do

2539
01:47:42,700 --> 01:47:47,300
uh... okay so they shot me here what have you got shot

2540
01:47:47,300 --> 01:47:48,500
I pull the bullet out.

2541
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:49,800
That's awesome.

2542
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:50,900
Yeah, you got to attack though.

2543
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,200
You're your turn to attack.

2544
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:55,900
So then I throw the bullet like a spiral like the perfect spiral

2545
01:47:55,900 --> 01:47:57,200
fucking like a football.

2546
01:47:57,200 --> 01:47:58,100

01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:06,500
jock should do that.

2551
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:07,100
Six.

2552
01:48:07,100 --> 01:48:13,000
It looks sick, but it just sort of Peters out as it reaches.

2553
01:48:13,000 --> 01:48:16,700
It goes like yeah, you might as well be throwing up quarter.

You're right up on them.

2564
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:33,580
You were swinging at them.

2581
01:48:57,100 --> 01:48:58,740
- I'm gonna roll for crying.

2582
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:01,540
- Okay.

2583
01:49:01,540 --> 01:49:04,300
- Because they already know my sob story.

2584
01:49:04,300 --> 01:49:05,420
- Roll talking.

2585
01:49:05,420 --> 01:49:07,060
Let's see how this goes.

2586
01:49:07,060 --> 01:49:07,900
- Okay, so I'm--

2587
01:49:07,900 --> 01:49:10,180
- And before that, what do you say?

2588
01:49:10,180 --> 01:49:12,620
- I'm saying, I'm looking at them, they're like--

2589
01:49:12,620 --> 01:49:13,500
- Show 'em the scar.

2590
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:14,860
- Guns, oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

2591
01:49:14,860 --> 01:49:19,460
I pull up this and I show them right here,

2592
01:49:19,460 --> 01:49:23,140
my whole entire arm, this whole thing.

2593
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:25,300
- It's like a Looney Tunes cigar.

2594
01:49:25,300 --> 01:49:26,540
- Yeah, yeah.

2595
01:49:26,540 --> 01:49:28,060
It's his Acme on it.

2596
01:49:28,060 --> 01:49:28,900
(laughing)

2597
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,540
- In cigar burns, yeah.

2598
01:49:30,540 --> 01:49:32,880
- You see that right there?

2599
01:49:32,880 --> 01:49:35,580
Kinda looks like the Acme logo, huh?

2600
01:49:35,580 --> 01:49:36,960
(laughing)

2601
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:40,280
Kinda looks like the Acme logo that's on the side

2602
01:49:40,280 --> 01:49:42,860
of an Acme baseball bat, huh?

2603
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:47,760
That's what happens when you spill paint in the garage.

2604
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:51,540
- That is an 18.

2605
01:49:51,540 --> 01:49:53,900
Wow.

2606
01:49:53,900 --> 01:49:54,720
- Wow.

2607
01:49:54,720 --> 01:49:56,220
- One of them just starts weeping.

2608
01:49:56,220 --> 01:49:58,260
(laughing)

2609
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,340
- Is it the blind one or no?

2610
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:01,180
- It's not the blind one.

2611
01:50:01,180 --> 01:50:02,780
- Is this, so the blind one is like,

2612
01:50:02,780 --> 01:50:03,980
what are you talking about?

2613
01:50:03,980 --> 01:50:04,820
- Who's that?

2614
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:05,780
(laughing)

2615
01:50:05,780 --> 01:50:09,300
- A, C, M, E.

2616
01:50:09,300 --> 01:50:11,860
Now imagine that in braille.

2617
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:15,140
and imagine if it was letters on my arm.

2618
01:50:15,140 --> 01:50:15,980
- He's only been blind for like 27 years.

2619
01:50:15,980 --> 01:50:16,820
- What's a tattoo?

2620
01:50:16,820 --> 01:50:17,640
(laughing)

2621
01:50:17,640 --> 01:50:19,260
- I don't think he knows.

2622
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:20,100
- He knows braille immediately.

2623
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:20,940
- He just blinded.

2624
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:21,760
- He knows braille immediately, I don't know.

2625
01:50:21,760 --> 01:50:23,140
- Oh right, he's blinded.

2626
01:50:23,140 --> 01:50:25,580
- When you lose your sight, you just know braille.

2627
01:50:25,580 --> 01:50:28,900
- Three dots, four dots, one dot, six dots.

2628
01:50:28,900 --> 01:50:30,060
(laughing)

2629
01:50:30,060 --> 01:50:31,460
- One of his hearts weeping, he leaves.

2630
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:32,420
He goes, "I can't do this, man.

2631
01:50:32,420 --> 01:50:33,580
"I can't keep hitting these kids.

2632
01:50:33,580 --> 01:50:34,900
"I can't keep shooting these kids."

2633
01:50:34,900 --> 01:50:36,100
- That was my whole action?

2634
01:50:36,100 --> 01:50:37,900
- Yeah, but one of them's gone.

2635
01:50:37,900 --> 01:50:39,260
Now, girl.

2636
01:50:39,260 --> 01:50:40,740
- Yes, weird girl.

2637
01:50:40,740 --> 01:50:41,580
- Weird girl.

2638
01:50:41,580 --> 01:50:46,380
I was confused. Sorry. Weird girl. You're up. There's one guy left. He's blind. I'm

2639
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:57,000
I only have one attack so I'm just gonna unarmed strike him. Eleven. That hits. Yay.

2640
01:50:57,000 --> 01:50:57,840
- Yay!

2641
01:50:57,840 --> 01:50:58,660
- Woo!

2642
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,000
- Roll for damage.

2643
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:03,320
- One.

2644
01:51:03,320 --> 01:51:05,440
- All right, it takes one day to slash him.

2645
01:51:05,440 --> 01:51:06,280
- Bitch!

2646
01:51:06,280 --> 01:51:08,200
(laughing)

2647
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:09,580
- All right, Molly.

2648
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:14,260
- I try to campaign the troops to all work with me.

2649
01:51:14,260 --> 01:51:15,680
I try to get electric powers.

2650
01:51:15,680 --> 01:51:17,200
I try to get dandruff.

2651
01:51:17,200 --> 01:51:19,420
I try to get dancing robot.

2652
01:51:19,420 --> 01:51:24,020
I think that we've had such a troublesome time right now.

2653
01:51:24,020 --> 01:51:26,140
It seems like we're all just trying to figure out

2654
01:51:26,140 --> 01:51:29,980
who we are in this situation, and we're not actually,

2655
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:32,300
we're not actually like beings ourselves,

2656
01:51:32,300 --> 01:51:34,140
we're being who we think we're supposed to be.

2657
01:51:34,140 --> 01:51:34,980
- I've been the most abused kid in school this whole time.

2658
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:36,820
- So true, so true.

2659
01:51:36,820 --> 01:51:39,420
- But also you're like 28 and you live with your dad still.

2660
01:51:39,420 --> 01:51:41,180
(laughing)

2661
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:43,900
- You're 28 and your dad is beating you.

2662
01:51:43,900 --> 01:51:45,660
(laughing)

2663
01:51:45,660 --> 01:51:47,380
- All right, oldie 20.

2664
01:51:47,380 --> 01:51:48,980
- I think we all need to work together.

2665
01:51:48,980 --> 01:51:50,900
- Describe to me what you do, what you do.

2666
01:51:50,900 --> 01:51:54,500
- I grab, I grab everyone's, I grab Emilio's hand,

2667
01:51:54,500 --> 01:51:57,140
I grab Bender's hand and then I reach out my foot

2668
01:51:57,140 --> 01:51:59,200
and put one foot like Twister on the book

2669
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:01,420
and one foot in the lap of the weird girl.

2670
01:52:01,420 --> 01:52:02,300
- Just in my mouth.

2671
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:03,140
- In the mouth.

2672
01:52:03,140 --> 01:52:04,380
- In your mouth.

2673
01:52:04,380 --> 01:52:06,460
- In the mouth and I'm kind of rubbing the foot around.

2674
01:52:06,460 --> 01:52:09,180
- She sees the foot and she drops down on all fours.

2675
01:52:09,180 --> 01:52:10,660
(laughing)

2676
01:52:10,660 --> 01:52:12,060
- And I'm trying to kind of, you know,

2677
01:52:12,060 --> 01:52:12,900
- Yeah, blast them.

2678
01:52:12,900 --> 01:52:13,720
- Megatron.

2679
01:52:13,720 --> 01:52:14,560
- Blast them.

2680
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:15,400
- Voltron.

2681
01:52:15,400 --> 01:52:17,500
- You're doing like Paula from Earthbound.

2682
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:18,780
And it's a seven.

2683
01:52:18,780 --> 01:52:21,020
(laughing)

2684
01:52:21,020 --> 01:52:23,620
- Roll again, you get advantage.

2685
01:52:23,620 --> 01:52:25,820
he did some cool

2686
01:52:25,820 --> 01:52:26,500

2689
01:52:31,860 --> 01:52:35,860

2690
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:37,740

Thanksgiving.

2816
01:56:49,380 --> 01:56:58,380
So you guys all, you guys finished writing your essay.

2817
01:56:58,380 --> 01:57:01,380
You're writing it into the book and I'm going, "Oh, it tickles!

2818
01:57:01,380 --> 01:57:02,380
Oh, eee!"

2819
01:57:02,380 --> 01:57:04,620
(laughter)

2820
01:57:04,620 --> 01:57:09,060
- Take your final little damage.

2821
01:57:09,060 --> 01:57:12,140
- We're called the fucking Thanksgiving club.

2822
01:57:12,140 --> 01:57:13,740
- You only take one damage.

2823
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:14,660
- Nice.

2824
01:57:14,660 --> 01:57:15,500
- Easy.

2825
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:16,320
- Yeah.

2826
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:17,160
- I survived.

2827
01:57:17,160 --> 01:57:18,000
- Wait, I'm gonna give a token.

2828
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:18,980
- Me too, I'm gonna stay at five, why not?

2829
01:57:18,980 --> 01:57:20,260
- Not me, I wanna get down to one,

2830
01:57:20,260 --> 01:57:22,980
'cause I think that's almost the most perfect number.

2831
01:57:22,980 --> 01:57:25,820
- How do you guys leave the school together?

2832
01:57:25,820 --> 01:57:26,660
Do you leave the school together?

2833
01:57:26,660 --> 01:57:27,620
- Well, I have to be carried.

2834
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:29,340
- Yeah, I put the book on my head.

2835
01:57:30,380 --> 01:57:32,860
I try to balance on top of a book.

2836
01:57:32,860 --> 01:57:35,120
(laughing)

2837
01:57:35,120 --> 01:57:36,580
- In a tower.

2838
01:57:36,580 --> 01:57:39,020
- Yeah, we're all walking down the fake place.

2839
01:57:39,020 --> 01:57:41,040
- Everybody gets on my body.

2840
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,460
- All your parents' cars.

2841
01:57:43,460 --> 01:57:45,700
(laughing)

2842
01:57:45,700 --> 01:57:48,580
- They're not getting in the car,

2843
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:49,780
they turned into a fucking tower.

2844
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:50,780
- Found you.

2845
01:57:50,780 --> 01:57:52,980
- Forget about me.

2846
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:56,320
- A giant tower of four kids and a book.

2847
01:57:56,320 --> 01:57:58,860
- You guys walk out.

2848
01:57:58,860 --> 01:58:01,660
Solving comes back into the library.

2849
01:58:01,660 --> 01:58:04,660
Oh, I didn't even get to say goodbye.

2850
01:58:04,660 --> 01:58:06,060
Hmm, what's this?

2851
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:07,960
It's the essay.

2852
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:08,660
That's nice.

2853
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:12,760
I asked them all to write one, but OK.

2854
01:58:12,760 --> 01:58:19,860
Dear book, we accept the fact that we

2855
01:58:19,860 --> 01:58:23,360
had to wrestle a whole holiday weekend in the principal who

2856
01:58:23,360 --> 01:58:23,860
is gay.

2857
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:30,420
for whatever it was we did weirdly

2858
01:58:30,420 --> 01:58:36,560
but we think you're a literary for making us wrestle to an essay of prime makeup

2859
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:38,520
who we think we are

2860
01:58:38,520 --> 01:58:40,640
you squirting us

2861
01:58:40,640 --> 01:58:42,600
as you want to squirting us

2862
01:58:42,600 --> 01:58:45,560
in the simplest crips and bloods

2863
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:48,560
in the most convenient slut

2864
01:58:48,560 --> 01:58:52,400
but what we found out is that each one of us is a high school

2865
01:58:52,400 --> 01:58:54,800
and a high school

2866
01:58:54,800 --> 01:58:59,800
a Puerto Rican, a high school, and a Puerto Rican.

2867
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,060
(laughing)

2868
01:59:02,060 --> 01:59:10,440
- I'm sorry.

2869
01:59:10,440 --> 01:59:14,120
- That's better.

2870
01:59:14,120 --> 01:59:18,840
- High school, high school, Puerto Rican, high school.

2871
01:59:18,840 --> 01:59:21,100
(laughing)

2872
01:59:23,880 --> 01:59:26,600
Does that answer your question?

2873
01:59:26,600 --> 01:59:28,840
Sincerely yours, the Thanksgiving Club.

2874
01:59:28,840 --> 01:59:32,240
[LAUGHTER]

2875
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:34,200
The Thanksgiving Club.

2876
01:59:34,200 --> 01:59:36,440
[HUMMING]

2877
01:59:36,440 --> 01:59:40,040
And you guys, all of you, throw your arms up.

2878
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:41,240
Yeah, on the--

2879
01:59:41,240 --> 01:59:43,680
Oh, into the electricity realm.

2880
01:59:43,680 --> 01:59:46,120
We fly up.

2881
01:59:46,120 --> 01:59:46,800
Yeah.

2882
01:59:46,800 --> 01:59:50,360
And yeah, that's it.

2883
01:59:50,360 --> 01:59:51,160
That was beautiful.

2884
01:59:51,160 --> 01:59:53,320
Great movie.

2885
01:59:53,320 --> 01:59:54,320
Goodbye, everybody.

2886
01:59:54,320 --> 02:00:00,760
OK, then we have employee

2887
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:01,840
injured by soccer ball.

2888
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,080
And please tell me this is in FIFA.

2889
02:00:04,080 --> 02:00:06,200
An incident occurred when employee

2890
02:00:06,200 --> 02:00:07,360
number one was seriously

2891
02:00:07,360 --> 02:00:08,520
injured by a soccer ball.

2892
02:00:08,520 --> 02:00:09,680
The soccer ball hit employee

2893
02:00:09,680 --> 02:00:11,000
number one's head while supervising

2894
02:00:11,000 --> 02:00:12,280
kids playing soccer ball.

2895
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:13,920
Employee number one was transported

2896
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:15,360
and confined at the hospital

2897
02:00:15,360 --> 02:00:16,240
for treatment of her head

2898
02:00:16,240 --> 02:00:17,240
injury and concussion.

2899
02:00:17,240 --> 02:00:18,880
Occupation guards and police.

2900
02:00:18,880 --> 02:00:21,000
So it was a school cop.

2901
02:00:21,000 --> 02:00:22,520
A cop got hit by a soccer ball

2902
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,720
and went to the hospital and then called OSHA.

2903
02:00:24,720 --> 02:00:25,720
Yeah.

2904
02:00:25,720 --> 02:00:27,440
I feel like he was planning that.

2905
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,480
He was like, "I could probably get some comps off of that."

2906
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:31,480
It was a girl?

2907
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:32,480
Yeah.

2908
02:00:32,480 --> 02:00:33,480
He doesn't think girls can be guards and cops.

2909
02:00:33,480 --> 02:00:34,480
Cameron, a lot of yours...

2910
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:35,480
No, I don't know.

2911
02:00:35,480 --> 02:00:37,240
Yeah, a lot of yours are girls.

2912
02:00:37,240 --> 02:00:38,440
A lot of them are women.

2913
02:00:38,440 --> 02:00:39,760
You're trying to hurt girls.

2914
02:00:39,760 --> 02:00:43,320
No, I don't think girls die as much as guys.

2915
02:00:43,320 --> 02:00:44,800
You don't think girls die as much as guys?

2916
02:00:44,800 --> 02:00:45,800
Yeah.

2917
02:00:45,800 --> 02:00:48,800
Because they don't have as many jobs.

2918
02:00:48,800 --> 02:00:50,120
No, I'm kidding.

2919
02:00:50,120 --> 02:00:53,480
Okay, then these are just a bunch of ones that don't have descriptions.

2920
02:00:53,480 --> 02:00:55,080
I just put the funny titles in.

2921
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:57,800
"Employee suffers non-work-related chest pain."

2922
02:00:57,800 --> 02:01:00,440
So why call OSHA? I don't know. This doesn't fit to me.

2923
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:03,080
Seems like you shouldn't call OSHA for that.

2924
02:01:03,080 --> 02:01:05,880
"Employee suffers burns when sprayed by thick, hot beet juice."

2925
02:01:05,880 --> 02:01:08,040
Was that a death?

2926
02:01:08,040 --> 02:01:09,400
Is that why you didn't include the description?

2927
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:10,120
None of these are deaths.

2928
02:01:10,120 --> 02:01:14,280
I mean, the description of this was like,

2929
02:01:14,280 --> 02:01:16,280
"An employee got sprayed and burned very bad."

2930
02:01:16,280 --> 02:01:17,320
It's not very pleasant.

2931
02:01:17,320 --> 02:01:19,160
But thick, hot beet juice.

2932
02:01:19,160 --> 02:01:21,560
Yeah, it feels like the titles are funnier than...

2933
02:01:21,560 --> 02:01:22,060
Yeah.

2934
02:01:22,060 --> 02:01:24,060
So then, here's...

2935
02:01:24,060 --> 02:01:26,060
I have a whole series I'm gonna go through lightning round here.

2936
02:01:26,060 --> 02:01:26,560
Okay.

2937
02:01:26,560 --> 02:01:28,360
Employee is attacked by lion.

2938
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,160
Employee's hand is bitten by wolf.

2939
02:01:30,160 --> 02:01:32,360
Employee's finger bitten by chimpanzees.

2940
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:34,660
Employee discovers bees at work site.

2941
02:01:34,660 --> 02:01:36,860
Employee injured when attacked by river otter.

2942
02:01:36,860 --> 02:01:38,860
Employee injures leg when attacked by panda...

2943
02:01:38,860 --> 02:01:40,360
When attached by panda bear.
