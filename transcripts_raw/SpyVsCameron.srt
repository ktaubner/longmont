1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Okay, cool

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Yeah, so

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,820
We another hello everybody. We're doing another spy versus spy except this time

4
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,260
It's not spy versus spy. It's spy versus Cameron

5
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:21,120
Is that what it is? Yeah, I don't even really know what the original thing is for there to be a so

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:24,480
Okay, you're not version of it. You're not near the movies

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,360
Which is the other so Patrick is what and he wanted us to do spy verse Cameron?

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:34,020
And it would be about how Cameron's near the movies, and he didn't really

9
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,040
Elaborate on that. Do you just say you just do whatever we say?

10
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,120
Yeah

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,320
really

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Like almost always yeah

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:51,600
Yeah, yeah, that's on us. I should have known that yeah jumped in I've been like yeah, I have no original thoughts. Yeah, that's okay

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,160
- Near the movies. - It's a nightmare.

15
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,200
- Yeah.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,240
- Well, at least you, now I'm a little bit mad

17
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,780
that you didn't do everything he said.

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,800
- Yeah.

19
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,800
- You just did the spy versus camera thing,

20
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,600
but you didn't put him near the movies.

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,440
- Well, there's--

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,600
- I don't wanna be near the movie.

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,640
I'm not near the movies really that so often, necessarily.

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,480
- I just thought that there has never been a third spy.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,160
I guess it could've been a gray spy.

26
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,800
- I bet there's a girl spy, Venus de Milo style.

27
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,060
- You could be a girl spy. - I bet there is a girl spy.

28
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:23,260
- I had the full Spy vs Spy collection when I was a kid.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,740
- I could do a quick acid swap.

30
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,580
- Some of those ones, the guest artist--

31
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,940
- No, let's go, it's pretty gory with it.

32
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,140
- That's horrific.

33
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:31,860
- You wanna restart this again?

34
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,180
- No, no, no, no, no.

35
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,620
- What's happening? - We can't restart this again.

36
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,420
- No, I just Googled Spy vs Spy female,

37
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:41,860
and I'm seeing Gray Spy, aka Lady in Gray,

38
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,500
is a third spy appearing in some Spy vs Spy comic strips.

39
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,020
- That's so smart.

40
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,020
- And she's called Lady in Gray.

41
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,300
- Oh my God, she's gorgeous.

42
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,420
- She looks like a different species.

43
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,100
- She does not look like--

44
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,020
- There's a huge degree of sexual dimorphism.

45
00:01:59,020 --> 00:01:59,860
- Yeah.

46
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,140
- She's kind of like a female black widow spider.

47
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:04,920
- And the other ones are plague doctors.

48
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,140
This is very different.

49
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,000
- They're kind of bird-like.

50
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,220
- Hubio, are you near,

51
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:18,660
you're in roll 20, I'm not seeing--

52
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,340
- Oh, you're not in the map.

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,680
- You're in the map, yeah,

54
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,880
'cause you're not moving with the screen.

55
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,720
There we go.

56
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,520
Yeah, cool.

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,460
So you can see here where our first,

58
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,580
so the way that this worked last time, Cameron,

59
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,000
is that your job is to kill your fellow spy

60
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,240
using your various gadgets and trickery and smarts.

61
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,500
You're gonna be given random gadgets

62
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,500
at the beginning of each little vignette.

63
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:53,140
and then you'll roll to see who goes first,

64
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:55,060
and then you'll begin sort of like trying to figure out

65
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,000
how to do this in a way that's discreet,

66
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,740
'cause they're in these real situations,

67
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,500
there are people who might take offense to you

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,340
trying to do something whack,

69
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,500
but if you do it quick enough, it won't matter.

70
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,300
- And a word to the wise here, Cameron,

71
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,860
the better an idea you have,

72
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,840
if this is anything like the first game,

73
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,620
the more likely it is that you will lose.

74
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,060
- Okay. - So have just kind of

75
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:22,060
the most basic, stupid ideas, don't over-complicate it,

76
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,340
because you will lose if you try to do something

77
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,940
even remotely interesting.

78
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
- Am I me? - Okay.

79
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,980
- I guess so, yeah, unless you wanna be Lady in Gray.

80
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:31,820
It's up to you.

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:34,300
Now you are you.

82
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,580
You're you. - But I'm me.

83
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,660
- You're you.

84
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,500
- Okay.

85
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,180
- I made you you.

86
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,660
So--

87
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,940
- Is that a giant baby bottle next to me?

88
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,620
- No, that's a corpse.

89
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,800
- It's just a dead body.

90
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,940
- It looks like a baby bottle to me.

91
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,900
- Bust looks like the nipple of a baby bottle.

92
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,740
- Yeah, he does look like a nipple.

93
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,940
- His sheet looks like milk with rippling.

94
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,700
- Oh, rippling milk.

95
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,220
- Rippling milk.

96
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,880
- Yeah, it does look like bountiful.

97
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,580
- Okay, so. - Ocean of milk.

98
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,580
(laughing)

99
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,740
- Okay, it could be a bountiful baby bottle.

100
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,460
This is a fast and loose, we want this to have fun.

101
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,860
- Okay, so this one's kind of unlike our normal D&D stuff,

102
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,340
this one's kind of off the wall.

103
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,340
Yeah, we can kind of do whatever we want here.

104
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,340
That's the bottle I'm getting so far.

105
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,340
Okay, so that's a baby bottle.

106
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,340
Got it. Okay, first things first.

107
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,340
Both of you guys, let's start with you, Cameron.

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Roll a D20 three times.

109
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,340
And then I will DM you on Discord.

110
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,340
Discord.

111
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,340
With what items you'll get.

112
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,340
Mm-hmm.

113
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:38,340
Okay.

114
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,340
Okay, I got a two.

115
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,340
Are these the same items as last time?

116
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,340
No.

117
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:49,340
I got a 15.

118
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,980
It's some of the same items but not all of them though.

119
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,980
I got a 19.

120
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
Okay.

121
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,820
Now let me check my discord.

122
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,340
It could be coming down the pipeline for me.

123
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,940
And these are items that I will have.

124
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:07,900
Yes, you will have them for this adventure.

125
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,900
Now I will do it.

126
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,700
Yes, you do it as well.

127
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,380
I will be copying and pasting from my list.

128
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,380
I got 3 of 15 and an 8.

129
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:23,700
Okay, so we got 2, 15, 19, 3, 15, 8.

130
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,700
Please tell me what the expense of canary figurine.

131
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,700
What?

132
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,700
Yeah.

133
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,140
Well we won't know yet.

134
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,540
But when we get our 15 we'll know what it is.

135
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,540
Till the other has.

136
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,660
We won't know till after.

137
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,020
We don't know our own items?

138
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,020
He means that...

139
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,020
We don't know what number is attached to it.

140
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:44,180
I can give you guys well, maybe you do have just ate the order it's in

141
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,300
true

142
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
But now you're gonna scramble it

143
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,140
No, I said something he's gonna scramble it isn't he see I might be a problem

144
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:58,620
Cameras too smart for this game. I'm literally trying to strategize right now

145
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:06,820
Last that you were just a you're a chess player you're playing with my chest

146
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,500
Yeah, I'm more of a cookie clicker player

147
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,800
Every game I play is cookie clicker

148
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,960
Sorry, I'm just cookie click copying from one note means I have to do I keep bringing have to do command

149
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,460
Control shift I mean because it just pasted as a picture nobody

150
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:27,220
Man, nobody cares about this

151
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:33,740
That's okay me and camera can talk about our days or something. Yes. I went on a walk a long walk today

152
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,100
Just through Manhattan. I was feeling the magic of New York. Oh wow

153
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,260
- You went all the way over there for a walk.

154
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,820
- Yeah, well I had to go do something there

155
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,780
and then I just wandered around for like an hour.

156
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:47,260
I went to the water, I went to a bunch of different areas.

157
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,340
I was seeing types of things.

158
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,700
It was kinda nice.

159
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,420
- He texted the group chat, you were like,

160
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,820
"I'm gonna go for a walk today."

161
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,800
- I didn't say that.

162
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,020
I would never say that.

163
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,540
- Yeah, he doesn't like us knowing where he is.

164
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:02,380
- I would say that once after I got home.

165
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,860
- The prank war is still on.

166
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,820
- Yeah, well you never know.

167
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:08,540
Anybody could get hold of anybody's iCloud and see anybody.

168
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,820
Okay, I've just gotten one item.

169
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,540
- No, you got three items.

170
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,980
- I've just gotten three items, everybody.

171
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,980
- And Caleb, here comes your three items.

172
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,460
- I'm excited as fuck.

173
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,700
- Okay, you got three, oh, that's cute.

174
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,540
That's fun.

175
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,500
I like that.

176
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,180
- Okay, don't tip Cameron off that I got a cute item.

177
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,020
- No, I just said it.

178
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,660
- I mean, he said this is gonna be a rubber ducky

179
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,940
or a teddy bear.

180
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,300
- Well, I also have to think about

181
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,260
what kind of twisted thing Patches might find cute.

182
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,620
And it would probably be like an alien dragon.

183
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,460
- Yeah.

184
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,300
True.

185
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,860
- Yeah, like a dark rune.

186
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,700
- Or a pho-- yeah.

187
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,540
- Yeah.

188
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,220
He is esoteric.

189
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,060
- Yeah.

190
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,880
- Yeah.

191
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,780
Okay.

192
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:57,220
Well, I'd really like these items.

193
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:00,860
- I heard yours got clogged up somewhere down the pipeline.

194
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,700
- It seems like it.

195
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,900
- They're coming.

196
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
It's just, it's just, you don't, you don't understand.

197
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,140
- Seems like I'm still rolling my item cube.

198
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,380
- You don't understand why this takes so long.

199
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,100
- You have to manually type out every item?

200
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,900
- No, it's just I'm stupid.

201
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,500
- What are you, coming up with them right now?

202
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,820
You stupid fucker.

203
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,780
- That would be cool.

204
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,540
- Send them to me and I'll send them over to Caleb.

205
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,940
- That is not gonna work, that would be complicated.

206
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:26,140
- I'll handle part of it, that'll make it a lot faster.

207
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,060
- It's a good trickity trap though.

208
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,140
- No. - Send me the full notes then.

209
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,900
And I'll copy and paste it for you.

210
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,400
No.

211
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,900
Oh, but then you'd have to copy and paste the notes, huh?

212
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,400
Yeah, which he seems to have a real problem with, so...

213
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Okay, you'll know in my life.

214
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,400
That is tough.

215
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,900
It's not easy.

216
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,400
Are you having trouble reaching the C key from the control key?

217
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Yeah, he's very little.

218
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
He's having Donald Trump, Donald Trump.

219
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,400
I deal with the last orange-ass hands.

220
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Oh, I got one!

221
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
Oh, I got all three!

222
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
You got all three.

223
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
Okay.

224
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,900
Alright, it's been pasted.

225
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,900
Wow.

226
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:59,900
Okay, now both of you's rolls initiative.

227
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,400
Okay, here I go.

228
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,160
This is going to be a serious roll.

229
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Serious roll.

230
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,760
It's going to be a very serious roll.

231
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,760
Geez.

232
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,160
My computer is running so slow.

233
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,160
20!

234
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,240
Oh wait, where's my initiative?

235
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,240
Do I have a character sheet?

236
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,240
You have a character sheet.

237
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,720
Sorry, I was about to just roll it.

238
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait, what kind of stats does Cameron the character have?

239
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,760
Wait, where's my guy?

240
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,760
It should be shared with you.

241
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:26,760
Go to the notes.

242
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,160
Oh, is it this one at the top?

243
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,580
I didn't see it because it wasn't in a drop down.

244
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,900
Why is this running so slow?

245
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,820
Geez Louise.

246
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,300
- It's roll 20.

247
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,220
- Okay, I got a five for my initiative.

248
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,380
- And I win again.

249
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,700
- Okay.

250
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,660
So, Caleb, or should I say black spy,

251
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
you are at this bar.

252
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,500
It's called--

253
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,380
- Cameron just take his headphones off.

254
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,300
- Oh, I just take them off?

255
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,140
- Oh yeah, take them off.

256
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,060
- We'll give you a thumbs up when you're ready.

257
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,020
- It's a thumbs up?

258
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,180
- Yeah, thumbs up, thumbs up.

259
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,020
- All right, see ya.

260
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,500
- So not a thumbs down.

261
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,420
Okay.

262
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:06,520
It's a big, it's a fancy bar, it's called the Podcast About List bar.

263
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
And you're on a date.

264
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Nicely done.

265
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,100
Yeah, you're on a date with a female police officer right now.

266
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,100
Okay.

267
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:21,300
And, but of course you know what your real mission here is, which is to end Cameron.

268
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,020
Can you tell me something?

269
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,440
What's up man?

270
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,320
So with the dynamic of black spy versus white spy, it makes some sense because they hate

271
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,120
each other because I guess they have different allegiances I would assume, different countries,

272
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,120
different...

273
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Yeah, stop there.

274
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
One's MI6.

275
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,800
Why does black spy want to kill Cameron?

276
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
You want to know your motivation, your character motivation here.

277
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,160
Just give me something here.

278
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
I got you.

279
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,160
Okay.

280
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:52,000
So I think think of it like this.

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,700
Cameron is probably the one who's maybe he's the one

282
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,000
who supplies white spy with the with the gadgets.

283
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,940
Oh, no. Right.

284
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,740
Like, I think like that. Right.

285
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,080
I think that's probably what it is.

286
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:08,180
Yeah. He's some kind of dirty arms dealer. Mm hmm.

287
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:10,040
Mm hmm. All right.

288
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,720
They've got your own.

289
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,820
There's a buddy dealer. Yeah, me too.

290
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,980
So, yeah, you're on this day with this female police officer.

291
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,180
And she says, so what do you do for a living?

292
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,340
I hope it's not being a criminal or a spy.

293
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:34,340
As you can see by my all black clothes, I am a goth.

294
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,380
Oh, that's fun.

295
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,660
Well, no, it's not very fun.

296
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,860
It's actually kind of the opposite.

297
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:41,460
Oh, right.

298
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,180
I'm sorry.

299
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,820
That's so stupid of me.

300
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:44,500
What do you do?

301
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:47,500
Are you some kind of blue spy or something?

302
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
What is this outfit?

303
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:52,300
- No, I'm a female police officer.

304
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,140
- Oh, wow.

305
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:56,260
- So I'll try to find out and find bad guys and arrest them.

306
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,060
- So it's kind of just the same as a normal police officer.

307
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,620
Why are you even saying female?

308
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,700
- I think it's important.

309
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,280
- Okay, well, if you'll excuse me,

310
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,340
I think I might go check out

311
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:12,220
that giant baby bottle over there.

312
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,300
- Okay, yeah, that doesn't require deception.

313
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
That is probably what you're interested in.

314
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
It's kind of an interesting thing, right?

315
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Yeah, it's kind of an interesting thing. I think she just buys it.

316
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Okay, cool.

317
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
So, yeah. What are you going to do then?

318
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
What's your plan?

319
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,300
Hmm.

320
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
I am going to...

321
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Is there any way that I could

322
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
use my movement

323
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
to get a little bit closer

324
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
and then throw my sonic eavesdropper,

325
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,300
the small handheld device

326
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:45,300
that allows the user to listen in on conversations from a distance?

327
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,300
Could I throw it in range of where Cameron is?

328
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,300
I mean, you can already use that.

329
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,300
Like, this is the proper distance for that kind of item.

330
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Like where you're sitting.

331
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
Maybe I'm going to walk up to...

332
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,300
Is there somewhere that I could...

333
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,300
I'll walk up to the bar and maybe like over...

334
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:08,300
maybe like the far left, like bottom left corner

335
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,200
corner and kind of crouch, hide behind the bar a little bit so he can't see me and maybe

336
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,880
poke the eavesdropper around the corner aimed in his direction.

337
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Okay, cool.

338
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
Yeah, go for it.

339
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:25,920
So just move your character there, poke it there and do a slight a hand check just so

340
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,160
in case a bartender notices or patron does.

341
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,680
All right, let's see.

342
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,680
Nice.

343
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Very smooth.

344
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,880
Yeah, you just sort of slide it under there.

345
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:42,200
Just like your normal walking by a thing and you put your hand on the thing.

346
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
It's great.

347
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,200
Looks very good.

348
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:47,360
So for the next turn do I just get to keep my headphones on?

349
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,280
You picked up on that.

350
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
There you go.

351
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,280
Okay.

352
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,480
Here, we'll tell him and I'll turn my volume down.

353
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:55,480
Okay, cool.

354
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Do it.

355
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Alright, cool.

356
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,480
Alright.

357
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,480
Alright, and that's the end of my turn.

358
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Alright, cool.

359
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Alright.

360
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,480
Okay.

361
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,720
So I'll let him know what happened.

362
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,720
So for reasons I can't explain, just I can't tell you about.

363
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:16,120
- Well, you don't even have to tell me

364
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,840
'cause unlucky for you guys,

365
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,280
I can read lips at 10 frames per second

366
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,580
and I know everything that was just said.

367
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,420
- Okay.

368
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:26,120
- No, but what's happened?

369
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,560
- Oh, okay, so yeah,

370
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,760
Caleb is gonna be able to keep his headphones on

371
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
for this session, for this round.

372
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,080
- Oh, okay.

373
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,920
- Yeah.

374
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,800
- Well, I'm sure you're gonna have a fun time

375
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,920
listening to me ask what is going on,

376
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,960
how does this game work,

377
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,880
why did it start with me not being able to listen to anything.

378
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,740
- Don't worry, I can help.

379
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,520
- So maybe you can help me out here

380
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,920
'cause I don't even really know at all what's going on.

381
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,760
- Okay.

382
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,640
So here's how it is.

383
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,560
You have to kill Caleb, who is the black spy,

384
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,920
in hilarious ways using gadgets.

385
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,320
You can also try to stab them and stuff, but

386
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,360
the the trick is to try to do it in a way that it doesn't

387
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,100
get everyone all alarmed about what you're doing.

388
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,860
So you don't get stopped or tackled by someone and have your whole thing ruined.

389
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:27,560
Yeah. So the idea is to each turn you have, you know, same as in D&D action,

390
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,220
bonus action, you know, reaction, whatever.

391
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:33,020
Most of the items just do actions.

392
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,220
They'll just take up an action.

393
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,220
Some of them, like we can discuss if it's like an action

394
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,860
and then like a bonus action to reuse it.

395
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,160
But I think it's just most of them just take an action.

396
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,360
And so it's just to set yourself up to position yourself to do the best

397
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,220
so you could talk to some of these people.

398
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,700
And like Pat last time

399
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,800
sent some people in certain directions to

400
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,320
confuse Caleb and Caleb.

401
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,820
It didn't work, but then you still died.

402
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,220
And thanks, Matthew.

403
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:08,120
Caleb did stuff to where he forgot what some of the shit you did.

404
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,100
It was very fucking cool.

405
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,400
If you haven't listened to it, go back and listen to the first one.

406
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,160
It was cool. It was cool.

407
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,340
You were kind of like, no, no, no, no, no.

408
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,460
You're going to get an idea of my techniques.

409
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:21,940
Yeah, you can't get his techniques down. Yeah, sure.

410
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,000
Mm hmm. So you can use one of your items

411
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,940
and I get to listen to every single thing you say. Yeah.

412
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,020
So right now, because because of an item that Caleb used this turn,

413
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,880
he's going to be able to listen to basically

414
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,220
whatever you say, whatever you say with me, where usually it's like

415
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,760
because it's a versus, yeah, like to try to keep it. Yeah, right.

416
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:49,420
But so. OK, so I just do a random stuff now.

417
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:52,120
Well, you're trying to kill Caleb.

418
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,280
So whatever it is you want to do, you just tell me what you want to do

419
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,860
and what you're thinking.

420
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,080
You're in this bar.

421
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,380
It's called a podcast about Liss Bar.

422
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,640
And I just have one turn?

423
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,740
Yeah, you just have one turn, just taking turns,

424
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,940
like in Dungeons and Dragons.

425
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,980
Oh, OK. So it's not like so.

426
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,480
No, no, no.

427
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,780
Then I will go back.

428
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,280
Yeah, yeah.

429
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,620
And go back. OK.

430
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,720
Well, all right.

431
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,540
Well, I guess and he'll only be able to listen to this turn.

432
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:21,120
Yeah. And like I will say that, like, because it's a meta, it's a meta item.

433
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,420
So like, I think it's fair to just do it this turn.

434
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,440
And then, yeah, you just have to be kind of

435
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,840
You have to try to be cagey and no DMing me

436
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,000
because then that defeats the purpose.

437
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,880
And also it would be bad radio.

438
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,720
Sure.

439
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,540
Yeah.

440
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:34,720
Okay, well.

441
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,560
How far can I move here?

442
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,480
30?

443
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,720
Yeah, 30 feet as always.

444
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,760
Four, five, six.

445
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,280
Can I speak obliquely about my item

446
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,240
to ask a question that I might not use it?

447
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,080
Yeah, absolutely.

448
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,580
- Third item, how far of a range is that?

449
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,480
- Look at your items again.

450
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,320
- Ooh.

451
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,820
- Yeah, that's like a, that's...

452
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,960
- If I moved 30 feet, would I be in range with that?

453
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,800
- Let me see.

454
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,960
Yeah, yeah.

455
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,440
Oh, with him?

456
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,260
- Yeah.

457
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,440
- No, it's gonna need to be,

458
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,240
you're gonna need to be within 10 feet for that.

459
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
- Okay.

460
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,160
- If you think about it. - All right.

461
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,800
Well then, I guess all I'm gonna do

462
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,800
I'm just gonna take a big slurp from this bottle of milk.

463
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,800
God damn it, man!

464
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:35,800
And I guess I will also...

465
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:42,800
Can I... Do I have any type of Final Fantasy-esque guard action?

466
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:47,800
Can I just be... Can I just give myself a bonus if I'm gonna get attacked?

467
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,800
You know what I mean? Like I don't want to do anything, can I just...

468
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Oh, I mean you can prepare an action.

469
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Like you can do that. Yeah, you can defend.

470
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,800
Yeah, I'll defend.

471
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,800
I also, not only do I not want Caleb to know anything I have, but I also have no idea what to do.

472
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,800
So, I'm going to start out by defending.

473
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
You can do the guard action, so that's just going to give you

474
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,480
plus one on your AC for the remainder of the turn and then the first attack

475
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,320
against you is gonna have disadvantage. I'll do that and I'll also drink some of

476
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,680
that milk. Okay that milk yeah that's a free action to drink the milk. Yeah when

477
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,000
you start drinking the milk everyone in the bar stops talking and just watches

478
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,880
you drink the milk. It's a big bottle. It's huge! It's twice the size of me!

479
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,100
When you're done drinking the milk they all just resume talking to the people

480
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,940
around them. The milk was booby trapped with a silence creator. They just

481
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:54,260
regard, they always regard you when you drink the milk. Okay, milk is an attention getter.

482
00:19:54,260 --> 00:20:04,740
Yeah, take your headphones off. Okay, well backed. Alright, is there a designated fire

483
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:10,420
exit in the podcast about Lisp Bar? Yes, there is. Also, second of all, I will say

484
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,260
that you can reapply, you can reapply it, but then you have to reapply it.

485
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,360
And then that's your action with that item.

486
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,160
I should have mentioned that.

487
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:21,760
But anyway, yeah, the fire exit is.

488
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:25,360
I mean, I guess it's behind the bar, which is dumb

489
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,100
trying to find out where it would be.

490
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,860
I guess it would have to be in the back of the bar, but I don't know where I put it.

491
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:33,500
Would it be these stairs or would it be this thing in the front?

492
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,860
No, that's the front door.

493
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,300
Let's say the fire exit is here.

494
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,360
I think that's fair, like in this corner here.

495
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
OK, this guy's running for the fire exit.

496
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,520
He's like, I think there's a fire.

497
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,960
OK, and I know he's going to return. Yes.

498
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:52,080
Yes. OK, I'm going to throw

499
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,000
my portable hole right behind the fire exit,

500
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,920
like right in front of the door.

501
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,920
And this is a pretty dim bar, no?

502
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,880
I'm open to that.

503
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,680
So, yeah, I'll ask him to roll a

504
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:31,680
I'm

505
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,040
It's kind of like you're trying to make it look like you're not throwing something.

506
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,940
It's just going to be a straight up roll against his perception.

507
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:40,520
Yeah, it'll be that.

508
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,660
I would also say before you roll it, hmm, that if you like walk closer to it,

509
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,660
you're going to like.

510
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:53,720
Like, I'll get I will give you like advantage if you move closer to it

511
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,560
on your side of hand roll, like then you're you're repositioned to over there.

512
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,800
But like I because I just don't want you to like

513
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
You just throw it from there, like...

514
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,040
Yeah, is there any kind of...

515
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,040
I'll move closer to it.

516
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:12,540
Alright, I'm gonna move over here.

517
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,640
And then, is there any kind of like...

518
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,640
throw rugs or anything?

519
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Could I take a cushion off of a chair and cover it?

520
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,640
These chairs don't really have cushions.

521
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,040
But you could grab a menu from off the table.

522
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
Okay, I'll grab a menu and I'll put it...

523
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,380
I'm going to I'm going to roll my sleight of hand.

524
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,300
You said I get advantage. Yeah. Yeah.

525
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,980
OK, 24.

526
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,840
Now I'm going to place the menu over it.

527
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,280
Yeah, the menu over it is.

528
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,140
I mean, that's you're not going to get advantage on that sleight of hand.

529
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:47,680
Check if you want it because you're I mean, let's just do it again.

530
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,180
Yeah. Eleven. OK, fine.

531
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:55,600
So just the whole when you placed it, it was like aces.

532
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,240
Like he's going to have to crush that perception check to notice it

533
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,840
in this dim bar.

534
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,680
The menu, you're like trying to be like,

535
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,000
"Oh, oh, I don't know what to do with this."

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,800
And like, looked a little sus.

537
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,640
- Okay.

538
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,460
- As they say.

539
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,800
So I'll find a way to frame that to him.

540
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,240
- And I moved 15 feet, so I'm gonna move 15 feet back.

541
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,060
- Cool.

542
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,440
- And then I'm gonna end my turn.

543
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,280
- I like that.

544
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,100
All right, cool.

545
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,240
Nice.

546
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,080
All right.

547
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,960
- I'm gonna go pee real quick.

548
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,000
- Pee pee.

549
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,840
All right.

550
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,960
All right.

551
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,560
-First thing you're going to do, man,

552
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,640
is roll a gosh-darn perception check.

553
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,920
-Okay.

554
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,760
Perception.

555
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,160
-Okay.

556
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,440
You're--

557
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,320
For--

558
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,600
That's cool.

559
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,040
You are able to--

560
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:55,520
You notice that Caleb threw down a menu on the ground.

561
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,880
He, you don't know why, it was kind of like a weird,

562
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,040
it didn't seem like a normal thing to do.

563
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:06,300
(laughing)

564
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:10,480
- Sure. - He had a rough day.

565
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
All right, so that happened.

566
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,360
(laughing)

567
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,200
Fuck, man.

568
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,560
I think to myself, well that doesn't exactly seem normal.

569
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,120
- You just suck it in the milk.

570
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,960
- Yeah.

571
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,760
Cool.

572
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,360
It happened around here.

573
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,780
OK, hold on, wait, sorry.

574
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,580
My screen management is fucked.

575
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,600
Give me a second.

576
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,940
And I'll put a like a marker there.

577
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,400
Yeah, just put down.

578
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,620
Well, let me rearrange my screen

579
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,280
really quickly.

580
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,380
I got the solve here.

581
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,120
All right.

582
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,920
Cool.

583
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,500
That's maybe not the best color,

584
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,220
but like here it's a five

585
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,920
foot by five foot menu.

586
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,940
OK, right there.

587
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,000
All right. Yeah, sure.

588
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,820
So the Cheesecake Factory size

589
00:24:52,840 --> 00:25:00,960
menu. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. And that's all. That's all I see. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing has

590
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:14,320
happened done to me. Okay. Um, well, I, okay. Here's a question I have about the portable

591
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:19,320
- It's just a hole, a one-way hole.

592
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,940
It's not a portal.

593
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,960
- Let me read it.

594
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,800
What does it say?

595
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,140
- It says a small black disc

596
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,800
that went placed on the surface.

597
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,120
So it's not necessarily that I could go through it,

598
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,840
but I couldn't make something else go through it.

599
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,280
Like, the thing that goes into it is like, kinda gone.

600
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,520
- It's like, gone, yes.

601
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,720
- But you can pull it out maybe,

602
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,560
but it's not like it goes somewhere.

603
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,000
- It's kind of like the banish spell in 5e,

604
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,760
except that like you're gone, gone.

605
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,720
Like, okay, like unless you bring it back, right?

606
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,720
So if I went in there, I would die.

607
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,160
Yeah.

608
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:54,520
But if you store items in there, right, it's like you can store items, pull stuff out.

609
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,080
Yeah, I can.

610
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,680
Exactly.

611
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,240
Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,040
Okay, I gotcha.

613
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,440
That's.

614
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,840
So you can put stuff in there and then trigger it is like an idea I've seen.

615
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,760
I've seen people do in my mind when I've thought about it.

616
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:09,480
Yeah. Well, so and putting so I'm going to put the milk into my hole.

617
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,300
It's fine.

618
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,820
Yeah.

619
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,560
I want to put all that stuff in my hole.

620
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,360
Come on, man.

621
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,280
That's what I want to do.

622
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,480
Is there a problem?

623
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,020
No, I guess not.

624
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,500
Do you want, do you care if anybody sees you put the milk into the hole?

625
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,560
Or can I try to roll to see if I can do it a little surreptitiously?

626
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,680
I guess I don't care that much, but it would be nice.

627
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,180
Maybe.

628
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,280
Yeah, sure.

629
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:34,320
Uh, and you mean also, sorry to clarify.

630
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,400
You don't mean the bottle.

631
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,840
You mean the milk inside the bottle?

632
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,640
Are you storing them?

633
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,440
Just loose.

634
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:39,720
Okay.

635
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,520
- If I put loose milk in, can I still pull it out?

636
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:45,680
- It'll be like if you try to drink water

637
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,200
from a stream though. - Can I shake the hole

638
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
so it splashes out?

639
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,680
Not like a concentrated stream, but like--

640
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,120
- That, yeah, that way.

641
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can do that.

642
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,000
Of course you could do that.

643
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,200
- I can splash, okay, then yeah,

644
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,080
I'm basically putting-- - Oh, that was a thumbs up.

645
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,600
- No, no, my friend, you stay far away

646
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,040
from my scheming plan. - Sorry.

647
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,840
- Okay, I wanna act, okay, in that case,

648
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,080
I will do this stealthily.

649
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,160
I'll be kinda holding the hole next to my mouth

650
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,000
while I'm drinking the milk and having all the milk

651
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,840
- I love that. - Go into the hole

652
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,660
instead of my mouth.

653
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,040
Or I can even put the hole in my mouth

654
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,680
to do it really stealthily.

655
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,600
- Oh, roll with, if you're doing that,

656
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,960
roll with a sleight of hand with advantage.

657
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,800
- Okay.

658
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,180
- If you're putting the hole in your mouth,

659
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,800
which means you have to just like.

660
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,060
(laughing)

661
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,800
You have to be so careful.

662
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,720
- Is that a success? - I don't like this laughing.

663
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,800
- That's gonna be, that's gonna be a, oh God.

664
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,880
- It seems like you're laughing at my expense, man.

665
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,960
- I don't want you to just, I don't think it's fun

666
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,520
if you just die that way.

667
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,900
Though it's kind of fun.

668
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,260
- So what I'd like you to do is do a--

669
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,900
- I got a 21.

670
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,540
- Okay, great, perfect.

671
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,980
All right, I wasn't sure, that's perfect, okay.

672
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,420
- I can't tell me I'm gonna die from a 21.

673
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,420
- No, no, no, no, I was gonna give you another,

674
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,940
I was gonna do, what I was gonna do

675
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,780
was gonna be like a deck saving throw on top of that.

676
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,020
- Well, that's fair enough.

677
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,320
- And then if you fail that,

678
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,060
then you can abort doing it is all.

679
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:05,540
So we'll keep that slight of hand if you nail it.

680
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,240
So do the deck saving throw though.

681
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,780
10.

682
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,060
That's fine, that's fine.

683
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,180
As long as it's not below a 10.

684
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,740
If it's below a 10, I'd have no choice.

685
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,300
I want this to work, obviously.

686
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,140
Yeah.

687
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,660
Okay, so I got the hole in my mouth with the milk.

688
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,660
So yeah, everybody just looks at you.

689
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:25,500
You see them, they kinda get a little mad

690
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,020
'cause they see the milk's gone.

691
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,860
Yeah.

692
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,540
And they go back into doing what they're doing.

693
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,460
Sure.

694
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,300
Yeah.

695
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,140
Okay, I'm gonna kind of, can I walk too?

696
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,700
That's a free action.

697
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,260
Oh, well, that's an item, I guess, too.

698
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,420
So, yeah.

699
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,260
All right, so--

700
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:41,240
You could place the hole too somewhere if you want to, if that's what you're thinking.

701
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,640
I want to keep it in my mouth and just like keep it in there.

702
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,980
Alright, yeah.

703
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,980
Keep it in there.

704
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:47,980
Okay.

705
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,980
Can I go here?

706
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:49,980
Where are you trying to go?

707
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Sorry.

708
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:51,980
Oh, he moved.

709
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,460
Yeah, you can definitely go there.

710
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,020
Do I move now?

711
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
Yeah, yeah.

712
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
Is that how the system works?

713
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,460
Yeah, it's like D&D, so you can move at any point.

714
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,660
Okay, I just didn't know, I didn't know, because of the asynchronous element.

715
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,660
Yeah, no, understandable.

716
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,660
Yeah, you're good.

717
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:11,620
Okay, I'll go here and then I would like to I guess try to stealthily set a tripwire right in front of me

718
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,180
Okay, you have to use that in your next turn. Okay, that's fine. Yeah. All right, then I will be done. I love it

719
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,800
All right, great. All right, take off your headphones

720
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:27,260
Okay

721
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:30,300
All right, what's up

722
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:36,420
Now you tell me man you looks like you've tried to set up a some kind of like fire escape trap

723
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:42,540
Yes, so watch this or piece of fire exit stupid shit. That's fair

724
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:45,180
voice throwing megaphone

725
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:51,220
Okay, okay. I would like I believe it. He's trying to read my lips. It's not gonna work, buddy. I would like to

726
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,340
Put oh my god. He's like he's pacing

727
00:29:54,340 --> 00:30:00,100
He's so nervous about what I'm about to do to him. I would like to use my voice throwing megaphone

728
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,100
Okay.

729
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:05,620
To make it sound like I'm coming over the loudspeaker.

730
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,420
And I would like it to say, "Fire!

731
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,420
Fire!

732
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,220
There's a fire in the building!

733
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:13,500
There's a fucking giant fire in the kitchen!

734
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
Everybody out!

735
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Everybody out!"

736
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,960
Okay, I like that.

737
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:24,420
And then I would like to walk through the exit, the fire exit, and jump over the menu

738
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,020
that I know exactly where it is.

739
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,020
I placed it there.

740
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Okay, cool.

741
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,020
and make my way out of the building.

742
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:32,020
Okay, I like that.

743
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
Um...

744
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Okay, so here's what we're

745
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
going to have to do, because here's...

746
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,020
there's...

747
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:44,020
He's gonna know.

748
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,020
So, I want to help.

749
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,020
Let's workshop this. Like, cause you need to...

750
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:50,020
You need...

751
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,020
It needs to be like that you convince him.

752
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,020
So this is kind of like a performance

753
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:56,020
check. That his

754
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:58,980
insight check can either succeed or fail against.

755
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,860
So for you to be like,

756
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,580
it'll be someone throwing their voice,

757
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,640
but he has to believe it's not,

758
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,820
he has to believe it's you.

759
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,060
I'm trying to think, I guess what I'm trying to do is like,

760
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,060
I guess I could just hard, just do this hard.

761
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,500
- I just need you to sell it.

762
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,300
I need you to sell it.

763
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,460
- I think I can do that

764
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,580
if you roll a high enough performance check.

765
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:21,220
- I need you to make it seem like

766
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,540
this was a, one of your cute little twists.

767
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,380
- Yeah.

768
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,080
about to head to the second map.

769
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,060
- Roll a performance check. - He doesn't know.

770
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:30,900
He doesn't know.

771
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,180
He doesn't know what the fuck he's gotten into.

772
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,820
- You can roll a, you can do a whisper roll too.

773
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,780
I think, or you just roll to me.

774
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,260
- How do I do that?

775
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,740
- Let me make sure I remember how to do that.

776
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,580
Hold on.

777
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:46,860
Whisper roll 20.

778
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,980
So I think you could do that,

779
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:52,540
'cause I think that's fair to have you do that for this.

780
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,040
Uh...

781
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,540
Yeah, okay.

782
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,240
Slash... uh... W.

783
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,540
Okay.

784
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Um...

785
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:12,540
Slash W, and then space, GM.

786
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:15,540
Uh-huh.

787
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:17,540
Oh, wait, here. I'm an idiot. I'm an idiot.

788
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,540
Move over. You can roll the dice and only you and the GM can see.

789
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,740
GM roll just forward slash GM roll.

790
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
That's what you do.

791
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,340
And then do I just do I press enter or do I roll?

792
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,640
No, then you're gonna have to type in your

793
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,340
your performance like stat.

794
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,640
It's like going to be this.

795
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,040
It's one.

796
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:38,640
So it's going to be 1d20 for sure and then plus something

797
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,340
depending on what your character sheet says or minus.

798
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,440
Performance.

799
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,440
I think it's gonna be plus.

800
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,240
It's just one.

801
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,640
It's just one so it's gonna be 1d20 plus one.

802
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:47,940
Yeah.

803
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:48,340
Okay.

804
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:52,900
So this should only show up for me if it's /gmroll.

805
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,340
12. Not that good.

806
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,700
Okay. Not great, but not terrible either.

807
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:01,540
And then do that again for your jump over the menu though.

808
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:04,140
A performance again?

809
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,740
Yeah.

810
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,540
Yeah.

811
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,940
All right. This is going to be good.

812
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:12,540
Well, it didn't work out.

813
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,540
What do I do? GM roll?

814
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,340
Yeah, remember to do /gmroll and then 1d20+1.

815
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,340
1d20+1.

816
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,340
Yeah.

817
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:23,840
Hey, even worse.

818
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,340
Okay, cool.

819
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:28,840
Yeah, so you basically, yeah, you say it.

820
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,340
I'll try to match what you said.

821
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,340
And then when you jump over the menu,

822
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:40,840
you like, actually, it's like an inverse performance check.

823
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,840
You don't make it look natural.

824
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,840
You like pirouette over it.

825
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,320
(laughing)

826
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,120
- Okay, it looks a little too perfect.

827
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,960
- Yeah, yeah.

828
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,000
I think that's kinda how it is.

829
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,020
- Once I'm out of the building,

830
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,960
I would like to re-enter from the entrance when I can.

831
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,140
- Cool, that sounds good.

832
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:01,060
So yeah, move your guy, can he even go all the way out?

833
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,820
- Well here, just wait to bring him out

834
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:06,880
until you take him out when the fire starts.

835
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,880
- 'Cause he'll know it's up if I leave first.

836
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:10,920
- Yeah.

837
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,140
- Okay, cool.

838
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:15,880
-Okay, cool. Let's do it.

839
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,540
-All right. That's the end of my turn.

840
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,540
-All right.

841
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:22,540
-All right.

842
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:24,040
-Okay.

843
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,540
-Nice rolling, Caleb.

844
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:32,040
-You hear over the loudspeakers of the bar, Cameron.

845
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,040
-Okay.

846
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,040
-There's a fire in the building.

847
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,040
-No.

848
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,040
-Yes.

849
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,640
You start to see people getting to the door.

850
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:55,920
You see Caleb run to the door and do a little pirouette through it over the menu.

851
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,920
-Oh, I understand.

852
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:06,240
-I'm willing to wager here that the item that we share is either the hole or the trip wire

853
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,240
and that's what's the deal with the menu is.

854
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,840
I can't imagine I'm too far off with that.

855
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,940
- Yeah, I don't know.

856
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:16,880
Yeah, yeah.

857
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,080
- All right, well, I didn't see him move

858
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,300
or do anything before the loudspeaker went off.

859
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,000
- No, no, no.

860
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,800
- So he probably conceivably didn't set a fire

861
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,200
and there might not be a fire in here at all.

862
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,720
Well, is there an outside map?

863
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,720
If I what?

864
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,400
Yeah, he's just like outside the bar.

865
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,960
OK, all right.

866
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,800
Well.

867
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,560
You know, I, you know, I just

868
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,520
thought about his date with the police

869
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
officer.

870
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,500
I got to bring that back.

871
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,680
OK, because what going he was on a

872
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,720
date, I didn't tell you he was on

873
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,160
the day in the beginning with a female

874
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,160
police officer.

875
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,640
This.

876
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,640
Yeah. And the last episode or this

877
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
episode.

878
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,080
I totally forgot about her.

879
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:04,920
- Okay, well.

880
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,740
(laughing)

881
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,160
- Okay, sorry, he just.

882
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,620
- Thank you, yeah.

883
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:09,460
- Sorry.

884
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:10,480
- You're basically trying to make me lose my neck

885
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,040
giving me crucial information.

886
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,300
(laughing)

887
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,680
- Sorry, keep going, yeah.

888
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:20,760
- Okay, do I have any weapons?

889
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
Oh yeah, I have a bow and a,

890
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,060
can I see him out the door?

891
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,600
Or I guess I don't want anyone to see me.

892
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,440
Nevermind.

893
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,340
- Yeah, you don't want people to know

894
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,920
you're armed like a rogue.

895
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,120
- Are there any other exits?

896
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:31,960
'Cause it's, you know, you're supposed to have two exits.

897
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,400
- There's a front door exit.

898
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,520
Yeah, your front door exit.

899
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,840
Where, where's that?

900
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,940
Right here.

901
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,700
Right here.

902
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,200
Sorry, can you?

903
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,880
It's not working.

904
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,760
It might be covered up.

905
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,320
Far right.

906
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,840
You'll see it.

907
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,760
It's next to the bathrooms.

908
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,240
Oh, I see.

909
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,400
And I was covered by my character sheet.

910
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:50,960
Sorry about that.

911
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,120
Oh no worries.

912
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,200
Okay.

913
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,120
So he wants me to chase him, I guess.

914
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,400
Um, or maybe he's doing doubled psychology.

915
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,640
Either way, you know, I'm not really going to run.

916
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,360
Uh, I will leisurely walk.

917
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:07,460
Is everyone out at this point?

918
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,740
No, people are just starting to get running.

919
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,100
How long is my trip wire?

920
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:14,140
How long of a space can it reach?

921
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:16,580
It can be up to 15 feet long.

922
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,240
All right.

923
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,540
So I'm going to go ahead and is this guy right next to me?

924
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,680
Is he is he gone?

925
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,820
He's starting to run towards the fire exit.

926
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,220
All right. So he's not looking at me.

927
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,020
No, no, no.

928
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,320
All right.

929
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,960
I'm setting up the trip wire across these three squares to the left of my my tile.

930
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
I'm sorry.

931
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,960
I don't really want to click on them.

932
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Yeah, I know.

933
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
I know you're looking there.

934
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
I like to set it up there.

935
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
Cool.

936
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
One of my three tripwires, I guess.

937
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
To the left.

938
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Yeah, to the left.

939
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
To the left, to the left.

940
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
Okay, cool.

941
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
Let me ask you a question.

942
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
Has anyone else made it out of the fire exit yet?

943
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
This guy is

944
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,600
is starting to make his way out.

945
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,440
He's gonna go out.

946
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,360
- He's starting to make his way out?

947
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,200
- He's gonna go out at the end of time.

948
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,840
- So nobody's reached the menu yet.

949
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,160
- At the end of your turn.

950
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,040
- 'Cause I'd be pretty curious to see what happens

951
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,560
to everybody in this restaurant

952
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,340
when they cross over that menu.

953
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,000
And I just would like you to remember that maybe that's there.

954
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,120
- Yeah, no, I will. - 'Cause if my theory's right,

955
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,960
I'd like to see what happens here.

956
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,640
- It's at the end of your turn.

957
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,440
At the end of your turn, I'll let you know what happens.

958
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,200
- All right, yeah. - Your next turn, yeah.

959
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,760
- And is there anything else I can do?

960
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,280
Do I have any more types of actions I can take?

961
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,880
- Besides setting up the tripwire. - Not right now, no.

962
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,080
The only thing is that I will say that like...

963
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,680
Alright, you're waiting to set the tripwire

964
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,180
after people have gone by you, right?

965
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:37,680
- Yeah, I don't want anyone to trip on it. - Okay, cool.

966
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,680
- This is kind of like a failsafe. - Then I'll allow that to happen.

967
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
Like this guy is already over here,

968
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,180
this guy is already going this way.

969
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,480
Yeah, I'm just trying to... I'm basically...

970
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,180
I'm setting up a spider's web.

971
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,480
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

972
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,080
- More than anything, yeah. - Alright.

973
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,580
- You're gonna do your turn? - Yeah, I'm gonna end my turn.

974
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,880
You're gonna see this guy disappear.

975
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,680
You're gonna see this guy disappear.

976
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,480
Disappear, not go through the door, but disappear.

977
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,040
You're gonna see this guy disappear.

978
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,440
All right, yeah, I thought that that might be the case.

979
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,840
You're gonna see this guy disappear.

980
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,080
(laughing)

981
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:17,000
What's going on, you guys?

982
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,600
Okay.

983
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,880
All right, okay.

984
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,720
Good one, K.

985
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,440
(laughing)

986
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,480
I'm sorry.

987
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,560
- Okay, listen, I would like--

988
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:31,680
- Four people call me a person with a child's brain.

989
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:35,040
I do not have a single damage item.

990
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,520
All of my items are trickery and illusion.

991
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,000
- You do, here's the other thing too though.

992
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,180
Like, so I thought that was really clever.

993
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,640
I think something we might wanna,

994
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,160
I'm gonna think about doing this,

995
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,800
'cause it's one of those things where it's like,

996
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,400
how much do you hand it over to the player's own intellect

997
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,800
as much as you go, your character fails an insight check.

998
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,600
So next time I might, I'll do something like that

999
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,880
to just see how that plays out.

1000
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,920
I liked doing that, that was fun.

1001
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,000
Yeah, you just made like four patrons disappear.

1002
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,040
Your date is, your date vanished too.

1003
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,280
She's just gonna run through the hall.

1004
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,680
- Okay, well then you know what?

1005
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,440
I'd like to walk back in to the bar,

1006
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,920
through the fire exit and go like,

1007
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,840
what the hell, where'd everyone go?

1008
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,520
And then I'll just go sit down at the bar.

1009
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,760
I'm gonna go sit right there.

1010
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,600
- Okay, cool.

1011
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,680
Yeah, all right.

1012
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,520
All right, cool.

1013
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,340
(laughing)

1014
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,640
- Wait, let me, hold on, let me look at, wait, no, no.

1015
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,480
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1016
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,880
- Hold on. - Wait, no, no, no, no.

1017
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,960
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1018
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,440
- And then?

1019
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,760
- You have weapons, you can prepare attacks.

1020
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,120
- You know what I'm gonna do?

1021
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
- What are you gonna do?

1022
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,160
- Can I move the portable pole?

1023
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,960
- What you did achieve doing

1024
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,300
is that everybody is out of here.

1025
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,640
So if you start attacking him,

1026
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,960
like you're okay to do that at this point.

1027
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:58,360
I'm going to sit down at the bar and just look directly, just straight ahead, right?

1028
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:03,720
And can I place the, can I sneak the portable hole right behind me on this

1029
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,480
tile, right behind my bar stool?

1030
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:10,320
As if, if somebody were to come stab me in the back, maybe they would

1031
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,480
fall into this portable hole.

1032
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:15,560
Do a slight of hand as you pick it up with the menu.

1033
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,180
Okay.

1034
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:16,640
Hold on.

1035
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,320
And GM whisper, whisper that to me.

1036
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:19,560
Yeah.

1037
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Let's do that from now on.

1038
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
Gmwhisper d20

1039
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,960
Gmwhisper

1040
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:34,240
Gmroll right? Yeah, yeah, gmroll d20 plus 7. Yeah, your sleight of hand's great. Oh

1041
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,920
Crit one man

1042
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,960
That's sucks. It just happens every time

1043
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:45,480
You really do get pretty bad rolls, man

1044
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:51,100
Damn, okay. I fall into it and I die? No, not quite.

1045
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,240
You pick it up

1046
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,640
I hear I think you think you picking up the menu with the hole and the menu falls in the hole and you're just like

1047
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:02,680
Whistling holding the hole and just place it behind you. Just very clear

1048
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:06,280
All right. Well, I guess my turn's over. Okay

1049
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,240
All right

1050
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:13,320
Okay, so Caleb

1051
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,680
-After everybody falls into something.

1052
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,680
-Yes, into something beneath that menu.

1053
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,000
-Yes.

1054
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,680
Caleb pirouettes back in and says, "What the hell just happened?"

1055
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,600
Then he picks up the menu, but the menu falls into a hole.

1056
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,440
He's just carrying a hole.

1057
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,120
He goes, "Oops," and places it right behind him.

1058
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,440
He's just sitting at the bar.

1059
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,280
-It's right behind him?

1060
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,440
-It's right behind him.

1061
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,100
Nobody's in here, right?

1062
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,560
Nobody's in here anymore.

1063
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,360
I tried to stress that to him.

1064
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,760
OK, I'm going to shoot him hard enough

1065
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,400
that he falls backwards into the hole.

1066
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:56,840
I would like to shoot him with my what's my ranged weapon here?

1067
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,200
I'd like to do a special role where the emphasis is not on damage,

1068
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:02,100
but pushing him back one square back.

1069
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,080
Yeah.

1070
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,920
Oh, I wonder we can call this a shove action.

1071
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,880
I'll have you roll.

1072
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,780
Let's have him like I got.

1073
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,580
Listen, I got a hammer in my inventory.

1074
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,260
I'll throw that.

1075
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,560
I just I want to push him back five feet.

1076
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:22,420
Like in D&D, technically, not getting some knock back is like a,

1077
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,400
you know, an added thing.

1078
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:27,260
So what we can do.

1079
00:43:27,260 --> 00:43:33,160
Is. Let's have you

1080
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:36,700
let's have you roll a yeah, OK, you can throw your hammer at him

1081
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,280
and try to knock him back.

1082
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,240
Let's have you just roll a

1083
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,880
Definitely just roll it, I guess, like a athletics check.

1084
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,340
Let's just do athletics first before I do that real quick.

1085
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,720
Can I can I this is a bar in the middle, right?

1086
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,380
Yeah, I just bought this bar.

1087
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,020
So I have nice cover first.

1088
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,320
Yeah, sure.

1089
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:00,660
Just just top like right, right here. Yeah.

1090
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,320
All right. I'll do that.

1091
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,500
And now I'll do my athletics check.

1092
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,900
And do forward slash.

1093
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,440
OK, that's fine.

1094
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,880
Okay. You keep your headphones on, okay?

1095
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,380
Okay.

1096
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:15,380
This is just happening now.

1097
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:20,760
Your thumb is not in the frame.

1098
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,260
Sorry.

1099
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,260
You're hurting your thumb.

1100
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,260
I was going like that? Yeah, that's cool.

1101
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,260
You were fisting the cam.

1102
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,260
I thought you were hurting me.

1103
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:31,260
You're both going to have your headphones on now.

1104
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:33,260
No.

1105
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:37,260
I need you to roll a dexterity saving throw.

1106
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,260
This will be easy for sure.

1107
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,600
- I need this so bad, please.

1108
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:42,440
(laughing)

1109
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,760
Please give this to me.

1110
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:44,600
(laughing)

1111
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,220
- Dude, what the fuck did I tell you?

1112
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,940
I just rolled two crit ones in a row.

1113
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,060
Something is happening.

1114
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,360
Something is happening.

1115
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,200
Cameron, Cameron.

1116
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,020
- Tell him what just happened.

1117
00:44:55,020 --> 00:44:57,440
- I told you, I told you.

1118
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:58,780
- So he saw you--

1119
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,620
- Your plan sucks dick, bro.

1120
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,360
I had the same item as you and my plan was so much better.

1121
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,540
- He saw you pure wet in and go,

1122
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,780
"What the hell happened?"

1123
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,620
And then pick up a whole bunch of stuff.

1124
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,620
Pick up a hole and put it behind you

1125
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:15,660
He jumped over the bar and threw a hammer at your head and knocked you into the hole

1126
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:23,960
That's fine, you know what I'm over these the items I got were terrible I'm over this episode

1127
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,100
Wait, I have wait. I have I have a can I do a victory pose? I'll die forever in the hall

1128
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:31,100
I have an important victory pose to do

1129
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:36,660
After I do that, I stand up on the bar and I shake my head around and all the milk sprays out of my mouth

1130
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:41,260
Wait, hold on. Make him roll dexterity and if he loses he falls into the hole also.

1131
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,060
I'm not anywhere near the hole.

1132
00:45:43,060 --> 00:45:44,260
He's not near the hole.

1133
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:49,860
So what he did is he put the magic hole in his mouth, Caleb, and he drank all the milk out of it.

1134
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:52,660
Wasn't sure what he was gonna do with that, but it's pretty funny.

1135
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:58,860
Well, here's my plan was that maybe the bar had some type of blowtorch where they do some kind of flaming moe type drink

1136
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:03,060
and I could shoot scalding milk at you and burn you from my mouth.

1137
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,260
You could have ordered a flaming drink.

1138
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:10,320
Probably would have done if it wasn't for that hole if the hole didn't work. I probably would have thrown my voice to death

1139
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,880
That's what I would have done to you. This is the only other fucking item that he gave me

1140
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,820
All right next time. I'll try to even use any of my items

1141
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:22,300
I use the hammer at me. I didn't know we had hammers. It's in the character

1142
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,460
So you have like you have a bunch of thieves

1143
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:34,220
So here's what we could do. We can do that. We'll have you have one mulligan

1144
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,220
So you know one one we roll

1145
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:43,660
Of an item no you don't think so item. Oh an item. Yeah single item. No not a whole round fuck that let's do

1146
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,380
The second thing to also Cameron which I told to Caleb is like I think

1147
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:51,260
I'm gonna try to instead of being like

1148
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:53,900
You have to buy

1149
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,800
Caleb's crap it's gonna be like you're good characters gonna roll against an insight check on something

1150
00:46:58,800 --> 00:46:59,640
- Okay.

1151
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,360
- 'Cause it becomes, I don't know,

1152
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,200
we're gonna see if that works.

1153
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:03,280
- I think that makes the most sense

1154
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,520
because it's otherwise we're just,

1155
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,360
- You're just like, you're just, yeah.

1156
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,900
- Anything is 100% suspicious.

1157
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,140
- Yeah, yeah.

1158
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:12,200
So we have to do that and you have to just like behave as if.

1159
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,040
- I did, yeah.

1160
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:14,660
I do think it was really funny

1161
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,960
that you put the hole in the door

1162
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,040
and then did the fire alarm

1163
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,720
so I saw every single person in the restaurant

1164
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:21,560
falling into the hole.

1165
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:24,360
- I thought that maybe you would be a brave soul

1166
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,920
and you would go in first.

1167
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,740
- My metagaming was I knew that you had

1168
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:29,500
one of the same items as me.

1169
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,300
So I thought maybe it could be the whole,

1170
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:33,340
or the other thing I had was a trip wire.

1171
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:35,220
So I was like, there's no way I'm running anywhere.

1172
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:38,580
- Oh yeah, that's good.

1173
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,380
All right, let's go to the next map.

1174
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,620
- This time I'll try to dumb it down a little.

1175
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:46,600
- I will smart my stuff up.

1176
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,740
- Okay, cool.

1177
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:51,100
All right.

1178
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,820
Whoa.

1179
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:54,500
- Boobies, okay.

1180
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,900
- Oh yeah, sorry, I didn't clean that up

1181
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,700
from whenever you guys-- - Is this a laboratory?

1182
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:59,700
This is an office now.

1183
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,700
It's a laboratory.

1184
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,700
Oh wait, this is the exact floor plan of our office.

1185
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,700
It's kind of crazy.

1186
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,700
I don't really like this being public.

1187
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,700
I don't know when you guys...

1188
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:11,700
I didn't realize that when I was adding it in here. I'm sorry.

1189
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,700
You guys are at the office.

1190
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,700
You're coworkers now.

1191
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,700
In this classic spy vs. spy type of...

1192
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
like y'all, you know each other

1193
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,700
in this scenario.

1194
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,700
Dwight and Jim.

1195
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,700
A Dwight and Jim situation.

1196
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:29,200
- Wait, that's what it should have been.

1197
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,300
(laughing)

1198
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:34,140
- Yeah, let's reskin it completely.

1199
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:36,020
- Yeah, this one is Jim versus Dwight.

1200
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:37,180
I'm Jim.

1201
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,340
- Yeah, okay, I'll be Dwight.

1202
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,180
- All right, okay, cool.

1203
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:44,980
So, okay, and then here's Michael Scott over here.

1204
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,860
- Okay.

1205
00:48:45,860 --> 00:48:49,180
- Pam is just in the general boobies area.

1206
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,020
- I go to Pam.

1207
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:53,180
- You know, I go to Pam, yeah, okay.

1208
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,760
- Both of you guys roll your 3D20s.

1209
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:57,600
- All right.

1210
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,140
- 5, 14, 11.

1211
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,480
- How did you roll so fast?

1212
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,860
- You click D20.

1213
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,860
Oh, now he wants to come to the master.

1214
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,160
Well, I'll let you figure that out, big guy.

1215
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,240
- You click, what?

1216
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,900
Oh, I found it all by myself.

1217
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,300
- Okay, you got five.

1218
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,980
- Okay, so.

1219
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,100
- 5, 14, 11.

1220
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,460
Okay.

1221
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,460
and I got 16, 17, 5.

1222
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:27,460
God damn, we have the same item again.

1223
00:49:27,460 --> 00:49:29,460
I know, it's scaring me type.

1224
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:32,460
Crazy guy.

1225
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:34,460
It's scaring me type.

1226
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:38,460
Oh, you guys both got 5. Okay.

1227
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:43,460
And then 14 and 11. Okay.

1228
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,460
I got 1000.

1229
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,460
You did not.

1230
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:50,460
It's a game of bluffing.

1231
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,460
This is the game of bluffing, so anything goes.

1232
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:59,460
Goddammit.

1233
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:05,460
Man...

1234
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,460
Sorry, it's formatting.

1235
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,460
Sorry, formatting.

1236
00:50:09,460 --> 00:50:16,460
Formatting is probably one of the most significant things of the modern era. Anybody agree?

1237
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:22,300
the

1238
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:32,140
fifth

1239
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:39,140
the

1240
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:46,700
And tell me how the fuck Mia Khalifa is news nowadays? Is it because she's getting...

1241
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,700
Well, because she was poolside.

1242
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:49,700
Mm-hmm.

1243
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:53,820
Oh, so now every time that a porn star goes poolside, we hear about it?

1244
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,540
Well, not every time, but sometimes you do.

1245
00:50:56,540 --> 00:51:02,180
I'm gonna turn on... my parents are gonna turn on the news and see this? This is what passes for news in this country?

1246
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,180
I mean, I guess, yeah.

1247
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:06,180
Jesus Christ.

1248
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:11,180
All of the major news outlets and Mia Khalifa went bullseye.

1249
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:15,340
What the hell, her breasts are out.

1250
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,680
- What the hell are breasts?

1251
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,180
- Well, I need to go to sleep.

1252
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:23,380
- All right, got yours.

1253
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:27,460
- I guess it makes more sense for that to be news

1254
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,820
than Mia Khalifa is filming a new porn video

1255
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,980
because she probably does that all the time.

1256
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:32,820
- True.

1257
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,060
- Oh man, you got-- - Probably flood the news.

1258
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,740
- You're saying she's a slut.

1259
00:51:35,740 --> 00:51:36,240
Yeah.

1260
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,440
Yeah, you might say that.

1261
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,340
You could say that.

1262
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,440
You might say that.

1263
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,540
I'm not sure I would but one might say that.

1264
00:51:44,540 --> 00:51:46,740
All right, who goes first?

1265
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,040
Roll.

1266
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:49,040
We didn't roll you.

1267
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:51,540
Fuck me.

1268
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,740
I almost got your items.

1269
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,740
In the meantime, it's annoying.

1270
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,540
It's just others.

1271
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,740
I've rolled a 12.

1272
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:01,240
Six.

1273
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,940
You got a 12.

1274
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:02,740
God damn it.

1275
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:05,040
We're going to do the exact same thing with the item that we both

1276
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:07,040
I know it.

1277
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,040
Let's just agree to not use the item that we both have.

1278
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,040
No, I'm gonna use it.

1279
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:15,040
Let's do a no items round.

1280
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,040
Shake on it.

1281
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,040
No.

1282
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,040
Shake on it right now that you won't use any items.

1283
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:23,040
I promise not to use any items.

1284
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:25,040
See, I'm promising right now.

1285
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,040
I like my items this time.

1286
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:29,040
I have deece items.

1287
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,040
I didn't even see mine yet.

1288
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,040
How come you're giving him more time to prep his items

1289
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:35,540
then you're giving me time to prep with mine.

1290
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:39,180
- 'Cause it's not a problem for me to read.

1291
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,240
- Well, who got the initiative hire?

1292
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,080
Cameron did. - Me, Cameron did.

1293
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,160
- I see. - So I'm gonna need

1294
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,360
a second here to read this.

1295
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:45,680
- Yeah, take a second.

1296
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:47,400
- Okay, so my first item.

1297
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,440
- All right, I'm taking my fucking headphones off.

1298
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:54,040
- Yeah, you got the-- - Okay.

1299
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:56,680
- I didn't wanna say this to Caleb.

1300
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:57,520
- Yeah.

1301
00:52:57,520 --> 00:52:59,520
- You got the most broken item in the game,

1302
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,680
which is the anvil.

1303
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,320
- Oh my God. - That is just...

1304
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,660
- Wait, what's the range?

1305
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,680
- It's anywhere.

1306
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,560
- It's worms, bunker buster vibes?

1307
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,260
- Yeah, precisely.

1308
00:53:12,260 --> 00:53:13,360
- Wow. - Oh, wow.

1309
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:14,660
- Haven't had that thought.

1310
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,560
- We should do a worms D&D.

1311
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,360
(laughing)

1312
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,800
- It's all from the side view.

1313
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,840
(laughing)

1314
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,160
- I would love that, actually.

1315
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,160
- All right, so this is the office.

1316
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:27,120
And he's all the way over here.

1317
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,240
So we don't even have a line of sight

1318
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,840
to each other right now, right?

1319
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:30,720
- No. - So first of all,

1320
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,560
where are the exits here?

1321
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:33,680
- You do have to be able to see him, I will say.

1322
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,520
- Yeah, yeah.

1323
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,780
(laughing)

1324
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:42,320
- What's the point here where I can see him all the way?

1325
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,580
(laughing)

1326
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:45,420
- The furthest point where I can.

1327
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:47,480
- He's like, yeah, it's like all these different,

1328
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:49,960
you're like, if you get on like a stool or something

1329
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,320
and you can see over all the office cubicles.

1330
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,880
- What's the button for ruler?

1331
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:56,840
- Oh, what?

1332
00:53:56,840 --> 00:54:00,360
- Sorry, I'm just trying to do line of sight here.

1333
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:03,360
Yeah, that's...

1334
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,360
That's one of the sites. I guess it's just there.

1335
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:11,360
If you go up the stairs, you could just see him.

1336
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:14,360
Really?

1337
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:17,360
Okay, let's do it. There's no one near him either.

1338
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:22,360
He just got into work. You're just taking off.

1339
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,360
I'm just doing my Dwight shirt shit.

1340
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:29,360
Alright, just doing some Dwight shit. Just go up the...

1341
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:36,680
All right, hold on all right just I'm going I'm I say loudly just have to do some Dwight stuff

1342
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:47,280
Forward slash GM roll 2d 6 all one word. Yeah, GM roll. Yeah

1343
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:52,240
Christ okay

1344
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:58,600
And I guess he's gonna have to do a deck saving throw all right

1345
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:02,360
- Which is gonna, yeah, he's not gonna, all right.

1346
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,200
He might, but he's gonna take half damage either way.

1347
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,340
Okay, yeah, all right, cool, all right.

1348
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:11,840
Okay.

1349
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:18,380
Oh, sorry, I forgot to do thumbs up.

1350
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:22,200
- Am I dead already?

1351
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,160
- Not yet.

1352
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,400
Okay, so.

1353
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,400
(sighs)

1354
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,660
- All right, roll a dexterity saving throw.

1355
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:37,600
- Do I have to?

1356
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,040
I got a crit one last time I did this.

1357
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,120
- You gotta do it again.

1358
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,640
- 18!

1359
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,960
- Very nice, okay.

1360
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,080
- Fuck you, Cameron, fuck you!

1361
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,580
- So this is what happens.

1362
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:52,680
You see, you're just sort of like hanging out

1363
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,000
in the office doing gym stuff.

1364
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,840
You hear very far in the distance, you hear,

1365
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:00,060
I'm just off to do some Dwight shit.

1366
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:05,060
And then an anvil falls out of the sky

1367
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:09,640
and you just dodge roll it in time.

1368
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,540
Oh yeah.

1369
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,840
That you only get beat up by it a little bit.

1370
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,500
You kind of like get knocked around a little bit,

1371
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,160
you don't get squashed.

1372
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:21,020
So you take four, you take four damage.

1373
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:23,680
Okay, I'm at nine.

1374
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:25,680
You wanna play ball Cameron? Let's play ball.

1375
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,320
Yeah, and you see some people you see Oscar

1376
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:34,160
Roll up and he's like "Los Cientos"

1377
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:52,160
Okay, what does he say?

1378
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,160
Besides Lucien Jones.

1379
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:58,060
He says, uh, he says

1380
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:03,360
He says, "Oh my god, what happened to you, Jim?"

1381
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:09,760
Um, I think Dwight might be up to one of his old pranks again.

1382
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:13,240
You hate Dwight, right?

1383
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:19,240
Dwight is the worst. Dwight's the worst man. I fucking hate Dwight. Okay, listen. Yeah, you gonna do me a favor?

1384
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:25,340
Absolutely, Jim. Will you find Dwight and tell him that Pam needs to talk to him?

1385
00:57:25,340 --> 00:57:33,000
Yeah, that's not a problem. Thank you so much. Okay, he runs off, right? I'd like to go over to Pam's desk.

1386
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,280
Okay.

1387
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,800
Pam's desk. Where's girl? I have the girl here.

1388
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:42,000
She's like

1389
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,280
"Gotta do it next turn, man. She's too far."

1390
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:52,120
You can get it like shouting distance like you can get um, let me see

1391
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,940
You can get here and her desk is like

1392
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:01,480
Like she's over like here. Okay, so you're within like I'll just call her

1393
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:04,540
Okay. Yeah, do you have a go over there?

1394
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:10,260
Yeah, I'm gonna go right here, okay, all right, I'm gonna call her

1395
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,020
Okay

1396
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:17,380
Hey, baby girl, how are you?

1397
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:19,700
I'm good. How are you?

1398
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:27,360
Yeah, I'm doing all right. Hey, listen, I'm trying to kill Dwight. He tried to drop an anvil onto my body luckily

1399
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:31,960
Very spry special forces type guy so I died. Mm-hmm

1400
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:34,060
No

1401
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:36,060
Here's what I'm gonna do. You're in a cubicle. Yes

1402
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:41,860
Mm-hmm. All right, so there's an open top. So I'm gonna throw these things. They're called

1403
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,740
Caltrops, I'm gonna throw them over there

1404
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:48,240
OK. OK.

1405
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:51,940
If you wouldn't mind, baby girl, just kind of set them in front of the door

1406
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:56,680
and be expecting a visit from Dwight.

1407
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,640
Okey dokey.

1408
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,940
Thanks so much. I love you.

1409
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,840
Bye bye. I know you do.

1410
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:06,000
And then and you're going to tell us

1411
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,040
Oscar's going to tell him that Pam wants to talk to him.

1412
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,080
OK. And I'm so I'm going to throw these things over. Got it.

1413
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,400
Yeah. You threw them over there right in front of the door.

1414
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,400
They're hidden.

1415
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
Cool.

1416
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:20,400
I'm just going to set up my phone.

1417
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
He's going to do some checks.

1418
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:22,400
All right, cool.

1419
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,400
Wow, that's classic Jim.

1420
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
Okay.

1421
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,400
All right.

1422
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
Okay.

1423
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,400
All right.

1424
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:37,160
You hear a thump, a thud.

1425
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:40,720
He rolls away.

1426
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,720
He's limping now.

1427
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,400
You hear Jim limping in the office.

1428
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:46,600
Yeah, and as Dwight that makes me joyful.

1429
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,600
Yeah, Dwight is happy about that.

1430
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:50,600
You get, um...

1431
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:52,600
You, uh...

1432
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,600
Oscar

1433
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,600
comes up to you.

1434
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,600
And he says to you,

1435
00:59:58,600 --> 01:00:02,100
"Dwight, Pam needs to see you in her office."

1436
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,100
Okay.

1437
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,100
Yeah.

1438
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,100
Am I rolling an insight on this?

1439
01:00:08,100 --> 01:00:10,100
Yeah, roll insight on that.

1440
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:12,100
Alright, how do I roll a stat privately?

1441
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:13,800
I guess it doesn't matter so much.

1442
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:17,300
Just forward slash GM role and then just add the insight.

1443
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:21,340
That's all all I know about how to do it.

1444
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:22,840
All right, cool.

1445
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,780
And a 20 plus four.

1446
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:30,580
OK, that's an 11.

1447
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,420
Yeah, you don't suspect anything.

1448
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:33,880
I don't suspect anything.

1449
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,660
No, I mean, it's just a thing that would happen.

1450
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:38,460
Yeah, yeah. I'm like, all right.

1451
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:41,960
So am I following Oscar or or am I just going?

1452
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,440
No, you're just going to go to the office.

1453
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:44,580
All right. Where's the office?

1454
01:00:44,580 --> 01:00:48,280
It's over here is where Pam's office is right near boobies,

1455
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:49,840
right near boobies.

1456
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,760
OK, well, I will start on my way there.

1457
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,360
Yeah, it's going to take you some time.

1458
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,200
It's going to take me a long time.

1459
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,520
It's going to take you like eight turns.

1460
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,440
Is there anything you want to do, though?

1461
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:04,600
To with the. Yeah, can you tell me?

1462
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:06,240
All right, so.

1463
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,160
Cool. First off, I'm here, right?

1464
01:01:09,560 --> 01:01:11,560
I want to put down some...

1465
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:14,160
Cow traps.

1466
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,460
Okay.

1467
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:17,860
Um...

1468
01:01:17,860 --> 01:01:19,960
Familiar with the stuff.

1469
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:23,460
Yeah, and I would love to put them down...

1470
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:27,460
Uh, hmm.

1471
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:34,560
If I put them down on a spot that I'm gonna have to walk through, is there gonna be an issue with me?

1472
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,660
No, you'll know where they are.

1473
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:39,540
- So it'll be okay if I throw them in front of me

1474
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:40,760
and then I walk through them next turn,

1475
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:41,920
I won't have any risk?

1476
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:44,040
- If you know where they are, you're fine.

1477
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,540
- All right, I'm gonna go ahead and throw them at the,

1478
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,920
do you see the two squares to my right

1479
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:50,240
that have the plus sign pattern on them?

1480
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:51,920
- I mean, you should roll like a,

1481
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:53,080
you should roll like a,

1482
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:57,200
I'll say this, you should roll like a fuckin',

1483
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,840
just a straight dex check with advantage.

1484
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:01,680
- Okay. - 'Cause you know

1485
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:03,960
where they are, but yeah.

1486
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,920
- All right, but not to throw them down, just to cross them?

1487
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:07,840
Yeah, just across them.

1488
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,280
Yeah. OK, so I'm throwing them down.

1489
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,520
Yeah, throw them down.

1490
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,560
I mean, like nobody's paying attention to you.

1491
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,520
This is the office.

1492
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:15,360
It's a little different than the bar.

1493
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,840
Let's put it that way.

1494
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:20,000
OK, so I'm going to throw them down at this.

1495
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,840
This bottleneck right there.

1496
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,840
OK, cool. I know where you're from, which also.

1497
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:28,840
Yeah, I'm going just to be clear, I'm going up on on the upper side of this block.

1498
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:31,400
Like I'm going over here, right?

1499
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:32,840
I don't know how to make. I'm right.

1500
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,040
I know. Oh, yes.

1501
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:36,600
That's where you're going. Yeah. OK.

1502
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:37,860
All right.

1503
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:41,460
Yeah, then I'm going to throw them down at that like square in that square.

1504
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,240
Bottle neck. OK, got it.

1505
01:02:43,240 --> 01:02:45,300
OK, I know exactly where you're saying.

1506
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,740
Cool. That's fine.

1507
01:02:47,740 --> 01:02:51,780
OK, and I also want a quick report of what in my immediate vicinity

1508
01:02:51,780 --> 01:02:53,880
is made out of metal.

1509
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,120
OK, cool.

1510
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:59,020
Any of the computers, staplers

1511
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,720
like the.

1512
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:03,660
So there's just generally stuff around.

1513
01:03:03,660 --> 01:03:04,660
There's generally stuff around.

1514
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,800
That's OK. All right. That's fine.

1515
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,840
Then I'm done. Yeah.

1516
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:12,340
And you see Stanley and he looks at you and he goes, Hmm, Stanley.

1517
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:15,240
Uh huh. Mm hmm. OK.

1518
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:17,680
And Kevin's dropped the chili.

1519
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:21,940
No, man, no. All right. OK. Turn.

1520
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:25,580
Hello, mate.

1521
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:28,240
All right. Yeah.

1522
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:29,800
So that was your turn.

1523
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:33,140
You're on. You've been on your phone. What's going on?

1524
01:03:33,140 --> 01:03:36,540
I'm checking out just pictures of Pam that I took.

1525
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:38,980
Guys are pictures.

1526
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:43,060
Picture of her cooking, pictures of her cleaning,

1527
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:45,340
kind of imagining our future life together.

1528
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:48,040
That's awesome. This is early office.

1529
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:48,880
Right.

1530
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:50,980
Is she still dating, what was his name?

1531
01:03:50,980 --> 01:03:52,100
Is it Roy?

1532
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,300
Rudd, Roy.

1533
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:55,500
Roy, was it Rudd?

1534
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,820
No, it was Roy.

1535
01:03:57,820 --> 01:03:59,180
It was Roy, okay.

1536
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,720
All right, so that sucks.

1537
01:04:01,720 --> 01:04:07,400
Cause I probably, you probably want to be dating her, but what do you want to do also?

1538
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:11,840
Well, we, you know, we have a crush, which is pretty cool. Um, let me look at my items

1539
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:19,120
one last time. I made the office too big. Yeah. The office is huge, mate. It's so big.

1540
01:04:19,120 --> 01:04:28,560
Um, Cameron is over there. My defense is from another campaign. There's no, there's no,

1541
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:32,960
There's no area of effect on this pocket mirror of mind reading, huh?

1542
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,600
No, it has to catch somebody's eye

1543
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:46,400
Okay, there are other office characters though, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know but I want to talk to this guy that's near Cameron

1544
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:49,800
You know what? Maybe I let's see. How far is this?

1545
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,560
God this is the biggest

1546
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,360
I'm a too big

1547
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,760
So I can walk here.

1548
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,760
Uh-huh.

1549
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,760
And I have, what, 15, 20 foot arms?

1550
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:07,760
Uh, you can use your dash action too to get there faster, but

1551
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,760
you won't then get to be able to take an action.

1552
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:11,760
You know what I mean?

1553
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,760
I just want to, this guy right here, I would really, really, really like to read his mind.

1554
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:19,760
This white guy. Or is that, that's Oscar.

1555
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,760
That's Stanley.

1556
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,760
Oh, that's Stanley? Yeah, I want to read Stanley's mind so badly, man.

1557
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:31,000
Oh wait, do I have a donut? He's fat.

1558
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,600
Yeah man, you got a donut.

1559
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,720
All right, I stick the mirror in the donut and I just kind of toss it to like,

1560
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,720
like how can I ping?

1561
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,680
Without him noticing you mean?

1562
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:45,600
No, no, he can notice.

1563
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:49,040
Oh cool. Just like you hold it down. That's all.

1564
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:52,640
Okay, yeah. I kind of toss it over here about 10 feet.

1565
01:05:52,640 --> 01:06:03,760
Okay. Or you know what I do? I use the mirror like a plate and I slide it across the ground

1566
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:09,800
with the donut on top. It looks like a little serving plate. Okay. I like that. All right.

1567
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:19,840
All right. I'm going to roll for Stanley. See if he gets duped by that. He's very wise,

1568
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:28,000
so he's decent wisdom but he falls for it though anyway. Yeah. So he goes he moves

1569
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:35,600
he looks he goes Stanley and he starts walking towards the donut mirror and you

1570
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:44,760
hear his thoughts and his thoughts are Dwight through something weird. That's it?

1571
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:54,080
and then just back to donut donut donut. Yeah, Dwight did something weird on the ground. It's

1572
01:06:54,080 --> 01:07:02,920
gonna be those caltrops. I know he has them and he knows I have them too. Let's see. He

1573
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:07,240
doesn't probably know. You're probably more familiar with the items. No, but he knows it

1574
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:11,400
because he knows.

1575
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:15,360
Because of the order that you sent him in.

1576
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,560
Yeah, maybe. Yeah.

1577
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:19,560
That's how I figured it out.

1578
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:25,720
All right. Well, I already used my movement and my item,

1579
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,320
so I think I will just...

1580
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:32,400
That mirror can be used every turn though still.

1581
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,840
So if you want. Okay, cool.

1582
01:07:34,840 --> 01:07:38,040
So you can use it to take advantage of people.

1583
01:07:38,040 --> 01:07:40,520
Here, wait, let me call Pam real quick.

1584
01:07:40,520 --> 01:07:42,760
Okay, ring, ring, ring.

1585
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:43,600
Hi.

1586
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:46,600
What up, baby?

1587
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:47,440
How you doing?

1588
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,760
Did Dwight end up stopping by and dying?

1589
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,680
You know, he's coming by, it's just at every turn,

1590
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,060
they have to move 30 feet.

1591
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:57,640
So he's on his way.

1592
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,080
Oh, okay, I forget about that office rule.

1593
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,560
His office is so big.

1594
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:03,920
Yeah, yeah, we really should have made the office smaller.

1595
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,840
It's only six or seven people who work here.

1596
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:06,680
It's kind of absurd.

1597
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:08,000
Yeah, it's pretty wild.

1598
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:11,960
Well, if you wouldn't mind, maybe--

1599
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:14,080
We might even, if you guys don't come up

1600
01:08:14,080 --> 01:08:17,340
with new stuff to do, we might even just

1601
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:20,360
make you guys move faster for the rest of the round.

1602
01:08:20,360 --> 01:08:21,920
That would be pretty neat.

1603
01:08:21,920 --> 01:08:24,320
That's actually a pretty good idea, Pam.

1604
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,640
Yeah.

1605
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:26,480
Oh no, don't--

1606
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:27,520
I'm not Pam.

1607
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:31,000
Okay, well, will you do me a favor?

1608
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:31,840
Yes.

1609
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:37,080
No, he's Dwight's gay if you flash your tits out of the doorway he won't care

1610
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,440
Okay

1611
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:41,440
Just sit there and look pretty baby

1612
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:44,160
Okay

1613
01:08:44,160 --> 01:08:56,040
All right, so what's going on it's to dig a new office rule

1614
01:08:56,040 --> 01:08:59,360
where everyone has a

1615
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:04,080
a lot more movement because this is crazy.

1616
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,240
Yeah, really?

1617
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:10,080
Like, but you did see Stanley just sort of wander away.

1618
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:16,280
And look, he's looking down at something, but you don't know what

1619
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,620
Stanley is. Yeah.

1620
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,620
OK, I don't care about Stanley.

1621
01:09:21,620 --> 01:09:24,420
OK, well,

1622
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:27,680
how much more movement do I?

1623
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:30,120
I'll say you can make it to Pam's office this turn.

1624
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:32,220
I think it's crazy to.

1625
01:09:32,220 --> 01:09:35,360
Make that take too much longer.

1626
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:40,200
OK, on the way, I'd like to throw down another set of Cal traps.

1627
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,900
OK, behind me. Oh, wait, I also have to roll, right?

1628
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:46,060
To get through my.

1629
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:48,640
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1630
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,900
All right. Just a dex roll or a dex save.

1631
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:52,980
Just a dex check.

1632
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,980
I mean, can we get acrobatics or whatever?

1633
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:57,680
Like acrobat, you might proficiency in that.

1634
01:09:57,680 --> 01:09:58,180
So do that.

1635
01:09:58,180 --> 01:09:59,980
I don't, but I'll do it anyway.

1636
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,980
And it's with advantage because you know where it is.

1637
01:10:03,980 --> 01:10:08,580
Yeah, you pass the 21 you pass.

1638
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:10,480
All right, and I'm just going to leave another.

1639
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:13,480
I'm just going to leave more of them right next to it as I go.

1640
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:14,480
Okay, cool.

1641
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:15,380
I know where that's going to be.

1642
01:10:15,380 --> 01:10:17,080
And where's Pam's office?

1643
01:10:17,080 --> 01:10:17,880
Sorry,

1644
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,780
Shoe P.O.

1645
01:10:19,780 --> 01:10:21,380
Sealed at me to talk into the mic.

1646
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:23,580
What?

1647
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:25,380
Where's Pam's office?

1648
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,880
Again, it's this...

1649
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,180
Yeah, it's this one over here.

1650
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:29,180
Yeah.

1651
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:31,180
Okay, I'm going.

1652
01:10:31,180 --> 01:10:31,880
I'm there.

1653
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:32,880
Okay, cool.

1654
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,280
Yeah, roll a Perception check.

1655
01:10:35,280 --> 01:10:36,680
All right.

1656
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:41,980
I'm going to hide it.

1657
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:46,580
GM roll 1d20

1658
01:10:46,580 --> 01:10:48,080
plus

1659
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,980
Perception 2.

1660
01:10:49,980 --> 01:10:53,280
Damn.

1661
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,540
(laughing)

1662
01:10:55,540 --> 01:10:56,380
- Okay.

1663
01:10:56,380 --> 01:11:02,000
You see Pam and she goes, "Hi, Dwight!"

1664
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:08,120
And you take six damage as you step all over

1665
01:11:08,120 --> 01:11:10,620
these fucking caltrops.

1666
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:11,460
- Oh. - They're all over

1667
01:11:11,460 --> 01:11:12,920
your feet now.

1668
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,360
And she goes, "He he he he he he!"

1669
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:17,280
- He has an ally?

1670
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,120
- Yeah.

1671
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,800
- I take six damage?

1672
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:22,640
- She's making friends in the office.

1673
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:27,080
- Bruh, he's using my unfriendliness against me.

1674
01:11:27,080 --> 01:11:32,720
- And then she closes the door.

1675
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:36,440
You should take her hostage though.

1676
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:37,280
- Yeah, that's fine.

1677
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:39,920
I mean, I'm just gonna stand in front of the door.

1678
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:41,280
She's not getting out.

1679
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,160
And I say through the door, "You're mine."

1680
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,420
(laughing)

1681
01:11:46,420 --> 01:11:47,260
- Oh, ow!

1682
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,160
She goes, "He he he he he he."

1683
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:52,000
- All right.

1684
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:53,040
- And I go, "Pah, pah, pah."

1685
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:55,660
(laughing)

1686
01:11:55,660 --> 01:11:56,500
- All right, cool.

1687
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:57,800
So you're just gonna chill there for now?

1688
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:58,640
- Yeah.

1689
01:11:58,640 --> 01:11:59,460
- All right, cool.

1690
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:08,520
You heard Dwight make Dwighty noises

1691
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:12,920
as he stepped on his Dwighty toes all over your caltrops.

1692
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:14,400
- Yes!

1693
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:17,440
- Yeah, and you heard Pam go, "He he he he he he."

1694
01:12:17,440 --> 01:12:18,880
Thank you, Pam.

1695
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,240
Yeah.

1696
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:22,160
I do this with my fingers.

1697
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:22,680
Yeah.

1698
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:25,040
People in other countries do this.

1699
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:25,840
Yeah?

1700
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,200
Yeah.

1701
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:28,840
All right.

1702
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,600
He knows that.

1703
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:31,480
Cool.

1704
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,640
So yeah, also now you can move just basically

1705
01:12:33,640 --> 01:12:36,680
to where you want to go in the office is what the new rule is.

1706
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:38,800
OK, I'm liking this rule.

1707
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,720
Yeah, because I'm just--

1708
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:43,240
it's just too much, man.

1709
01:12:43,240 --> 01:12:44,640
Well.

1710
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:45,640
Mm-hmm.

1711
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:52,640
I'm going to walk over to Stanley.

1712
01:12:52,640 --> 01:12:56,480
Now that's a proper office item I gotta say.

1713
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,640
Yeah wait where's... he's not gonna go back to his desk.

1714
01:12:59,640 --> 01:13:01,640
Um...

1715
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:11,640
Stanley.

1716
01:13:11,640 --> 01:13:12,640
Mm-hmm.

1717
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,640
Yeah.

1718
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,640
I'm gonna walk over, actually, yeah I'm gonna walk over to Stanley.

1719
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,640
Yeah.

1720
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:18,640
Hey Stanley!

1721
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,640
'Sup Stan the man?

1722
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,640
How you doing, Jim?

1723
01:13:22,640 --> 01:13:26,640
Good, brother. You know what you look like you need?

1724
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:32,640
And not a donut. I already saw you eat one, you fat motherfucker.

1725
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:34,640
You need a new pen.

1726
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:36,640
Look at these pens. These pens are shit.

1727
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:40,640
These are big, low-quality, bad pens sitting in your pocket.

1728
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,640
Roll a persuasion check.

1729
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:45,640
Or a deception check, I guess.

1730
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:46,640
Because he doesn't need a pen.

1731
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:48,640
I don't want you. I'm going to...

1732
01:13:48,640 --> 01:14:18,600
and

1733
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:20,600
happens.

1734
01:14:20,600 --> 01:14:24,600
Stanley says "OKAY!" grabs it, and presses it, and blows up.

1735
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:27,600
Alright, how much damage did I take?

1736
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,600
Uh, you don't take any. Stanley's just dead.

1737
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,600
And you don't have to pay anymore.

1738
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:34,600
I was right next to him.

1739
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,600
Yeah, alright, shit.

1740
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,600
Come on, let's be honest.

1741
01:14:38,600 --> 01:14:40,600
Mmhmm.

1742
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,600
Also, I have a show I have to go to, so I'm okay to die.

1743
01:14:42,600 --> 01:14:44,600
Oh yeah, that's true too.

1744
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:47,600
Oh shit, okay, you take 11 damage.

1745
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,600
You actually did die.

1746
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:51,600
It's 4d4.

1747
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,600
And you just like...

1748
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,600
got completely destroyed.

1749
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:57,600
Okay, now I feel bad.

1750
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,600
Alright, you know what?

1751
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,600
Fuck it, man.

1752
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,600
The what? The...

1753
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:07,600
The roll's only going one way tonight.

1754
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,600
Cameron, put your headphones on.

1755
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:11,600
I'll explain what happened.

1756
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,600
Okay, so based on what I was seeing,

1757
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,600
I'm guessing maybe something good happened?

1758
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:16,600
- For you. - Yeah, for you.

1759
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,600
- It's so cool that it's just been his owed items

1760
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,600
that have been killing him.

1761
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:24,600
So he rolled, he went up to Stanley and said,

1762
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:25,600
"Take this explosive pen."

1763
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:26,600
He didn't say explosive pen, he said,

1764
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,600
"You look like you need a new pen."

1765
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:32,600
Rolled a persuasion check, got a crit one.

1766
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,600
- Third crit one of the night.

1767
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:36,600
- Stanley said, "Okay, I'll take the pen."

1768
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,600
And he took it and pressed it, and then Stanley died

1769
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,600
and he took 11 damage. - And I died.

1770
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,600
I died

1771
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:50,160
That's crazy, this is the kind of thing that's been happening to me every single time

1772
01:15:50,160 --> 01:15:56,280
I play you are you're not even letting me get a plan off. Yeah, I know you scheme too much

1773
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:58,400
Dude, that's not my head much

1774
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,760
I had I had I put down a shit ton of

1775
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:07,280
Caltrops behind me at what I was walking and my plan was you're gonna walk over them take some damage and then as soon as I

1776
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:09,680
Saw you walk over them. I also had a giant magnet

1777
01:16:09,680 --> 01:16:13,260
So I was gonna turn that on and then all they were all gonna fly into your body and kill you

1778
01:16:13,260 --> 01:16:15,180
- That's such a good idea.

1779
01:16:15,180 --> 01:16:18,240
- Tell me why you actually went over and talked to Pam.

1780
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:19,900
- 'Cause I failed my insight check.

1781
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:22,460
- Oh, okay. - I tried to do that.

1782
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:24,100
- I knew it, I was like, there's--

1783
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,500
- I actually, he didn't even feel,

1784
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,860
I specifically said, should I roll an insight check?

1785
01:16:27,860 --> 01:16:29,020
'Cause I knew I was supposed to.

1786
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:32,200
- I almost put my headphones back on to say,

1787
01:16:32,200 --> 01:16:35,700
of course this is a trap, but you're supposed to--

1788
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:36,540
- Yeah, but it was okay.

1789
01:16:36,540 --> 01:16:39,060
- No, we're trying, I think that's better,

1790
01:16:39,060 --> 01:16:40,460
I think it's better for the game.

1791
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:43,140
- I think I played the first one a little too meta-geared.

1792
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:44,220
- It was fun. - But I understand

1793
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:45,060
the vibe now, I think.

1794
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:46,120
- Yeah. - I think it makes sense.

1795
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:47,700
I think it is, yeah.

1796
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,940
I wish I got to use my magnet, man.

1797
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:50,780
I was also hoping I could--

1798
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:52,500
- We'll definitely be doing Jim versus Dwight again.

1799
01:16:52,500 --> 01:16:53,780
- Yeah. - Yeah, Jim versus Dwight.

1800
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:55,500
- I wanna do every versus.

1801
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:56,340
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1802
01:16:56,340 --> 01:16:57,620
- That exists. - I'll start,

1803
01:16:57,620 --> 01:16:59,100
if we're gonna do that, I'll start leaning

1804
01:16:59,100 --> 01:17:00,020
into the characters.

1805
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:01,340
I'll make it more of a thing.

1806
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:02,180
I like that. - Speaking of characters,

1807
01:17:02,180 --> 01:17:04,940
I just wanna say here, Pat, as I'm looking at,

1808
01:17:04,940 --> 01:17:07,040
I just noticed on the character sheet you gave me,

1809
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,140
for myself, I see here you've made me a level two rogue,

1810
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:10,980
which is nice.

1811
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:12,840
- Everyone's a level two rogue.

1812
01:17:12,840 --> 01:17:15,740
- Under background it says multimedia artist.

1813
01:17:15,740 --> 01:17:18,040
- Wow, that's very flattering.

1814
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,600
- That is very kind of you.

1815
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,900
But what I'm noticing here, for race,

1816
01:17:22,900 --> 01:17:25,400
you put standard human.

1817
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,680
As my race, you've put standard human.

1818
01:17:29,680 --> 01:17:31,000
- That was the option they had.

1819
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,560
I just like, I used the character banter.

1820
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,960
- Wait, did you talk to Oscar Cameron?

1821
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:37,600
- Uh, I don't remember.

1822
01:17:37,600 --> 01:17:40,520
- Okay, you wouldn't remember the voice patches was doing.

1823
01:17:40,520 --> 01:17:44,720
Yeah, oh wait. No. I did talk to Oscar. Yeah, he did he did do this

1824
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:48,600
He didn't say the same or Oscar just talk to me at least did he say Luciento to you?

1825
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:54,520
Did he tell you that I said I'm just doing Dwight stuff

1826
01:17:54,520 --> 01:17:55,360
Yes

1827
01:17:55,360 --> 01:18:01,440
He did say that no I heard you saying you heard him say that from like from like it said like I got from a distance

1828
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:04,440
You just hear you just hear Dwight go. I'm just doing Dwight stuff

1829
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,360
Thank you. Yeah, dude

1830
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:11,160
He told me that I could use the anvil thing on you as long as I had line of sight so I was like yeah

1831
01:18:11,160 --> 01:18:11,440
Okay

1832
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,160
I'm just gonna find the point on the map that I can walk to where I have line of sight and I was gonna have to

1833
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,080
Walk like multiple turns to get there and then he was like, yeah, you can just climb to the top

1834
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:25,620
Okay, that's it for you

1835
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:36,600
That is that's a damn, but that's not a bad idea. Yeah, they'll give him a taste of medicine

1836
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:43,280
I would I wouldn't mind all run that line. Yeah, I would like that. All right, cool. Maybe okay. Bye. Bye

1837
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:44,120
Bye bye.

1838
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:44,960
Bye bye.
