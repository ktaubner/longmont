8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Stop singing.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I love my birthday.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, he's not even singing.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
He can lip sync it.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
He can lip sync it.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
He can lip sync it.

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Because I wasn't there.

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I love my birthday.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
So, wait.

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
So, what happened?

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I love my birthday.

19
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Get this, man.

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Craziest shit ever.

21
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It was this guy's birthday.

22
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It was this one guy's birthday and we started singing.

23
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I love my birthday.

24
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
He started singing it.

25
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
No, we started singing it.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
We antagonistically.

27
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We tried to get him to sing it.

28
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He was like.

29
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
We started singing that like really loudly all around the bar.

30
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yeah, well, no.

31
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
What happened was he kept singing it was his birthday and he kept, he was very stupid.

32
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,840
stupid. He was he was honestly one of the stupidest people I've ever seen. I kept showing him

33
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,040
stuff and he would just do like I would like we showed him the thumb trick where he looked

34
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,120
like a fucking thumb. I ran up to him and was like hey it's your birthday right you

35
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,240
want to see a magic trick and I started just like holding my thumb like this just taking

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,160
it off of different parts of my hand and he was like whoa. I showed him the ibeer app

37
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:25,280
and he just stared at me blankly. And he basically yeah he kept saying yeah he was like. How

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,560
I just when he was we're playing, he just like insert himself into our group and

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,320
he was like yeah,

40
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:35,400
then he was like I have to go pee. It's my birthday.

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:42,320
I kept like he also when he would go get a drink, he would like start skipping

42
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,200
and then like realize that he was in a public place and like stop halfway

43
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,680
through and yeah, but basically he was on the other side of the room. You

44
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,520
would have actually like we would have been like this guy. So I was trying to I

45
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:55,420
I was trying to like get him to react. I just was standing across the room and I

46
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,320
just kept saying really loudly like it's my birthday today. I love my birthday.

47
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,540
It's nobody else's birthday today and he literally just didn't process like he

48
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,420
just did not say he was he just really fucked up. He did not seem drunk as the

49
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,260
thing. He was kind of drunk. I think he's kind of drunk, but he was not he was

50
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,260
not like sloppy. He was clearly very stupid and then you at the end. So then

51
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,320
we started saying I love my birthday really loud. He just he didn't react or

52
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:21,360
no. They got him right there and then at the end right before I left I was like

53
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,460
Hey, birthday boy, sing along with me.

54
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,380
I love my birthday.

55
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,780
And he just like stared at me.

56
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,400
He was like, I love my,

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,220
like he just couldn't figure out how to sing it.

58
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,660
- That white boy had no rhythm.

59
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,660
- Yeah. - No.

60
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,500
- He's cool though.

61
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,380
- Yeah. - I don't know.

62
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,700
- I would have stopped you guys.

63
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,540
I would have saved him.

64
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,740
- But that song is stuck in my head now really bad.

65
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,620
- I literally can't stop singing.

66
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,700
I love my birthday.

67
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:48,700
I think it might be a top 10 hit soon.

68
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,540
- Yeah. - Yeah.

69
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,380
- I agree.

70
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,380
I think we put a little...

71
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,380
We need to produce it. We need Pharrell.

72
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,380
"I Love My Birthday" is the chorus and then like...

73
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,380
"Will.i.am"

74
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,380
And then there's a verse about presents.

75
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,380
"Damn, it's my birthday"

76
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,380
"Damn, it's my birthday"

77
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,380
"It wasn't just the first day"

78
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,380
"Smoking on that Chronicle"

79
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,380
"My birthday got Bionicles"

80
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,380
"I just got Bionicles"

81
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,380
"Lego Life on Mars set"

82
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:16,380
"Nerf gun the Vulture"

83
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,380
"Yeah"

84
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:25,380
I'm 12. I just got all editions of Spore. I love my birthday. I love my birthday. I love

85
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:32,380
my birthday. I love my birthday. I love my birthday. I love my birthday. I love my birthday.

86
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:41,380
I love my birthday. I love my birthday. I love my birthday. I'm gonna check it out.

87
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,580
Yeah, we have Kai with us today.

88
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,580
Hello.

89
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,180
I'm live from New York.

90
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,820
It's 7am, Kai.

91
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:53,500
I'm in the hallway office.

92
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,940
We should turn this into a museum already.

93
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:01,100
I think it would be cool to have one legendary bus.

94
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,100
One bus?

95
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:08,780
See that corner, we have Sullivan, we frame that, and then I think maybe frame the Plaza

96
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:12,880
meter too but then like in the right there is like a 3d that we need it a 3d

97
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:22,660
printed bust of okay well we don't frame the way we got a 3d okay here's a bust of

98
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:27,020
okay I think instead of I think instead of a bus looking at the wall I think

99
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,740
instead of a bust maybe we put oh I got Caleb a new maybe I think that what we

100
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:36,860
could do here is we put a lot that one pardon me sorry I think we put a rail

101
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:41,120
down the hallway here and we have like kind of like a car like a dark ride that

102
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,500
people can ride through a dark ride a writ you know his junkie has a skateboard

103
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,140
on it that's true yeah put anything like yeah well we'll put like gears and stuff

104
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,340
so if he tries to spike grind on it it'll grinds his feet like a glass divider

105
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,020
right here and then like an old couple could walk by with their hands behind

106
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,420
their backs when we were looking at office space I really wanted to get a

107
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:06,820
place that had like like like a retail space on like a busy street

108
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:10,460
know that we can just have open all the time while people guess why we're

109
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:14,460
sitting at a table that would be cool yeah yeah this is sort of like a

110
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,980
basement yeah we got a basement with a basement infected by flies yeah I've

111
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,340
been decorating Caleb's space for him what do you think I already showed really

112
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:30,100
beautiful mm-hmm did you notice the new poster I mean I don't know what new

113
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:35,980
poster is the one on the left no what the Batman yeah yeah dude I saw

114
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:42,380
that earlier. You did? Well I... Like last week. We were recording, we just got done

115
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,860
recording and you were in the bathroom and I acted really quick and put that up

116
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,740
and you had no idea that I put it up. Yes I did, I just didn't care. Oh. I just, I'm

117
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,140
numb to this by now. Yeah. This is not a prank or anything. I gave Caleb space, I gave him

118
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:59,620
this Batman, the Batman poster that I got when I saw the Batman at AMC. The thing?

119
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:08,260
yeah we got this big uh breath of the wilds um this big frames

120
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:11,940
in my corner i'm not gonna take it it's it's a framed breath of the wild

121
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,300
like like me and pat had a really good idea for what to put up next i'm not

122
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,620
gonna tell you you'll just see it and then uh this one looks expensive

123
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:23,060
my girlfriend gave me her old naruto uh thing

124
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,420
from middle school i like that every poster has gotten progressively bigger

125
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,420
The Naruto poster is a giant.

126
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,420
I know, there's like no space.

127
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,420
Caleb, can I ask a question about one of your decorations?

128
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Yes, sir.

129
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,420
Are you your ancestor's wildest dreams?

130
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,420
I mean, I guess so, if it's in my car.

131
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:40,420
That one I found when I moved into my new place.

132
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:43,420
I found this in a poster tube in my closet.

133
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,420
Did you think you bought that at some point and you forgot about it?

134
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,420
No.

135
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,420
It's signed, too.

136
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,420
It's signed by the artist.

137
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,420
Yeah.

138
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,420
Caleb, you're your ancestor's wildest dreams.

139
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,420
I think I am my ancestor's wildest dreams.

140
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,660
I think I am my ancestors wildest dreams. I'm my ancestors wildest nightmares. I think my

141
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:06,780
ancestors were probably Irish travelers. If your great-great-grandpa got American Pickled,

142
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,060
do you think he'd be proud of you or not? My grandpa? You have to stop using that movie

143
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,060
as like a frame of reference. I think you're the only person in the world who has seen

144
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,700
that movie. My mom told me the synopsis so I know what he meant. Yeah. But I think you're

145
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:21,900
probably the only person who watched that movie. I think American Pickled has entered

146
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:28,540
the lexicon is like a something like a verb no yeah I got time machine do you

147
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,500
mean yeah I'm a really it's more of a time barrel that he's gonna be in and

148
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,300
yeah he's gonna be wet and green so what would you call that

149
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,100
well you're green yeah I'm green like the weed I'm smoking mm-hmm yeah oh my god

150
00:07:55,100 --> 00:08:00,660
oh my god I back him dude dude yeah back over him

151
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,900
my damn truck bitch-ass fuck you mm-hmm I'm sorry he's one of those guys that I

152
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:09,300
wish would get would be in like a new jackass movie so you can see me a hurt

153
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,740
real good. I'd love to turn him into an American pancake. He looks like you? A little bit.

154
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:21,580
No. I guess I look like him, he's older. That's not the rule. That's the rule. I look like

155
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,620
him a little bit. I don't think so. Okay, thank you guys. I appreciate it. Have you

156
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:30,580
been told that a lot? I've been told Jack Black, him and- I've been told Jack Black by

157
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:36,780
my aunt. Yeah, I can see that. Every big guy who laughs, people will tell them they're

158
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,220
Jack Black doesn't laugh he makes you laugh. No he laughs. He tickles my funny bone. He's

159
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:50,380
funny as well. I'm not Jack Black. I'm getting back there. You getting back there? I'm getting

160
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:55,020
back there. You know what it was? I started drinking beer again instead of clear liquid.

161
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:06,460
Water. Water and clear Pedialyte. Natural Pedialyte. That stuff gets you so fucked up.

162
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,460
I love Pedialyte so much.

163
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,460
Dude, Pedialyte gets you so messy.

164
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,460
Electrolytes are fucking... guess what I'm sipping on right now.

165
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,460
Don't tell me it's electrolytes.

166
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:18,460
Electrolytes.

167
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
You just throw it in that?

168
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,460
Yeah, it's like a powder.

169
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,460
I think I have more in my bag actually.

170
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,460
Oh my god, give me some dude.

171
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,460
If I actually took them you can have them.

172
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,460
I need to try this shit.

173
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,460
Dude, I want to get like...

174
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Oh, I did.

175
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,460
I wish I had...

176
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,460
Holy shit.

177
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
Is this Liquid IV?

178
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:37,660
No, it's the Walgreens brand, but it's $5 cheaper, but it's the exact same ingredients.

179
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,260
I'm going to just put it on my fingers.

180
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,760
You're going to gum it?

181
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,960
Yeah, I'm going to gum it. I'm going to drink it like a fun dip.

182
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Snort triple hydration.

183
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm the only one of us that doesn't have a fucking water bottle. Are you kidding me?

184
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,260
What do I have over there? I have a Codsby Surprise Egg. I could put it in and fill it up with water.

185
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,960
Water bottles are goated.

186
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,360
Dude, I had to get like a Nalgene or something. I keep buying fucking like water bottles when I like

187
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,240
What happened?

188
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,520
The fly got in there

189
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:18,760
There's fucking ten foot dude, I told you the bathroom has literally been taken over

190
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:24,500
Maybe you could use this cap - no, no just it's protein, dude

191
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,460
No, that's we have those are those are flies that braid in the toilet eat those. Yeah

192
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,880
No, these are so

193
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,000
So what happened was like how did the flies get it's that crack in the wall, right?

194
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,160
No, they they they lay eggs in warm and wet places. So I think what happened where they come is

195
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,320
I think they know oranges. Yep, they got in here by the oranges and then I think the heater was on

196
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:51,600
I think somebody left the heater on yesterday and the bathroom door was open

197
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,240
And so it got really hot in here and they all laid eggs in the toilet and sink drain and

198
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
spread out.

199
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
It's crazy.

200
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,720
I feel like with fruit flies, they have the ability to just like spawn out of nothing.

201
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Yeah.

202
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Yeah.

203
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Fucking air.

204
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Dude, they're like bacteria born or some shit.

205
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,800
They do player at place at me.

206
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
100.

207
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Well, your place.

208
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Myself.

209
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
My kids.

210
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Yeah.

211
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
It's really cool.

212
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,320
That reminds me of like speaking of guess what I just got 15 out of my drink.

213
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
What flies through flies?

214
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Hell yeah.

215
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
And they're all in that cap.

216
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
And they're all in that cap.

217
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,760
But like, if you ever heard of those medieval recipes for like, recipe for an ox.

218
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:31,720
And it's like, bury a, you know, a bees nest on the fourth day of autumn.

219
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Yeah.

220
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,720
And you know, that kind of shit.

221
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:36,160
And then you just get an ox according to that.

222
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,200
That's what flies are doing constantly.

223
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
Yeah.

224
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,760
That's probably what Minecraft was based on.

225
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
They're being summoned.

226
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Mm-hmm.

227
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Yeah.

228
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,760
I wish I could summon animals.

229
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Yeah.

230
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,760
You can summon flies by being stinky.

231
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,080
You can do that.

232
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,080
Yeah.

233
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,840
will follow you like a familiar. You can summon super fly by being a hoe.

234
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,340
Yeah.

235
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,980
It's true.

236
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,600
I guess you can summon humans by shooting your gunk.

237
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,320
By calling them.

238
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,040
Oh, you can also summon rats by wearing like tights and playing a flute and

239
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,680
dancing around.

240
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,560
That's true, yeah.

241
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,200
True.

242
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,320
And by being pied.

243
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,200
Yeah, pied.

244
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,600
Yeah.

245
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,080
Really?

246
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,520
Yeah. If you're pied.

247
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,760
You're pied and you got a pipe?

248
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,480
Nah, that's different.

249
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,560
The creamed pied piper did something different.

250
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
That's the cream pied piper.

251
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,280
It was actually the cream pied pipey.

252
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:27,280
You summon, if you get cream pied, someone summons nine months later.

253
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Yeah.

254
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,280
Wait, what the hell?

255
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,280
That's true.

256
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Wait, let me think about that.

257
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
Wait, let me think.

258
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,280
It's actually true.

259
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Wait, so I can summon one million white frogs by just tickling my thing?

260
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,280
Yeah.

261
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,280
One million tadpoles.

262
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,280
No, they're frogs.

263
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:50,280
frogs that first fish that crawled out of the ocean summoned all the people.

264
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,280
That's true.

265
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:54,200
Just took a long spell to cast.

266
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,400
If someone had had frog sperms instead of tadpole sperms and they come down something and they

267
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,800
could see the cubs crawling around.

268
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,120
Like the chocolate toad in Harry Potter?

269
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,240
You busted a nut.

270
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,280
I would love my sperm to jump down Ron Weasley's throat.

271
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,580
I'd love to feel my sperms four years old.

272
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,580
At the end they're like 16 really.

273
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:21,980
No, specifically in the second movie.

274
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,480
I'd love if each of my sperms was one inch long so I could feel them coming out like a

275
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,480
boba straw.

276
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Oh my god.

277
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,580
Have you ever seen that video, I'm sure you've heard it, but it's like the loudest orgasm

278
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,980
ever and it's just the guy nuts and he just goes like, "Eeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhh!"

279
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,980
(screaming)

280
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:41,400
- That's not that loud, I could definitely, like just,

281
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,240
- You could just yell.

282
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,780
- It's not so hard to do a loud orgasm.

283
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,620
- I guess he had, I guess he--

284
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,820
- If that's the record, I'll break it tonight.

285
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:50,500
- The YouTube comments I read said that he had a kidney stone

286
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,220
at the same time as him nutting.

287
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,060
- That's just, why would they know that?

288
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,220
- See, I don't think that's true,

289
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,940
but I'm choosing to believe that.

290
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,620
- Yeah, I'll choose to believe that too.

291
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,660
- Based on the pitch of his voice,

292
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,540
he probably had a kidney stone at the same time

293
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,380
as he was nutting.

294
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,200
- My favorite thing is honestly,

295
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,380
like when there's a video somewhere

296
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:08,980
that's clearly somebody or either a person or an animal dies in the video.

297
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,480
Yeah.

298
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,680
And then you look at the comments and somebody's like, "Don't worry guys.

299
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,780
He's okay and he just suffered like a broken arm."

300
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,380
It's funny that I always...

301
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:21,280
Yeah, got a bullet going slow motion through a guy's head like Sniper Elite.

302
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,580
I always believe that comment for like 10 seconds.

303
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,180
Me too. I just choose to be like, "Yep, I believe that."

304
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:27,580
There was that one video of the...

305
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,080
The dog.

306
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,680
The dog, yeah. The dog flying...

307
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,080
What is it? It's like a propane tank or something?

308
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:38,620
no it's a it's a soda bottle like a two liter soda bottle with some kind of gas

309
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,880
yeah and they throw it up in the air and the dog runs after it and then it goes

310
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,920
like oh and the dog just goes like stiff as a board and just flies and not just

311
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:50,840
that the comments like the dogs fuck and the explosion is so powerful that it

312
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,600
sets off a car alarm in the parking lot and the dog is like completely stiff like

313
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,600
a hamster in a fucking cage is dead god bless the person who just said the dog

314
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:06,520
That person is like honestly doing so much. Yeah, that's a white lie that we need. That's I think that's a work bomb

315
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,160
Have you ever heard of that? It's oh, yeah this toilet cleaner my neighbor

316
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,040
Aluminum foil. Yeah. Yeah, my neighbor used to make those. Yeah, I used to like make those and put them

317
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,360
He would bury them underground so that like the ground would explode. Yeah, was he just being cool or was he trying to do?

318
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:28,360
Yeah, this is the same neighbor that showed me three guys one hammer when I was like nine years old. I got you

319
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
He's an older neighbor?

320
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,360
Yeah.

321
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
Oh, cool.

322
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
He's my sister's age.

323
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Oh, okay.

324
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Yeah.

325
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Dude, people who are your sister's age are the best.

326
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Yeah, he showed me a lot of fucking shit.

327
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,360
It's true, dude.

328
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,880
We had this neighbor, his name was Phillip, and he--

329
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,360
He had a cousin named Phillip.

330
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
That's really cool.

331
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,360
He was like a kid who's--

332
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,360
This is my cousin.

333
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,360
His dad was like old and crazy and was like a mad scientist, and his dad would do--

334
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,520
- We had this neighbor, her name was Franny K. Stein.

335
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,660
(laughing)

336
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,200
And she was a crazy scientist.

337
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,320
- He was cool, he had hovercrafts.

338
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,160
- No.

339
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,980
- What?

340
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,820
- Yeah, it's like a--

341
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,660
- Like propellers?

342
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,160
- Yeah, it's like a boat that has a real powerful fan

343
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,440
and it lifts it like a half inch off the ground.

344
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
- That's all you need?

345
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,120
- It was so cool.

346
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,280
- My neighbor was the exact opposite,

347
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,220
where it's just like we were all very white trash.

348
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,600
And that's why he had a go-kart and dirt bikes and stuff.

349
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,140
it was a good word used to throw waterproof firecrackers into the dam

350
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:26,720
pond

351
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,740
told them i'm breadon

352
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,880
to trick the fish into eating a firecracker

353
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,200
uh... lol yeah i never held his wife hostage

354
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,020

358
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,320
every time i try to have a little with my neighbor one time my little killed

359
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,720
JFK with a sniper rifle. My neighbor was one year younger than me. Okay, my

360
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,220
neighbor was my babysitter once. My neighbor was my cousin. That is actually

361
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,040
that my neighbors had a fully blue room in their house. My dad lived in my house.

362
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:12,160
My dad married my mom. Really? Were they your neighbors? No. They were neighbors

363
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,800
with my aunt who married her husband. I do I wish I wish that I had the I wish I

364
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,480
had the the Boston Catholic everybody lives in the same house and next door

365
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,680
oh my that sucked that sucked growing up because it was like all my cousins were

366
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:30,760
like basically my like brothers yeah and your brother's like that's like what my

367
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:34,680
brothers were like my dog was like my mom and my mom was like my like my dad

368
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,880
had that and I think it's not enough yeah that I didn't get that yeah dude

369
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,440
it it's fucking horrible like you it would have been cool though like you

370
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,160
can't do shit with everything like oh like I can't sneak out cuz like my

371
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,760
fucking aunt lives next door. Why the hell would you want to sneak out? There's this one time

372
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,960
where like my... You only sneak out what to go see your cousins? They're in

373
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,960
the fucking house with you. No, I'm sneaking out to go to a damn party. With your cousins?

374
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,140
Yeah, you just take your cousins. The whole house is a party if you got all your cousins. There's this one time my

375
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,040
aunt, my aunt Kathy who lived directly next door, like my brothers were fighting

376
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,800
and it got so loud that she like did like she was like I have to do something

377
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:16,440
And she tried to like walk into my house to like yell at us

378
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,160
And I like shut the door on her was like what the fuck are you do like you're like just walking into my house

379
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:26,760
Yeah, you can't do that like you this is like can't say that to your aunt. I don't think that's

380
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:33,560
It's not my brothers from fighting so that they came over and were like hey

381
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,800
You can't just walk into our foot like my brothers were like beating the shit out of me

382
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,160
I would say she's I think neatly in the right

383
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:45,120
probably but like I think if your aunt is also your neighbor I think that that's

384
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,200
probably the number one thing that she can do is walk into your house.

385
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,440
Yeah, because that might as well be a noise complaint from your neighbor but it's somebody who is

386
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,840
your aunt and and can come over and also why are these kids fighting?

387
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,360
You know why they were fighting? They would get into fistfight like

388
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,360
full-on brawls because they just couldn't play video games with each other.

389
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,440
Oh dude, that's... Yeah. They were like they were they were still doing it when my

390
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,480
brother was like like a week from turning like 18. Yeah. It was like if he like hurt

391
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:19,400
him bad enough he would like it would be like counted as like a domestic. I was

392
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,880
just saying that they can't play video games with each other do you mean like

393
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:27,280
they just like they weren't allowed to? No, well my fucking parents should have

394
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,800
done something. That's a good rule. It's like okay you guys can't like that it's

395
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,000
not like I was gonna play fucking NHL with them they would play NHL and then

396
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,540
get into real hockey fights.

397
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:40,960
Like sometimes he would like and then they would fucking play

398
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,400
hockey together in the driveway too. And like that would also

399
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,480
turn into just hockey fights. Like it was they they were very

400
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,480
committed to the hockey fights. Yeah, fights are cool. Oh, yeah.

401
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,920
No, I think they did it just so they could fight each other. But

402
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:58,040
then like my aunt would also come out and yeah, reports just

403
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,400
be like, what the fuck are you? Were they angry fighting or just

404
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,160
angry fighting okay they were like genuinely pissed at each other and would

405
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,360
like pull the shirts over and just like beat the fuck out of each other Wow

406
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,920
dude the biggest fight I ever got in with my brother was because I was just I was

407
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:15,800
just using the computer and he just unplugged it yeah and I just went ape

408
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:21,760
dude I was probably doing I was probably googling like our rappers good guys

409
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,400
unplugged my computer I just started wailing on him yeah yeah I used the computer the most in

410
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,680
the house and they would everyone to getting mad at me was just one time I

411
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:39,280
can tell this year it was like I'm calculating whether or not I'd be like

412
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:49,680
super I was calculating whether or not I'd be super embarrassed I had just

413
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,960
discovered like like someone forgot to clear the history I'd like just

414
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,880
discovered internet pornography when I was like 11. I just found like, "Oh this is

415
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,080
like the website where all the porn is." And I kept like

416
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,240
scrolling through because like I'd never seen a vagina before and I looked at one

417
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:15,240
and I went, "Oh my god! What?!" I kept like scrolling through stuff and I was

418
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:28,240
like I think I had opened like a hundred different tabs. I think I came home from

419
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,680
school earlier I like stayed home or something yeah yeah I stayed home from

420
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:36,640
school and my sister got home from school at like one o'clock mm-hmm and

421
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,840
she'd walked down so I closed it as fast as possible and then I opened up I was

422
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,520
on this like Batman fan website.

423
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,480
I was looking at like action figures and shit.

424
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,000
And then my sister came downstairs like,

425
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,560
"I need to use the computer for school."

426
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,120
And I got up from the computer and ran outside.

427
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,960
(laughing)

428
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,280
And I hid in the woods for like an hour.

429
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,280
And then like, I finally walked back in,

430
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,360
like tried to like sneak past everybody.

431
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,640
And then my sister and my dad were already talking.

432
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,040
They were like, "What the fuck?"

433
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,880
(laughing)

434
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,560
There was like 100 pages.

435
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,120
- One time in middle school,

436
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,960
my friend Jackson, like, just was like, "Kyle, look at this!"

437
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:18,280
And like really quickly on his phone, or his iPod Touch or something, just like showed me like

438
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,880
a video of like a woman just squirting way too much.

439
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,720
And I was just like, "Ugh!" And then he was like, "Ugh?"

440
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:29,400
And I was like, "That was nasty! What was that?" He was like,

441
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,120
"That was a woman's vagina." And you said, "Ew."

442
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,880
- Oh my god, I love you. - I just got checkmated.

443
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:39,080
But like, it was a nasty video when I was like 12. Like, I still think that's kind of--

444
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,920
I don't want to know I don't want to see a picture of a vagina

445
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:49,520
I don't see that's disgusting. That's what clothes are for. Yeah, that's why we fucking invented clothes. Yeah, that's the only reason

446
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,620
I don't want to look at boobs or butts

447
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:57,680
Male form no

448
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,720
Didn't man no

449
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:05,760
Perfect V lines honestly. I'd rather I was a man pretending to be Atlas

450
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,760
I would rather see a penis than a guy's abs.

451
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,720
Okay.

452
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
And I would also rather see a penis than a vagina.

453
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:13,600
Yeah.

454
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,600
But I would rather see boobs than a penis.

455
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:17,920
Okay.

456
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,000
What about girl butt?

457
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,680
Girl butt?

458
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,720
You can just see that on the street.

459
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,160
Girl butt's just like, not even on the street.

460
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,120
You can see everyone's butt.

461
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,560
I'll see butt, you know.

462
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,840
If you look close enough, you can see everyone's butt.

463
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,920
Oh, it's just there.

464
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:38,080
You could see Girl Butt on the street and like stopping in the middle.

465
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,920
Yeah, that sounded really bad.

466
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,420
Yeah.

467
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:43,200
I was like, you can just look at any girl's butt on the street.

468
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,880
What are you guys talking about?

469
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,680
Yeah, that's not...

470
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,880
That did not sound good.

471
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,960
Girl, I mean, butt, as far as I'm concerned, butt is just a matter of...

472
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
I mean, just go to the beach.

473
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,040
Yeah.

474
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,520
Yeah.

475
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,720
That's what butts are about.

476
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,840
Or the bathroom.

477
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,340
Yeah.

478
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,160
Yeah, just go to their locker room.

479
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,840
If you want to see any of this shit.

480
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,040
Just go to your security.

481
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:06,520
I'm sick of kids getting hooked on porn so young. Back in the day we just snuck into the girls locker room.

482
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:09,560
Yeah, like a little nerd outfit, bring a ladder and binoculars around.

483
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,500
I mean if you want to see a girl butt just go to your surveillance screens.

484
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:18,040
Right? Just go to your Dark Knight giant wall of every blink fitness.

485
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:22,680
Put some of my computer up. Alfred, Alfred, Alfred show me the biggest butt.

486
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,480
I won't be part of this, Mr. Wayne.

487
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,980
Here she is, Mrs. Nicki Minaj.

488
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,380
He's plugged into the Grammys girls locker

489
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:37,760
Batman's using that like sonar thing

490
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,400
Effect where it's like it's like zooming around

491
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:50,020
Alfred Winnie dead smell a vision to this now

492
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:57,920
Master Wayne Master Wayne is really incredible what you've done with this, but picture smells like Joker gas

493
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,920
He's shoes on. The Joker's in her butt. The Joker's in her butt Alfred.

494
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,360
I don't think that if the Joker's hiding in Nicki Minaj's fucking ass that explains

495
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:19,480
why it's so damn big. I was born a poopy. Which is why I'm inside a butt. He's born a poopy.

496
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,280
The Joker was born a poopy. I don't know. We're talking about being inside a butt.

497
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,160
That's what's in there. Yeah I do kind of believe that girls with big big butts

498
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:30,160

hundred tiny venus fly trap. Yeah, well, just getting one and like in your

509
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,640
brain, it's like in a little shop of horrors and like walk around and

510
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:22,320

pretty good little shop of horrors plant boys his name is

512
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:47,040
fuck you Audrey - Audrey - my name is Kevin I do not sing I do actually I do make

515
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:11,880
outer space and also she has children's mm-hmm oh she's a she the logic hammer

516
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:23,280
just bounced on your head okay I guess I can hit with a water hammer. Feed me poop Seymour. Feed me poop now. Feed me all your poop. Feed me poop more. Feed me poop more yeah I guess we're back here.

517
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,220
I mean feed me food more is something that gets stuck in my head pretty damn

518
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:35,320
often. Feed me food more. Feed me food more right? Okay I'll feed you food more. So here's the concept Kai.

519
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:39,080
Food more is anyone who gives you food. Yeah that's a food more. So whenever if

520
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,280
if somebody has a potential to give you food you say could you feed me please

521
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:48,320
food more? Or you could sing feed me food more and you or you say you'd say can you

522
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,520
pet me pet more yeah so anything that you need is that thing anymore

523
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:56,640
yeah and that's why because there's the plant needs to see it has no eyes see

524
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,280
more mm-hmm this is all a little too high concept for me yeah this is scary

525
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:06,200
that's okay you don't need to get it earlier when we're talking about like

526
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:10,820
imagining a vagina or a penis. It reminded me of,

527
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:15,860
there's this guy that I knew in college who was just definitely like an

528
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,820
aggressively closeted guy. And he was just like,

529
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,660
I was making a joke about Jack Black's penis. I don't remember what, why,

530
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:26,600
but like I wasn't, he was like, Oh, like how, I can't even, like,

531
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
I can't even like think about a penis.

532
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:33,940
About like the fact that we were like imagining a penis and a joke.

533
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,300
And he was just like, Oh, like I can't, Oh, like I can't even think about that.

534
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,380
That's so, Oh my God guys.

535
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,340
What?

536
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,340
It was just like such a poor cover.

537
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:49,660
And I found out like later, um, like later in the year, one of my friends who liked

538
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:54,140
to get really drunk and get smoochy, um, he'd like be like, and like, you know,

539
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,020
smooch when he was drunk, this guy was just like, it's interesting what you do

540
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,100
with your friends, like the smooching.

541
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,540
And he was just like, yeah, I just think it's funny.

542
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,060
And the dude was just like, maybe we can be friends like that.

543
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:10,980
Oh, it was such, it was a tragedy. I hope they did.

544
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,780
I hope they did smooch and it opened something up in his brain. I hope so.

545
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:18,380
I think he's still, I think he was very religiously raised.

546
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,300
Is that Flintstones sock? That is a Flintstones sock.

547
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,060

548
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,900
I did not want you to comment on it.

549
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,300

I think this is Voltron.

555
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,320
Why are you wearing a Flintstone and a Voltron sock?

556
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,760

00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,820
to cash in on that of like, oh, I played like a minor character

628
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:51,740

He was genius because he made awful movies and yeah.

Yeah, he made some shit called like Soul Pancake.

640
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,180
And then he was like, "We're going to make content that's really good all the time."

641
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,460
Did you watch that superhero movie that was kind of like...

654
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,440
kind of what was the Nick the one with Nick Cage and that little girl gas yeah

655
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,780

watched kick-ass - and the guy who plays like the mother plays kick-ass he's like

657
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:26,600
Oh Aaron Taylor Johnson he's like oh so he from the first one to the second one

658
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,800
he's he has aged like 20 years and he's fucking shredded yeah and they're still

659
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,460
like he's 16 years old. Dude, Aaron Taylor Johnson yeah cuz he was filming like

660
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:39,800
does he married to like a 90 year old? He's married so he was playing John Lennon on a

661
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,680
John Lennon on a movie when he was like 19 something like that and then the

662
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:49,120
director like divorced her husband to be with him and they have like six kids now

663
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,920
that's so awesome. I think the number of kids is way smaller but being in an

664
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,320
indie movie more like he's living an indie movie.

665
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:56,920
That's right.

666
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,420
I'm saying he's living in Nicky and Nora's Infinite playlist.

667
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,220

00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,420
Did you guys see that movie about a box?

670
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,020
It's like I built a fort or something.

671
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,220
No, okay.

672
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,220
So I called like I built a fort out of boxes.

673
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,120

674
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,320

00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,920
It was like Zooey Deschanel.

680
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,520
Mumble opened her mouth and went.

681
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,320
I just created a movie.

682
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,240
It was, I mean, she's not even involved, but it was,

683
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,640
but it is her fault.

684
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,200
Dude, that era, like 2009 to 2013,

685
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:37,400
where every like, like the 500 days of summer era of like media,

694
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Really?

695
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,000
Do you remember that, though?

696
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
How do you feel about Iron and Wine?

697
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
There's people wearing like suspenders and shit all the time.

698
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
How do you feel about Iron and Wine?

699
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,000
I'm not acknowledging this.

700
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:11,000
Wait, wait, you hate a band that won multiple Grammys?

00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
How is that supposed to make any sense?

But their songs were on the radio constantly!

704
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000

And I'm going to hit your mom with a Ford and her sons.

721
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,180
We're hitting on hipsters.

Yeah, IPA liquid.

723
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:24,180
That's exactly the same as this.

724
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,180
Yeah, I did realize now.

725
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,180
Huh?

726
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,180
Oh, what?

727
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:33,500
I said I realized now that, yeah, I'm just saying like, oh, I hate hipsters.

728
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,420
I'm saying I hate hipsters in a roundabout way.

729
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
Man bun?

730
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:39,860
More like, man, I'd have fun chopping that thing off with scissors.

731
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:45,080
still a bar around here that gives you a free drink if you chop your man bun off

732
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:52,460
yeah there is booby trap Lee sigh well I mean that place is so stupid yeah yeah

733
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,220
I love it it's great but it's dumb it's just so

734
00:38:56,220 --> 00:39:01,760
funny to see someone who has a mustache on the side of their index my cousin has

735
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,860
really yeah she has that she yeah she has that she has a and then she has the

736
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:13,660
word Elvis tattooed on her arm. It'd be so funny to just get like a square tattoo.

737
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:25,780
Each finger you have a different mustache like it's a Swiss Army knife

738
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,580
and they're like oh what's that one like on your ring finger? I'm like don't worry about it

739
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,940
don't worry about it. That's for special friends. It was a long time ago I was

740
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:36,980
young okay when I got these tattoos. I was supposed to it had a fast forward

741
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:45,620
rewind pause and play this is supposed to be the stop button and then I had I

742
00:39:45,620 --> 00:39:49,860
didn't like that idea so I changed all of them to mustaches and figured hey why

743
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,820
not just keep that one in the back pocket it would be funny if you just color the

744
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:57,620
entire side of your fingers like Steve Harvey

745
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:03,980
yeah you get frostbite on one finger yeah cool hey you guys ever noticed how

746
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,120
- You know how the pause sign looks like an 11?

747
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,500
Yeah, 'cause I have to pause every damn movie

748
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,840
11 times to go pee.

749
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,020
- Yep. - Oh.

750
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,600
- Yep. - That's a classic take.

751
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,980
- They gotta make movies easier to pee in.

752
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,220
(laughing)

753
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:20,100
- You ever notice a record button

754
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,420
looks like a dinner plate?

755
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,780
Yeah, 'cause I record it.

756
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,100
I go to dinner. - 'Cause I record my dinner.

757
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,640
- And I record myself eating.

758
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:27,900
- Or record me screaming at my family during dinner.

759
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,300
- Do you ever notice that the play button

760
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,420
looks like an arrow because it's pointing

761
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:34,420
where I want to go play.

762
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,080
(laughing)

763
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,260
- My living room, I guess, is pointing that way.

764
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,380
I'll go play over there.

765
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,220
(laughing)

766
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
- That's a good point.

767
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,060
- That's a really good point.

768
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,140
- What if things are on a remote?

769
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:43,980
Hold on.

770
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:44,820
(laughing)

771
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,060
- You ever notice that the power button

772
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,380
looks like Pac-Man smoking a joint?

773
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,980
- No, but that's a really good point.

774
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,860
Because that's power.

775
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,700
- Yeah.

776
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,980
- No, it doesn't.

777
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,820
- It does.

778
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,640
- Yeah, it does.

779
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,480
- A joint?

780
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,300
- Yeah.

781
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,140
- How does it look?

782
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:00,980
What the hell are you talking about?

783
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:01,800
- Look closer.

784
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,800
Look closer on it. Look closer at it.

I just like, hate.

793
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,800
I actually like that era.

794
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:22,800
That era of like...

795
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,800
I actually like that era.

796
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Dude, that era of like, weird Al and Perry Grip.

797
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,800
Oh my god.

798
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,800
The era of like, like autotune and like T-Pain and A-Side.

799
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,800
Don't get me started on the news and do a bad lip read.

800
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,800
Oh my god, dude, I fucking hate that shit.

801
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,800
You know what era I really didn't like?

802
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
What?

803
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
September 11th, 2001.

804
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,800
That was a very short era.

805
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
That was a very short, it was a bad era.

806
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
One day.

807
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,800
Yeah.

808
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,800
That was a bad era.

809
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
Not fun to be in kindergarten.

810
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,800
Yeah.

811
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,800
Getting told what to do.

812
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:54,800
I got, I got take, my mom took me out of school because she was worried that New Hampshire

813
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
was going to get attacked.

814
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Yeah, I mean, same.

815
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,080
my mom thought that Minnesota was gonna get attacked.

816
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
- Yeah.

817
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,920
- And it did.

818
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,960
- Yeah, no.

819
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:03,800
- Mm-hmm.

820
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:04,720
- Mm-hmm.

821
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:05,680
- Wait, you don't remember that?

822
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,520
- Sorry.

823
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,360
- Minnesota was attacked.

824
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,680
- Why do you think it's called the Twin Cities?

825
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,520
- Yep.

826
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,340
- Oh, fuck.

827
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,800
- Twin Cities, Twin Towers, City, New York City.

828
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
- That's where the New York City towers should have been.

829
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,640
- Yep, think about it.

830
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,400
- The Twin Towers should have been in the Twin Cities.

831
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,840
- Minnesota, what's on a plane?

832
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,040
Many sodas.

833
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:21,880
- Oh my God, that's true.

834
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:25,000
- Fresca, Diet Coke, every option.

835
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,360
it's usually complimentary on certain airlines.

836
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,100
- The Mississippi River runs right through it

837
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,500
and what do terrorists do to stay hydrated?

838
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,720
They take a little sippy--

839
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,560
- And they never miss it.

840
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:36,400
- And they don't miss it.

841
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,760
- And Mississippi did die on the plane.

842
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,960
- They take a sippy from their Mrs. Pepper.

843
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,800
- And what else is pepper?

844
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,560
Dr. Pepper, back to the sodas.

845
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,040
- Yep, and you know what else they put pepper on?

846
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,880
Schwarma.

847
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,280
- And do you know how many letters are in Schwarma?

848
00:42:51,280 --> 00:43:00,160
2023 which is a prediction for that's next year. Twin Towers 2, the fall.

849
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,440
Why didn't they put the Twin Towers in Minneapolis? Why didn't they put them in the Twin Cities?

850
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,640
It would have made way more sense.

851
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:09,760
It would have made way more sense and it would have been harder to attack.

852
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,760
Nobody ever would have fucking touched them.

853
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
And also less people would have died.

854
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,760
Yeah.

855
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,760
Yeah, because there's less people.

856
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:14,760
I heard that.

857
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,760
It'd be like an abandoned mall by then.

858
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,880
I heard the true motive for 9/11 was they were trying to knock down the Twin Towers because

859
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:23,400
was there mad that New York copied Middle Earth? That's right. I heard the

860
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,040
same thing. I heard they had the two towers and- Where they're from. Middle

861
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,400
Earth. Yeah, exactly.

862
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,960
They're not orcs, okay? If anything, they're elves, but they're not orcs or

863
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:37,960
dwarves. You guys see Bright? Bright? The Max Landis movie? Oh, I remember that.

864
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,880
It's the orc movie. Dude, I watched it really high, like a year ago. It's

865
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:46,520
incredible to watch. Really? Like, there's just like orcs and durags, like...

866
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:49,720
Yeah. It's like an... Actually, I think I've seen the first 20 minutes of it.

867
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:53,240
insane. Nextlane just said like like tweeted something I just finished my

868
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:57,400
screenplay that yeah may very well be my if it's done right this could be my

869
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Star Wars yeah no thinking that that's your magnet yeah it's like yeah it's

870
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,520
like an all lives matter movie with Will Smith it's insane I remembered him

871
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,800
recently cuz somebody posted a screenshot of his Instagram story that

872
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:15,320
was it said like Chris D'Elia speaking truth oh yeah like it's so funny to you

873
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,220
like your dad is a child murderer and you're like I guess I'll be a mega

874
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:26,540
a rapist. I have to live with my father. I'll never be my damn dad. Yeah, yeah,

875
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:30,540
do John Landis like if you he had he like threw a party when he got a

876
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:34,900
yard for the murder of any major children. He forced Michael Jackson to

877
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:38,500
endorse the occult by making thriller. Yeah, he also threw a kid out of them

878
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,060
airplane or something. I don't remember the story. Yeah, two Children were

879
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,540
murdered by a magic helicopter. I mean, yeah, I guess it in the grand scheme of

880
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:50,420
things if you're gonna kill like kids helicopters cool way also like if

881
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:57,420
you're gonna kill kids if you're gonna kill kids they better be like child

882
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:02,420
actors also yeah like non-union go bigger go out like an annoying kid same same

883
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:05,420
difference they're having a tantrum in the Walgreens you guys bet I'm gonna

884
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:10,140
take them out back is having a tantrum in Kmart and you pull like a walkie-talkie

885
00:45:10,140 --> 00:45:18,440
out and you just like crash it here. When I see a kid I see a tango. I see a bogey.

886
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:22,060
Yeah John Landis was like okay for this scene like okay the kids like for this

887
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:26,140
scene I'm gonna need to stand on this target right here. Didn't he leave this shot?

888
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:31,020
This is your mark. This bullseye. He left the shot in the movie I think. Really? I think that

889
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:38,060
shot is in the Twilight Zone. Yeah I love that. So a kid was doing well.

890
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:41,180
yeah kids you have to you're supposed to stand on the H, because that sense for

891
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:41,620
here

892
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:47,460
the H in the circle. That's your and stretch your necks up really tall, so

893
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,100
you can see

894
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:52,420

902
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,340
I don't care much for dogs.

903
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:35,780
- I was Catherine Hepburn.

904
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:36,700
- It really freaked me out.

905
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:39,420
I was like, are you a celebrity?

906
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,560
Yeah, like I honestly was like,

907
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,380
is she like an old movie star or something?

908
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,220
Why is she acting like this?

909
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:44,380
- Yeah, you can't just talk like that.

910
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:45,820
- Why is she like wearing all white

911
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,220
in like the middle of like Ridgewood?

912
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:49,940
Like it's just weird, dude.

913
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,060
- I think there's just probably a lot of weirdy freakies

914
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,060
crawling around New York City.

915
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:54,900
- That's true, man.

916
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,420
- Keep New York weird is what I say.

917
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:57,580
- Yeah, absolutely.

918
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,260
- I saw my first acidic people.

919
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:00,100
- Nice.

920
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:00,940
- Congratulate me on that.

921
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,760
- How was that?

922
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,600
- I thought it was hilarious.

923
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,080
It's the funniest thing ever. They're so funny.

924
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,560
They're really funny. I'm Jewish, by the way, but...

925
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,840
I'm not. They are funny.

926
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,440
Those guys are...

927
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,240
They look funny.

928
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:12,040
They have antennas.

929
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,120
They actually do.

930
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,480
They have antennas and they speak...

931
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,720
We're not going to say feelers. Antennas.

932
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:24,360
No, but... And they have their own rules and funny hats. I was like, "This is awesome."

933
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,320
I loved it so much.

934
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:30,200
It's always... I do... It's a little bit embarrassing how many times I've told people

935
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:33,400
when it's their first time in New York, you have to go to South Williamsburg.

936
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:33,480
Yeah.

937
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,200
You have to just walk around.

938
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:34,920
I'm just like...

939
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:35,400
It's crazy.

940
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,760
The place I'm staying, Tommy's place is right over there, and it's awesome because I'll just

941
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:43,000
go to get a sandwich, and then I'll see a guy walking around.

942
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:43,160
Yeah.

943
00:47:43,160 --> 00:47:43,720
I'm like, "Oh."

944
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,560
And they have the bars on all the windows.

945
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:45,960
Yeah.

946
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,400
I remember when I first moved here, I was telling Kyba, I took the bus somewhere, and I went

947
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:57,480
through that part of Williamsburg or whatever, and I felt like I was in the Jeep from Jurassic

948
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:57,720
Park.

949
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,840
I felt like I was like in the alien hub world where all the species intermingle because I just like

950
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:08,920
seeing these guys like he like when I was driving to the apartment in my in an uber

951
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,920
a city guy just stopped in the middle of the road and got out of his car and calmly walked into the

952
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:19,080
store and like did something for like three minutes while people were just like blaring their

953
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:23,640
horns and then he walked back out to get into his car and he didn't like even ignore like he wasn't

954
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,080
like, "Oh, sorry." He just like, "Boop, boop, boop."

955
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:31,760
Yeah, dude. They have the biggest Toyota minivans.

956
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,960
The biggest what?

957
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:33,960
The biggest Toyota minivans.

958
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:34,960
The biggest toy?

959
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,840
They have the biggest toys, and they're keeping them from us.

960
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:40,840
Why?

961
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:41,840
Interesting.

962
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:49,320
They have these big minivans, and they'll fucking park them on the sidewalk, sideways.

963
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,320
That's insane to me.

964
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
Dude, it's like-

965
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
I don't know how they get their cars where they do.

966
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
Yeah.

967
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:57,320
The car would be like teetering on like a light post.

968
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
It's like half on the curb.

969
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:03,320
Half on the curb, upside down, and they just get out and walk out.

970
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,320
I was buying like...

971
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,320
Like they have some kind of magical powers or something.

972
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
I don't know.

973
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
They're hiding from the rest of the world.

974
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,320
I was buying an SD card reader for my PC when I first moved here.

975
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,320
And I went to the...

976
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,320
I was like, "Oh, there's like an electronic store in Williamsburg.

977
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
I'll just walk there. It's pretty close."

978
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
And...

979
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:26,600
first of all, it wasn't close. I didn't know, I still didn't know the area. I walked like 30 minutes to this like

980
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,840
That's close.

981
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,840
photography store in the middle.

982
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:30,340
Lazy.

983
00:49:30,340 --> 00:49:36,820
Literally in the like the the middle of this like neighborhood and I walked in and it was like

984
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,820
It was in the middle of the neighborhood?

985
00:49:38,820 --> 00:49:43,960
Middle of like South Williamsburg like like the like where like every

986
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:45,960
Why are you making a claw with your hands?

987
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,960
and stuff.

988
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,960
Why are you doing like Dracula teeth with your fingers?

989
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:53,400
making like a shape with your hand like you're doing like a hook nose.

990
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,960
Well I paid way more for that yesterday.

991
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,800
Another funny place that I visited on my trip that made this place feel like a hub world

992
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,280
is I went to Chinatown and that was very funny as well.

993
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:04,280
Ease up there.

994
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:09,640
Listen, the Hasid's are all fair game.

995
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:12,800
Once we get to Chinatown, you gotta take the slow train to Chinatown.

996
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:13,800
I love Chinatown.

997
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,800
It's so awesome.

998
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:17,520
The one in Flushing is my favorite.

999
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:18,520
That one's cooler.

1000
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:24,840

00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,600
- That's so fucking cool.

1014
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,120
- All the tourist trap shops in Chinatown

1015
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,760
have the perfect mix of items,

1016
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,520
where it's like half shirts that say

1017
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,920
"Motherfucking Fortnite in New York City"

1018
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,080
and then it's half mahjong sets.

1019
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:30,480
- Yeah, mahjong sets.

1020
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,800
- Every store should be like that.

1021
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,480
- The perfect Goku Supreme.

1022
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:35,680
- I love the Chinatown shirts.

1023
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,640

1024
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:38,480

1025
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,320
- It's awesome.

1026
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:43,660
I saw in multiple of those stores. I saw like the hats that have like braids attached

1027
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:54,400
Like a cartoon baby Groot wearing like a headband and like holding a joint and I was like this is this is so

1028
00:51:54,400 --> 00:52:00,320
They have shit like the fucking like Goku like for Fortnite with the like for tonight guy

1029
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:06,320
We're like the supreme bogo like on a shirt and like go like Vegeta smoking weed and shit

1030
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:11,920
Yeah, so but dad and then like and then I read it alien like an auspicious tiger. Yeah

1031
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,680
Yeah, the reason that I think it's so awesome is like they're just like vaguely picking up on like this is what people like yeah

1032
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:24,520
Yeah, they're just not paying attention to licensing and throwing everything that's someone who's 15 might like on yeah, and they're right

1033
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:29,620
It's awesome. Yeah. Oh, you sure it's like that. Oh, man. I mean like Goku backwards t-shirts

1034
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:34,580
Yeah, I feel like most of this most of the the shirts in that's in those stores

1035
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:37,220
I see people buying them, but I never see people wearing them.

1036
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:37,720
Yeah.

1037
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,460
I think they're a gag gift.

1038
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:39,960
Yeah.

1039
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,740
If you hang out at Maria Hernandez long enough, you see like sexy Goku Supreme shirts.

1040
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,240
Yeah.

1041
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,820
Last time I was at one of those stores, I bought Cameron a lucky coin.

1042
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:49,320
I do.

1043
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:50,740
It might be in my wallet.

1044
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:51,240
Tell me.

1045
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:51,740
That's a nice--

1046
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,240
I want to check.

1047
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,980
I think it's probably been-- it's been about a month.

1048
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:55,260
I'd like to check in.

1049
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:56,460
Cameron's gotten taller.

1050
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:57,460
It's been a month and a half, actually.

1051
00:52:57,460 --> 00:52:58,100
That's true.

1052
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:59,860
Do you feel more lucky?

1053
00:52:59,860 --> 00:53:01,580
Have you been-- have you had a lucky month and a half?

1054
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:02,820
I've had-- I would say I've had a lucky streak.

1055
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:05,460
- Well honestly, I think I've had a pretty unlucky month

1056
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:06,460
and a half since I gave you that coin.

1057
00:53:06,460 --> 00:53:07,700
- Cameron, you should give that coin back.

1058
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:09,380
- No, I think I just have to get my own.

1059
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,220
But then like--

1060
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,340
- No, I'll get you one for your birthday.

1061
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:13,460
- I feel like that's, I feel like I have to be gifted one

1062
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,780
'cause I gifted him the coin.

1063
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,260
- Yeah, I'll gift you one, don't worry.

1064
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,140
- We have to like gift, each of us has to gift a coin

1065
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:19,980
to each other.

1066
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,420
- Mm-hmm, I think it's on my desk at home.

1067
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:24,060
- I wanna get a lucky coin really bad now.

1068
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,900
That sounds like a great--

1069
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,740
- It's a really cool coin.

1070
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:29,660
- I had a lucky coin in high school.

1071
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:33,300
it was like one of the pure silver quarters.

1072
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,380
- When Caleb-- - It was like a 1963 quarter.

1073
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:36,580
- It's gotta be Chinese for it to be lucky.

1074
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,420
- Yeah, only Chinese stuff is lucky.

1075
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,820
- Yeah, I also drilled a hole in it

1076
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,660
and tried to put it on an necklace.

1077
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:40,480
- When I handed you what?

1078
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,060
- When Caleb handed me the lucky coin,

1079
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:44,300
he was holding, he got takeout food,

1080
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,260
and the second he handed me the lucky coin,

1081
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:47,260
the bag ripped and all his food fell on the ground.

1082
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,300
- Oh yeah, yeah, that did happen.

1083
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,140
- The second that it left his hand.

1084
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,020
- It was literally the second I handed the lucky coin.

1085
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,980
And I remember you were telling me,

1086
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,460
you were like, it was the perfect moment

1087
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,660
'cause I forgot that I had it in my pocket,

1088
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,700
and then you were like, "Oh man, I'm real stressed out this week," and I was like, "I have a

1089
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:06,380
literal solution right now. I have a solution," and then I gave you the coin immediately.

1090
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:07,380
I felt terrible.

1091
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:10,340
Yeah, and a kid laughed at you, too.

1092
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,340
Yeah, dude.

1093
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,340
You got a hangover without drinking?

1094
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:15,940
Dude, it was awful. It was so fucked, my lips started swelling up.

1095
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:17,940
It was like a started cracking.

1096
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,940
It was bizarre, dude.

1097
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,940
You started flaking away.

1098
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:22,860
I can't eat chocolate anymore. It was really, really bad.

1099
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,420
We're going to get you a coin.

1100
00:54:24,420 --> 00:54:25,420
You guys wanted a shot down today.

1101
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:27,420
You guys want to go to Chinatown today?

1102
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:29,420
You guys busy after the...

1103
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:31,420
You guys want to go to Chinatown?

1104
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,420
Maybe.

1105
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:35,420
We have to do a lot of fucking bullshit.

1106
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,420
Well, I might just go to Chinatown again

1107
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:39,420
and buy myself some little trinkets.

1108
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,420
Can you get me a lucky coin?

1109
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:43,420
If I go there, yeah.

1110
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,420
Can you get me a dragon flavored lollipop?

1111
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,420
Dragon flavored lollipop?

1112
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,420
I'm going to buy you the most cursed item in all of Chinatown.

1113
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,420
I think we need a...

1114
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,420
I think for the office we need a...

1115
00:54:53,420 --> 00:55:00,300
like a dragon incense holder okay let's get a lot of cool shit yeah you should

1116
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:06,720
also let's get away these curtains yeah oh we should have done that oh I mean I

1117
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,460
guess we're still time or shower curtains well these ones were supposed

1118
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:15,220
to be sound dampening but they're just actually gray you could paint on them

1119
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,220
yeah I think that this whole office should be China themed yeah I'm really

1120
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,260
down can we cannot does that mean I can get rid of the Naruto poster? No, no, that

1121
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:27,720
stuff all stays. All right, yeah. That's your that's your flair. My flair? That's

1122
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,960
your flair. And look I drew Caleb up here too. Can I put something at your desk Pat? No, no,

1123
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:35,980
don't even think about that. All right. Is this all revenge because I wrapped up

1124
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,940
because I put a piece of plastic on your desk? Oh that was a good prank. And put a post-it

1125
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:43,980
note that said prank? When? You don't remember that? We put plastic all over

1126
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,260
everything on your desk. I put a there was a piece of plastic. And then we were like oh I

1127
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,860
I don't know if he'll be able to tell you that's a pretty good not we didn't want

1128
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:54,540
you to think it was like an accident or a prize so we're gonna pray I put a post

1129
00:55:54,540 --> 00:55:57,700
it knows on it what do you mean it was covered your computer monitor and

1130
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,700
everything and it was plastic and it said it was a post-it note that said

1131
00:56:00,700 --> 00:56:05,940
prank on it I don't remember I don't think this happened I you think

1132
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:11,100
absolutely happened I did have yeah I remember I'm we there then the post-it

1133
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,740
note that said prank would still be over here no no it was on the place like a

1134
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:22,260
a month ago. I sat on the plastic yeah. You don't remember this. No, I don't

1135
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,140
think this happened. It's such a good prank. It was such a good prank that it

1136
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:30,020
wiped his memory. He's such a fucking good prank. I think I'm going to do more.

1137
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:33,180
I mean, I guess what probably happened is that you walked in and you saw a

1138
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:35,700
giant sheet of plastic covering everything your desk. You're like, Oh,

1139
00:56:35,700 --> 00:56:38,900
guess I left this here last night and then that is probably what he thought he

1140
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,860
didn't even see it was a prank and it didn't process it idea that you could do

1141
00:56:41,880 --> 00:56:45,440
you want yeah you could like reach around in his computer and kind of mess up some

1142
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,640
of the stuff in there I just like fucking use like my keys

1143
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,560
a really good prank but again I'd need to put a post-it note that says that's my

1144
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:00,480
I'm fine with ranks but just at least leave a note yeah you know like a car

1145
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,680
accident like just leave a note if you if you prank somebody mm-hmm prank

you had a prank prank didn't even happen prank didn't work it did work did

1147
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:15,580
work obviously because you forgot it that's the point of a prank it's

1148
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:19,340
supposed to blend in it's supposed to be so innocuous that's why you need the

1149
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:23,380
post-it note to say I'm pranking you right now yeah yeah cuz otherwise you

1150
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:26,540

1155
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,700
I'm serious. So many people will not eat your way out of the world.

1156
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:55,240
He did it. He did it. How much jello do you guys think you could eat?

1157
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:58,060
I feel like I could probably eat a bathtub full of jello.

1158
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:00,940
I don't think I've eaten jello since I was like seven years old.

1159
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,540
Jello's like cotton candy, right? Yeah. How much cotton candy can you eat?

1160
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:08,300
I mean, you could, I could eat one bag and then be like, oh, but if it's like,

1161
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:09,780
It's disgusting though is the thing.

1162
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:15,500
If you had to eat a pound of cotton candy to save your family.

1163
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:17,980
That's a lot of, I mean yeah, to save my family.

1164
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,980
I mean I'd try.

1165
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:21,900
It's not an issue of like, yeah, it's not an issue of being full.

1166
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:23,380
It's just like disgusting.

1167
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,220
Which one's heavier, a pound of Jell-O or a pound of cotton candy?

1168
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,900
I didn't ask you the question last night, Patrick.

1169
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:28,900
No, Jell-O.

1170
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,900
I didn't ask you the question.

1171
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:30,900
Oh yeah.

1172
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,620
Okay, if you're dating somebody for a really long time, right, like a really, really long

1173
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,700
time and you're like very in love, right, this is a hypothetical that we were talking

1174
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:42,420
last night and then you find out that that person is your identical twin sister

1175
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:50,820
do you keep dating them no no no we us three all said yes we all were like yes you would keep

1176
00:58:50,820 --> 00:58:54,900
you're in love yeah if you're in love yeah it's like whatever it just makes our bond even fucking

1177
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:00,340
cooler you could pilot a pacific rim mac because yeah exactly also now that you know that your

1178
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:04,500
twins you're gonna start like saying shit at the same time dressing the same that's the problem

1179
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:07,900
that starts the relationship is like, "Oh my god, we finish each other's

1180
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:12,580
sentences." We dress exactly the same. We are telepathically connected and we

1181
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,980
grew up together in the same house. Identical twins though. It has to be

1182
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:24,660
identical twin sisters and a brother. Okay, new thing. You're

1183
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:31,140
triplets. Which one would you date? Not only do you have your

1184
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:36,740
your beautiful wife. Now she's got a damn twin sister. Oh, it's kind of and and

1185
00:59:36,740 --> 00:59:38,340
she's coming for Thanksgiving.

1186
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,980
She's coming well your your brother. I would totally right. I mean you're in the

1187
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:46,100
same house. Yeah, she's coming for Thanksgiving. Okay, it's quadruplets

1188
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:51,940
actually. Okay, yeah, it's quadruplets and there's three hot sisters. Would you

1189
00:59:51,940 --> 00:59:54,900
okay? Here's a question. I would hate I would you let three girls suck your

1190
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:58,740
penis. No, I would hate if it was quadruplets and it was two boys and two

1191
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,020
girls and it's like okay this is all set up perfect I'm being one of the boys is

1192
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,980
gay and it screws everything up but then you see you've just it doesn't matter

1193
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:11,940
it's all twins yeah if three girls tried to I would get too nervous okay would

1194
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:17,580
you rather your girlfriend or your twin sister probably my girlfriend okay

1195
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:21,260
interesting well what if they were the same but yeah see how is my twin sister

1196
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:27,540
like Boston Boston like me and her name's Helga her name is Helga but she

1197
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:36,820
hiding? No, she looks like Amanda Bynes. Okay. Amanda Bynes, 2014. Amanda Bynes, 2005.

1198
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:44,340
Amanda Bynes, she's the man. So I'd have to say no because she was like 16 in that movie.

1199
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:50,100
I don't think so. Probably not. I think probably my girlfriend. Interesting. If I found out my

1200
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:56,660
girlfriend was my sister, it wouldn't change anything. But you know, if given the choice

1201
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:03,060
to date my sister or my girlfriend I'd go girlfriend every time. Every time? Maybe one time out of a hundred.

1202
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:08,500
Just to see what up. If you found out your girlfriend was, what if your girlfriend was like, like oh yeah just

1203
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:13,380
found out I'm Hitler. If you found out that your girlfriend was Hitler? Yeah. I mean that's even

1204
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,620
less of a question. I mean like. You would have sex with her still? Yeah. She's Hitler in a wig.

1205
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:22,900
Yeah. But what do you mean she's a hundred and twenty years old? She's obviously hasn't done anything Hitler-y

1206
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:28,100
when I've been alive. People change. Girl, that's the old you. I don't care about the old you,

1207
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:31,380
I care about the new you, girl. Okay, what if you find out your girlfriend,

1208
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:37,940
Jeffrey Dahmer. We've all done things and you stayed the same and my heart didn't change.

1209
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,580
That's really true and like a poem. What's a life with no fun? That's what I would say to her.

1210
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:52,340
Okay, all right. When does this come out? Where can people find your art and look at your art
