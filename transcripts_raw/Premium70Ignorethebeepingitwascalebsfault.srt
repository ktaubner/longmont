She's like a ball of fire, but you peel back the layers, and there's just love underneath, and I was like

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,400
Oh, that's like a really sweet quiet guy, and then they're like going through their current home where they're living in and

20
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,960
Talking about like the design of it, and then he walked in this room

00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,160
And he's like and I call these my hands of mercy and they're these giant sculptures of these like evil red

Yeah, I just love I just love my hands of mercy and everyone else in the family like hates them they look so fucked up

And and then at the end of the end of the episode when they show like the new house the wife wanted to surprise him

27
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,920
So she put the hands of mercy in his new office and he walks in and he sees him

It's a very clunky name, I will say.

109
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,680
I do not listen to rock music.

Sorry, I can't hear you.

119
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,800
I'm listening to Bad Bunny lyrics right now.

120
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,240
Yo tango, cus-cud-ola, mi amigo.

121
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:30,200
So Patti McAloon from Prefab Sprout was supposed to be a priest but then he decided to become

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,200
a musician instead.

123
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,500
And he's not Irish right?

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,160
Even though his name is Patti McAloon?

125
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,560
I thought they were Irish because of that and turns out they're just, they're Geordie.

126
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,920
They're from...

127
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
What's Geordie mean?

128
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,920
I don't know what that means.

129
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:47,860
Geordie is like a, it's like the border of like Scotland and the UK.

130
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,640
So he's Irish?

131
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,040

00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,600
When you said like, oh yeah.

He wasn't Irish and his name's Patty.

134
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:59,160
I thought you were gonna be like, yeah, he's from Nevada,

135
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,800
but he's from right next door?

136
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,880
- Yeah, that's a different place.

137
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,520
Completely, that's a different place completely.

138
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,240

140
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,360
- Mm-hmm, it's pretty much the same place.

141
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,200

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,080

00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,680
I don't know where you are right now, but you're trespassing on one of our properties.

168
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,440
Yeah, Patrick, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to deport you to the Irish Rotunda, and if

169
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,920
they don't want you, you're gonna have to go to the moon or something.

170
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,400
We have a strict COVID lockdown at the Irish Rotunda right now.

171
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,160
Wait, wait, you don't own any of the oceans.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,160
I own all the oceans.

173
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
What are you talking about?

174
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,040
I said everything outside of the circle.

175
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,040
No.

176
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Okay, you...

177
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,040
But I own the air.

178
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,000
You said no, it was implied it was land.

179
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,360
Why did I imply it was land?

180
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,840
I said everything else.

181
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,840
Shut up.

182
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,840
The whole world.

183
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,320
Do you think the water's not part of the world?

184
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
No.

185
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,440
You can have a-

186
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,120
Okay Patrick, you can have-

187
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,000
A cloud.

188
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,440
Can I have a cloud?

189
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,120
You can have a cloud for as long as it lasts before it rains.

190
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,680
Yep.

191
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,080
Once it rains it goes back onto the earth, it's mine again.

192
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,720
I would like to have-

193
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,600
You get no part of it.

194
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,880
None.

195
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,120
All right.

196
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,680
Zero.

197
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,080
Zilch.

198
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,120
I get nothing.

199
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,520
Nothing.

200
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,880
What about-

201
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,440
You can ask to pay to stay with me.

202
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,000
Well, you can-

203
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,960
What about Australia?

204
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,600
None of you-

205
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
Neither of you want Australia.

206
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,160
I already have.

207
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,760
I yeah we have it under control that's me and cams like shared that's like the

208
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,900
demilitarized zone between the rotunda and the rest of the world we've

209
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:31,880
suppressed all the stuff that's going on over there yeah we've got it all figured

210
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,800
out yeah and this and yeah some of those accents to really had to go yeah we

211
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:43,560
don't wear what camps what where what where's the circle you can see it on the

212
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:48,560
map it's on the map where tell me tell me where the Google Earth right now yeah I

213
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,520
I mean I'm not gonna I don't it's also it is a secret location so I can't really

214
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:58,440
give it away on air like this is it around like County Cork?

215
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:06,280
It's around it's around it's round. It is absolutely round.

216
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,200
Patrick I'll tell you what you if you look at a map of Ireland right now okay

217
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,960
and you pick a point on it that's either owned by Caleb or me yeah I could that's

218
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
That's what I can tell you with certainty.

219
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
London dairy.

220
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:19,960
Is that in Ireland?

221
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Yes.

222
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,960
It's not London dairy anymore.

223
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
It's Cameron dairy.

224
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
That's it.

225
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,960
Okay, London dairy.

226
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,960
London dairy is Caleb dairy and that's mine.

227
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,960
So which one?

228
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Well, there's two London dairies, but now they're Cameron and Caleb dairy.

229
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Well, one of them's in the circle.

230
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
The one that's in the circle is mine.

231
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
One of them is in a different circle.

232
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Okay, okay.

233
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,960
So if it's in the circle, that means Caleb just has Northern Ireland.

234
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,960
Okay, so if it's in the circle, that means Caleb just has Northern Ireland.

235
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Okay, so if it's in the circle, that means Caleb just has Northern Ireland.

236
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,960
Okay, so if it's in the circle, that means Caleb just has Northern Ireland.

237
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:55,520
of

238
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,080
It doesn't necessarily have to be round a circle it can be like a shape that kind of just goes

239
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,080
What the fuck are you talking about?

240
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
A circle doesn't have to be round?

241
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,080
Yeah it doesn't have to be round.

242
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,080
Well I mean if you're talking about you know territory I mean

243
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:11,080
It's a geographical circle it's actually like a different thing

244
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,080
It has a different definition

245
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,080
It's like when people say that America is a circle

246
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,080
It's like it's obviously not but

247
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,080
Nobody fucking says that

248
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,080
It's when they say like the united circle of America

249
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:23,080
People say time is a circle it's not it's a line

250
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
Exactly it's a clock

251
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,480
so it's a hand on the clock the one not the circle of the clock get this anymore

252
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,360
well it's like it's like if you think about it basically is that you're not

253
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,320
welcome on earth anymore yeah like you're gonna have to like Graham is

254

Not for me.

291
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,800
I miss when female rappers were just like whores with deep voices.

292
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,800
Yeah.

293
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,800

Mm-hmm.

295
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,520
well isn't isn't that Nicki Minaj? She doesn't have a deep voice. Yeah that's

296
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,860
true she's got that very grating voice. She has a baby voice. Yeah. What's up with all

297
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:47,200
these baby rappers? Well no because she has different personas that she has different

298
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:54,200
voices for. Um. I'm a barb now. Um okay. This is my new decision to become a barb. Yeah

00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,040
podcasting where you do different voices. You get new personas? Yes. So like maybe

Mr. Bean. So really it doesn't matter all that much.

334
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,360
Right, because then it gets confusing because it's like, oh is he the Beans Man?

335
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,360
Or is his last name Bean?

336
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,360
Is he the Beans Man or a Man's Bean I ask?

337
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

338
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,360
Is he Chicago's famous Bean?

339
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,360
No.

340
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,360
I hope to God he's not.

341
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,360
They should do a Chicago Mr. Bean reboot.

342
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,360
Yeah, where he gets born from the bean.

343
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,360
And it's called, you know how he falls out of the sky at the start?

344
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,280

370
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:00,000
says he's in the middle of the Hudson River that's not good. That is a bad sign.

371
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,520
He's probably swimming, he's probably having fun. Yeah looks like he is, we should all wait.

372
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:10,120
Looks like he's 100 feet below sea level. It looks like there's some nice little floaties on his pin

373
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:14,680
right here so I think he's fine. It looks like there's some water. It says scuba.

374
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:19,880
Yeah it says fun under the dot so I think so I think he's fine.

00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:26,280
Wait hold on hold on click it click it uh click the three dots next to fun.

Okay. Oh my god it says he's funking underwater.

383
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,280

389
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:15,720
Wait, hold on. It says that fun is an acronym too. It says fuck, under, n- water.

390
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:20,040
All right. That's done.

391
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,200
Yeah, we may have killed that one.

392
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,800
We may have taken it one too far.

393
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I've been, dude, I've been so off. I've been so off lately.

394
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,880
The funky thing was strong. You've been off?

395
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,200
Me too.

396
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,160
Are you a dude of yours?

397
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
Have you been down bad lately?

398
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,880
Me? Have I been down bad?

399
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,000
Are my friends down bad?

400
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,440
I've been down bad, dude.

401
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,780
I've not been down bad, I've just been off.

402
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,600
David Ortiz shirt, I feel amazing.

403
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm down bad because God is throwing lightning bolts at me.

404
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,920
That is...

405
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,920
Try and kill me.

406
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,920
That might be Zeus then.

407
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,240
God doesn't really deal with lightning.

408
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,860
Well, it's a metaphor.

409
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
And yes, he does.

410
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,860
Oh, I got it.

411
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,860
Okay, continue.

413
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
My bad.

414
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,860
I got killed by God.

415
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,800
Yeah, I was killed by God several times.

416
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,880
I died a thousand times yesterday.

417
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:00,880
So that's how that feels.

418
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,800
I have tried a thousand times waiting for you.

419
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,300
No.

420
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,200
You don't like that song?

421
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
You're right, you are off. Yeah, off key.

422
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,400
Come on, brother.

423
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
That was horrible.

424
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,400
No, you know what it is? I ate a pulled pork sandwich before recording.

425
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,000
It's amazing that you are so easily affected by food.

426
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,320
Just any food that is not like an apple, you're like, "It's..."

427
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,440
I think I'm allergic.

428
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,080
It is... Allergic to what? Pulled pork?

429
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,720
No, an apple.

430
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,000
Oh, okay.

431
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,200
[laughter]

432
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,080
Yeah, I can use like...

433
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,440
If you had said yes, I would not have been that surprised also.

434
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,480
You'd be like, "I don't know, something about the shredded... I'm allergic to shredded meat."

435
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:46,120
Yeah. I, um... yeah, like if I'll eat... if I eat like apples or carrots, I think it's like... I think

436
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,360
there's some... I don't... I don't know what it... it's called oral allergy syndrome. I've talked

437
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,400
about it before where if I eat like raw carrots my mouth will swell up, but if I eat cooked carrots

438
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,600
it's fine. I think I might be allergic to eating a giant meal because it makes me so tired. Oh,

439
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:10,920
I'm so allergic to cigarettes. I'm allergic to beer because it makes me throw up.

440
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,160
I think I'm allergic to poop and pee. Yeah. I hate the smell. I can't stand it. It spoils my appetite.

441
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:23,160
It makes me sneeze. I burst out in hives every time I touch poop and pee.

442
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,360
And there's a big hive around my mouth. Yeah, I think I'm allergic to this stuff.

443
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,760
Yeah. Oh God, it's so gross.

444
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,080
I haven't touched it in years due to my allergy.

445
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,480
Yeah, no, I mean it's like it sucks because like I wish I could but it makes my mouth tingle.

446
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,840
Yeah, because I actually wanted to do like some like experimental art

447
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,680
with poop and pee but I guess I can't.

448
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,880
Yeah.

449
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,360
Oh well.

450
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,640
We should get into experimental art.

451
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,040
I'm going to do Piss Christ with Patrick.

452
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,520
Yeah?

453
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,080
Yeah.

454
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,000
Are you going to like 3D print me or like?

455
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,360
Are you not available?

456
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,360
I'm down to get 3D printed, but I'm kind of busy lately.

457
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,360
Can you just sit like David Blaine in a container that I pee in?

458
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,360
No.

459
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Why not, dude?

460
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,360
It's for art.

461
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
I'm busy.

462
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,360
Okay, okay.

463
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,920
Somebody doesn't care about the art world.

464
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,920
I don't.

465
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
I'm busy now, though.

466
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:14,920
You guys want to see my latest art piece?

467
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:15,920
Yeah.

468
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:16,920
Yeah.

469
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:24,960
I call this the persistence of sleep.

470
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,960
Wow.

471
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,800
- Oh my God.

472
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,920
- That's amazing.

473
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,720
- Yeah, so I got-- - You wanna see?

474
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,640
I crafted this.

475
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,800
I bought one of Cameron's pieces lately.

476
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
- Really? - One of Cameron's--

477
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,480
- You lately bought it? - Latest piece.

478
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:36,520
- You lately bought it?

479
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:37,720
- I meant to say latest.

480
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,320
- That still would not have made sense.

481
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,880
I bought one of his pieces latest.

482
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,600
- His latest pieces.

483
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,480
I'm off today.

484
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,480
- I didn't know which one you bought.

485
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,880
- Yeah, you ate pulled pork.

486
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,840
That is a-- - I did do that.

487
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,720
Now that one's called,

488
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,040
that one is called the persistence of sitting down.

489
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,200
- This is an instruction manual for a chair.

490
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,880
Yeah, what's that say? Shit?

491
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,880
Come on, brother.

492
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,880
No, it's a found object type of piece where you find an object and you say, you name it.

493
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,880
Um...

494
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,880
See, it has...

495
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:06,880
I've actually been working on a piece...

496
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,880
It could be whatever you want.

497
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,680
Look, it's got nothing in it.

498
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,480
I've actually been working on this piece lately.

499
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,480
It's almost done.

500
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
It's called The Persistence of Caleb.

501
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Really?

502
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,840
And pretty soon I'm going to be putting it on display.

503
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:22,280
I'm going to be hanging it on the wall in a very awful, bad-smelling, cold, and very

504
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,880
uncomfortable gallery that I found.

505
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,880
- No. - It's another one of Cameron's pieces.

506
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,880
- Blow off duster. - Now that one's called the persistence of no dust.

507
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,880
- The lack of persistence of dust. - Well I don't recall asking you for name suggestions.

508
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,880
- You're right. Yo, take a plump on the duster dude. Have you ever done that?

509
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
- No. - It's cold.

510
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,880
- It's cold. - Is he gonna do it?

511
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,880
- Is he gonna do it dude?

512
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,380
*sucking noise*

513
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:53,880
*screaming*

514
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,380
*laughing*

515
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,380
Don't do that again, dude.

516
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,380
Oh boy.

517
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,380
Oh fuck.

518
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,880
Oh fuck me.

519
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,880
I gotta sit down.

520
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,380
You're sitting down.

521
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,380
*groaning*

522
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,880
I have to lie down.

523
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,880
I'm gonna die.

524
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,880
I'm gonna die.

525
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:16,880
I think that is- I think- I think I'm over being addicted to like real drugs and now it's time to move on to like-

Inhalants and yeah and like all that kinda awesome shit.

528
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,080
You should just be like a casual poppers taker.

529
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,640
I'm addicted to candles dude.

530
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,640

Yo I'm looking like- I know people say you don't- you should like should stay away but

534

535
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,040

the

546
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,300
demi-hot

547
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:15,860
taking a hit off link air freshness like

548
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,860
Oh, hey guys!

549
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,860
Hi!

550
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Just pretending, just pretending it's got helium in it.

551
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,860
I'm so high right now!

552
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,860
Oh my god, anybody could fuck me right now!

553
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,860
You guys all look like Mickey Mouse!

554
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,860
Oh my god, oh my god.

555
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:33,860
Yo, I think somebody put on some Bob Marley.

556
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:36,860
I'm high as fuck right now.

557
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,860
Yo, I think I see a Chester.

558
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:43,860
Oh no, whoa, your head is so big right now!

559
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:48,260
You look about ugly as hell right now!

560
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,260
Oh my god.

561
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,020
Wait, you should put on- did you know if you sync up Dark Side of the Moon to The Wizard

562
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,660
of Oz, it syncs up?

563
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:59,900
Do you know if you put on Dark Side of the Moon while you're vacuuming the house, it's

564
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,900
so much fun!

565
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:07,140
Yeah, did you know if you put on Dark Side of the Moon while you're sitting there listening

566
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,340
to music, it actually syncs up to be a great album?

567
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,340
Mm-hmm.

568
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,540
Have you guys thought about that?

569
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,820
Yeah, you can do that with any album too.

570
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,820
No.

571
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:16,820
Only some.

572
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,460
No, I think it's a couple.

573
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:26,940
If you play Dark Side of the Moon and you play Bon Jovi, Slippery When Wet, if you play

574
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,660
those while you're listening to the other...

575
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:36,580
You can sync up Rucka Rucka Ali, I'm Black, You're White, Who Cares with Tenet and it

576
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:37,860
syncs up perfectly.

577
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:43,180
The funniest way that people name their album is seeing like a phrase painted on a brick

578
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,420
wall or on the road or on a street sign and just be like, "Yep, that's it!"

579
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:51,820
That's what the album cover for Slippery When Wet is too.

580
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,820
Yeah.

581
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,260
I think it's actually...

582
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,260
Damn.

583
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,260
Damn.

584
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,260
Recycling?

585
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,260
That's it, dude.

586
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,700
Thank you on a trash can?

587
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
That's the one.

588
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
Oh yeah.

589
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
Oh my god.

590
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Oh yeah, dude.

591
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
Men.

592
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,700
Women?

593
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
Men's bathroom.

594
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Cameron Fetter is banned from this bathroom?

595
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,700
I think that's it guys.

596
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,700
I think we found our album name.

597
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,700
Yeah.

598
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
This crazy sign I saw that says

599
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Cameron is banned for sneaking into the girls bathroom.

600
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
We should name our album that.

601
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,700
That would be so funny guys.

602
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Yeah, people would take pictures with the sign.

603
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Yeah.

604
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,700
Today I saw

605
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:43,220
I like walked around Williamsburg today there's still on every block a huge like

606

picture with it in Williamsburg there's like a bunch of them it's so sick dude

608
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:59,260

00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:22,800
they we used to have Achilles and Hercules and you I don't know but now we

Graffitis.

628
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,360
Achilles to Graffitis.

629
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,800
That's the name of one of my new art books actually.

630
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,800
That's so amazing.

631
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,800
Yeah.

632
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,600
When are you getting your art books published?

633
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,640
I already did.

634
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,680
So you're going to have to go look for them.

635
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Wow.

636
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
Whoa.

637
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
Did you self publish?

638
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
Did you go?

639
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,240
It's kind of a Banksy turn of events.

640
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,440
You go to the store, you want to buy them.

641
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,440
You can't.

642
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,320
In fact, the only way to buy it is to destroy it.

643
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,240
- Yep.

644
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,040
- That's some artistic shit, brother.

645
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,880
- God damn, that is so fucking cool.

646
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,960
- You will be a professor at the new school

647
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,480
within the year's end.

648
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,720
- It's all printed on like shredded paper

649
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,820
that doesn't make any sense,

650
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,640
but when you like put it backwards through the shredder,

651
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,160
the art comes together.

652
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,600
- Whoa.

653
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,440
- Yeah.

654
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,260
- That's incredible.

655
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,200
- You have to buy the special shredder I designed

656
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,280
in order for it to work.

657
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,720
Otherwise it'll just shred it twice.

658
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,760
'Cause a normal shredder doesn't go backwards.

659
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,560
It's a $300 shredder.

660
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,160
Oh yeah, no, it's way more than that.

661
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,840
I mean, there's only one of these in the world.

662
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,880
$300 installments.

663
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,320
Yeah, for a million years.

664
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,080
Twice a day for a million years.

665
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,140
And the contract does say it goes

666
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:35,840
through your family line forever.

667
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:36,960
Yep.

668
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,400
I'm gonna get, I wanna go to Best Buy and get like a--

669
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,240
Right?

670
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:42,680
Do you think, right before you die,

671
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,840
just taking out just an insane amount of debt

672
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,280
and just ruining your children's lives forever?

673
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,160
Genius, dude.

674
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,800
- Yeah, just like buying every--

675
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,480
- Just cruising your family line.

676
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,040
- Every 70 inch TV at Best Buy,

677
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,800
and be like, "I'm gonna finance it.

678
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:01,800
"I'll do one penny a day for one trillion days."

679
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,040
(imitates high-pitched squeaking)

680
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,760
Sir, why are you tee-hee-hee-ing?

681
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,100
Oh, no reason.

682
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,020
Okay, we accept.

683
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:12,280
- Yeah, I'll pay zero dollars a day for one million years.

684
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,760
- Duh, sounds good to me.

685
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,440
Those people at Best Buy are so stupid,

686
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,480
except for the Geek Squad,

687
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,840
the brave and noble Geek Squad,

688
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,520
who took down Osama bin Laden.

689
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,320
- I mean, hey, we said that graffiti artists were brave.

690
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,320
We forgot about the Geek Squad.

691
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,960
- Well, those are the same people.

692
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,640
- It's true, yeah.

693
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,560
- Yeah, there's a big overlap there.

694
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,360
- Geek Squad, graffiti artists.

695
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,040
- Geek Squad and graffiti artists, yeah.

696
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:36,880
- That's true.

697
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,680
Those are two of the most hip hop kinds of guys

698
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,520
you can have.

699
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,340
- It's true.

700
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,280
- I feel so bad for,

701
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,440
there's a certain type of person at Best Buy

702
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,100
like that works at Best Buy when you go in,

703
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,320
you look at them and you're like,

704
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,680
oh, like you wanted to work at GameStop

705
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:56,280
they wouldn't hire you. Yeah. It's so depressing. Yeah, the people who are in the game section

706
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:00,080
or like the PC's. Yeah, with like the really skinny guys with long hair and you're like

707
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,760
oh shit yeah I'm sorry man. It's funny, you could have got those pre-orders like for your

708
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,040
friends but now you're just fucking. Yeah, now you have to walk back and forth like into

709
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,080
the parking lot in the winter because people want to do curbside pickup for their iPhone

710
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:20,560
Charger mm-hmm I think like when like me too was was happening I think like most

711
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,720
people who were publicly shamed were like Hollywood people and then I think the

712
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,680
second most was GameStop managers because I think like four in my hometown had

713
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,720
like 1,200 comment Facebook threads about them oh yeah there's something about

714
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,720
that rush of power yeah that is like technically powerful but at the lowest

715
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,760
level that anybody can access.

716
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:48,920
So, they just, I think it, I think it, uh...

717
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,360
Yeah, well the thing is, everybody who, everybody who's a GameStop manager also plays like, like,

718
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,600
you know, fucking, uh...

719
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Fingering simulator 2 on Steam.

720
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Yeah, exactly.

721
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,640
They play like, they play like the Call of Duty games for like 24 hours a day and just

722
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,900
like, like get war crimes injected into their brain and it's like, "I'm gonna become the

723
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,640
manager and I'm going to be Ronald Reagan."

724
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,800
Do you ever hear about that Call of Duty streamer, he was like friends with Keemstar, his name

725
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,040
was Only Use Me Blade.

726
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,840
Oh yeah, Only Use Me Blade?

727
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Yeah.

728
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,560
I watched a video about him last night.

729
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,840
Oh he just became an alcoholic.

730
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:32,360
He became an alcoholic and then got banned from Twitch for showing his butt.

731
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,560
I used to watch him and like Sea Nanners and all those guys when I was growing up.

732
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,680
I wanted to be a COD pro.

733
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,960
- Didn't only use me, but isn't he involved in like,

734
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,480
I don't wanna get into like the--

735
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,440
- Oh, isn't he involved with like wings of redemption,

736
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,120
like trolling wings of redemption or whatever?

737
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,160
- I don't know what that is.

738
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,080
- Exactly, that's why I stopped myself

739
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,040
but then still said it.

740
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,040
- We need to make like a list of like,

741
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,880
me and Cam both make a list of things that we know.

742
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,960
And then you--

743
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:59,240
- And then I keep it to my computer.

744
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,040
- Yeah, you say I'm gonna stick to these subjects

745
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,320
and not go talk about one of the craziest things

746
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,400
anybody's ever talked about.

747
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,240
- Yeah, maybe if we like--

748
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,160
- Do you guys wanna talk about like

749
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,640
Lord of the Rings for a while maybe?

750
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:12,960
Maybe if we had a list of topics that we could that we made before the show.

751
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Wow.

752
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:18,240
Maybe like a bunch like we could come up with like something where like we go just go through

753
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,240
them.

754
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
You guys are talking on this.

755
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,840
What if we did the news?

756
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,360
The news is too scary to me and I watch it like a horror film all day.

757
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,560
What if we did one where we said where we wrote stuff about Chipotle?

758
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:30,560
Okay.

759
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:34,720
What if we did an episode about Greg Peppers?

760
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,880
Done before.

761
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:36,880
Who did that?

762
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,120
think it was you and me and him okay that makes sense all right what if we did one

763
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:48,880
where Pete word it was like a mailbag uh-huh you want to be in a mailbag for

00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,960
I don't even fucking know, dude.

767
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,960
I've done so much.

768
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,600
I've done so much, but I have nothing to fucking talk about.

769
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Basically, we have conquered New York City.

770
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
I can't believe you guys.

771
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,440
I was fucking, I was relying on, I've been sitting here doing nothing, wasting away with

772
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,200
God punishing me day after day, and I was like, "Oh, they're going to have some great

773
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,280
stories about like Jubio falling into a manhole or something."

774
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:24,520
Oh, you want to talk about Jubio falling into a manhole?

775
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,800
Yeah, I do have that story.

776
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,800
No.

777
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,320
No, Jubio's just like a giant Mexican toddler that I've been bringing around New York City

778
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,280
in people. How big is he? How tall is he? He's like 6'3". Yeah. Whoa. Very surprising. Came

780
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,300
hands. Just with his height alone. Yeah, yeah, he was, yeah, he got up and he hit it with

781
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:54,420
his head. Yeah. He's gonna be so happy to hear that we're talking about him. He is going

782
00:39:54,420 --> 00:40:01,780
through it cry you really cry no but I guess somebody I guess he was at like a

783
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,100
get-together and told somebody how much money he made every week and they got

784
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:14,660
really sad and nobody talked for like 10 minutes because he makes a Mexico wedge

00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:55,080
world and he snores like "Naaaaaahhh" What's his full name? Oh today I will say this, this happened today. Today I

791
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:01,040
parked my car on the street that is like the worst street to park your car

792
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:06,020
on but that's why there's always a space there. Car crash Avenue. It kind of is

793
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:10,000
car crash Avenue there's like there's a sidewalk on one side of the street that

794
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,000
that is full of like, like bear shit and like rappers.

795
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,080
Yo, what's up man?

796
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,440
And then like all these pieces of like cars

797
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,020
where people have gotten in fender benders

798
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,600
and like, like their bumpers have flown off

799
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,080
onto the sidewalk.

800
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
And today I parked there and I was like walking down

801
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,880
the street and there's a guy just like staring at me

802
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,320
at the end of the block.

803
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,420
And I was like, okay, this is weird,

804
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,120
but like not enough for me to cross the street.

805
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:37,660
And then I got closer and he was sitting with his balls

806
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:43,020
penis out peeing onto his balls and then the pee was flying in the wind towards

807
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:50,540
me and I had to like Matrix dodge the pee and get and move to the other side of

808
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,580
the street damn and he's just like looking at me like a bull like just

809
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,300
ready to charge. You should have charged at him.

810
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:03,340
I would have gotten fucking pee on my face. No I couldn't because I was

811
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:08,820
laughing so hard I just immediately started laughing and I had to I had to

812
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,900
cross the street yeah somebody just just just peeing

813
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,660
themself with just just no emotion in their eyes whatsoever is one of the

814
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:19,380
funniest and he was to their balls you know that it was his Pete had huge balls

815
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:23,860
and a very small penis and so the pee was just hitting the balls he was not

816
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:28,740
touching his penis at all there was no guidance was it was it his like his

817
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,300
pants were down or it wasn't wearing pants or balls were popping out of his

818
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,900
fly with his penis and he was just sitting there like like just staring at

819
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,980
me he wasn't even like asleep he didn't even he also looked like a normal guy

820
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,260
didn't look homeless at all and he was just peeing at me and looking away what

821
00:42:45,260 --> 00:42:57,140
street was this? 60th. Oh you saw me? Yeah what time? Oh yeah oh man. You guys see those videos that went around a

822
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,380
while ago on there was like a Twitter account where a guy just pees in public

823
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:05,220
like there's one where he just like he's just Pete just peeing himself underneath

824
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:16,020
a Burger King table like that's next level I thought they were they were I was

825
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:19,780
laughing a bunch and then there was one I saw that me I had to stop because he

826
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:25,060
was peeing in a ball pit. I was like, "Alright, yeah, I'm out."

827
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:28,740
How does that guy get that close to a ball pit?

828
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:33,580
I know, right? There have to be some kind of security measures

829
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:36,540
in place. There need to be defense lasers.

830
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,260
Also, the thing is about a ball pit, there's so much pee in there already.

831
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Right. There's no...

832
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:44,340
He's fine. They need one of those, like, fucking, like

833
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:48,860
a minority report, like, computer thing that can just detect if someone has the intent to

834
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:52,220
pee when they're walking into any definitely kind of children's

835
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:56,180
established and that's the only way the technology is used we never stop

836
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:00,100
otherwise yeah anything like that no abduction it's all that if you've seen

837
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,340
minority report you know it ends badly if they're trying to detect murders and

838
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:07,420
exactly it's snowballs I've never seen minority report but that is a crazy name

839
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:14,660
for a movie why why is that what the movie's about it's about it's about

840
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:20,960
time cops really they see that they see crimes before they happen yeah so why

841
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,940
is it called wait why is it called minority report I think Tom Cruise plays

842
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:32,020
the same character that he played in the last samurai okay yeah I think that

843
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:36,500
might be the name of the unit or something yeah something like that I

844
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,260
don't get why it's called minority you know you're getting hung up on the wrong

845
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,420
thing you know minority also just means like minority like it doesn't have to

846
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:47,780
mean like the kind of person that you're scared of or anything. It can just be like

847
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:53,300
what I mean like a small number. What Tom Cruise?

848
00:44:53,300 --> 00:45:05,820
I'm not. Yeah you're an evil racist. Oh the minority report is when it's a see

849
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:08,780
yeah it's the report that's in the minority that when they say when they

850
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,780
there's three psychics and they think that two of them think that it's gonna

851
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:15,020
to happen and then one of them think it doesn't and so that's the minority

852
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:21,620
report. Damn. I've never wanted to learn about justice more. Yeah. I need to learn

853
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:26,540
more about justice. Yeah because that's what that movie is, it's justice. Exactly.

854
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:30,580
It's justice stuff. It's justice for me because I paid $7 to watch it and I enjoyed it.

855
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:36,660
That's justice. I've been watching a lot of guys grocery games. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:41,960
of Hitler and then you open the door that's like Hitler's house and he's not

in there. And you look up and he's looking down at you from a cloud.

925
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,840

927
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:27,920
trying to get you to go to hell for so long and the only way that you find out

928
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,580
is because you can't see yourself in the mirror. Because he was a vampire. Because he was also a vampire.

929
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:39,460
That's a very good point. And he was a Jedi. Or a Sith. Which one is bad? He was a

930
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:49,260
Sith. Oh. What? Oh. Never mind. Something happened. The other day we were celebrating Neil's birthday and Pat

931
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:53,540
talked about Star Wars for an hour and a half and I kept just hearing him talk

932
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,540
about Star Wars again and again. It was kind of amazing.

933
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,540
Joe and Alex were asking me about it.

934
00:51:57,540 --> 00:51:59,540
And apparently it all stemmed from

935
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,540
somebody saying the word "Garagu"

936
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,540
and then Pat just had

937
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,540

938
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,540
moment. You have to, dude, he hasn't been

around people for months. You're right.

940
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,540
You need to let him get that stuff out.

00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,180
What are you talking about?

1011
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:30,180
I'm like a car because I'm going to drive you.

1012
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:32,180
Who's head was that beeping going off in the background of their audio like every five seconds?

1013
00:54:32,180 --> 00:54:34,180
It's Caleb.

1014
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:36,180
It's been going for a long time.

1015
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,180
I know.

1016
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:40,180
That was my humidifier.

1017
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:42,180
So thank you for reminding me to get one of those.

1018
00:54:42,180 --> 00:54:44,180
People are going to be so mad at you when this episode comes out.

1019
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,180
No they won't.

1020
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:52,020
fifteen minutes it was showing up on my on my my WAV my wave WAV so I was like

1021
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,900
I'm safe you just heard you there was a beeping in your room you thought I just

1022
00:54:56,900 --> 00:55:00,780
won't turn it off I'll just no I only heard it once I thought that it was

1023
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:08,620
outside I'm so smart about audio I'm smart if you complain about audio quality

1024
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:12,580
on a podcast yeah honestly you're a fucking pussy

1025
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:13,580
You'll bust her.

1026
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:14,580
Just shut up.

1027
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:15,580
You'll bust her as hell.

1028
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:16,580
Yeah.

1029
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,940
Just shut the fuck up.

1030
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:23,980
If you're listening to a podcast on anything where you can actually discern the quality,

1031
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:27,460
you better be listening to this on your phone speakers on the subway.

1032
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:28,460
Yep, out loud.

1033
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:34,340
This is either phone speakers on the subway or like your iPod headphones from like 2011

1034
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:38,660
where one of the ear foot buds is cut off.

1035
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:39,660
Exactly.

1036
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,100
It doesn't, it only plays at one volume, at 100 volume.

1037
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:45,140
- You're sweating, through your hand

1038
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:46,220
in your sweatshirt pocket,

1039
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:48,140
and you listen to it with one hand up to your ear

1040
00:55:48,140 --> 00:55:49,740
so no one can tell that you're listening to music.

1041
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:51,780
- Exactly, even though you are a grown man

1042
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,180
and you're not at work, you're at home.

1043
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,300
- You have to play this from your desktop computer

1044
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,980
and then put your home phone next to it

1045
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,500
and then call your home phone and pick it up

1046
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,820
and then go to work and then have your cell phone

1047
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,420
up to your ears so you can hear it playing

1048
00:56:03,420 --> 00:56:04,900
from your computer through your phone.

1049
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,840
- Okay, so you're gonna need like a bunch of marbles

1050
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,440
and a cream pie and some walkie talkies.

1051
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,980
And basically you're gonna press,

1052
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:14,520
you're gonna pull a string from your living room

1053
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,960
and all the marbles are gonna make

1054
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:17,960
all this awesome racing shit

1055
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,360
and then they're gonna press on one of the walkie talkies

1056
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:23,240
and then you're gonna hear a barbershop quartet

1057
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,540
that we hired to recite the podcast

1058
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,120
after they've listened to it.

1059
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,120
And they're gonna talk it to you

1060
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,200
through the walkie talk, walkers, talkers.

1061
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:34,200
- Basically what you want is some baking soda

1062
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,600
and some vinegar and you're gonna mix them up

1063
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,560
and it's gonna make a volcano.

1064
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:43,080
mmm yeah yeah you're gonna need some panko breadcrumbs for chicken breasts a

1065
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:52,120
bottle a bag of oil a bag of oil a can of San Marzano tomatoes a cast iron skillet

1066
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,560
and a cast iron fork and knife and a serrano chili and you're gonna make some

1067
00:56:56,560 --> 00:57:00,800
of the best chicken parm we've ever had brother shit a serrano chili and chicken

1068
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:05,760
parm it's makes it spicy wouldn't you just use red pepper flakes

1069
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,260
- Fuck no.

1070
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,100
- It's too dry, dude.

1071
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:11,700
You get more spice out of the fresh chili.

1072
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:13,580
You can use a bird's eye chili too.

1073
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,420
- Really?

1074
00:57:14,420 --> 00:57:16,120
- I usually just use the chicken in the parm.

1075
00:57:16,120 --> 00:57:17,520
I don't do any of the fancy stuff.

1076
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:18,600
- Don't take it from me, man.

1077
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:20,800
- Hey, this mayo-ass white boy ain't putting no spices

1078
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,520
on his chicken parmies. - Don't take it from me.

1079
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,840
Take it from Emeril Lagasse, okay?

1080
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,200
- Oh my God, famous Italian.

1081
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:27,600
- Famous Italian chef.

1082
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,440
- Emeril Lagasse.

1083
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:30,520
- Emeril Lagasse is basically Larry the Cable Guy

1084
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,860
for Italians.

1085
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:32,700
- Is he Italian?

1086
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,520
I thought he was Cajun.

1087
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,820
- Yeah, that's what I mean.

1088
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:38,740
He's like, everybody is like, he's basically playing a character.

1089
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:44,540
It's pretty awesome. Have you ever watched his pilot? No. He had a sitcom pilot.

1090
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:48,860
Really? Yeah, two actually. Was it sick? Two film sitcom pirates, pilots. Pirates?

1091
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:54,620
Emeralds, oh my god, Emerald Pirates. He was killed by pirates? That'd be sick. He's still alive.

1092
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:58,780
Uh-huh. Yeah, he is living, unfortunately. We should watch Emerald's pilot.

1093
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:05,820
okay I'm down that sounds uh yeah it's just a lot of cooking jokes so it's about

1094
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:12,460
it's it's about Emeril right that is so why don't they do like like they got to

1095
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:16,460
do like you know Seinfeld type stuff but for other professions that's what it was

1096
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:21,340
that's what it was that's that is exactly what it was it was cooking at

1097
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:25,340
the beginning of every episode yes no no buddy cam that is exactly what it

1098
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:29,320
fucking was really yeah that's so sick what kind of food jokes did he make

1099
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:35,100
there's a there's there's in the intro of it he's like oh I ate a chili that

1100
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,500
was so spicy it was there is like my uvula was a pilot light that wouldn't go

1101
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:44,780
out you ever notice how a potato chip and a chocolate chip look completely

1102
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:52,460
different what's a chip? A chip's a chip! I mean Jesus Christ get it together who

1103
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:58,020
are these people deciding what a chip is? Is there a committee of chips? Is there a chip council?

1104
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:05,260
And why am I not on it? I eat more chips than anyone. Why would Emeril do that voice?

1105
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:15,060
Because he's a sitcom voice. You gotta do like a Cajun Seinfeld.

1106
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,260
okay

1107
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:27,540
to buy you. How come when I go to the bayou, I'm doing only bayou jokes too? Bayou? Bayou?

1108
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:36,860
I live by the bayou! It doesn't make any sense! I'm down at the bayou but it's by me! How

1109
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:44,380
come? How about I buy you a ticket on my riverboat tour? Which I get! That's my job! I'm doing

1110
00:59:44,380 --> 00:59:47,860
it right now! How come when something comes out of a swamp it's a creature but when it

1111
00:59:47,860 --> 00:59:57,060
comes from a bog it's a monster oh that's fucking I had maybe you have to pee so

1112
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:02,260
bad for every time I do the Seinfeld voice I have a sharp pain in my penis I

1113
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:10,900
have to go baby I'll be right back guys the river Delta Delta's a damn airline

1114
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:15,580
why do you think I love I love Seinfeld like his major bit at least in my brain

1115
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:23,300
is like things cannot share the same name that makes no sense at all yeah I miss

1116
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:29,180
him also dead also in hell he's so dead yeah also we'll be so funny how he just

1117
01:00:29,180 --> 01:00:33,620
became Seinfeld just became like think you're too far from your mic patch

1118
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:40,220
Seinfeld became like the most out of touch person in the world well just like

1119
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,220
yeah I mean his whole...

1120
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,220
No I know I know I know

1121
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,220
You think he was like in touch?

1122
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,220
Yeah at least for a little bit

1123
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:50,220
You think he had his finger on the pulse?

1124
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,220
Yeah his observations were at least like

1125
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:54,220
Oh the train sucks

1126
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,220
Here's why the train sucks

1127
01:00:56,220 --> 01:00:58,220
Now it's like how come when I fly first class

1128
01:00:58,220 --> 01:01:00,220
That was so cutting edge back then too

1129
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,220
That was a really weird of the time

1130
01:01:02,220 --> 01:01:04,220
People were like I guess the train does suck

1131
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:06,220
Shit he's such a genius

1132
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:08,220
I've never

1133
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:12,060
said that Seinfeld was cutting-edge or anything I'm just saying it's like it's

1134
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:15,620
extremely funny how like all of his I like cuz he's an observational comic and

1135
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:21,620
all of his observations just became like oh yeah fuck it like it sucks when my

1136
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:26,020
private jet pilot looks at me it's crazy how out of touch the Queen of England is

1137
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:31,220
these days it's such it's so that's not even that is not even comparable to what

1138
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:39,060
I said. Okay that okay now how about that?

1139
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:43,780
Okay all right you made your point I get it. Yeah you're welcome all right I

1140
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:50,140
