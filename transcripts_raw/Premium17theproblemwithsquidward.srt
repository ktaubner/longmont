24
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,300
This cat doesn't like Indian food, huh?

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,620
cat does this cat like to eat meat yeah they eat that we give them wet food

26
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:07,140
sometimes we give them they like to eat duck that's a fancy cat that's a that's

27
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,260
a fancy feast if you ask me it's only like a dollar for the food it's a dollar

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:16,900
for duck now oh my god it does say it does say human grade they're doing

29
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:22,060
dollar down so you could eat the cat food that yeah here's my human grade for

30
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:31,260
that F. Okay. Yeah. Last night I had a Lyft driver who's this guy who just he told

31
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,740
he was telling us that he's been he hasn't had a day off in 17 years and he

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:41,900
him and his Brazilian wife she's about to get she gets citizenship she gets

33
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,820
American citizenship on like in the middle of March and then he said the day

34
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,460
after they have a flight booked to Brazil and they're just gonna live in Brazil.

35
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:58,100
Why? He never explained that. Yeah. Yeah, and but I just was enjoying him talk. He

36
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:03,340
said that the economy is gonna crash in December 2020. Oh, he's a prepper?

37
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:08,060
No, he's a Lyft driver. Well, he could be a Lyft driver and a prepper. Yeah, those

38
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,060
aren't mutually exclusive. I just told you he hasn't had a single day off in 17 years. What does that have to do with anything?

39
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,820
He has no prep time. Well, he could be working and then he could be prepping too.

40
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,460
It's a mindset.

41
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,460
Prepping is a mindset.

42
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,460
Yeah, absolutely.

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,460
Are you a prepper?

44
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,460
No.

45
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,460
No?

46
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,460
No.

47
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:31,380
I think, we were talking about this before, but I think the difference between me and

48
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,660
the people on Doomsday Preppers is like I believe all the stuff that they're saying.

49
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,140
I'm like, "Oh yeah, there is going to be nuclear war and we are all going to die."

50
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:42,300
But I just don't, I wouldn't try to live.

51
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,100
Yeah, it's just like you might as well, I don't want to be building a fucking shed.

52
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,100
I want to be playing video games.

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,440
Just think about how much it would suck to live in a bunker.

54
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:55,060
The thing is, is like, if you spend all that time and all that money, and then it doesn't

55
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:58,940
happen and you're like 80 years old, and you're just like sitting in your bunker like, "Come

56
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:02,300
on, dude, just fucking somebody press a big red button right now, because I just, I want

57
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,300
to use this shit."

58
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,300
You know?

59
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,300
You have a Tommy gun?

60
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,300
Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,300
You know?

62
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,300
The cat is being mischievous.

63
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,940
Yeah, he just wants to drink out of the water cup.

64
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,940
That's fine.

65
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,940
It doesn't matter if he drinks out of the water cup.

66
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,140
Yeah, but what if he spills it on the laptop?

67
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,380
Then take the water off the table.

68
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,380
Yeah, why is the water?

69
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,360
there's water on my laptop. We poured water on your laptop. And now the

70
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:26,060
cat almost drank it all off. Oh my god that was a close one. Oh my god.

71
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,380
Yeah but I'm coming straight off that Tom O'Shea roast

72
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,940
right now. Yeah. Yeah. Stop farting. I should not have ordered Indian

73
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,500
pizza before this. Yeah, Indian pizza. Yeah, that is like an evil scientist

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,180
disconstructed, the most like disgusting fart food.

75
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,020
- Yeah.

76
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,300
- Specifically for Patrick.

77
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,380
And it's like Patrick's dream food.

78
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,220
Like there is--

79
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,300
- Oh yeah, absolutely.

80
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,380
- There's definitely a geometry notebook

81
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,660
that Patrick doodled in when he was in third grade

82
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,100
that says Indian pizza.

83
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,300
- I didn't eat Indian food until this year.

84
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,900
- You didn't eat Indian food until this year?

85
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,460
- Yeah, I didn't eat Indian food until like two months ago.

86
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,540
- Dude, Indian food's the best.

87
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,360
- Yeah, I know.

88
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,820
- Indian and Mediterranean, neck and neck for me.

89
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,140
That's it.

90
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:14,900
I think Indian... no, Thai food's better than Indian food in my opinion.

91
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:15,900
Man, you crazy.

92
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:16,900
I love Thai food.

93
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,900
I bet you do.

94
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:18,900
I love that food.

95
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,900
Get out of here, cat.

96
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:20,900
Get out of here.

97
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,820
The cat is being a dick today, dude.

98
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
Get the fuck out of here.

99
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,820
He's not being a dick.

100
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,820
He's being so evil on purpose.

101
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Yeah.

102
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820

Yeah, I just want to ring his little bell.

I just want to ring his little bells.

I just want to ring his little balls.

Yeah, I want to dingle him.

121
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:32,340
Yeah but did the Tom O'Shea roast. Yeah. Give us some examples. Tom beat me. Tell us some of your

122
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:40,100
jokes the joke the only I we had the okay pretend Cameron is Tom pretend Cameron

123
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,720
at Cameron is Tom okay I'm not I do that no I'm let me imagine it I'm not

124
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,140
imagine with your mind imagining your Tom the one that so so we did the format

125
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,060
was you four jokes and then a knockout joke and a knockout joke just like a

126
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:01,180
good joke the knockout joke is like the the judges a cool one just confer or be

127
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,660
in between. So the first three jokes are like jokes and the knockout joke is you just go

128
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:11,100
and fuck you. Yeah. And suck my dick. And you say your phone number. Like a bag of farts.

129
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,220
That wouldn't be a knockout joke. That would be the first joke. The last joke,

130
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:21,420
the knockout joke is fuck you or you suck. The knockout joke is, it needs to be akin to a knockout.

131
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:26,620
Yeah. Exactly. So you would go like fuck you. I would call it, they had to explain the

132
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:32,780
knockout thing. I think of it as a fatality joke, you know? Yeah, or a babality joke.

133
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:33,580
Yeah.

134
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,420
If you're fighting a baby.

135
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,540
Not a friendship.

136
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:43,660
Definitely not a friendship. No. But yeah, I lost. But I think it's because my jokes were...

137
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:47,340
I just wrote jokes... I wrote jokes like everybody in the audience was going to be like

138
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,140
people who were already kind of on my side, but I just was too mean, I think.

139
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:52,860
Yeah.

140
00:06:52,860 --> 00:07:00,620
and not... I didn't do like superficial stuff. Like I was very rude to Tom. They had to ask...

141
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,260
They'd ask you to stop being so rude.

142
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:08,060
There was a guy... So I'll tell you the joke where I think I lost him. It was like,

143
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,020
"Cameron, I'm going to pretend you're Tom here."

144
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,660
Okay.

145
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,460
Cameron... So when I say Cameron, ladies and gentlemen...

146
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,020
Imagine it's Tom.

147
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,060
Imagine Tom.

148
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,060
Yeah. And you know Tom from the show.

149
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,700
There's a photo online on Facebook of Cameron shaking hands with Joe Biden,

150
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:28,460
who was a commencement speaker at his graduation. Now you may be impressed by this photo,

151
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:33,020
but what you won't be impressed by is that Tom didn't even know that was Joe Biden,

152
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,940
because Tom just saw an old man in a robe and thought he might be a wizard that could

153
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:45,340
resurrect his dead high school friend. Yeah. What? Yeah, I think that's why they lost.

154
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:51,980
Yeah, I know. You could have gone so many ways with that.

155
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,020
Nope, I did.

156
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,420
Joe Biden, hair sniffing, pedophile.

157
00:07:55,420 --> 00:08:00,140
The thing is everybody in one half of the room thought it was really good

158
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,860
and the other people, I got a couple of awes.

159
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,940
The judges? You got awes from the judges?

160
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:09,580
No, the judges were fucking, they were all like barred out. I don't know,

161
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:13,020
I didn't even know who the judges were. They were all fucking just fat Boston guys.

162
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,860
Yeah, it's guys like fucking Irish McNeil.

163
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,220
Yeah, Mr. Piss.

164
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,620
Mr. Fat. Mr. Fat.

165
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,740
Mr. Fat.

166
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,620
Steal your wife.

167
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:26,060
But I had a couple of jokes about Tom's friend, Tom's dead friend.

168
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,540
And then, and I told him we wrote together before the thing, like we kind of, we wrote

169
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:37,660
all the jokes together. And he, when he heard a couple of them, he made the guy who died,

170
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,420
his parents were supposed to come to the show.

171
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:45,340
And he made them sell their tickets.

172
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:45,980
Really?

173
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,540
Yeah.

174
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,660
That's so funny.

175
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:51,580
Yeah, he was like, yeah, his mom would have cried and his dad would have tried to fight you.

176
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:58,060
And I was like, that would have been like a win, you know, I lose but I have to fight some guy

177
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,860
who I'm making fun of that I've never known.

178
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,540
Yeah, that would have been a really bad night.

179
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,020
Yeah.

180
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,900
Anyway, it was fun.

181
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,660
And then I got to meet that Uber driver who needs a day off.

182
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,180
Yeah. He even worked Christmas, he said.

183
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,300
Oh my god.

184
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:16,860
Yeah.

185
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,900
No presents?

186
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,500
No presents for him?

187
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,540
Well, maybe.

188
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,580
My present is working.

189
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,980
What if he hasn't even been home?

190
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:30,380
What if he walked in his door, just can't even open the door, there's so many presents in there.

191
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,860
Oh my god.

None of the other little rappers are though, but a little pump

241
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Yeah, no Gucci man people think he's a clone cuz he got thin and he's had any smiles. He does he got

242
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,500
He got real good veneers. It's funny that he killed a guy and then put his body in a dumpster

243
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,080
Yeah, and then was like me sorry, and he's fine now. He didn't even go to jail for that

244
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:11,800
He went to jail for some other shit. Yeah crazy. Yeah, that's nuts. He's a man. I would never do that

245
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,240
I would never let him kill me. I would I would do that, but I would say I would say sorry

246
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:23,980
Mm-hmm. I would make a public apology. I am so sorry for the body that I just put in your dumpster

247
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:30,780
Pizza Hut. Ladies and gentlemen, I made a whoopsie. There's a dead guy. I think he was in the back of

248
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:36,380
a school. Yeah, yeah. I thought, yeah, didn't he like a high school? Yeah. Yeah, because the guy,

249
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:42,380
I mean, to be fair, the guy tried to rob him. Oh, okay. In his house and Gucci Mane shot him in the

250
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,900
head and then was like, "Oh, I don't want to call the police because I'm a rapper." And he, so he

251
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:53,660
just put the guy's body in a school dumpster. Yeah. He's like, "All right." I think one of the

252
00:12:53,660 --> 00:13:00,740
the kids did it yeah yeah the person in the dumpster was the principal and Gucci

253
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:05,940
man was just he had a contract the kids he's freeing the kids like like Dobby

254
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:11,020
like yeah it's a how either house cells but you have to kill the principal if to

255
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,660
give him a shred of his bloody clothes mm-hmm yeah I got the principal a bullet

256
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:20,220
and it frees all the kids mm-hmm yeah and then the kids get no homework

260
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:42,300
The N word is homework. Hey in this house buddy, hey take your shoes off and the

Tremors monsters. The Tremors monsters are fat. Yeah. He's very fat. The Tremors monsters are fat worms.

Fat worms with beaks. Yeah. That's what I'm looking at. The Tremors monsters are so cool.

266
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,720
This is one of those things where it's like maybe we don't, maybe we we don't see blue the same. I

00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:18,860
Like plain stuff, just 'cause when you add something else

00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,280
to it isn't gross, duh.

297
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,680
But like, on its own it's still gross.

298
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,920
- Yeah, you wouldn't just drink the fucking syrupy,

299
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,000
little slurpy syrup.

300
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,280
- Yeah, like a milkshake is good,

301
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:28,120

302
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,840
- But just ice cream is disgusting.

303
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,040
- I wouldn't drink a cold,

304
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,200
I just wouldn't drink milk on its own.

305
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,680
- You wouldn't drink milk on its own?

306
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,600
- That's weird.

307
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,160
Milk on its own is good.

308
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,000
- Yeah. - I don't know.

309
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,360
- I have a glass probably three times a week.

310
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,760
- I don't drink enough milk.

311
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,600
- Yeah, we need to get more in the milk stuff.

312
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,800
- I like milk, but there's a lot of almond milk.

313
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,560
- Do you ever had an egg cream?

314
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,380

315
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,520
- Whoa. - What's that?

316
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,620
- It's basically, it's this old New Jersey drink

317
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,080
where they put a bunch of chocolate syrup in a thing,

318
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,800
in a cup, and then a little bit of heavy cream.

319
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,640
- You know who likes egg cream?

320
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,480
- And then a bunch of soda water.

321
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
- Aaron likes egg cream. - Really?

322
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,000
- Oh, that sounds disgusting.

323
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:01,880
- It's really good. - Soda water?

324
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,960
- It's really good.

325
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,140
- Sounds gross.

326
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:08,060
it's really good and Aaron would know. Aaron if you're listening buddy, I miss you.

327
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:13,260
Please yeah. I don't know how he would. He doesn't own a device.

328
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:18,260
Yeah. He has no device. Yeah. I imagine him partly because of his look and

329
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:23,620
also just how he lives. Just like a castaway situation 24/7. Yeah.

00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,760
Wouldn't, wouldn't, don't you hate it when the creature gets in your hole?

361
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,680
Puts his long thing into your hole and snakes it up like a little worm that's

362
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,000
giant. The creature takes out your shit with his thingy. The creature scoops out this.

363
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,040
When the creature goes plumber mode on my butthole. Don't you hate when the

creature gets in you like a gorilla. I despise that. From behind. Yeah.

365
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:07,040
Creature go up in the air. Luckily for you, we have an invention that will save you. Do you?

366
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,040
It's called the anti-creature donut. It's like a hemorrhage donut.

367
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Hemorrhage donut? Hemorrhoid donut. Hemorrhoid donut. You put it on your

368
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,040

00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Creatures have taste buds on their penises.

385
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Yeah. They can taste donuts.

386
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
They can taste only donuts.

387
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah, I have a donut

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000

00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
And here is the donut

390
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,160

396
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,280
Yeah. The thing that sucks. The fish hook and then they put it in your mouth and it dries out your shit. I have thought at times about buying a sucker.

397
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:06,920
You know it just makes you it's just so your mouth gets dry. Yeah I know. Yeah.

00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,120
Well you can't... I just fill my mouth with water and then and then use a sucker on it.

399
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,520
Use your vacuum. A vacuum is too big. No, no you can make a part. You can make a part.

00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,760
Oh, yeah, no, no, no, no, no, let him finish I can make a part. Yeah. What the fuck are you talking about?

401
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,800
You could drill you can drill a thing of thingy. You could put a straw. It's too powerful

402
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,160
No, you put you put duct tape all over the end. It will create a black hole

403
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:33,680
It's too powerful. No

404
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:40,400
Over the vacuum and then you duct tape the straw to the back camera knows what I'm talking about. That's a stupid idea

405
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,800
Yeah, so I don't want no vacuum near my face. I want to suck it

00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:16,700
The cat crawled into Patrick's belly button and went under his skin and gave him real boobies

Yeah

414
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:30,240
Mummy is awesome. I've never seen the mummy ride at Universal better than the movie. I

415
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:35,320
Movie was basically there's like no movement

416
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:44,500
bathroom but that was like the movie does not even take a picture of you the movie

417
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:51,140

00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:56,540

00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:00,540

00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:14,980
Guys it is one of those walk around guys. I want to be

423
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,900
Around guys

00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:24,480
Yeah, walk around they shake around they shake their little instrument the cup with the change in it and they play music for everybody

425
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,140
I was saying I was laughing about like waiting outside a coffee shop

426
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,120
And if somebody walks out with an uncovered drink just dropping a bunch of coins like

427
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,540
Just dirty dirty

428
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,860
And you're clearly homeless. Yeah, you have a good one man

429
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:47,560
It's like stinky poop coins. Yeah, it but why not just go poop then the brown cause then it doesn't have the pretense penny

430
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:52,060
There is brown there is brown coin in there. There's brown coin. There's silver coin

431
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:57,820
When I was 13, I had an idea for a documentary and oh, I think I've said this before

432
00:23:57,820 --> 00:24:04,600
I had an idea for a documentary because pennies we lose money on pennies because they it cost more than a cent to make a

433
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:10,640
penny, cost like three cents or something. And I had my idea when I was 13 was to

434
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,920
make a documentary called, about that topic, about pennies, called Chump Change.

435
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:21,520
Yeah. Yeah, and I had, dude, I designed the poster. Didn't even think about starting

436
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,720
to make the movie. But I had a poster and I had a name and I had a dream but I also

437
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:32,160
had an Xbox so that shit was tough. Yeah. Yeah. We should have made that. We should

438
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:37,040
We should make another Xbox. We should make an Xbox, get this, 1080.

439
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:42,480
Okay. Because we'll skip to 720. Yeah. We don't need it. We're going full Tony Hawk.

440
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:50,880
What did he do? Tony Hawk did the 900. We're gonna do an Xbox 900. The 900 is different from a 1080.

441
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:56,880
We're gonna, okay. I don't remember the actual logistics of it. I think the 900 you go upside

442
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,920
down what yeah I don't think anybody's ever gone upside down on a skateboard so

443
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:06,600
what about sure about that? Mike McGill? Mike Berbiglio? What about Mr. Backwards?

444
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:13,480
That guy went backwards not upside down. Backwards the motherfucker. Did you guys see that post that I

445
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:20,000
shared? No. Did you guys see that post I shared? You're old. There was a no

446
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,880
there's this skateboard company it was like a 30 year old it was like Spitfire

447
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:31,840
No. I still ride Spitfires. Sick. But there's this company, New Deal, and New

448
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,920
Deal was like an old brand. It was like a very like... it had a lot of

449
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:40,160
people who were like ended up making other companies that are around today,

450
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:45,000
but it's like their 30-year anniversary was this year. Holy crap. What the what?

451
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,800
They had... Has skating been around that long? Oh my god. There was a guy who was on the

452
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,120
team, the original team, who couldn't come back for the 30-year anniversary due to

453
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:59,080
some allegations against him. And they made an Instagram post where they were

454
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:06,960
like, "Oh, our buddy Neil Hendricks, he just, he dodged those allegations and now we

455
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,960
have a new pro model for him coming out." And like all the comments are just like

456
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:18,000
like 45 year old former skateboarders just being like, "He had one of the best

457
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,440
inverts of all time and then you read the allegations it's just terrifying.

458
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:27,120
What are the allegations? Terrifying to you? He made a scary face into the camera.

484
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,200
smoking k2 yeah have you that's just reminded me okay - I had found this on a

485
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,840
Wikipedia article one time I don't know if I've shared this on the pub before

486
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,980
it's on the Wikipedia article list of entertainment affected by the September

487
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:51,840
11th attacks this is the Muppets yeah it's um the 2002 TV film it's a very

488
00:28:51,840 --> 00:29:01,060
Muppet very merry Muppet Christmas movie Muppet 9/11 the 2002 TV film yeah Caleb

489
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,660
Caleb. It's a very Merry Muppet Christmas movie.

490
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:05,160
Okay.

491
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,660
That's the name of it.

492
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,160
I don't care.

493
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,020
Has the twin towers standing in an alternate reality where an angel shows

494
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:13,060
Kermit the Frog what the world would be like had he never been born.

495
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,560
That's the thing about that is...

496
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,360
So they would still be standing if he hadn't been born.

497
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,360
It came out in 2002 though so they must have shot it in 2001.

498
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,160
Wait.

499
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,660
Yeah.

500
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,560
I didn't realize that was gonna happen and then release the movie.

501
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:26,060
Exactly.

502
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,060
Oh no one's gonna see this.

503
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:27,560
Yeah.

504
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,060
Wait so they changed...

505
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:33,060
So no, they didn't change it. So they filmed it before.

506
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,100
Filmed it before 9/11.

507
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,900
Or did they change it?

508
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,860
I don't know.

509
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:41,300
So does that mean the Muppets exist in a world where 9/11 happened?

510
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:46,340
Yeah. No, it was added. They were added. The World Trade Center was added.

511
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,140
Really?

512
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,500
That's what it says on Wikipedia.

513
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,700
Damn, dude. Genius.

514
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:57,780
Yeah. So yeah, if Kermit wasn't born, we wouldn't have had to go through that tragedy.

515
00:29:57,780 --> 00:30:01,700
They shot, what's his name, Gonzo? They shot him out of the cannon at the Twin Towers.

516
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:07,140
Yeah, he was the third thing that hit.

517
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:12,900
Well, are they saying that it's a bad thing that the Twin Towers are still standing?

518
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,140
I think so. Well, I think, no, it's like they're saying that Kermit the Frog...

519
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,180
We'll have to watch the movie.

520
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:20,340
It's a butterfly effect thing, you know?

521
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:20,820
Yeah.

522
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:26,820
Because that's what made Al Qaeda hate America. As they saw an episode of The Muppets,

523
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,740
They're like, "We have to destroy this country."

524
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,140
"We must destroy this frog and pig."

525
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:34,820
They thought that was his house, because they thought that he was the richest man in America

526
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,380
and he lived in the biggest building, and so they tried to take it down.

527
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:40,020
Oh, this is the World Trade Center article.

528
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,380
Oh, there's Cookie Monster taking a bite out of the Twin Towers.

529
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,100
Oh my God.

530
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,060
That's pretty funny.

531
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:47,380
That's on the cover of Sesame Street Magazine.

532
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:49,540
Damn, I gotta get a subscription.

533
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:52,340
This is the World Trade Center page on the Muppet Wiki.

534
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:58,420
A King Kong style enlarged Cookie Monster climbs the Twin Towers on the cover of the October

535
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:03,540
1976 issue of Sesame Street Magazine. His height reaches into the night sky, having taken several

536
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:08,740
bites out of both structures. Jesus Christ. Cookie Monster's height reaches into the night sky.

537
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:12,740
It's honestly crazy how many things there are like that about the Twin Towers.

538
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,980
Well, I mean, if you think about it, it's just like they're big buildings.

539
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:16,660
Yeah, they're iconic.

540
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:21,380
There's a Godzilla movie poster, like the poster for Godzilla versus Megalon. They're

541
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:24,100
they're both standing on top of one of the towers.

542
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,540
- But there's not as much destructive media

543
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,060
about the Empire State Building, right?

544
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:30,020
Which I think-- - King Kong climbed

545
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:30,860
the Empire State Building. - If someone,

546
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,980
if they took down the Empire State Building,

547
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:35,820
we would've struck back immediately.

548
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,380
- Yeah, yeah, there would've been nothing,

549
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,140
no holding back, dude.

550
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,500
- No, we would've gone full nuclear.

551
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,620
- We would've gone full Toby Keith on 'em, man.

552
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,340
- We would've shotgunned them all.

553
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,180
- Yeah, dude.

554
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,620
(laughing)

555
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:48,540
- We would've been shotgunned.

556
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,780
- Oh, here we go, we got,

557
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:54,620
about the the alternate thing. According to director Kirk Thatcher, their

558
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,820
appearance was not meant to imply that a Kermit is somehow responsible for the

559
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:02,340
destruction of the towers, but simply the background cycloramas/translights

560
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:06,220
that were available in Canada were more than a year old. So it's just old footage.

561
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,940
And that's just how they decided to cut it? Yeah. They just didn't. It's crazy.

562
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,660
Yeah, they didn't think about it. It's insane, man. What kind of Muppet-brained moron

563
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:19,380
came up with that one? Have you heard the Taliban song by Toby Keith? Have you

564
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:22,920
heard the Muppets song. Yes, we've played that on the show. We have? I think that was one of the

565
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:26,060
things we did on the 50th episode. Are you talking about the one that's like, and we lit up their

566
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,140
world like the 4th of July? No, no, no, that's a different song. That's, I like that one.

567
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:34,260
That's courtesy of the Red White and Blue. Courtesy of the Red White and Blue, yeah. The Taliban song is a song he

568
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:38,700
did with Kenny Chesney live. Whoa. And he added it to the end of Shocking Y'all. Is it good?

569
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,140
It's uh, I don't know. Give us a little sample. Your pipes are already warmed up for the recording

570
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:49,340
we did previously, so give us a little sing. Just play the Taliban song. No, you snip it, dude. I want to hear a

571
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:54,220
snippet. I just know that the chorus is "the Taliban baby"

572
00:32:54,220 --> 00:33:01,340
the Taliban baby? that sounds pro-Taliban. Yeah it really does.

573
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:05,500
People ask me like I honestly I just was I kind of was confused. Honestly I was on a

574
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,100
lot of pills. I couldn't remember which one was the Taliban. I thought we were the

575
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,500
Taliban.

576
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,740
got a nice guitar so far so far it sounds pretty good

577
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:31,700
snap your fingers I love your fingers come on T-Pain style baby girl let me

578
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:34,620
buy you a drink

579
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:45,580
whoa two-bedroom cave

580
00:33:45,580 --> 00:34:05,420
Kenny Chesney all of Kenny Chesney songs are about drinking Corona light on the

581
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:12,420
beach and then he pulls this fucking song out of nowhere. So we're sick dude.

582
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:20,420
They're saying, they're implying that the Taliban is what makes women wear burkas over there.

583
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:20,920
Yeah.

584
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
They have their religion.

585
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
They just hate women so much.

586
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
Yeah.

587
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:28,920
The Taliban, oh the Taliban baby.

588
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:33,920
The Taliban, the Taliban baby.

589
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:38,320

599
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,800
really makes beats on a speaking spell. He's awesome dude. I miss him. Scott Storch.

600
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,680
Yeah, there's the Make It Rain remix. I thought it was so cool. It was a Fat Joe song. I thought

601
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,080
it was so cool when I was a kid because the song starts and then the song like cuts and

602
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,840
he goes, "Yo what's up, it's Scott Storch, the number one producer on the motherfucking

603
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:52,040
planet. Took six months off, now I'm back up in this bitch." And then the song starts

604
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,480
again. He just wanted to do like a cool thing at the beginning. That was like his drop.

605
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,560
That video of him just sitting there playing that piano.

606
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,660
Yeah, it's so funny.

607
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,800
The Cubs jersey just makes that.

608
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,440
Dude, and his big fat fucking Italian face. That fucking chubby wop. I love him, dude.

609
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,840
He rocks. And just all his beats sound exactly the same.

610
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,320
Right, it's just him playing the piano.

611
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:23,200
playing piano. When was the last time you heard a song on the radio, a rap song, that had

612
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,000
like a piano riff in it? Right, I mean the last one, honestly the last

613
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,680
rap song I heard with a piano riff in it was "Same Love" by Macklemore. Whoa. Did he

614
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:41,840
produce that? No, that was Ryan. Scott Storch. "Same Love" Scott Storch remix? The white boys linked up again.

615
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:45,840
The white boys fucking linked up and killed the game one last time, dude.

616
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Yo, it's Scott Storch, the number one producer on the motherfucking planet.

617
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
I took five years off, now I'm back.

618
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
And now I'm back up in this bitch to make a gay song.

619
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.

620
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
Get 'em back.

621
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,840
Oh yeah, at the end of the Make It Rain intro, he says, "Get 'em crack."

622
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,840
Yeah.

623
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,840
Yeah.

624
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,840
Fat Joe was called Crack. Is Fat Joe still alive?

625
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
He calls him Joey Crack.

626
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
Yeah, Fat Joe, he got out of jail.

627
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,840
Oh, big puns.

628
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:14,360
jail for like being bad at QuickBooks. It wasn't even like a cool like reason.

629
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,960
That's how they got Wesley Snipes too.

630
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,960
Yeah, they got Wesley Snipes for doing that. But that was good because it made him do like

631
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:25,240
cool movies. Didn't he do - didn't he like to pay back the IRS, didn't he do Blade and shit?

632
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,120
I think so.

633
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:29,000
Yeah. I don't know which one came first. I know -

634
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:33,640
I think he got - no, because he was in jail. He went to jail for tax stuff in like 2011.

635
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:38,520
Oh, okay. Oh, I'm wrong then. Maybe I'm thinking - I know that George Carlin

636
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:42,120
like owed a bunch of tax money that's why he made a bunch of

637
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:46,040
bad a bunch of yeah George Carlin all that all this shitty comedy

638
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:50,760
yeah George Carlin stopped being good like when was that being good as soon as

639
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,240
like people didn't care about like gay marriage anymore

640
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,680
yeah because he'd be he'd go on stage and he'd be like

641
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,080
um uh i'll tell you what people i think gay people should be able to get married

642
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:04,760
and instead of people like crying they just be like okay George

643
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:13,840
like yeah he was on George Carlin he's on speed he's on a lot of he was on one he

644
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:19,760
was he was on one yeah dude he never lived to see same love yeah if George

645
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,720
Carlin God was a lie my administration oh my god he would have you were the hell

646
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,800
out of that man no I think you would have liked him yeah yeah he would have

647
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,280
had some great McCain material oh my god yes he would have yeah he would he would

648
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,280
just be doing Trump's, the shit Trump has done about McCain. Yeah. Yeah, if it came

649
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:42,480
out of George Carlin's mouth people would like it. People would love it, calling him,

650
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:48,240
telling everyone that he's in hell. That's so funny. Dude, honestly, that is so

651
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:52,820
fucking funny. So funny, dude. He rocks. Yeah, I hope he loses the next election but keeps

652
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:59,720
tweeting. Yeah, for me the ranking of choices is number one,

653
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:03,720
Bernie winning obviously. Number two, Bloomberg winning the nomination and

654
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:10,840
then Trump winning 99% of the vote. That would be so funny dude. That'd be so fucking funny.

655
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:15,200
Just like Bloomberg only wins New York. No he loses New York. No no no,

656
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,680
Bloomberg wins Florida. Yeah yeah. I was gonna say like Hawaii. Yeah he wins Hawaii. Yeah.

657
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:28,320
We just think he's like he represents the Aloha. He gets a Tulsi Gabbard. He represents the Aloha

658
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:33,440
lifestyle more so than Mr. Trump. Yeah. Yeah, they think Mr. Trump's fake tan is

659
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,480
offensive. Yeah. They're like, "We couldn't vote for him." No, but yeah, I think that

660
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,000
would be the best. That would be the second best version. Just because I think...

661
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,840
Third, Tulsi winning, by a landslide. I mean, Tulsi winning, yeah. Oh, come on, dude. I want mommy in the

662
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:53,000
White House, dude. The thing is, I'm about eating pussy and she's gonna, she's gonna

791
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:48,720
Didn't we? I think we said it last episode. Did you know that the cast of The Simpsons is the Seven Deadly Sins?

792
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:55,120

he just loves music

800
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:05,520
he doesn't talk because he used to talk but he did an offensive Indian accent

801
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,520
so they had to...

802
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:08,920
that'd be the best move for them to do

803
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:13,720
just make... there's like a poo gets hit on the back of the head and loses all function of speech

804
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:16,520
but he just does super...

805
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,380
- Oh no, Pooh gets hit on the back of the head

806
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:20,800
and then he just talks in just like not an accent.

807
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:24,000
- Just do one episode where he does black voice.

808
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,340
Just one.

809
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:26,240
Come on, just one.

810
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,160
Don't even, don't talk, don't think about it.

811
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,080
Just like a YouTube poop dub over.

812
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:30,920
You know what I mean?

813
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:32,080
It'd just be good.

814
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,040
I think it would solve, it would clear up a lot of stuff.

815
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,360
- Pooh says pingas.

816
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,440
- Yeah, Pooh does the pingas thing.

817
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:40,360
- He says pingas, he says over 9000.

818
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:42,960
He does, he says mama Luigi.

819
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,800
- Yeah.

820
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,620
- He says dinner.

821
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:50,500
Luigi no that takes me back. Yeah, that takes me back to my mama Luigi. You know how he says that's mama

822
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:59,220
And he goes Maria, why would he does a weird we Yoshi Yoshi doesn't speak any English

823
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:06,020
That's mama Luigi to you Mario like they say in Brooklyn and then early to bed early to get the worm or is it the bagel?

824
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,580
Yeah

825
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,820
And then Yoshi goes Yoshi goes like

826
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,620
My

827
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:18,460
Yoshi think Luigi mama you seen that clip. I made I made YouTube poops of it

Crapping. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I made yeah, I was a YouTube poop kid. I made a wow. I had a channel. I think it's still up

832
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:40,300
What was it called?

833
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,900
I made YTP MVs.

834
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,020
Whoa.

835
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:44,780
Which was YouTube music videos.

836
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:45,340
Yeah, of course.

837
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,780
But I took it... None of the ones I made were funny. I just was trying to recreate

838
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,140
the songs with the samples.

839
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:54,860
Did it work?

840
00:47:54,860 --> 00:47:55,900
Yeah, I mean, I did a few.

841
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,660
You're sort of a top storch yourself.

842
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:01,900
Yeah, but I had no... I don't know if they sound good today.

843
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,940
Yeah.

844
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:04,220
Back then, they sounded awesome.

845
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,860
Let's pull one up.

846
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:06,300
They could have got... They could have aged the video.

847
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,500
What's the name of the account?

848
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,220
I think it's, I think it's Wargers.

849
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,220
Wargers.

850
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,220
It's like war, G-U-R-S.

851
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,220
I hope he has like 2 million subscribers.

852
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:17,220
I, I...

853
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,220
This?

854
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,220
Yeah.

855
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:21,220
Brian Fellow?

856
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:24,220
Yeah, I don't remember the content.

857
00:48:24,220 --> 00:48:26,220
Oh, you deleted him, dude.

858
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:28,220
No, they deleted everything.

859
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:31,220
Oh no, they deleted everything.

860
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,220
Damn.

861
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:35,220
That's, oh yeah, because I mean it was inactive for a long time.

862
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,220
Damn, that's fucked up, man.

863
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:45,440
I just have the only things that I made on that are online for me as a kid are my

864
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,380
RuneScape music videos. Yeah. Yeah. Do a Lady Gaga music video you know what I mean?

865
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,340
Oh I have a video of me as a very young, very young, I look like an

866
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:59,700
oblivion NPC in the video because the camera that we recorded on was very bad.

867
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:04,220
Yeah. But it was a video we learned how to use the voiceover function because I

868
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,540
I had Sony Vegas because I was making YouTube poops.

869
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:07,860
- Dude, Sony Vegas was like--

870
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:09,580
- I had a pirated Sony Vegas copy.

871
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:10,420
- Absolutely.

872
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,860
- I loved the Sony Vegas 9 key gen music,

873
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,140
Unreal Super Hero 3.

874
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:14,980
- Yeah.

875
00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:15,800
- Doot, doot, doot.

876
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,640
That song's fucking, that song's awesome.

877
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,540
- Key gen music was also good.

878
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:19,500
- Yeah.

879
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,180
I tried to, I used to make YouTube poop,

880
00:49:22,180 --> 00:49:23,900
YTPMVs of key gen music.

881
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,100
- Yeah, that's what you do.

882
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,700
- That was my thing.

883
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:28,160
It was very hard to do.

884
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,580
I could, you know, I'm gonna try and make one.

885
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:36,080

I'm gonna get back into the game. The game miss you. Yo it's Worgers. I took six months off now I'm back

- I didn't know that was still around.

897
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:14,720
- I don't think it's still around.

898
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,440
- Well, now one of the guys is big.

899
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,280

904
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:24,320

905
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,160
- He was a creator of YouTube.

906
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,920

And now--

910
00:50:30,680 --> 00:50:34,780

911
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:35,780
Yeah, creating...

912
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,780

00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:39,380
Creating cum out of his penis when he sees a man.

914
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:40,380

918
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:44,380
There's this website called Daily Booth.

919
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,380
It was like pre-Snapchat.

920
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:48,580
You just took like pictures of yourself.

921
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:52,220
It was like Daily Booth because it was like Daily Photo Booth.

922
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:53,220
Yeah.

00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,220
So, you take like one picture.

00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:56,220
Oh my.

926
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,220
Ashton Kutcher was very big on there.

927
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,220
Are you serious?

928
00:50:58,220 --> 00:50:59,220
Yeah.

929
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:03,300
what we would do in the Skype group was we would go on Daily Booth and we would be

930
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:08,040
epic trolls. So we would comment on people's pictures just really fucked up

931
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:14,520
stuff. I think I showed my ass and my pubes once. Damn. Oh yeah I yeah we

937
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:54,440
more because you could upload pictures. So, I would just Photoshop, like save their pictures

938
00:51:54,440 --> 00:52:00,280
and then Photoshop them. But I didn't have Photoshop. I had some like, it was like an

939
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,200
in-browser Photoshop called Pixlr.

940
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,200
Yeah, Pixlr.

941
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
Oh, yeah. Pixlr.

942
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:08,520
Yeah, I used Pixlr and I would like liquefy their faces and then I would comment it. I

943
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,640
just kept blocked by people. It was awesome.

944
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:16,720
I one time fell in love on Omegle with some girl and then Levi, my younger brother, came

945
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,860
in and unplugged the computer as a prank and I beat the shit out of him.

946
00:52:20,860 --> 00:52:25,400
Dom's like her best friend met on Omegle. Really? Yeah. See I could have had a

947
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:29,600
best friend. I have to pee so bad. Yeah. We can pause it or we can stop it but I have

948
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,840
to pee so bad. We can pause it. Okay I'll pause it. Alright I'm playing it again. Did you guys find

949
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:40,840
his YouTube poop account? I found I found the one that I made in the one that I

950
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:49,060
came back with in high school. Whoa. The comeback. How many views does it have? I have 5.8k views

951
00:52:49,060 --> 00:53:00,800
on a video I uploaded called Full House Porn. And it's just a clip of... Let me turn it up.

952
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,960
not a good video. What does it say? I have 1k views on this. Go back.

953
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:11,960
You have to...

954
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:20,760
Wow, pretty funny.

955
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:23,600
You had a whole chapter that I didn't know about. Yeah.

956
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:27,800
That's crazy. I had friends from online. I knew about that. I didn't know any...

957
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,000
I really didn't like...

958
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,560
This was a pretty funny one.

959
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:40,520
This is "Fuck My Big Fat Titties."

960
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:47,960
I didn't really use the internet for anything besides gaming until like two years ago, honestly.

961
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:53,720
Like none of these videos that I've made on here make sense unless you also made YouTube

962
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:56,880
poops at the time that I made YouTube poops.

963
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,520
So it's like jokes for just like me and like 13 people.

964
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:06,720
Yeah see like if you scroll back far enough on my Twitter you just get like me responding

965
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:13,880
to like reporters and I'm like "what is the margin of error on this South Carolina poll?"

966
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,880
And like the 2015 primaries.

967
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:16,880
It's stupid.

968
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:17,880
Damn.

969
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:18,880
It's embarrassing.

970
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,620
If you go far enough back on my Twitter I think it's mostly just stuff of me in high

971
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:27,620
high school but I think I haven't really changed that much yeah there was one I

972
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:32,620
did bully some kid from my high school nice there nice some kid I don't know he

977
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:56,860

978
00:54:56,860 --> 00:55:01,820
hotel was it was a residence in by the Marriott well that's not a bad hotel dude

980
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:12,020
points I was like senior high school the day the day that I like my last day of

981
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:17,700
high school was the day that we moved out of the fucking hotel share room with

982
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:21,140
anybody? Oh yeah, it was the worst. I had to sleep on the couch. My little brother...

983
00:55:21,140 --> 00:55:25,860
Did you get continental breakfast every morning? I did. Oh my god. That makes it worth it.

984
00:55:25,860 --> 00:55:30,080
Yeah, it did make it worth it. That's so sick. But some kid, I thought this kid... Suddenly he likes breakfast.

985
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:34,300
Mmm, oh now you like breakfast. Switching sides on us, huh? Oh I never really got

986
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,400
breakfast. I would just get the juice. You fucked it. I would get the cranberry juice. You squandered, you

987
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:44,140

988
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,440
breakfast. A waffle on the weekends. But that's it. But like it has to be a big thick Belgian

989
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,200
waffle. Okay. But even then, even then I don't even, that's not even my first

990
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,900
choice. You don't even like pancakes? No. I don't want to go back into this. Yeah.

991
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,820
Yeah. It's too controversial. I got into, I thought this kid was making fun of me

992
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:06,860
for living in a hotel and then I found his posts on the Hypebeast forums and I

time. Oh, he did the reverse trick. He did the... YouTube pooped himself and reversed it.

1005
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:17,820
He clicked reverse speed. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, you guys didn't know you could move.

midair over the hole. Yeah, it was actually an indoor skydiving chamber. Yeah, he didn't move

1009
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:45,660
it all. I'm spinning around. Cameron is clipping through dimensions right now.

1010
00:57:45,660 --> 00:57:51,500
There's a good video of me when I lived in that hotel with me and my little

1011

1013
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:08,060
shits and craps into and he bounced on top of his shit and came all the way back

1014
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:16,460
it's backwards Patrick. It's doodle Patrick. No.

1015
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:18,460
Wait what did you say?

1016
00:58:18,460 --> 00:58:20,460
Someone reversed what I said.

Please somebody reverse that and tell us what it says.

1018
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,300
There's a good video it's me I was like 17 I was like smoking a cigarette outside my brother

1019
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,380
was like waving to my mom and I go up to him and I was supposed to stop before I

1020
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,700
actually put the cigarette out on his arm then he moved his arm and moved it into

1021
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:42,420
the cigarette just fucking burned his arm. Doesn't sound very funny.

1022
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:48,060
It was a good power and he just healed. Yeah. Guys I think I see something in

1023

1025
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,580

00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:21,500
I don't know how to do this.

1029
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,580
(laughing)

1030
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:24,420
- Yeah.

1031
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:26,900
Oh no, I think I'm gonna hold the microphone

1032
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:28,380
far away from my face.

1033
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,260
- I move away from the mic to breathe.

1034
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:31,460
- Oh my God. - Whoa.

1035
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:33,980
- Bringing it full circle. - Chocolate rain.

1036
00:59:33,980 --> 00:59:35,420
- Yeah, when the beginning of the episode

1037
00:59:35,420 --> 00:59:36,660
we talked about chocolate rain.

1038
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:38,460
- YouTube poop.

1039
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,700
Is a feel like this. - That song is not poop.

1040
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,860
- There is a bunch of chocolate rain YouTube poops.

1041
00:59:42,860 --> 00:59:44,980
- Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

1042
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:46,420
where it's like they go like

1043
00:59:46,420 --> 00:59:47,880
truck truck truck truck

1044
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:49,620
yet to the

1045
00:59:49,620 --> 00:59:50,300
the

1046
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,100
but that was a little live

1047
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,180
and we get to know

1048
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,060
always will make you to prove always makes you laugh when someone is really

1049
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,580
just like

1050
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:59,500
i don't know what you really think that it's not only

1051
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:03,500
the best always gets me or when someone reverses the second half of the

1052
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,900
sobel so someone goes like

1053
01:00:04,900 --> 01:00:06,700
soon

1054
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:09,140
says it yet for us to use the pool

1055
01:00:09,140 --> 01:00:10,900
for our fish

1056
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,500
please and i will use to say swears in front of us

1057
01:00:13,500 --> 01:00:17,820
I would use my YouTube poop reverse thing and say swears in front of teachers that way.

1058
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,380
I'd say, "What the fuff?"

1059
01:00:19,380 --> 01:00:21,580
Yeah, they totally couldn't tell what you were saying.

1060
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,500
That was like when I was a kid, I had this friend Liam who was sort of a bad boy and

1061
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,180
his dad died because he was a drug dealer.

1062
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:32,140
But Liam loved to say curse words and I did not jive with that.

1063
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:37,300
So I was like, one day he said, "Fuck" in front of me and I was like, "You said fuck!

1064
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,220
You said it in front of me!"

1065
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,220
And he was like, "No I didn't, dude.

1066
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:41,220
I said fuck.

1067
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,220
F-O-C-K."

1068
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,020
F-O-C-K.

1069
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:46,460
And then he just started saying "fuck" all the time,

1070
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:47,900
and I couldn't do anything.

1071
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,980
I was powerless.

1072
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,380
But then again, his dad got shot in the head

1073
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,980
while he was driving a Hummer.

1074
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:54,820
- Ooh.

1075
01:00:54,820 --> 01:00:57,460
- Who wins now? - Coolest way to go out.

1076
01:00:57,460 --> 01:00:58,820
- Yeah, the dad wins.

1077
01:00:58,820 --> 01:01:01,020
- Yeah, the dad wins, 'cause he's getting his dick

1078
01:01:01,020 --> 01:01:02,460
sucked in the Hummer too.

1079
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,460
- No, he wasn't.

1080
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:04,300
- In heaven.

1081
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:06,660
- He got his dick sucked in the Hummer in heaven.

1082
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:07,860
- Yeah.

1083
01:01:07,860 --> 01:01:08,700
- He got head.

1084
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,520
- Yeah.

1085
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:10,740
- Dude, he got brain.

1086
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:12,740
I actually don't know if that's exactly how he died.

1087
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,740
- You split that up? - No, no, I know that he died.

1088
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:18,740
I don't know if he died in his Hummer. I know he had a Hummer and he got shot.

1089
01:01:18,740 --> 01:01:22,740
- I just assume it was a cool movie. - You see, I saw on the highway the other day a Hummer truck.

1090
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:24,740
- A huck. - A huck, yeah.

1091
01:01:24,740 --> 01:01:26,740
- A trucker. - A trummer.

1092
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:28,740
- A hummer. - A humbler.

1093
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:30,740
- A hummer. - A humbler.

1094
01:01:30,740 --> 01:01:32,740
- A hunker.

1095
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:35,740
- A Conway Practical Elite Katana.

1096
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:39,740
- Nice, dude. - This is the unveiling.

1097
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:50,220
Tyler, Tyler it'll sound weird on the camera.

1098
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:52,620
You kind of just sound like comic book guy from The Simpsons.

1099
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,620
Yeah.

1100
01:01:53,620 --> 01:01:54,620
Yeah.

1101
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:55,620
I think that's his voice.

1102
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,620
That's literally the guy.

1103
01:01:56,620 --> 01:01:57,620
Yeah.

1104
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:58,620
You're right.

1105
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:01,700
He saw a comic book guy and he was like, oh my God, that's the coolest guy ever.

1106
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:02,700
I do that now.

1107
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:03,700
I need to do that voice.

1108
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:05,700
I think this was $199 US.

1109
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:11,580
I think it was--

1110
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,260
- I'll watch that video now.

1111
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:15,180
- $215 after conversion.

1112
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,800
- Man.

1113
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:18,620
- Can we watch that?

1114
01:02:18,620 --> 01:02:20,100
- Yeah, we'll watch the episodes over.

1115
01:02:20,100 --> 01:02:20,940
- Oh, okay.

1116
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:21,780
- But if you wanna stick around--

1117
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:23,820
- If you stay till the end of this episode,

1118
01:02:23,820 --> 01:02:26,020
then you can hear the katana impression.

1119
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:26,860
- Yeah.

1120
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:27,680
- I think there was someone who was,

1121
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:28,900
I think it might have been--

1122
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:29,740
- Whoa.

1123
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:32,060
- Someone was asking for me to post a video of it.

1124
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:32,980
- Of the katana thing?

1125
01:02:32,980 --> 01:02:38,100
post it. I don't know. It's a YouTube video. I don't remember who was asking me. I'm gonna

1126
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:41,660
have to look through Twitter. I think either way it'll be probably fine if you post it.

1127
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:46,380
Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. That's just really funny that I actually did the

1128
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:51,340
thing like three months later. Yeah. So I'll go back to the guy. Yeah, but he could be dead

1129
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:55,660
now. Yeah, the guy might be dead. Hope not. I think it might have been. I hope the guy's

1130
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:01,900
dead. I'll have to look up and see who was asking me. Oh, it was Joe Mama. What? Yeah.

1131
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:02,400
NO!

1132
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:02,900
That's it.
