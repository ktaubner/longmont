00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
you're listening to Israel's number one podcast.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,480
- Podcasts for the mindless.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,060
(upbeat music)

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,040
- Crap monster.

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,880
(laughing)

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,960
(explosion)

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
- All right.

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,040
- All right.

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,880
- Yeah.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,720
- Okay.

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,360
- Yay.

12
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:21,760
- We have somebody very special.

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,600
- Yay.

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,680
(laughing)

15
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
- Long time coming.

16
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,920
We have very important person, Tom.

17
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,360
with us here today.

18
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:31,860
Hello.

19
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,040
Tom is here.

20
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,720
Tom, last name on here.

21
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:37,600
On here, in here, inside of all of you.

22
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,100
Yep.

23
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:38,600
On your phone now.

24
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,920
Tom, all up in this, is with us today.

25
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,560
Very excited. How's it going, man?

26
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,720
Good, good. Thank you for having me.

27
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,160
Been waiting for so long to be invited on.

28
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,160
It only took how many episodes?

29
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,960
That's fine.

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,200
No big deal.

31
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,240
We were busy.

32
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,400
Yeah, we were actually like really busy.

33
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
We're so busy.

34
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
It sucks how busy we get.

35
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,400
There was this thing where Patrick, he had to like

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,400
make dinner one night.

37
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
That was a whole ordeal.

38
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
And I burnt the dinner too.

39
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh shit. Dude, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.

40
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Yeah, so now you feel bad.

41
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,400
I feel so bad.

42
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,400
I've been really busy too.

43
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
I've been kind of like working on my hustle.

44
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
My money. That type of thing.

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Which, you know, anyone who knows,

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
that's a 24/7 type of deal.

47
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Cameron has been auditioning for Stomp this whole time.

48
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:38,520
I've been auditioning for Stomp. I want to be, I would like to be a guy who gets to do

49
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,840
like the one really cool jump. Like I'm maybe not in the dance for most of

50
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,120
it but then I like jump from like 20 feet in the air and land on a trash can

51
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,680
and it makes a noise you've never heard before when my shins shatter. That's kind

52
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,280
of the role that I'm auditioning for. It's difficult. I've been in and out of

53
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,180
the hospital and the casting directors don't like me, they don't like the

54
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,280
threats I've made, they don't like the pictures I've taken of them.

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,680
And they don't like, they don't like, the thing is is that they don't like

56
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:07,280
something new, they don't like something fresh.

57
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
Right, I mean they just want to keep their old ways.

58
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
Absolutely, they want to keep the white man down.

59
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Which is, you know, something I've gone on about at great length.

60
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,280
If you read my blog...

61
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
[Laughter]

62
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,480
You wanna go more into this one? Yeah, let's lean in. Let's go.

63
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,280
There are a lot of good recipes on that blog too.

64
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Yeah, it's mostly recipes.

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,280
Except for the occasional post that's like, "Man, they won't fucking put me in Stomp!"

66
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:42,280
It's every recipe blog where there's like, you know, a thousand words of like the most banal story in a really good recipe.

67
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,280
Yeah, the story is just, "I have been auditioning for Stomp for ten months.

68
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,400
This is the only thing I'm allowed to eat because of my strict diet or my strict

69
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,160
training regimen. Yeah. Of making my shins as weak as possible so they snap on every jump.

70
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:03,840
Yeah I'm trying the calcium free diet. It's really been

71
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,520
doing a number on my bones. I can feel them getting crunchy. Yeah. They feel like

72
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,320
the inside of a peanut butter M&M.

73
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:19,200
I was gonna say if you're at peanut butter M&M,

74
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
wait till you get to Butterfinger texture.

75
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,200
Oh my god.

76
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,700
Oh, that's gonna, yeah, your bones are just gonna flake off.

77
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:31,200
I've been sitting in hot cars all summer trying to melt my bones down just a little bit.

78
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,600
I've been sitting in a hot car and then going into the, sneaking into the walk-in freezer

79
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:40,040
at McDonald's to try and make my bones more brittle so they break more easily.

80
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,580
- I've been soaking, filling up a bathtub with Coca-Cola

81
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,880
and just dipping my legs in for hours at a time.

82
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,720
(laughing)

83
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,560
- I've been--

84
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,520
- And the acid just kind of burned through.

85
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,080
- I've also been heavy on the microplastics diet.

86
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,440
That has been really good for me.

87
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,080
I'm working on becoming infertile

88
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:02,240
because that will make it easier for me to retain

89
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,920
and perform better in my auditions.

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,760
- Well, actually, if you want to become weaker,

91
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,560
you need to cum as much as possible

92
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,520
because retaining actually makes you really strong.

93
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,220
And that's just a fact. - It's true.

94
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,000
- I don't mean to correct you on your own show, but--

95
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,240
- Well-- - Like, I just, you know,

96
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,680
if we're gonna talk about retaining--

97
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,520
- Okay, let's talk retaining. - Why don't Cameron

98
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,920
just end the recording? - Yeah.

99
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,920
(laughing)

100
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,720
- I need to, I still need to have some strength.

101
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,840
I need to be able to jump.

102
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,760
All right. - No, no, they can drop you.

103
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,320
They could just drop you. - That's true.

104
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,760
- That's true. (laughing)

105
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,380
You know, I might bring that up to the casting directors.

106
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,400
That might make them a little more sympathetic to my cause.

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,440
listen guys you can you can just get pull me up there in a harness you don't even

108
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,480
don't worry about a catwalk or anything just let it go

109
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,640
yeah let me go let me do my thing all right nobody get me another just let me

110
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,800
fall it's gonna be good it's gonna be great

111
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,560
and i mean if you if there's another guy inside the trash can that i'm falling

112
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
onto that'll make an even crazier noise i mean it's all about

113
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,600
you guys you guys are making the same stomping noises day in day out i want to

114
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,880
do something new okay here's an idea we get an even weaker

115
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,960
guy inside of that trash can. And so when you land on him, he

116
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
crushes just in half completely.

117
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,160
Yeah, I imagine it's gonna sound like it's gonna sound like the

118
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,760
green line at the Boylston stop in Boston combined with the

119
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:25,520
Minecraft fall damage sound and it's gonna be incredible. It is

120
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,440
gonna change the game and just wait until I chop and screw it

121
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,280
because I'm also a DJ.

122
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,280
We're only gonna have one shot at this.

123
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,920
Yeah.

124
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
So you better get the camera out, all right?

125
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
It's gonna be so sick.

126
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,680
I'm just glad that, you know, Cameron's following his passion.

127
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
Yeah, it's beautiful.

128
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,680
Absolutely.

129
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,520
I mean, yeah, you know, other podcasts, other podcasters, they sit around, they, you know,

130
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,320
they talk for two hours a week to each other and then they spend the rest of the time,

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,120
what, watching movies, playing video games, reading The Silmarillion, going on a walk,

132
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,120
trying to figure out what to do.

133
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,120
No, not me.

134
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
I've never done anything like that.

135
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,420
and day out I'm jumping off my couch over and over and I am creating a hairline

136
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:15,220
fracture in my shin so that those puppies just explode out of my legs when I when I

137
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,620
have to stick any fall that's further than that.

138
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,740
Yeah, you're micro bruising your shins with a hammer by just tapping it over

139
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,620
and over again creating small fractures.

140
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:28,700
I have a doctor, I have one of those reflex hammers that the doctor they have

141
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:32,120
at the doctor's office and I'm just hitting my shins over and over again in

142
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:40,520
different spots and it I can see it's it's really it's really magical. I can see the effects taking

143
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:46,760
place and I think you're gonna like it. Yeah I think you're gonna really like me in Stomp

144
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:55,400
whatever the next Stomp is. They have like a whole theater I've seen I think I was walking

145
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:01,000
somewhere around here in New York. I haven't seen Stomp I've seen a theater that just said Stomp on

146
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,260
it I are you thinking of like a basketball court where you saw saw guys

147
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:09,680
jumping around I you go oh this is so this is crazy these guys that might be

148
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:15,720
it might be well it's a stomp no it's on second Ave the East Village theater with

149
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,640
shows ranging from Little Shop of Horrors to stomp but it's called stomp

150
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:25,800
so it's not called Little Shop of Horrors and stomp well it'll be called

151
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,800
little shop of horrors and Cameron's done.

152
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Hey!

153
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Oh my god.

154
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,800
They are doing Stomp.

155
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm looking at it right now. They have resumed

156
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,800
Stomp after COVID-19.

157
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Oh, thank god.

158
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Finally.

159
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
I might need to take a trip up to the city.

160
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Yeah. Go to Stomp.

161
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,800
Yeah, go to Stomp. Seven times in a week.

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I just want to

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,800
see how much tickets cost really quick.

164
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
They're probably

165
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:59,640
so expensive but I am on the merch page and I got merch they got merch dude they

166
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,940
got you can buy stomp drumsticks for $15 just like they use in the show they do

167
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,560
they use drums they wouldn't I thought they just I okay I'm gonna expose myself

168
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,800
here I've never seen stomp and I just assumed they jumped around a bunch that's

169
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,920
so messed up man I've never stopped either I think I've seen like a

170
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:21,720
commercial or a preview for it on a DVD or something

171
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,800
None of you guys have seen Stomp?

172
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,440
They do percussion with like garbage cans and stuff, right?

173
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,240
I've never seen Stomp.

174
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,840
Is that, that's an element of it?

175
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,400
Yeah, okay.

176
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,080
I'm glad I got that right.

177
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,280
Yeah, well, I don't.

178
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,360
I just assume it's people jumping around, stomping on the ground.

179
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,840
So, but then like, it shouldn't be called Stomp.

180
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,760
It should just be called like, "Noises."

181
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,000
Yeah.

182
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,440
Yeah, "Trash Noises."

183
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:42,840
Yes.

184
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,160
You're not going to believe this.

185
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,760
We could get two seats to see Stomp tomorrow.

186
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,360
Oh, shit.

187
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,000
for $48 each.

188
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,840
- Ooh. - What?

189
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,600
- They got three tickets available too.

190
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,440
Look at that.

191
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,260
They're all next to each other.

192
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,100
- Oh, look at this.

193
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:57,920
There's three of us here.

194
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,760
Let's go.

195
00:08:58,760 --> 00:08:59,600
Let's do it. - Whoa.

196
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,420
- Okay.

197
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,260
(laughing)

198
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,680
- Here, if we see Stomp,

199
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,180
I'm only gonna see it in Dayton, Ohio

200
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,840
at the Victoria on October 15th.

201
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,320
(laughing)

202
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,440
I'm putting my foot down.

203
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,540
- All right, I'll meet you there.

204
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:17,160
- We're gonna get Skyline and we're gonna go to Stomp.

205
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,000
- Oh my God.

206
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,600
That would be a dream. - Beautiful Dayton, Ohio.

207
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Yeah, beautiful, beautiful Dayton.

208
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,720
I love it.

209
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Tropical Dayton, Ohio.

210
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
Yeah.

211
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
I've been there.

212
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,960
I've been there like when I was 18.

213
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,600
I just turned 18 and that was like my birthday road trip was going to Dayton, Ohio.

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,680
I assume you went to the university and like partied or?

215
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,680
No, no.

216
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,680
It was me and my mom.

217
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Okay.

218
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:48,240
And my friend Alex and my dad, my brother.

219
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
Nah, that sounds like a fun trip.

220
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,240
Yeah, we just, it was the first time I've ever eaten raisin canes.

221
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:59,240
And then I found out that it wasn't a chain that's local to Dayton.

222
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
Oh yeah, you can just get that anywhere.

223
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:06,240
It's like when I went to LA and I had Chick-fil-A for the first time.

224
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
I had Chick-fil-A for the first time in LA too.

225
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Oh yeah, I forget they don't have it.

226
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
They don't have them around here. I think they have one around here.

227
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
They have one in Nashua, New Hampshire.

228
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,680
There is a there's a fake one in Boston. There's one on Google Maps. It claims

229
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,200
there's one but if you go there it's just there's nothing. It's empty and there are

230
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,000
a bunch of reviews on it that say "Do not go here this is a fake Chick-fil-A."

231
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,800
Yeah that was great because I did want to try it in Boston. I never got tricked by it

232
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,600
though. Me and Caleb were like yeah we walked to try and find it and we

233
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,880
just it was like an empty storefront and we talked about like taking a picture in

234
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,640
front of it and then just photoshopping like a Chick-fil-A sign there and just

235
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:52,460
like rating it five stars. I'm so glad they finally opened. Yeah we never we

236
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,080
never got around to it. That would be a good idea though you know if anyone else

237
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:59,800
wants to steal that go ahead. That's like that's like when the Taco Bell first

238
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:04,680
started open up. Oh my god dude yeah that yeah I'm that one I'm so glad that I

239
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,360
don't live downtown that I and I don't go downtown anymore now that the Taco

240
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
there because that would be a problem for me.

241
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Yeah.

242
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,360
That would be an issue.

243
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,160
You don't go to downtown Boston anymore?

244
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
Not really.

245
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I don't have anything to do there.

246
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
Go to Primark.

247
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
The Taco Bell.

248
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
Yeah, Taco Bell and Primark.

249
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:25,120
Yeah, well there's a Taco Bell near here too, but it's just far enough away.

250
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,120
Yeah, but it's not downtown.

251
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,120
Yeah, that's true.

252
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,120
It could be downtown.

253
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,120
You could do a...

254
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I could, yeah.

255
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,520
I've been to Boston twice in my life.

256
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,520
Yeah, alright.

257
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,520
Let's see.

258
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,280
What do I remember from Boston?

259
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:43,800
could help my sibling-in-law move, which is what I did the first time I visited, and then

260
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,400
you could take like that walking tour.

261
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Yeah.

262
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,920
Which we did the second time.

263
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,920
That's something Cameron's never done.

264
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,560
That walking tour with Taco Bell, now that would be a dream.

265
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,200
That would just be very nice.

266
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,560
It's a walking tour to Taco Bell.

267
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,000
And all the stops are just like, "Oh, this is where like..."

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,880
Well, I would go to Taco Bell first.

269
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,880
I would like...

270
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,320
It's like getting popcorn at the movies.

271
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,720
I would go first, I would get a huge bag, I would get like 20 items and I would just eat

272
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,760
them insanely loud right next to the tour guide the entire time.

273
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,280
And I would keep offering, I would keep interrupting the tour guide to offer them like a quesadilla

274
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,600
or something and getting really offended when they said no.

275
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,560
But why would they say no?

276
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,640
You're offering like a free...

277
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,120
Exactly, why would they say no?

278
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,480
I don't know, I guess it's kind of messed up.

279
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,840
Yeah, there would be a lot of trouble by the end of the tour.

280
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,120
I would be in a I would I would have gotten myself into in big trouble, but I can't elaborate on

281
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,120
It's a oh you could go to the

282
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,280
The army navy store there

283
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:47,200
Is there an army maybe so yeah, there is yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's disappointing that they have both like I'm supposed to have a rivalry

284
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,880
Right. Yeah, it's all okay. All along. They're on the same side

285
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,120
This sucks

286
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,120
At least I have wrestling that's still real. Yeah, but the army and the Navy that's fake that's

287
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,360
Yeah, that's ruining my mood

288
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,360
All right

289
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,600
I feel like we can kind of get into this stuff kind of early because most of them are this is I think longer than

290
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Most of the stuff we do

291
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,680
Yeah

292
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
So yeah, we got you know

293
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:22,760
Sweet sweet baby boy Tom with us. Oh, yeah, we figured we'd read some sweet delightful story

294
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
That will make nobody mad.

295
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,160
Nobody will get angry at us or tweet at us. Yeah, no one will say "ew". Nobody will be unable to finish this episode.

296
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,160
Well, they're nice stories, and they're nice. They're heartwarming.

297
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,100
Yeah, these are some stories. So basically you just throw this episode on.

298
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,200
You leave this, you play this through your baby monitor at your baby.

299
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:51,920
When your girlfriend asks, "Hey, what's the deal with this that podcast that's on your phone that you listen to?"

300
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,520
you can show her this one. Yeah, this is the one. This is the first episode you have them

301
00:13:56,520 --> 00:14:00,640
listen to. This is the girlfriend and parent safe episode. Put this on at work. Yep, absolutely.

302
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,640
If you're allowed to play any sort of thing at work, this is fine. Even if you're not,

303
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,880
you know, your co-workers are going to love you. Just put it on. So yeah, this is a, it's

304
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,920
not really a list, but it's a list that, it's a list in that it's a list of stories that

305
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,040
I found. Most of them are on DeviantArt, which I'm going to try and delve more into for this

306
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,480
show because I did not, I kind of thought it like it came in a stroke of genius. There's

307
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:28,280
I forgot there's like text posts on DeviantArt and there's some crazy stuff on there.

308
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,920
There's a lot of bad stuff on DeviantArt.

309
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,140
There's people that post their food all the time on DeviantArt and it's just the saddest

310
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
meals you can imagine.

311
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:40,680
I love the people who Photoshop themselves to have powers and stuff.

312
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
That's really nice looking at those.

313
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Oh yeah, those are the sickest ones.

314
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,960
Well, I like making them and imagining myself as being stronger than Goku.

315
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:50,400
I don't want to give away yet what this is.

316
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,040
So I'm going to read the title, but not all of the title, and I'm just going to start

317
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
reading the story.

318
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,840
And, you know, it's just a nice story.

319
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,920
So I'll just read this to you guys.

320
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,400
Fun with this story is called Fun with Babysitter.

321
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,720
Okay, off to a good start.

322
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,600
So it's going to be a nice story.

323
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,040
A nice story about a nice little evening.

324
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,640
Okay, here we go.

325
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,000
It's Sunday, meaning Max's mom is going out tonight.

326
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,660
Max loved Sunday because it meant he got to see his babysitter, Ashley, who he secretly

327
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:24,540
had a crush on. Max was playing in his room, patiently waiting for Ashley to arrive.

328
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:28,620
"Hey Max, we see Ashley pulling in the driveway so we're going to leave now!" Max's mom yells

329
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,300
from the other room. Max quickly jumps up and bursts out of his room. When he gets to

330
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,180
the front door, he sees Ashley standing there. "Hi little guy," Ashley says, opening her

331
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:40,980
arms for a hug. "Ashley!" Max yells as he runs over to Ashley and gives her a big hug.

332
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:46,940
"Bye Max, be good, love you!" his mom says as she leaves. "I missed you so much," says

333
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,340
Max, I miss you too, cutie pie.

334
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,740
What do you want to do today?

335
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,660
Hmm, I don't know.

336
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,900
You can't think of anything?

337
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,860
So, so far, this is just really nice so far.

338
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:56,700
I'm really, I'm--

339
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,580
- Yeah, this is a nice story about an adult child.

340
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,300
(laughing)

341
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
An adult with a babysitter.

342
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,300
- Yep, this is a 21 year old with a--

343
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,460
- 21 year old with a babysitter.

344
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,220
Yeah, can't stress it enough.

345
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,020
I fucking hope it's an adult.

346
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,860
- Jesus Christ.

347
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,900
- Well, there is one thing Max starts to blush.

348
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,500
well what it is

349
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
max give no on swear

350
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,220
and just let us know that more

351
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,940
you yet

352
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,340
you won't want to do it

353
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:28,300
what are you talking about you know i would do anything you want to do

354
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,420
but but it's

355
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,460
weird

356
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:33,340
weird so what there's nothing wrong with being a little weird

357
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,340
there is it

358
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,940
no not at all max i would never make fun of you

359
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,580
actually sweet angle like voice and a pretty big smile on max's face

360
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,900
so editor on here's a good idea

361
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:44,620
so

362
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,540

363
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,300

364
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,700

367
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:59,580
this is a little bit good to have a good

368
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,580
my blood

369
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,020
actually look confused

370
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,020
on now you think i'm weird

371
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,460
no max not at all i mean if you want a small but i guess there's nothing wrong

372
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,400
with that

373
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,620
so you'll let me

374
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,480
of course

375
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,180
max jump with excitement

376
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,780
So, I guess I'll just lay on my belly, and you can lay your face on my butt and smell it."

377
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,780
*laughter*

378
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,580
Max giggled.

379
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,580
"Okay."

380
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,780
Ashley laid on her stomach, followed by Max burying his nose in her cracks.

381
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,780
*laughter*

382
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,780
She was wearing leggings so Max could really get his nose in.

383
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:38,780
*laughter*

384
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:43,220
"Ha ha ha, oh, that tickles," Ashley giggles as Max starts taking big sniffs of her stinky

385
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
bum.

386
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,180
"How does it smell?"

387
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,180
Ashley asks.

388
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,180
"Stinky!"

389
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,860
"Well, duh, it's my butt!"

390
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,220
Max cointined to sniff away at Ashley's bum.

391
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,060
Suddenly Ashley felt a rumble a rumble in her tummy.

392
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,420
"Uh oh, I think I have to fart.

393
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,340
You might want to get away, Max."

394
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,900
"You can fart?"

395
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,900
Max says eagerly.

396
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,180
"You want to smell my farts too?"

397
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,980
"Okay, but I'm warning you, they're really, really bad."

398
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,980
"Birds, pfft."

399
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,980
(laughter)

400
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:20,580
All these stories have the most, the funniest onomatopoeia I've ever seen.

401
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,580
They're really...

402
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,380
They love onomatopoeia so much.

403
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,380
The smell hit Max hard, but he loved it.

404
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,980
He inhaled Ashley's toxic aroma deep into his lungs.

405
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
"Ha ha, you really like that, huh?"

406
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
Ashley wiggles her butt at Max's face.

407
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,980
"You... oof."

408
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:43,980
voice was muffled from Ashley Asscheeks. Here, I got some more. Burt. Blarp.

409
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:45,980
Blarp.

410
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,980
Blarp.

411
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Blarp.

412
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:54,980
Dude, I know exactly what a blarp fart sounds like. I can hear that in my head.

413
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,980
I know. I mean, it's beautiful.

414
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,980
I'm lost on blarp. I can't imagine a blarp fart.

415
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,980
I mean, what the human mind can create is beautiful.

416
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,380
with joy and farts the smell hit Ashley's nose phew that stinks she covers

417
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,120
her nose with her shirt I gotta say I'm impressed you can thank all the gas my

418
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:22,060
friends usually have to leave the room when I rip one

419
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:24,060
*laughter*

420
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:27,060
Ooh, a silent one.

421
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,560
That one gonna reek.

422
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Oh boy it did.

423
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,560
It stunk like a fresh pile of shit.

424
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
*laughter*

425
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,560
What?

426
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,060
This next one, this next word...

427
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:39,060
*laughter*

428
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:47,900
bubble blur. Oh my God, I'm so gassy today. It's your lucky day.

429
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,600
Isn't it Max Blorp each part max sucked directly into his nose

430
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,360
enjoy every second of what was happening. Okay Max. I think I

431
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,580
got one more fart in me Ashley grunts and then bo bo bo bo bo

432
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:08,620
The fart shook Max's head.

433
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,300
He couldn't believe the size of that one.

434
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,300
Ashley laughs.

435
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,900
"Wow, that was a big one, huh Max?"

436
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,020
Max pulls in head away.

437
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,640
"Yeah, it was huge!"

438
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,640
Max giggles.

439
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,620
"Ha ha, I'm glad you like them.

440
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,420
In fact, if I have to fart again later, I'll be sure to do it right on your face."

441
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:25,420
Max was so happy.

442
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:26,980
Now he loved Sundays even more.

443
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,180
Well, at least it had a happy ending.

444
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,260
That's what I'm saying, it's nice heartwarming stories.

445
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:34,540
It would be really funny if that had just like a horrible twist.

446
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:39,260
It's like, "Oh, and she died from her farts."

447
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:42,780
And Max had to explain it to the police.

448
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,340
Hey Pat, do you want to read this next one that you found?

449
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,060
No.

450
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,060
You sure?

451
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,740
Man, I hate this one so much.

452
00:20:55,740 --> 00:21:00,860
This one's really bad. This one I think is maybe the worst one of all, and it's second.

453
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:10,700
This one is called "Mom's Little Boy - Extreme Slob Story" by Kink Chameleon.

454
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:16,100
And the summary of this one is "Mother spoils obese son."

455
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:19,540
Oh no!

456
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:24,620
We can popcorn this if you want.

457
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,620
Maybe we each read a paragraph.

458
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,340
Alright, yeah, that's good.

459
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Three paragraphs.

460
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,800
Which one is this one?

461
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,080
This is the second link here.

462
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,080
Yeah.

463
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,080
Oh, okay, I see it.

464
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,080
Yeah.

465
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,080
I have to click on it.

466
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:39,600
I don't really want to click on it.

467
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,400
All right, it's not opening.

468
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,840
You have to hit proceed at the top because of how graphic it is.

469
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Oh, Jesus Christ.

470
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,840
All right, here we go.

471
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
God damn it.

472
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,840
All right.

473
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,640
Chapter one, "Moms" and it's in quotes, "little," so that's how you know it's two adults.

474
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,640
Yep.

475
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
I hate that there's so many of these.

476
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,640
*laughter*

477
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,640
I hate this so much.

478
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
Alright, come on, stop stalling, let's get it.

479
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,640
Shira slowly opened the door to her son's room,

480
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,640
carrying a large, three-tiered chocolate cake.

481
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,640
Immediately, the musky stench she loved so much hit her.

482
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,640
It smelled of piss, shit, and cum.

483
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:22,640
*laughter*

484
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,640
Her son's giant form was sat in front of the TV,

485
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,480
some mind-numbing game or other he was ginormous over 800 pounds and entirely

486
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,720
naked except for the various stains covering his body ever since he was born

487
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,680
Shira wanted him to have everything he could ever want and with the sizable

488
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,640
inheritance from her rich family she never had to work she could devote every

489
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:51,320
second of every day to him it's a good character work some good like yeah

490
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,520
lower building here no he would he would never have to work a day in his life or

491
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:04,760
worry about anything at all. In fact, he'd never even left the house or been educated.

492
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:10,760
She wanted him all to herself, living a lie of excess, without any of those silly things,

493
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,960
like thought or dreams. Just pleasure.

494
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,360
Ah, that sucks to hear.

495
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,760
It's so bad, man.

496
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,960
Who's going next?

497
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Just pleasure.

498
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,760
Alright, I'll go next.

499
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:27,200
Her daydreaming was interrupted by a loud whine and a fart from her beloved son.

500
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,660
The poor boy was hungry, and she was just taking in his brilliance instead of feeding him.

501
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:37,720
She quickly rushed to her son's side, son's side stepping past the wrapper's boxes and

502
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,960
the growing pile of shit behind her boy.

503
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,720
So cute!

504
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,000
As soon as he realized she was there, he released a torrent of drool and said, "Gimme!"

505
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,960
She handed him the plate and he immediately dug into it.

506
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,140
his face in chocolate as he moaned, taking breaks only to take a drink from his massive

507
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:02,200
extra sugar bottle of coke.

508
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,280
His toes curling in pleasure as he drank it.

509
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:12,020
As he continued his feast, Sheera knelt down and began massaging her son's massive stomach.

510
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,120
and begins shitting on the floor.

511
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,220
"Such a good boy, yes you are,"

512
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,420
she said, speaking in the same manner

513
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,700
someone would speak to a baby or a pet.

514
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,540
(laughing)

515
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,220
A baby or a pet.

516
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,180
She continues massaging his greasy belly

517
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,580
getting lower and lower as he continued farting,

518
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,820
shitting, and eating.

519
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,140
His moans of pleasure getting even louder.

520
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,540
- Dude, I don't think it's...

521
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,860
(laughing)

522
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,700
- Uh, no.

523
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,260
(laughing)

524
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,820
- I can't even, I can't even, like, no.

525
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,420
- Take this home, Cameron.

526
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,420
*crying*

527
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,420
*clears throat*

528
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:55,420
As she was tickling her baby's underbelly, she noticed that his cock was hard and immediately got to work massaging the shaft.

529
00:24:55,420 --> 00:25:01,420
Her little boy didn't like to be pent up and she had started taking care of it more and more when he stopped being able to reach it.

530
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:06,420
She began jacking him off with one hand and kneading his belly with the other, saying things like,

531
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:09,420
"You're such a good boy" and "You'll be my special little boy forever."

532
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:16,100
forever. The sounds of shitting only intensified as he interrupted his own moans with loud

533
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:21,300
belches and food. This continued until finally he came and finished his cake at the same time

534
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:28,300
to rest of dream.

535
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,060
And then, yeah, a nosedive again, screaming with ecstasy as he ejaculated all over his

536
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
mother's hand and his underbelly.

537
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:45,220
She began kissing him all over his belly and licking up the cum.

538
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:50,040
When she had laughed it all up, "More!" he shouted, punctuating the demand with a fart.

539
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,940
She would have to clean all that shit up when he was asleep.

540
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,420
Her baby needed more food right now.

541
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,580
She quickly kissed him on the cheek and rushed to the exit of the room.

542
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,860
"Anything you want, baby, you're doing so well."

543
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:04,300
She went back to the kitchen, her mind filled only with love.

544
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:08,400
My mom listens to this show.

545
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,160
My mom and dad both listen to this.

546
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,280
Hey, look at it this way, right?

547
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:15,440
This is not a premium episode, this is a regular episode.

548
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,500
If you're hearing this and you're pissed off, you better subscribe to the Patreon and listen

549
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,720
to something else, alright?

550
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,160
This is your punishment for not subscribing.

551
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,080
I think, I mean, that was nice.

552
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
That was a nice little story.

553
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,360
Exactly, it ends with love.

554
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:33,120
Yeah, it's just a story of family.

555
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,200
One of the tags on this one is burp freeform.

556
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,700
Freeform burp.

557
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
Freeform burp.

558
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:47,840
Oh, feedy, fat freeform, feedy, handjob, lazy freeform.

559
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,480
Alright.

560
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,480
That was really good.

561
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
It was nice, yeah.

562
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,480
And you said Patrick wrote that?

563
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,480
No, I didn't.

564
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,480
Oh, okay.

565
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Sorry, I misheard him.

566
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,480
it.

567
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:03,560
Oh, okay. Sorry, I misheard him.

568
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:09,120
This one's in the first person here and there's a lot of dialogue, so I was thinking maybe,

569
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,840
you know, I can read this, somebody can maybe play the part of the sister.

570
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,360
Oh, no.

571
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Okay.

572
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,560
I just saw the title.

573
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,720
Yeah. Well, no, this is another, this seems fine. I'm not going to judge a book by its

574
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
cover, right?

575
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:27,720
Absolutely.

576
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,240
So, when we see this and it's "Sister's Dutch Oven" I think, "No, that's fine.

577
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,240
We'll see."

578
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,880
Maybe it's not so bad.

579
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,920
Yeah, it could just be about getting a birthday present.

580
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,720
Yeah, a cooking dinner.

581
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,520
You know, that's what the actual Dutch oven is.

582
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,720
Getting a Dutch oven for your birthday.

583
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
Maybe that's what it's about.

584
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
Yeah, okay.

585
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,000
Alright.

586
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,240
And I like the first line here.

587
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,120
I'll be trying to do a simpler style in this story. I mean, I won't go back to my

588
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,560
original 2014 style, but this one will be easier to read than my recent stories.

589
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:08,880
That's good to know. Yeah. I just had a nightmare, one of those scary ones that

590
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,720
keep you awake for the rest of the night. I also can't sleep because of the

591
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,280
loneliness that haunts me. I'll be waiting until 6 a.m. Then I'll seek

592
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:18,600
comfort by my older sister, who always knows how to comfort me. It looks like

593
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:22,000
human life is just a sad condition. Is there any way we could be happy?

594
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,200
happiness is just a distant emotion that will never reach I hope talking with my

595
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,100
sister will help me change my mind and finally be happy that will be the

596
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:34,960
emotion I was waiting for my entire life I wipe my tears away and wait silently

597
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:42,340
suffering the darkness isn't helping me 6 o'clock a.m. I knock at my sister's

598
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,680
door I know she's already awake she tells me to enter her room who wants to

599
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:56,320
the sister I'll play the sister I mean let me get it is yeah what's wrong she asked

600
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,440
me worried she probably knew I was crying the whole night I need a hug I

601
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,040
told her and she immediately hugged me softly I felt a lot better um and I need

602
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:09,920
another thing too but it's pretty embarrassing to say that I say blushing

603
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,520
you can ask me anything I'll be here for you she said I almost cried you are an

604
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,880
"An angel," I say, almost crying from happiness.

605
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,240
"So what do you need?" she asks.

606
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,720
"Do you remember when we were younger?

607
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,520
You used to trap me under the covers and... fart.

608
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,400
Well I need you to do that again," I said.

609
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,920
"But why?" she asked.

610
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,760
"It will make me feel better," I said.

611
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,760
"That's...

612
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,760
Okay.

613
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
I will do it.

614
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
Anything for you."

615
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,760
she said.

616
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:41,760
"Thanks," I said.

617
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
She smiled.

618
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:43,760
"Come here."

619
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,160
warmly inviting me under her covers.

620
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:49,680
See this is nice, this is a nice family story, cheering each other up.

621
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,280
Nothing wrong with this so far.

622
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,280
I was so happy she was doing this for me.

623
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,760
My sister is truly an angel.

624
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,160
I remember when she used to do that.

625
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,960
I remember her farts were really smelly.

626
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:01,280
I can't wait to smell them again and be happy.

627
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:06,000
The nightmare I had tonight was incredibly scary, so I need a bit of fun.

628
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,240
And what is more fun than farts?

629
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:17,460
you you you can play the part of the fart here she farted a bit loudly after a few

630
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,780
seconds a putrid stench assaults my nostrils and makes my eyes water maybe

631
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,700
her farts are just too smelly for me I move my head to outside the covers

632
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:35,100
stinky oh yes it stinks a lot can't breathe in there I said smiling uh-uh

633
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,100
"Uh, but you need to breathe the gas to stay better. I can't let you escape."

634
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:43,020
She said, covering me with the covers again, just like she did when we were younger.

635
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,900
"I'm so happy."

636
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,660
"Don't escape!"

637
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,660
She warned me.

638
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,420
"Alright, Pat, you're up."

639
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:01,900
The inside of the covers smelled revolting. It was really hard to breathe in that stench.

640
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,980
Does my sister have skunk-like powers?

641
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,120
It smelled like a can of broccoli went really bad.

642
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,620
"Can I breathe fresh air now?" I asked, disgusted by the rotting smell.

643
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,620
"Not yet," she said, giggling.

644
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:18,620
But I'm glad I asked her to do this.

645
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,620
It really makes me feel better, even though the smell is noxious, pungent, and very strong.

646
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,620
This smell gives me a nostalgia.

647
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:32,120
The quality of the air inside the covers quickly deteriorated.

648
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,820
I tried to push a shirt over my nose, but it was totally useless.

649
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,360
It smelled much worse than a sewer.

650
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,000
I need to escape from this.

651
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,960
I try to escape, but she prevents me from doing that.

652
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,440
"No," she said.

653
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,720
"Please, I'm dying here," I complain.

654
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,200
"Does it really smell that bad?" she asks, giggling.

655
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,560
"This smell is rancid," I complain.

656
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,520
"That's a good thing to hear.

657
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,520
Things are gonna get even stinkier now," she said, happy.

658
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:05,520
*farting*

659
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,520
At this point, thinking straight was impossible.

660
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,520
I needed to get out from this eye-watering stench that permeated the inside of the covers.

661
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,520
Every whiff I took made me want to throw up and cry.

662
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,520
I begged for fresh air, but she wanted me to smell her all of her gas.

663
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,520
I was helpless in this vomit-inducing stench that wasn't letting me breathe.

664
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,520
I knew my sister had nasty gas, but I would never have thought farts could be this smelly.

665
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:33,840
"Time's over! I hope you enjoyed!" she said, letting me escape. I gasped for fresh air.

666
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,840
"Finally!"

667
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,880
"Thirty minutes, I see!" I say.

668
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,760
"Yup! Do you feel better now?" she asks.

669
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,240
"Sure," I said, smiling. Her gas reached her nostrils and she held her nose.

670
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,920
"Oh, man! I wonder how you didn't pass out from the smell. You can't breathe this thing.

671
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,560
It's too stinky!" she said, giggling.

672
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,680
"It was too stinky, trust me!" I told her.

673
00:32:55,680 --> 00:33:01,280
"You have been a good brother. I'll make you breakfast," she said, going to the kitchen. "I'll make you two eggs."

674
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,280
She said, smiling. I smiled back.

675
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:11,240
"I feel much better now, and the thought of that scary nightmare don't bother me anymore. My sister's stinky farts saved me.

676
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:16,400
I need another hug," I say. She hugged me again and said, "I love you."

677
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:22,220
I ate the egg she cooked, said, "Thank you for everything," then went into my room to play video games.

678
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:27,560
The sun is rising now and a new life for me begins. Hopefully a life full of happiness and joy

679
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:31,180
I think me and my sister will do this game more often so that I can be happy

680
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,440
I'm looking at the comments here. I didn't know there was comments on these

681
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,280
There's a somebody says love this and she's willing to do almost anything to help out her brother, too

682
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,800
And that's very nice. Yeah

683
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:52,180
Actually, and then they also say s actually this gave me the idea of Miyoko gassing her younger sister Kiko on like a dare

684
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:58,660
To see if she can survive her big sister's gas by locking her door, and she can't use her Saiyan powers to escape

685
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:06,860
Either or she loses I was wondering if you could do that and Kiko loves her big sister adores her actually their bond is massive

686
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:12,380
And they said I would do that in the next chapter life of coin conestine

687
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,660
World-building

688
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:25,720
Country yeah, oh man. Oh, yeah the the the the author of that was named chemical vacuum

689
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:30,900
Sister needed

690
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,700
Chemical vacuum oh

691
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,240
My god is a good

692
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,720
38,000 views

693
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,140
38,000 views

694
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:41,140
38,000 it is

695
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:47,940
Yeah, not enough honestly cuz it's beautiful. Hopefully. Yeah, it's good writing. Yeah. Yeah, it's really good writing

696
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:51,740
Yeah, I guess we should be plugging the names of the people who wrote these, you know, it's

697
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:59,980
really fair. The first Fun with Babysitter was by XStinkyFartBoyX. So, you know, if you

698
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:02,220
want to throw him a little money or something.

699
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:06,500
Oh, Chemical Vacuum is in the comments, it looks like. Oh, yeah, short but amazing.

700
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,540
Yeah. All right. Should we just keep going?

701
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,380
Yeah, what the hell? Why not?

702
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:26,740
Yeah, let's move on here to Amusement Park by GarbageMan95.

703
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,660
There's several characters in this one, so I don't know, we'll figure it out as we go,

704
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,660
I guess.

705
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:32,660
Okay.

706
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,580
This story contains fart humor in some detail.

707
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,540
If you do not like it, do not proceed to read.

708
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,500
It's a good warning right off the top.

709
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,500
Yeah.

710
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,260
All right.

711
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Are you ready yet?

712
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Sadie yelled.

713
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,620
"I'm coming, just wait," Ashley replied.

714
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:52,380
Ashley walked down the stairs, the steps creaking from the force of her weight.

715
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,900
She wore tight blue shorts with a matching blue shirt.

716
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,700
"Let's go already," Kelly said.

717
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,660
The four of them, Kelly, Sally, Sadie, and Ashley, began walking to their local amusement

718
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
park.

719
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,460
"I can't wait," Sadie said.

720
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:09,580
"Just don't get sick on the rides again," Kelly muttered.

721
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,020
They arrived and were greeted with the smell of greasy amusement park food.

722
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:16,540
"That smells great," Ashley said, sniffing the air.

723
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,340
"Let's eat first."

724
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:26,820
After waiting on line, and giving a nice view to anyone standing behind them, they couldn't

725
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,900
resist putting that in parenthesis.

726
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:33,580
"Oh, your whole story is about these ladies farting, but like, that's somehow the creepiest

727
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,580
thing."

728
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,820
"I know, yeah."

729
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,040
They found a table.

730
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,760
Their seats slightly bent as they sat down.

731
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,600
After devouring their food, the four of them searched for a ride.

732
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,360
"That looks like fun," Sally said as she pointed to a roller coaster.

733
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,360
Kelly's stomach rumbled.

734
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,600
"Are you okay?"

735
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Sadie asked.

736
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,960
"Yeah, I'm fine."

737
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,840
As the coaster was making its way to the top slowly, an idea came into Kelly's head.

738
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
"Wanna see something funny?"

739
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:02,120
Kelly said with a smirk.

740
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
"What?"

741
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:07,440
She leaned forward and released a foghorn of a fart.

742
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:11,440
slightly shook their ride and caused the passengers behind to gag.

743
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,680
The girls erupted in laughter.

744
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,280
"Nice one!

745
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,400
Wait, let me try."

746
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,880
She grunted, and just as the coaster was about to go down, a window-shattering fart blew out of her butt.

747
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:28,080
A few unlucky passengers had their mouth open. It stunk of rotten cheese.

748
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,200
As they were screaming from the ride, Ashley yelled out,

749
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
That was the turbo!

750
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,200
(Laughter)

751
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,200
The turbo!

752
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Soon later, the ride finished and the girls all had smiles on their faces.

753
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,200
"We should keep doing that," Ashley suggested.

754
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,200
"Do what? Fart?" Sadie replied.

755
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:53,200
"Yeah, it's funny. Let's find another ride."

756
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
They looked around until they found the bumper cars.

757
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,200
The four friends looked at each other and smiled.

758
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,200
The light buzzed green and everyone started knocking into each other.

759
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:08,880
"Brrrterrrr" was heard from Sally's car as she hit somebody.

760
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,240
Ashley drove towards Sadie and turned around so her backside was facing her and grunted

761
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,240
loudly.

762
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,280
This time, a low fart came out.

763
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,200
It stunk twice as worse as her other ones and lingered in the air.

764
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,440
Anyone driving into it would be hit by a wave of stink.

765
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,200
The cars turned off and they all got off from their cars.

766
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,880
Ashley had farted so hard on the bumper car that it still smelled after she got off.

767
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,800
As they walked away, they saw a machine that twirled you around.

768
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,760
Strapped inside, the ride started.

769
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,760
"Woo!"

770
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,160
Kelly screamed.

771
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,360
"Watch this," Sally said.

772
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,440
She then released a terrible silent fart.

773
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,160
It engulfed the ride and hit all the passengers with a wave of rotten eggs.

774
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,440
They all laughed.

775
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,400
"Okay, it's getting late."

776
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,000
"Alright, one more ride.

777
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,640
The grand finale," Sadie smirked.

778
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,200
"So, oh wait, who's saying this?"

779
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,200
"I don't know who that is."

780
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
"I think Ashley, maybe?"

781
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
"Okay."

782
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,440
So Ferris wheel? I mean yeah this is the kind of thing they got if they ever want

783
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,560
to film adaptation of this they have to clean up the dialogue. Yeah. They have to

784
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,200
make it clear who's saying what because it's just hard it's hard to understand.

785
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:10,120
We're doing our best. Yeah. But we don't have a lot to work with right now.

786
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:14,200
After walking there the four girls board the ride. It slowly turned as they reach

787
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:22,120
the peak of the wheel. Okay ready? All smiled. Yeah. They all lowered their pants.

788
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:25,840
They all lowered their pants so their bare butts were revealed. They hung their

789
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
their cheeks off the rail for all to see.

790
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:31,160
Come on man!

791
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,680
Three, two, one.

792
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:43,120
At once, the girls erupted in a gigantic fart.

793
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,640
It sounded as if three truck horns went off at once.

794
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:46,960
Cheeks vibrating from the farts,

795
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,980
it even caused the Ferris wheel to move faster slightly.

796
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,440
The smell was awful as it drifted downward,

797
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,260
enveloping a portion of the park.

798
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,200
They all laughed at their smelly work.

799
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,680
Guys got any more?

800
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Sadie laughed.

801
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,100
If I push any harder, something other than gas is gonna come out.

802
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,740
They exited the Ferris wheel and went home from a day of stink.

803
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:11,740
This is at the bottom here, there's a description about this story.

804
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,080
Four gassy girls go to an amusement park.

805
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,920
Request from Codemaster 9999.

806
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,680
Sadie, Sally, Ashley, and Kelly are his OCs.

807
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,040
Sorry it took so long.

808
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:24,840
I felt it wasn't its best and still do.

809
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,840
Hope you enjoy.

810
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,640
I want to read a really good comment here.

811
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:34,280
This is a comment from user "That Guy Likes Farts."

812
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,400
I like and hate this story.

813
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:40,480
Like probably the first story that doesn't end up with someone shitting themselves.

814
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,320
Loves all fart stories.

815
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,480
Hey, they quote, they all lowered their pants so their bare butts were revealed.

816
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,720
They hung their cheeks off the rail for all to see.

817
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,920
I read some pretty nasty shit, but that's just wrong.

818
00:40:51,920 --> 00:41:01,120
That's the worst part. I mean, I like farts as much as the best guy, the next guy, but

819
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,720
bare butts, no thank you.

820
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:05,240
Yeah, uh-uh. No, you keep the clothes on that thing.

821
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:12,120
I like that Garbage Man has his copyright there. In case I steal the story, he's going

822
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:15,320
to sue me. I'm going to get DMCA'd.

823
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,040
That was really good though.

824
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,840
I'm glad I will say to his credit.

825
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,340
They weren't family members and that's been a big step up, you

826
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
know, for the last couple ones.

827
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,840
They were just four friends.

828
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:27,540
Four friends.

829
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,640
Just four friends.

830
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,440
Then nothing.

831
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,340
No other qualities about them really either.

832
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,840
Yeah, just four friends.

833
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,240
And they love to fart and they stoke really bad.

834
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,340
They like to fart and go on the rides.

835
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,840
Who doesn't like to do that?

836
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,340
Yeah.

837
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,040
Yeah.

838
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,240
What are you supposed to do?

839
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,940
Hold the fart till you get off the ride?

840
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:47,400
No, you're supposed to engulf the ride with a big sticky fart.

841
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,400
You're supposed to hit them with a wave of eggs.

842
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,520
Yeah.

843
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,200
The turbo makes the ride go faster, so it's more fun.

844
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:53,960
Mm-hmm.

845
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,760
Yeah.

846
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,400
I'm just glad that one of them didn't fart

847
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:59,240
and it ignited something in the engine of the bumper car,

848
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:03,560
so a spark from the bumper car made the whole ride explode.

849
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,600
That would have been really bad.

850
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:10,320
Yeah, and I'm glad they never include the other people

851
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,000
on the ride puking their guts up and being nasty like that,

852
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,520
Yeah, because that would be too much for me.

853
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,520
That would be too long.

854
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,200
I mean, you know, I can handle farts.

855
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
I don't think puke...

856
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,200
No, that's disgusting.

857
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Absolutely not.

858
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,280
No, puke, it's just wrong.

859
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
There's a comment here...

860
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,280
Yeah.

861
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,160
It's childish as hell.

862
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,800
The comment here from Lone Skunk just says, "What made you write this?"

863
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,680
Well, Lone Skunk obviously didn't read the bottom because it was a request from Codemaster

864
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,680
9999.

865
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,680
Obviously.

866
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
Very obvious.

867
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,680
Yeah.

868
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:40,680
This next one's pretty long, but...

869
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
It is long.

870
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,920
It is, I thought that, you know, it's a nice, it's a supernatural twist on the

871
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,360
genre. I think maybe we can switch off paragraphs here. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

872
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,440
and also I would like to say so far, if we're rating these, you know, so far,

873
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,280
five stars, all of them. Yeah. Five out of five. Perfect. Yeah. I just can't maybe

874
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,640
but yeah, I'm going to be on good read.

875
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,480
I'm going to be recommending them to my to my high school English teacher. That's

876
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,400
friend to be on Goodreads. I've already printed out "Mom's Little Boy." I'm putting it in each

877
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,880
of my neighbor's mailboxes. Like, you gotta read this. I'm leaving them in the Little Free Libraries.

878
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:30,800
I'm putting them all in, like, leather-bound, like, books. It's gonna be great.

879
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:35,360
A compilation of really good stories. Yeah, and speaking of leather-bound books,

880
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:40,300
This next one by ubiquitous 101 is a girl's gassy spell book

881
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:49,600
All right, this was another request this is another request this one's pretty long, but you know, hopefully it's rewarding

882
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:53,720
Arena Lexington was your typical college sophomore

883
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:57,880
She was on her way home, but had decided to take a look at some of her college towns older buildings

884
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:04,080
It was then that she saw the book. It was a strange ancient looking book covered with dust and bizarre writing. This is strange

885
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,240
Why is this book just lying here? She couldn't help but pick it up.

886
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:12,080
Oh, well, it looks like the owner didn't want it anymore. So Irina decided to take it home with her.

887
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:19,580
Irina arrived at her house and examined the book. What's this? Looks like a spell book. She took a closer look at the writing.

888
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
I wonder...

889
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,580
She just knows it's a spell book.

890
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,580
It just says spell book on the first page.

891
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,980
Chapter 1 Fart Spell. It's like, oh, okay.

892
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,080
Irina couldn't resist the temptation. She tried to say one of the strange incantations.

893
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:40,800
Irina waited for a few seconds, then laughed. "Nope, just an old book with weird writing."

894
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,560
Irina put down the book and stood up.

895
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:49,440
It was then that she first felt it. A very slight pressure in her stomach.

896
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:54,160
A mild, but insistent bloating. "Oh my," Irina exclaimed.

897
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,480
The swelling only continued, stretching against the tight fabric of her shirt.

898
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,040
Her belly felt inflated, churning with growing amounts of gas.

899
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:11,040
Ireena was also becoming aware of the slight but incessant pressing against her bottom from within.

900
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,040
She realized she needed to fart.

901
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:21,040
Ireena was definitely uptight about that sort of thing, and she tried her best to hold the gas in.

902
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,360
But her stomach kept swelling and straining and her butt seemed to be

903
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:31,480
hugely inflating outwards. That's what happens when you're gassy, your butt inflates.

904
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:35,280
They don't know how humans work. They don't know how the body works.

905
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:39,920
Okay, this is a spell that she read. That's true. I'm sorry. That's true. It is supernatural.

906
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:46,840
Yeah. Uh-oh, he froze. Yeah. He froze there for a second. Oh shit. Yeah, we have to give

907
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:50,680
that the benefit of the doubt that something very magical could be

908
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:55,000
happening. We shouldn't be applying like real world logic to it. Right. The

909
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,600
turbulent gas churned within her. She now looked nine months pregnant, fertile with

910
00:45:58,600 --> 00:46:03,600
feel flatulence. And Irina was still getting bigger and rounder. Her belly was

911
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:07,360
extraordinary taut, as if it were about to burst. Irina couldn't hold it in any

912
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,960
longer. The pressure was too much. An intense direct blast of gas seemed to

913
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,960
cause her butt to double in size before exploding out of her with such force

914
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,880
that her ass vibrated briefly.

915
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,880
Irina blushed, but sighed in relief.

916
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,440
Another fart slipped out, brief but considerably louder than the first.

917
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,240
Then two smaller explosions, one after the other.

918
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,320
In spite of her letting loose, however, her belly had swollen beyond anything humanly

919
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,320
possible.

920
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:35,840
It was inflated to the size of a large beach ball.

921
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:39,520
What was even stranger was that even though the farts were quite potent in smell, she could

922
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,880
breathe them in as easily as air.

923
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,000
Irina lost her balance and fell to the ground.

924
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,580
Her enormous belly forced her legs apart.

925
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,120
Irina groaned in visible discomfort.

926
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,120
"Too.

927
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,120
Much.

928
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
Gas."

929
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:58,280
A loud, long, wet, and extremely strong-smelling fart erupted out of her behind, causing the

930
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,360
floorboards to vibrate noisily.

931
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,040
Irina smiled in embarrassment.

932
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,960
Yet again, to her surprise, she could breathe in the dense air freely without discomfort.

933
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:11,120
"Dude, I hate when I'm trying to sleep and my upstairs neighbor won't stop farting against

934
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,080
the floorboards and vibrating them."

935
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:20,320
When she keeps casting the fart spell on herself and shaking the whole apartment, it sucks.

936
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:24,160
So she cut loose and started blasting away.

937
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:29,200
The room was soon flooded with Irina's flatulence and filled with the rumbling reverberations

938
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,080
of bombs going off.

939
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:36,240
Irina farted so many times in the next couple of minutes, she lost count immediately.

940
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,760
Once she was finished, the air was ripe with her innermost secret and private scent.

941
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,800
For the longest time, Irina sat in silence.

942
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,160
She had fun cutting loose.

943
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:48,440
But finally, she got an idea.

944
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,880
Why not try this out on her friends, just for fun?

945
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,880
Yeah, of course.

946
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,240
That would be my next thought too.

947
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:57,320
So she invited two of her best friends, Christine and Angela, over.

948
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,960
When they arrived, she made conversation with them for a while.

949
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:03,920
And then Irina cast a spell on both her friends.

950
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,400
At first, neither Christine nor Angela noticed the sudden change in pressure.

951
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,460
suppressed her desire to giggle mischievously at the sight of her

952
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,260
friend's belly slowly bloating outwards with gas. Angela's stomach rumbled

953
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:20,560
noisily and Angela blushed. "Oh, seems I'm a little filled right now."

954
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:24,620
Christine started to laugh but an even louder gurgle from her own belly cut it

955
00:48:24,620 --> 00:48:28,920
short. Angela's face was visibly red. "I guess that meal I had disagreed with me

956
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:32,300
more than I thought." Angela's stomach rapidly swelled up to the size of a

957
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:36,980
volleyball. "You know if you guys can get your hands on that book you got a

958
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,420
got a good live show you could do.

959
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:40,780
- That's true, yeah. - It's true.

960
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:42,220
- The blonde haired woman was struggling

961
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,140
to contain the growing gas within her,

962
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:45,980
but her fart needed freedom.

963
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:48,620
With a soft but very long and powerful hiss,

964
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:51,340
Angela's divine wind broke free of its confinement

965
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:53,780
and blessed the air with its presence.

966
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:55,060
Christine looked surprised.

967
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,820
Wow, Angela, you really needed to go, didn't you?

968
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,260
Angela chuckled nervously.

969
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,580
I guess I did.

970
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,220
Christine relaxed and her own aroma

971
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:03,900
violently erupted from her body

972
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,940
to join with the dense gas of Angela's already in the air.

973
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,700
The two scents mixed and complemented one another, one fragrance balancing out the other to form

974
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:14,060
one perfect feminine perfume.

975
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:20,300
It's like that scene in Ratatouille when he eats strawberries and cheese and he gets a

976
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:24,780
different colors and tastes like combining.

977
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:28,860
Christine was mortified, but at the same time was relieved.

978
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,220
She looked at Angela.

979
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,860
I needed that.

980
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:35,580
With a loud rumble, both women's bellies swelled outward yet again.

981
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:40,120
"This is impossible!" exclaimed Angela as her stomach grew to the size of a large beach

982
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:44,260
volleyball, causing her to fall to the ground.

983
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:46,020
Christine followed shortly.

984
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:49,880
Now the gas was really being passed.

985
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:56,100
And both women noisily expelled enormous amounts of feminine flatulence into the air.

986
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,260
Their bellies only grew and grew.

987
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:04,460
Their shirts rode up on them, exposing the taut skin of their tanned, hugely swollen

988
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:09,980
stomachs. Angela and Christine needed relief from the incessant pressure and the farts

989
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:15,860
flowed freely and loudly in spite of whatever embarrassment they felt. Their faces contorted

990
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:21,860
and grimaced as they struggled to expel out all of that flatulence.

991
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:25,860
All the while, Irina looked on with barely contained amusement. The two women's stomachs

992
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,340
briefly swelled up to twice the size of a big beach ball and they gasped loudly as the

993
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:34,180
sheer amount of gas buildup became apparent. And with two twin cries of exertion, Angela

994
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:39,000
Christine released the ripest deepest longest loudest and most powerful chain

995
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:45,700
farts the extremely strong smell immediately gave away the fact that the

996
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:53,560
gas had come from the most inner part of the women's systems the blasts were so

997
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,740
powerful that they ripped twin holes clean through both layers of the girls

998
00:50:56,740 --> 00:51:00,580
clothing and they both blush fiercely as the extent of the gases power became

999
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:03,060
apparent. This is, yeah, this is...

1000
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,500
It's taken a turn.

1001
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,620
Irina couldn't stop laughing for quite a while. Angela looked annoyed.

1002
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:13,180
"What's so funny?" Irina tried to stop laughing. "I'm sorry, it's just... I'm the

1003
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:18,540
cause of you two letting those farts rip." "It was so funny watching you try not to

1004
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:24,220
fart." Angela looked incredulous. "What do you mean, caused us to fart?" So Irina

1005
00:51:24,220 --> 00:51:28,620
explained to them what she had done. Then Christine had an idea. "Hey, why don't we

1006
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,460
We all try these spells out on each other.

1007
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:31,460
It'll be fun.

1008
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:34,220
After all, Arena, turnabout is fair play."

1009
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:35,460
Arena smiled slightly.

1010
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,220
"Okay, that sounds interesting.

1011
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,220
Let's try it.

1012
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:39,220
See what happens."

1013
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:40,860
So Arena got the spell book out.

1014
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:46,220
The first incantation caused extreme bloating in Angela, but no supernatural swelling.

1015
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:52,120
Christine and Arena had to coax the gas out of her by manipulating Angela's swollen belly

1016
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:53,660
with their hands.

1017
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,380
Gradually they managed to get it all out of her.

1018
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,940
Christine and Irina also had that spell cast on them one after the other.

1019
00:52:00,940 --> 00:52:02,400
This is so fucked up dude.

1020
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,400
This is so unsafe.

1021
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,140
They didn't draw a summoning circle or anything.

1022
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:09,180
Who knows what kind of enmities they could lose in their house.

1023
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:15,060
Well no enmity is going to be able to survive the smells in this house.

1024
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:20,220
The next incantation caused their farts to actually be visible as brilliant colored clouds

1025
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:23,060
of turbulent gas.

1026
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:29,060
Afterwards, they got into swimming gear and went into the pool

1027
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,560
and tried out the very first spell Christine had discovered.

1028
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:36,560
They had spent their time floating on the water's surface, expelling huge bubbles

1029
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:41,060
and using their fart to create bubble baths.

1030
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:46,560
The latter experiment was particularly effective when all three of them were close together,

1031
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:50,560
creating one enormous mass of gigantic gas bubbles.

1032
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,700
The real fun was when they tried out the next spell, and the last one they would try out

1033
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,700
for the day.

1034
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:58,120
They tested it out when they were inside and dried off.

1035
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:00,280
I can't wait to find out what the last spell is.

1036
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,280
Me too.

1037
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,960
Almost as soon as the spell was cast, their stomachs began to swell out.

1038
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,080
At first it seemed like nothing new, but the swelling didn't stop.

1039
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,800
In fact, the rest of their body started to inflate with gas as well, and their flatulence

1040
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,840
became uncontrollable, both in terms of frequency and power.

1041
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:19,560
All three of them grew rounder, larger, and more inflated by the minute.

1042
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:21,000
They wondered when it would stop.

1043
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,120
When it did, they looked like gigantic, round, human balloons.

1044
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,240
Then they began to feel very light, and soon they were floating upwards until they hit

1045
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:28,240
the ceiling.

1046
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:30,000
For about a minute, they didn't know what to do.

1047
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,580
"Alright, take us home."

1048
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:36,200
But as it turned out, their farts had become so powerful that they could literally propel

1049
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,000
themselves around the room.

1050
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:42,920
That quickly turned into an opportunity for various games like Bumper Girls and Aerial

1051
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,080
Tag and they played those games for hours.

1052
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:49,400
By the time they were done, the room was so filled with gas they couldn't be able to,

1053
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,280
they wouldn't be able to smell anything else for a couple hours.

1054
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:53,280
But they didn't mind.

1055
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,280
They were having fun.

1056
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,080
And when it was over, they resolved to use the spell book whenever they wanted to play

1057
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,280
these kind of games again.

1058
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:05,120
I mean, this is, this story I think is a great, a perfect example of the, the female mind

1059
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,480
is incapable of hustle, you know, because if I had found a spell book like this, I would

1060
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:12,960
be using it to rob banks, I would be street performing, I would be making so much money,

1061
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,840
but they, all they want to do is play bumper girls all day.

1062
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:17,400
They don't want to monetize it at all.

1063
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:21,720
Like you could, people could pay to play Bumper Girls and Aerial Tag in your house.

1064
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:22,720
Exactly.

1065
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,400
They're just like, "Oh, let's go swim in the pool."

1066
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,400
No, dude.

1067
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,400
I would be online.

1068
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:31,280
I would be selling this, I would be selling the gas as fuel, okay, to the government.

1069
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,600
I would be, I would be becoming a military contractor using this spell book.

1070
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,200
I would talk to NASA.

1071
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:43,400
I found a completely energy-free use, free way to go to space.

1072
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:44,400
All right?

1073
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:49,520
Yeah, we could just use all this methane and just fucking, you know, I mean, it probably

1074
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:54,040
get up there, do a number on the ozone layer, but we'll figure something out.

1075
00:54:54,040 --> 00:55:00,560
This was made in 2006 and Jamal in 2012 wrote, please make a sequel.

1076
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,920
This is my request.

1077
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:06,200
And then 11 days later, oh, wow, it looks like I'm six years late, huh?

1078
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,080
Well, the sequel would still be nice.

1079
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:14,040
There's also a comment here from Major Tom 2000 that says, oh, Major Tom.

1080
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,040
No, hold on, not me.

1081
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,040
Hold up.

1082
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,640
But wait, if they couldn't smell anything for two hours, that doesn't make sense, because

1083
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,480
earlier you said they could breathe it like air.

1084
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,760
It's a different spell, Major Tom.

1085
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,200
It was very clearly a different spell.

1086
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,200
True.

1087
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:42,160
There's a comment here from Nick09y3, and they say, "I can only describe Hat in two

1088
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:47,720
words, sheer brilliance.

1089
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:53,120
Here's a comment from great five and this is an asterisk, jumps up and down,

1090
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:54,120
awesome.

1091
00:55:54,120 --> 00:55:55,160
Can you draw it as a picture?

1092
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,020
This is a reply to asking for a request.

1093
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,860
Can you draw it as a picture?

1094
00:55:58,860 --> 00:56:02,880
Definitely should be a pretty anime girl who gets squeezed and goes,

1095
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,400
it's up to you who squeezes her.

1096
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,840
Non-fat please, that's about it.

1097
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:08,880
No wait, one more thing, if you write a story about a beautiful non-fat

1098
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,480
anime girl who gets a hissing fart squeezed out of her, then have the

1099
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,320
squeezer repeatedly squeeze her midsection sort of pumping it causing the

1100
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:18,440
gas to come out in spurts that'd be super smexy please write the story if you want

1101
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,400
but definitely draw the picture if you draw both I'll do a commissioned art

1102
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,600
piece for you if anything you want

1103
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,600
they're bargaining in the replies

1104
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:31,160
playful Absol says could you do something like this except with a dragon instead

1105
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,120
and the author said if I had the time perhaps but I can't make any promises

1106
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:41,280
Hey listen I'm very busy. Hey I got so many fucking fart stories I gotta write.

1107
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:48,440
Add it to the fucking list dude. Throw it on the pile. Yeah all right this this next

1108
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:55,200
one will I think can be our last one. Okay. This one's nice. This one's sweet. Which one is this?

1109
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:02,920
A girlfriend's fart goes straight to the heart. Oh okay. By the spazzer. It's very nice.

1110
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:09,360
there's this is another dialogue one Pat do you want to play my girlfriend I guess

1111
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:19,560
real life okay oh and you're sure you want to do this yes I always have haha

1112
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:24,840
well all right but if you want to back out I don't think I possibly can I

1113
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:28,920
giggle as I hold my girlfriend close to me her thighs leaning over and

1114
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:32,680
overlapping my leg.

1115
00:57:32,680 --> 00:57:35,300
Just know it's my first time doing something like it too.

1116
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:37,440
She slides over completely and fully sits in my lap.

1117
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,680
Oh, I thought that was your line.

1118
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:39,880
I can't tell if it is.

1119
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:41,440
It doesn't have any names here.

1120
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,440
I know.

1121
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,640
That's the worst part about these is, you know, you never can tell.

1122
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,640
You're right.

1123
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:46,640
That's the worst part about these.

1124
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,640
It's shoddy, right?

1125
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:48,640
Yeah.

1126
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,640
You're right, Patrick.

1127
00:57:49,640 --> 00:57:55,320
Yeah, I just wish that I could, like, there was more detail about what was going on.

1128
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,320
That's my main concern.

1129
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,320
It's so hard to follow the fucking story.

1130
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:03,720
This is a comment from Patrick 2000. Hey, did you make sure to write who's saying

1131
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:09,320
what yeah yeah doing like script coverage on these like like you have you have

1132
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:14,320
tons of third act problems in this yeah absolutely yeah I mean try to we need to

1133
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:20,160
know why we care about the characters way faster you know we yeah she slides

1134
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:24,240
over completely and fully sits in my lap I can feel her back pockets touch my

1135
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,160
crotch and I do a silent sigh of arousal and nuzzle her with my head on the back

1136
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:34,400
of hers. I know, just make sure you get comfy though. Is that... I don't know.

1137
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,840
We'll just split the call. Who is who? Doesn't matter anymore. I think both of you are

1138
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:46,920
everything. Yeah. Nuzzling, I also, nuzzle her with my head on the back of hers

1139
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,480
doesn't seem like a very good, like just sticking your face into the back of her

1140
00:58:50,480 --> 00:59:02,720
head. I can feel her body seem to calm into me and her butt got more into my

1141
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,520
crotch. Well yeah, if I wasn't comfy I don't think I would be doing this hun. I

1142
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:12,680
go lower with my head and now my face is fully in her hair smelling the shampoo

1143
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:16,480
and conditioner she uses in the morning. It'll probably be the last good thing I

1144
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:30,920
smell. I like that this one is like it's like a classic like burr purr purr purr

1145
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,200
kind of situation that ends with tort. Yeah but then there's a BRB right in the

1146
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:42,720
middle. That was when that the girlfriend took a break from farting. So the Zordash guy

1147
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:46,320
I arrived, I had to go pick up the order.

1148
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:51,240
I admittedly jolt a little as she lets out a long and bubbly fart point black against

1149
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,240
my crotch.

1150
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:53,240
Point black.

1151
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:57,720
Clothed, but it feels like the blast goes right through the cloth and into my skin.

1152
00:59:57,720 --> 01:00:01,980
I can feel her body relax and get less tense after the fart ends, and she can't help but

1153
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:03,800
sigh after.

1154
01:00:03,800 --> 01:00:07,400
God, that felt so much better than it should have.

1155
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:08,400
How about you?

1156
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,000
Oh, you have no...

1157
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:18,400
a process first the blast then the heat then the smell it rises from my lap and

1158
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:22,280
up to my nose smelling like the definition of meaty with a smack of

1159
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:28,360
vegetables packed in I can't believe that my girlfriend someone I find so

1160
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:32,200
attractive someone I love and have a connection to doesn't mind and even

1161
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,880
thinks it's cute that I'm into her gas this is the first time she's farted in

1162
01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,380
front of me and the first time a girl has farted on me.

1163
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:42,160
Hun, I must have been in a trance.

1164
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,420
I blink a little and put my arms around her.

1165
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:49,780
You have no idea how great it really is.

1166
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,900
So yeah, the confusing dialogue here, you know, there's no, it doesn't say who's saying

1167
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:54,900
what.

1168
01:00:54,900 --> 01:00:55,900
Well.

1169
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:57,860
Maybe, maybe this is a fight club situation.

1170
01:00:57,860 --> 01:00:59,540
Oh my God.

1171
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:03,060
Well, but I hate to do this, but you know, Pat didn't really sell me with that last line.

1172
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:06,480
Yeah, I just I can tell his heart wasn't into it.

1173
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:07,480
So I gotta say I can read this again.

1174
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,520
I need you to re-read that.

1175
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:13,640
You have no idea how great it really is.

1176
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:15,320
That's oh man, now I'm in it.

1177
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,640
Now I'm into this story.

1178
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:17,640
Yeah.

1179
01:01:17,640 --> 01:01:21,120
Her body warms up even more from emotion and she leans back going lower on my chest and

1180
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,400
looks up at me.

1181
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,000
I think this is a you line Patrick and I want to really hear your I want to hear just your

1182
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,520
love.

1183
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,520
It's just a fart you goof.

1184
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:30,520
There will be more.

1185
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:37,400
I go down and smooch her forehead, even chucking to myself.

1186
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:38,400
Let's hope so.

1187
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:42,760
I just like, I guess she leaned back.

1188
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:49,560
I'm just trying to, I'm confused by like the bodily proportions.

1189
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,680
There's so much going on in this story.

1190
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,720
I mean, I think this is our first one star out of five.

1191
01:01:55,720 --> 01:01:56,720
Yeah.

1192
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:59,400
Well, okay, but here's something here at the bottom.

1193
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:02,920
"Hey, another scene story this time. I had to write it down and make a story of it,

1194
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06,440
even if it is short. I really hope you enjoy. I love scenes like this.

1195
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:09,400
I also tried to make it gender neutral so either gender can enjoy."

1196
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,500
Oh.

1197
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:15,560
I think maybe that's why they didn't say who's saying what,

1198
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,320
but that doesn't really make any sense.

1199
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:21,240
It doesn't because they still use like gendered pronouns, right?

1200
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:21,960
Yeah.

1201
01:02:21,960 --> 01:02:24,520
Yeah. Yeah, they do.

1202
01:02:24,520 --> 01:02:26,600
I guess maybe you don't, maybe, yeah.

1203
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:30,680
Maybe it's so if you can read it, if you have the kind of fart fetish where you

1204
01:02:30,680 --> 01:02:33,640
like to fart on people or if you like to be farted on.

1205
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:37,000
Yeah. Either one. Maybe that's what they mean. But yeah, you know, I'm gonna have

1206
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,960
to hit this with a two stars out of five because, you know, I really like the

1207
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:45,560
emotion on display. It's just kind of difficult to read. I

1208
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:49,480
appreciate it. It is short and it is sweet and it is a loving, it kind of

1209
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:55,480
displays a loving relationship, but it is very hard to reenact this with

1210
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:59,800
my partner because we both keep getting confused at what line

1211
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:02,680
we're supposed to read. So if you could work on that for me,

1212
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:03,200
thank you.

1213
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,440
A comment from boyo3. If this is a true story, then goddamn man,

1214
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:13,660
you got a wife on your hands. A reply from fart slave. I had a

1215
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:17,000
similar situation. It lasted one year and two months. I think

1216
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,560
that she doesn't even know what she wants.

1217
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,680
Oh, this one's fucked up. This guy wrote, I wish I could have a

1218
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:25,040
girlfriend like that. Then again, I'm a teen still in high

1219
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:30,160
school maybe one day I'll find the one and one heart stinky girls replies yeah

1220
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:36,240
same man we can only hope oh man are you a teen or are you just saying you hope

1221
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:44,840
you can find a girl that won't fart on you. Alright well yeah I would say I'm sorry for this episode but I'm not.

1222
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:50,920
That was really good. Yeah you have to listen to this. You know yeah. Turn the volume all the way up.

1223
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,680
You put this on a beats pill you put on the subway.

1224
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:55,680
Mm-hmm.

1225
01:03:55,680 --> 01:03:56,680
Yeah.

1226
01:03:56,680 --> 01:03:57,680
You will not get in trouble for listening to it.

1227
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:01,960
You are allowed to play it over the loudspeaker at like a Target or a Walmart.

1228
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,840
You can take the phone.

1229
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,080
I think if it's like you hit the star button, you can broadcast it.

1230
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,400
You know what else you should listen to over the loudspeaker at the store is Chapo FYM

1231
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,400
streams.

1232
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:14,400
That's right.

1233
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:15,400
Yeah.

1234
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:16,400
You want to plug that, Tom?

1235
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,080
You have anything else too or just...

1236
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:26,080
twitch.tv/chappotraphouse or patreon.com/chappoFYM where we watch videos that are very similar to this.

1237
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,080
Both these boys have been on our lovely stream.

1238
01:04:29,080 --> 01:04:30,080
We love it.

1239
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,080
Yep.

1240
01:04:31,080 --> 01:04:32,080
Yeah.

1241
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:35,080
And we, we, anytime you got a fart video, call us in.

1242
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,080
No particular reason.

1243
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,080
Yes, absolutely.

1244
01:04:37,080 --> 01:04:38,080
Yeah.

1245
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:43,080
I've got, we watch, I watch just fat guys eating a disgusting amount of food all day,

1246
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,080
so they fart a lot.

1247
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:46,080
So don't worry, I will be calling you.

1248
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,080
All right.

1249
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:49,680
All right, well, thank you so much for coming on.

1250
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,180
Yeah, thanks for having me on.

1251
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:52,180
Bye!

1252
01:04:52,180 --> 01:04:53,180
Bye.
