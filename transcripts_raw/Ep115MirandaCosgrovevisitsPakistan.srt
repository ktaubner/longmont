00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,760
I'm smarter. We're thinking of doing an episode where we read a list and just

4
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,240
kind of laugh at it and make fun of it. Yeah, we're kind of just gonna make fun of the list today.

5
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,920
We think we're done giving the list the spotlight. It's less of like a celebration of lists and

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,560
more of like a savage roast.

7
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,400
- A take down.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,640
- A savage roast like Conan the Barbarian

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,300
would do to a list.

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,140
- Yeah.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:34,960

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,940
we're gonna do sort of a New York Mag style

13
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,780
like Donald Trump take down on this list.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:42,580
- Yeah, kind of like a brutal barbaric kind of berserker

15
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,400
wearing wolf skin kind of roast on the list, you know?

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,840
- Yeah, we're kind of just gonna do

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,520
the most insane crap we can.

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,360
- Yeah.

19
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,200
- We've been thinking,

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,220
I think we're due for an insane episode.

21
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,120
- Yeah, I think we're gonna do an insane one today.

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,960
- You know?

23
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,780

This is Texas and I'm about to stand my ground.

So you're one of them irony bros I hear so much about.

50
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,400
You'd best keep moving.

51
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:38,000
Yeah, this ain't no town for you.

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:46,520
I am trapped in my apartment because Janna wanted to paint our tile floor and our tile

53
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,760
floor is the entirety of the hallway that leads to the front door.

54
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,720
You have to go out through the fire escape.

55
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,920
I don't have a fire escape.

56
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,240
You have to climb out the window.

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,880
I have no way to get out.

58
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,720
The paint takes 30 hours to dry.

59
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,040
You should have done that.

60
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:11,160
I can't even go in my kitchen and to get to my bathroom I have to jump over like a hallway

61
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,120
full of paint, like a moat.

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,320
You should just put footprints on it and make it your home.

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,320
Make it like a...

64
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,320
That could be a cool kind of look.

65
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,680
Yeah, it would look cool.

66
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,680
Yeah.

67
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Put handprints and stuff.

68
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Yeah, write your name.

69
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,840
And maybe put some on the ceiling so people get kind of scared when they come in.

70
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,100
We could go...

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,600
Me and Cameron could come to New York and we could put our...

72
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,080
You could put more paint on the floor and we could put our hands in like the Chinese

73
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,080
theater.

74
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,080

120
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:14,460
I think Watson is a Sherlock Holmes type. No, Watson is not anything like Sherlock Holmes,

121
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,180
you idiot. No, he is. You idiot, he knows. They're completely different. What are you

123
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,940
No different stats. They don't they have different sets. They're not the same archetype. They're the same class

124
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:36,500
Dr. Watson is a is a doctor. Okay, would you go to the doctor and say I need a crime solved?

125
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,420
Would you go to a detective and say I need surgery you would die

126
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:45,740
Both of those cases because neither of them would know how to do the job right either the same class with different stats

127
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,420
They're different. He just raised his doctor stat. That's not they're both detectives. That's not they're not detectives

128
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:54,420
No, a doctor is a kind of detective.

129
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,420
No.

130
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Yeah, because he detects what's wrong with you.

131
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
Yeah, he puts that finger in your thing.

132
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,420
In your thing.

00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,420
He puts his finger in your thing.

134
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,420

00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:26,060
cheese balls as I was walking around. So when you took it, it was at their house?

169
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:32,660
No it was on the ground in Kendall Square. Why was it? While there was a family

170
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:37,900
sitting on the grass and I ran by and scooped him up and ran away. When I was

171
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,100
when I was stuck in the Dallas Airport a couple weeks ago I I found some trail mix

172
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:52,620
on the ground I just ate that nice there was a trail of trail mix leading into

173
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,060
the bathroom and you follow it's called trail mix yeah it might have been it

174
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,780
yeah it might have been an anthill but I think about it yeah because the Texas

175
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,660
the Texas Airport they they have it Alamo themed so there's a lot of sand

176
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,900
outside yeah this tumbleweed uh-huh that rolls by instead of the like normal

185
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,180

Cam's got to retire.

00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,340
I know that you did not watch it three times.

203
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,820
Because when you were watching it last night, you said, "This is the second time that I've

204
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
watched this."

205
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:13,820
Cameron, you're fired.

206
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Yep, you're fired.

207
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,740
You're fucking fired.

And the podcast is over.

210
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,300
No.

211
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,740
Yeah, I can turn off the audio recorder right now.

212
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,100
No, me and Pat are doing a new podcast.

213
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,100
Yeah.

214
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,100
It's called Talking Cameron.

215
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,100
It's called The Prince and the Peanut.

216
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:41,100
I'm Peanut. He's Peanut. I'm the Prince of Comedy. And he's the Peanut. I'm the Peanut M&M.

217
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,100
Yeah, and then you could, I mean I guess you could guest on it sometimes. Yeah, you could be the guest.

218
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:56,100
I don't know, we'll have to talk to Prince and the Peanut and the guest. I don't really want to guest with someone who is like an insane liar that led to me getting kicked off my own podcast that I invented.

219
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,100
who literally lied about the number of times that he watched Freddy got fingered in the past few days.

220
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:02,100
We actually don't know who lied here.

221
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:07,100
I can pull up the messages right now where Patrick said he watched it twice.

222
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,100
He said it in a group chat.

223
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
I did watch it twice.

224
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,100
Patrick just admitted his lie.

225
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,100
If we can run it back.

226
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
He came so hard.

227
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
I wasn't going to pull those receipts up.

228
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,100

This is incredible.

236
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
That's what they do.

237
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
Actually, the question is a lie.

238
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Yeah, I don't know if I watched it three times.

239
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
It's all been a blur.

240
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
Yeah, you watched the whole blur.

241
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,740
This whole week has been a blur for me.

242
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,740
I don't know what's going on.

243
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,740
I've watched eight movies in the past two days.

244
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,740

248
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,740
I don't believe you, but go on.

00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:03,740
I don't believe you, but go on.

I don't believe you, but go on.

252
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,740
I don't believe you, but go on.

253
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,660
- This whole week has been a blur for me.

254
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,500
I don't know what's going on.

255
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,260
- I've watched eight movies in the past two days.

256
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,580
I'm going insane, dude.

257
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,420
- I don't believe you, but go on.

258
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,340
- You're lying.

259
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,180
Yeah, prove it.

260
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,260
You can check my letterbox.

261
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,580
- That doesn't, that you,

262
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,780
obviously you faked your letterbox to set yourself up

263
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,460
so that you could lie about this.

264
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,980
I could go on letterbox today

265
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,940
and say that I watched Inception 100 times

266
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,020
and leave 100 different ratings and reviews for it.

267
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,140
- You couldn't do that.

268
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:36,020
- I've never used letterbox.

269
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:45,020
Exactly, you couldn't do that. I watched the night comes to us, Dr. Sleep, King Kong Escapes, Alien 3, Alita Battle Angel, Alien Resurrection, War of the Worlds, and The Hitcher.

270
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:48,020
You watched the Battle Angel, you jacked off.

271
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:57,020
No, you know what I did? So I watched Freddy Got Finger twice, and then the third movie I watched was Wet Hot American Summer. So I did not watch Freddy Got Finger three times. I will.

272
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,020
Yes!

273
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,020
See, they are different movies.

274
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
You lied.

275
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:04,020
I just don't know what's going on with me right now.

276
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:09,220
Oh my god, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, he admits it.

277
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,720
Oh yeah, finally we can move on. I'm sure that was so interesting for everyone to listen to.

278
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,220
Well, I mean, you know, sorry for starting that.

279
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,020
No, that's what, this is what, your friendship is gonna be stronger now.

280
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,520
Yeah.

281
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,420
Because Pat admitted that he lied. Pat, you're worse than dirt. You're a fucking jerk.

282
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,520
I'm not worse than dirt.

283
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,520
You're a piece of mud, you fucking two-faced bitch.

284
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I'm not two-faced.

285
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:33,360
- I'll admit that I lied too, 'cause it's--

286
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
- Cameron, you were virtuous.

287
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,620
- If it's, if I'm saying the past two days,

288
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,480
if that includes today, that's wrong,

289
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,960
'cause I haven't watched any movies today.

290
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,480
So I would actually be the past three days.

291
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,960
So we both kinda lied.

292
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,920
- Yeah. - Okay.

293
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,120
Yeah, yesterday I went to space.

294
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,840
Okay, so we're gonna move on.

295
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,680
- I believe you.

296
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,520
- I believe you too. - Thank you.

297
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,360
Yeah, you have no reason not to believe me.

298
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,560
We all trust each other now.

299
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,720
We're okay, we're never lying to each other again.

300
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,560
- Okay. (laughs)

00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,600
Is prostitution legal in the county that Vegas is in?

332
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
No it's Reno.

333
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Reno, okay yeah.

334
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:59,400
I think it's funny that just like one county, just like something that's illegal everywhere

335
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,840
else in the country, they're just like, yeah just right here where it's gonna be.

336
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:07,440
Yeah, you gotta have one place.

337
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,240
- They should have the, yeah, Murder County.

338
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,720
They should have that somewhere.

339
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,560
- They do. - Yeah.

340
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,640
- They do. - Yeah, they do.

341
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,480
Yeah.

342
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,320
It's called New York City. - It's called

343
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,280
Lansing, Mississippi. - It's a war zone out here.

344
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,600
- Miss Chicken. - Between the Bloods

345
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,640
and the Cricks, the Crickets.

346
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,120
- Yeah, the Crickets and the T-Birds.

347
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,400
The Crickets and the T-Birds are constantly fighting

348
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,240
in New York, they're like, they're doing--

349
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,720
- New York City is like the end of Lord of the Rings.

350
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,560
- Yeah. - It's just like a giant battle.

351
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,920
- It's like the end of the Lord of the Wings and--

352
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,760
(laughing)

353
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,600
- The Lord of the Wings. - The Lord of the Wings.

354
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
The end of the Wad of the Wings.

355
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
It's the end of Wad of the Wings and West Side Story.

356
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,240
Yeah.

357
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,360
Dude, it's so scary to go to New York City because you're always, they're always, it's

358
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,040
always Team Aqua and Team Magma fighting each other with Pokemon battles.

359
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,440
It's so annoying, dude.

360
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,440
Oh my god.

361
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,280
I hate it when they, I hate it when Rayquaza comes to New York and he's wearing Timbs.

362
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Yeah.

363
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:58,280
Now that would be something, a funny joke they could put in the new show.

364
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,680
The newest Pokemon show.

365
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:02,200
Yeah, they could have Rayquaza wearing Timbs.

366
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Yeah.

367
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,200
Quanza.

368
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,600
That's, wow, that's kind of a triple entendre.

369
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Uh huh.

370
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,600
Cause like Rayquan.

371
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Rayquaza.

372
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Quanza.

373
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
I didn't even think of Quanza.

374
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Yeah dude, Rayquanza.

375
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Rayquanza.

376
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Raymond Quanza?

377
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
The inventor of Quanza.

378
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
I'm Raymond Quanza, nice to meet you.

379
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Raymond Quanza.

380
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,600
Oh, Deborah, I gotta invent a holiday!

381
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Raymond, you're never gonna win this.

382
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

383
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

384
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

385
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

386
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

387
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

388
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

389
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

390
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

391
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I'm Raymond Quanza.

392
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,400
Raymond, you're never gonna reinvent the new Christmas.

393
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,600
Raymond, you really need to make a new holiday, Raymond.

394
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,600
I'm your big brother.

395
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
You're fucking dying.

396
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm Raymond, my little big brother.

397
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Hey, Raymond, I need new clothes. I'm in so much pain, Raymond.

398
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Is it okay if I make a turkey-do-e-moat at your house?

399
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,600
He's just hooked up to the machine that Palpatine was hooked up to

400
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
in fucking Rise of Skywalker.

401
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,400
this is a great here in this palpatine

402
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,920

403
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:11,880
misterious green liquid being pumped into him

404
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,540

414
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,400

00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,460
from a genie if you had the alliance lamp

418
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,440
isn't there a speaking of raymond is a perfect transition transition into the

419
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
list

420
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:55,800
uh... was there a simpsons episode with ray

421
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
Ray Magini.

422
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:00,400
This is Ray Romano's guest appearance on The Simpsons.

423
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Hold up.

424
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
I don't remember.

425
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,240
I think I've only seen to maybe season 11.

426
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,440
Hold on.

427
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,680
Let me.

428
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,760
I'm up to season I think 6.

429
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,240
It's starting to get good.

430
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,920
It's already got good.

431
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:16,920
It's gonna get even better.

432
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,400
Once you get to season 32, it gets better.

433
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,400
Oh my god.

434
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,400
It peaks at season 28.

435
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,800
Yeah, something I don't, I love season 5, but something I don't like about it is how few

436
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,320
Trump jokes they put in. Yeah. I feel like you can't really be

437
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,200
complacent when you're making a TV show you have to kind of speak truth to power

438
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,760
against Donald Trump so. That's right. Yeah, Ray Magini, that was the character's

439
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:43,520
name. That's like the first Simpsons episode I saw. Ray Magini, what season is

440
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:50,480
it? That is... I was like seven so. You were seven? Yeah. Means it was season like 20.

441
00:22:50,480 --> 00:23:05,480
the

442
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,480
Yeah, now that I think about it, 16.

443
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Yeah, one of them, yeah.

444
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,480
Yeah.

445
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,480
The discretest list is by Kaideretsunu.

446
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
Kaite-

447
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
Kaiteretsu.

448
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
Kiretesu.

449
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
Kitturu.

450
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Kisturu.

451
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
Sas.

452
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
Kishdeban.

453
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
Kite.

454
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
Kis-

455
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Kite-

456
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,480
Kite-

457
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Kite-

458
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
Kite-

459
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Kite-

460
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Kite-

461
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Kite-

462
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Kite-

463
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Kite-

464
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,480
Kite-

465
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
Kite-

466
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
- Kitarasnu.

467
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,200
- Kitar, Kitar.

468
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,440
- Vishnu Kaiba.

469
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,640
- You got it.

470
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,880
- Yeah, and the description is,

471
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,400
"The trademark I wish,

472
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,200
"if somehow were guaranteed reality."

473
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,320
That's word salad.

474
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:54,240
That doesn't make any sense.

475
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
Number one is, of course, unlimited wishes.

476
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,080
- Uh-huh.

477
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,800
- That's a layup.

478
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,040
- There's a list in this list.

479
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,920
- Yeah, this is a really long list.

480
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,880
There's a comment that just has like 20 things.

481
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,960
- Well, should we read this list in the list?

482
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,800
- I say we just read it.

483
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,960
- I feel like there's gonna be some duplicates.

484
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,800
- Let's go through it real fast.

485
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,640
- I feel like there's gonna be duplicates.

486
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,280
- We won't talk, we'll just go through it real fast.

487
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,120
We won't even talk.

488
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,680
We'll say one thing about each one, all right?

489
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:18,520
Ready?

490
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,360
Unlimited money.

491
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,600
That's good, you can buy lots of stuff.

492
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,880
The ability to order anything off any website for free.

493
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,440
Kinda redundant if you already have unlimited money.

494
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,660
Telekinesis powers.

495
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,500
That's cool.

496
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,400
- Can control.

497
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,880
- The ability to teleport anywhere.

498
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:31,720
- Where'd it go?

499
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,560
- I love Looper.

500
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,380
- I am going to school.

501
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,580
Wait, jumper, I love jumper.

502
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,420
- Immortality.

503
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,260
(laughing)

504
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,080
Immortality.

505
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:37,920
- That terrifies me.

506
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,760
- You could never die.

507
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,580
- No, so scary.

508
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,140
- Free airline tickets for life.

509
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:43,220
Again, redundant if you already have money.

510
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,460
- Hello, Hawaii.

511
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,800
- Unlimited school supplies.

512
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,940
- What?

513
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,780
I would never do that.

514
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,580
- Why would you choose that?

515
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,580
Unlimited food.

516
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,420
- No, no, no, listen.

517
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,500
You don't have to use them for school.

518
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,900
- You could sell them out of your locker.

519
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,620
- You could sell them out of your locker.

520
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,860
- Why not just wish not to go to school, though?

521
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,840
All right, we're spending too much time on this one.

522
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
We have to keep going.

523
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
Unlimited food. Yummy.

524
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
*burp*

525
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Everything is free for me.

526
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,680
That's the same as the first one.

527
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
The ability to time travel. Yes, please.

528
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
I would go talk to Jesus Christ.

529
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Inability to feel pain.

530
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Yes!

531
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
I would be the greatest skateboarder on earth.

532
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
No, this wouldn't be good for me because I'm a sucker for pain.

533
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,680
The best skateboarder who's the best ever

534
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
because he feels no pain.

535
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
He's just eating Neverland

536
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
and it just gets hurt so badly.

537
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:34,800
Just breaking all of his teeth out.

538
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I could try it again.

539
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,440
I could try the trick again.

540
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Private jet.

541
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
I don't think so.

542
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
No, I know what happens on private jets.

543
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,040
I don't want one of those.

544
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,160
Mansion with hot tub, game room, and water/theme park and backyard.

545
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,480
That's too much for one wish.

546
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,520
That's too much, yeah.

547
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,520
That's four wishes.

548
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,220
You can get the mansion, but you have to buy all the other stuff yourself.

549
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,960
You have to build it yourself.

550
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,080
Personal chauffeur.

551
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,580
I would wish for Caleb to be my personal chauffeur.

552
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,580
I wouldn't do it.

553
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,580
Caleb is our personal chauffeur.

554
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:04,580
I am not.

555
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:09,540
True, I am going to be driving you two to New York next month I guess.

556
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
Unlimited pets.

557
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:16,300
Dogs and cats just raining from the sky.

558
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,220
In a two bedroom apartment with like six pit bulls and a bunch of parakeets and shit.

559
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:24,460
No, no, no, not six pit bulls, unlimited pets.

560
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,460
Unlimited pit bulls.

561
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,800
Yeah, infinite pets.

562
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,860
Pit bull army.

563
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,260
- Inability to get sick, yes please.

564
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,100
Now that would solve a lot of problems.

565
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:35,260
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

566
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,340
Pitbull army.

567
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,280
- Wow. - Yeah, dude.

568
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,140
I hear they're already developing that in China.

569
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:44,440
They're teaching pitbulls to bounce a ball at the same time.

570
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,940
(laughing)

571
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,880
- Would you guys, like an Iditarod style pitball,

572
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,700
pitball. - Pitball.

573
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,060
- My man, pitball. - Iditarod style

574
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,460
pitbull death chariot.

575
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,860
- That would be cool. - Would I ride it?

576
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:03,460
Yeah, dude, all the pitbulls are just eating all the other dogs in the rain.

577
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,300
You mount machine guns on them.

578
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,820
Dude, that is so cool.

579
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:10,980
To enter the Iditarod in a twisted metal style sled.

580
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:18,060
Dude, a fucking pitbull could totally, like, they are so muscly, dude.

581
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,060
Depending on the kind of them.

582
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,380
Yeah, they're like ripped to shit.

583
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:24,620
You could mount a 50 cal machine gun to a pitbull.

584
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,620
Yeah.

585
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,540
(laughing)

586
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,260
- He could, he totally could.

587
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,620
- You're so slow, but you're just killing everybody

588
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,900
ahead of you so it doesn't matter.

589
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,300
- It is funny to imagine pit bulls as just like,

590
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,860
like unthinking killing machines.

591
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:39,700
- Yeah.

592
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,140
- All they desire is death.

593
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:44,380
- Yeah, they crave carnage.

594
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,340
- They crave destruction.

595
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,820
- Yeah.

596
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,500
- Did you guys have to follow the idea to rot in third grade?

597
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,340
- Yes.

598
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,580
- I didn't have to do anything in third grade

599
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,020
because I was cool.

600
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,400
i died every other year and and and third-rate did you follow it for class or

601
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,780
did you follow it on your own class

602
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,380
i feel like you were following yourself

603
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,420
you guys both did a rod

604
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,840
you did a rod no you did i just said that about you dude you did a rod

605
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,420
it's two against one

606
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:13,620
i wish i was the only guy on the podcast that's my wish

607
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:16,540

uh... yeah increased popularity

611
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,780

612
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,560
i would never get in no

613
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,260
would be fun to popular already

614
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:37,260
uh... eliminate my son sensitivity

615
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:42,660
that's specific to one person

616
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,060
unlimited ink in my printer

617
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,420
that'd be cool dude i could print out so many pages

618
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,860
on the ability to correct all mistakes

619
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,740
plus what's going on

620
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,020
i don't know i feel like that's uh...

621
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:00,780
this is what we should soaring

622
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,840
yeah about their some really good comments on this unlimited wishes one

623
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,900
there's another uh... comment here that says

624
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:09,900
i would love this because you could wish for everything on this site and even

625
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,420
more than that for me it would be to have unlimited robux roblox

626
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,580
uh...

627
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,260
Imagine your kid discovers a genie's lamp

628
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,500
in the old basement of your house

629
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,740
and wastes all the wishes,

630
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,580
being like, "I want 100 robux.

631
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,580
"Okay, I want 100 more robux."

632
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:30,180
(laughing)

633
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,020
- I like this comment.

634
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,100
Would be nice, but depends if the genie

635
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,320
has a no unlimited wishes rule.

636
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,420
- That is so true.

637
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,140
- That is what, if I was a genie,

638
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,180
that'd be the first thing.

639
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,020
Like, why have they not-- - The genie's clause.

640
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,060
- Yeah, why does the genie's union not got together

641
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:47,420
be like we can't have they can't keep doing this to us.

642
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,900
- Yeah, what I would always think when I thought about like,

643
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,620
you know how genies like to twist your wishes?

644
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,340
A really cool twist if someone wished for infinite wishes

645
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,420
is you just force them to stay there forever

646
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,820
and keep wishing and they can never leave or stop wishing.

647
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:01,940
You know what I mean?

648
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,220
- I wouldn't be a mean genie.

649
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,020
I mean what else does a genie have to fucking do?

650
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,900
- Well I mean I just mean that would be a good twist

651
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,220
for a genie to do.

652
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,420
- Yeah, why do genies always twist the wishes?

653
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,180
- Why do they have to be mean?

654
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,580
- They're evil pre-Islamic deities, dude.

655
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,980
They, until Islam came in and set 'em all straight.

656
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:21,820
- Yeah, no, I only want a post-Islamic genie.

657
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,660
- Yeah.

658
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,980
- I just want a Muslim genie.

659
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,380
Is that too fuckin' hard to ask?

660
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:27,900
- Have you guys watched Wishmaster?

661
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,740
- No.

662
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,560
- Wishmaster's so good. - I think so.

663
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,780
I seen it a long time ago.

664
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,980
- Oh, yeah. - I love Wishmaster so much.

665
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,460
- No, I'm thinking of Pagemaster with Macaulay Culkin.

666
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,940
(laughing)

667
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:36,780
- Yeah.

668
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,220
- Yeah, different movie.

669
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,100
- That's a cool movie.

670
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,300
He goes into Moby Dick.

671
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,980
- He goes into the pages.

672
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,280
he actually gets this he's in the pages

673
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,880
wish master is awesome because none of

674
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,880
the none of the twists make like any

675
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,020
sense like there's a part where like the

676
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,960
police a police officer like points a

677
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,640
gun at the genie and is like freeze and

678
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,800
the genie is like okay and then freezes

679
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,080
the police officer in a block of ice

680
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:02,920
it's like that would be my twist would

681
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,200
not be clever somebody be like I want a

682
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,320

00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm the G I'm the best genie ever here's another another comment on this one that

690
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,320
says I wash that in my school ma'am should call me for dance practice nice

691
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,320
That is so true. Epic123 says that and being creative with things and

692
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:13,800
then right under that RedPanda789 says that and being very creative.

693
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:19,080
You wish to be creative? Yeah I wish for unlimited wishes and to be creative. I love

694
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,360
being creative. Yeah. Yeah because if you have unlimited wishes but you're not

695
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,800
creative with your wishes all your wishes would kind of suck right? No, you

696
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,160
don't have to be creative. I mean if you have unlimited wishes you can

697
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,780
just be like okay I want $100 okay I want a hundred more okay I want a hundred

698
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,960
more it doesn't have creative well if you're not creative then it's like I

699
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:43,000
wish for no creative creative wishes is when is it when it gets bad it's not a

700
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:49,000
great wishes you're like I wish that I wish that my house what could fly and

701
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,560
then you fall out of your house and die you know but if you're uncreative you

702
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:55,240
just say I wish for a big house and you get a big house and it's fine the key is

703
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:59,280
you have to wish for you have to what if the house is to be happen to you so that

704
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,680
he twists it the other way.

705
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,520
- Yeah. - Oh, okay.

706
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:04,320
- You know, you could say, "I wish I was in jail."

707
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,920
And then you get put in like a really cool jail.

708
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,560
- Yeah, you get put in white collar prison

709
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,160
and you're playing tennis with Bernie Madoff.

710
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,040
- That's right. - I wrote a one-act play

711
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,880
with Aaron about that, about a genie who like,

712
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,480
the person keeps wishing for, it was like,

713
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,760
"Oh, I heard genies twist your wishes,

714
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,900
"so I gotta be careful.

715
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,100
"I wish for my whole family to die

716
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,080
"in a tragic buzzsaw accident."

717
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,320
And then her whole family dies and she's like,

718
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,680
"Whoa, what's the twist?

719
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,440
"How did you twist it?"

720
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,000
And just like he's wishing for stuff like that.

721
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:33,960
- You are so smart.

722
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:34,800
- I'm pretty creative.

723
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,520
I kinda wish to be creative.

724
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,040
- Yeah, Cameron wished to be creative

725
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,600
with his pre-Islamic genie in his basement.

726
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,440
- Yeah.

727
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,680
- That's why he's in that cave.

728
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
- Yeah, I'm in a cave. - You're like Charlie Cockman.

729
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,960
(laughing)

730
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,200
- Yeah. - Yeah.

731
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,800
- Cameron's a real Charlie Cockman type.

732
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,840
- Yeah.

733
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,900
- Thank you.

734
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,400

Where do you put Ski-Doo in your wishes?

749
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,200
- Exactly.

750
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,440
- There's a comment on this one,

751
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,240
there's a comment on this one that just says vagina.

752
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,480
(laughing)

753
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,920
- I wish that a vagina would fall in love with me.

754
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,760
- Yeah.

755
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,440
- The next one, I just wanna read this

756
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,420
and then immediately read a comment on it.

757
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,120
Number three is for you and your friends

758
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,520
family to be a mortal and then this comment says yes even better is if only

759
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,920
me and my aunt were a mortal when she was younger and I was a two-year-old so she

760
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:07,040
can give me baths and change my diapers forever

761
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:18,400
Jesus Christ just the first time that you've ever seen a genie express

762
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:27,920
disgust yeah I don't even have a twist for that I'm just gonna kill you I wish

763
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,320
that you were dead yeah the twist on this one is I'm just gonna kill you he pulls

764
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:38,160
out a smaller he pulls out a smaller lamp and rubs it that comes out and he's like

765
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:45,880
yeah I want this guy killed also unlimited wishes can a genie can a genie

766
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:54,560
give himself a wish? Maybe. May a genie cast a wish upon himself? Yeah. I think he, well,

767
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,720
I think he would have to have a smaller, lower number. If he says it into a tape recorder

768
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,480
and then plays it back and pretends it's somebody else's wish. If he does a really good impression

769
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:10,560
of a guy who found a lamp. Yeah. Or if he's very manipulative. Yeah. Or if he has split

770
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,240
personalities one is it one part of him is a genie and the other part is a kid

771
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:22,320
named Derek hmm who finds a lamp yeah that's that sounds like a Marvel

772
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:35,960
character from the 60s later there yeah there they had their their secret

773
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,680
identity just made no sense it was just like oh this this this is Thor is like a

774
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:44,080
Thunder God oh but wait he needs a secret identity I know he transforms

775
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,120
into a guy who has to walk with a cane like they're all just like they all just

776
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:53,960
transform. It's like like it would start out as just a kid who can turn

777
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:58,920
into a genie and grant people wishes but then in the 80s it's like he actually has

778
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,640
multiple personality disorder and yeah and inside of his mind he's constantly

779
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,560
fighting himself yeah yeah what was the what was that's actually a metaphor for

780
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,120
addiction yeah what was that cleat it sucks it comics got like cool at some

781
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:17,400
point I think you know and them a little in Chris Claremont yeah and Alan Moore

782
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:22,000
there's Alan Moore I know him yeah and they did the Vertigo comics they're like

783
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,840
yeah see these guys like that that like sub company or whatever that just makes

784
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:33,320
comics that are like a prostitute with AIDS has it has to fuck a evil trash bag

785
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:41,640
yeah it's pretty when I was a kid I was like yeah Frank Miller and shit since

786
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,160
yeah call me when it's SimCity and I can actually control it my own city called

Caleb's Berg they it's the Caleb I got great news what's the news there's Sim

790
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,800
uh... one ticket to caleb's bird please

791
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,920
number four is world peace

792
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,480
for world peace

793
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,440
and there's three comments that just say best wish ever must have wish

794
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,220
and random nader says would be nice that would be nice

795
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,400
yeah that would be nice but it's not a jet ski

796
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,640
Yeah, the twist there is you run out of oil.

797
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,640
Exactly.

798
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,120
Yeah, it's just your car don't work no more.

799
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
Yeah.

800
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,800
You gotta find a new...

801
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,200
If there's world peace, then there's gonna be no more video games, 'cause you can't force

802
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,760
a Vietnamese family into working in a software slave shop anymore.

803
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,520
Yeah, and there's gonna be no more cartoons.

804
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,480
And way too many cousins at Thanksgiving.

805
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,740
(laughter)

806
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,020
- Ah shit, Brits back, fuck.

807
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,820
No, come on dude.

808
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:00,560
- I thought you were at war.

809
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:04,360
- Nah, actually some kid voted for world peace at a genie.

810
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,860
At a genie, he voted at a genie.

811
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,000
- He voted at a genie.

812
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,560
- He voted at a genie for world peace.

813
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,120
- It's one of those overpopulation conspiracy theories

814
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,300
where it's like a war all along was a way

815
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:17,040
to trim down the cousin population.

816
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,300
- Yeah, exactly.

817
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:24,260
Yeah, there's not enough food at Thanksgiving now.

818
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:28,900
Half the fucking cousins, the big cousins especially, are back from Afghanistan.

819
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,900
Yeah the stupid cousins.

820
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:34,620
The cousins with IQs too low to know when to stop eating.

821
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,460
Yeah but he's also the cousin with the Dodge Charger.

822
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:43,020
Pretty one-sided flag football game at Thanksgiving now.

823
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:46,180
Now that all the war cousins are back.

824
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:51,680
Number 5 identical twin sibling and the first comment is kill them and pretend to be dead

825
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,820
then see how people really talk to you.

826
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,780
Kill your twin sibling just so you can- Why would you wish for a twin sibling to kill

827
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:00,780
you?

828
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,780
Why not just wish to see how people talk about you?

829
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:06,420
You are the better twin.

830
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,340
Also like, beyond that, I think identical twin sibling is kind of a crazy thing to wish

831
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,340
for.

832
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,340

00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:42,980
randomator says could end up being a problem that's true it could end up

839
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:47,340

863
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,380
I would live in a world that has Bikini Bottom from Spongebob and also has Rick and Morty and other fictional

864
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,380
things as long as my friends and family are there.

882
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:17,540
moral questions of the show it's kind of like a philosophical quandary type thing.

883
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:23,900
Oh my god I was playing I was playing Valorant the other day and... With Rick and Morty?

Yes no I saw the greatest I saw the greatest like gamer tag I've ever seen

885
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:40,140
in my life is a person whose name was bleak nihilism. I was just like fuck dude I wish

886
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:46,180
I thought of that first. Bleak nihilism is my gamer name. I think my favorite gamer name

887
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:56,380
is not a gamer tag is uh will sent it to us it was a guy in warzone named soldiers wrath.

888
00:43:56,380 --> 00:44:03,100
I changed mine, Carlos Mencia had one of my favorites, his Call of Duty, his Xbox Live

889
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:08,140
Gamer Tag, he used to post to his fans to ask them to play Call of Duty with him, and his

890
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:10,140
Gamer Tag was Laugh Punisher.

891
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,140
Sick, dude.

892
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,380
And I changed my Warzone name to Laugh Punisher.

893
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,380
That's so good.

894
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,740
It was two, so I couldn't have the ER at the end, so it's Laugh Punish-R.

895
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:21,940
That's even better.

896
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,340
That is cool.

897
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:30,780
nine-year-old brothers is a furious destroyer yes that is like the best like

00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:36,020
nine-year-old Blake yeah furious destroyer

899

900
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:51,220
so I thank God it's a slippery slope. Yeah it could have been Führer's destroyer.

901
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:59,100
Exactly. Become the biggest celebrity ever and then user HiThere says

902
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,340
I actually can't stand the prospect of being famous. Me too. Fame is like a

903
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:08,740
prison to me. Fame is a prism and you shine the light through it.

904
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,660
It's got four sides.

905
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,660
Yeah.

906
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,660
Uh-huh.

907
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,860
And you can see the dark side of the moon through it.

908
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:15,860
Yeah.

909
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,860
Yeah.

910
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,220
That's a Pink Floyd album cover.

911
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,220
Yeah.

912
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,220
Good one.

913
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:21,220
Nice, dude.

914
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:26,500
What do you guys think was the inspiration for Pink Floyd's song about money?

915
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Money!

916
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
It rocks!

917
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:32,300
No, no, that's not it.

918
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,300
That's not it.

919
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,300
Let's try again.

920
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,300
I love the stuff and I put it in my pocket.

921
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,300
Money!

922
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,300
I wish I had $100.

923
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:38,300
- I had $100.

924
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:41,460
- No, that's not it.

925
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:42,540
- Money! - Money!

926
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,660
- It's cash.

927
00:45:43,660 --> 00:45:44,500
There it is.

928
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,260

929
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,460
There it is, yeah.

934
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,140
It's a bash.

935
00:45:56,140 --> 00:45:57,420
- It's a blast.

936
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,700

940
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:19,740
late a last-minute addition yeah the bass riff in that song sounds like a song we

941
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:24,140
want it to sound when I elevate this to sound like truth what it sound like dog

942
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:29,860
shit yeah yeah it's like one of those like like the 70s guys who like like it

943
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:33,100
was very deep in the 70s but then you'd like hear it now it's just kind of like

944
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:37,800
It's actually it's actually really important because it's one of the one of the major

945
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:44,100
Inspirations for that fort minor song where they use just random sounds and household set objects to create a beat room

946
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:49,900
So he's kind of planes by by MIA. Yeah where they use a paper plane to record the song. That's yeah

947
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:55,740
Yeah, where she's song it they actually sang the whole song while riding on a paper plane. It's a little-known fact pretty impressive

948
00:46:55,740 --> 00:47:00,060
She she wrote all the lyrics on paper planes and then threw him to her producer. Whoa

949
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,780
I

950
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:09,260
I love, I love like, Boomer like, deep shit, like Money by Pink Floyd or like, just the

951
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,740
phrase "Give Peace a Chance".

952
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,620
Like you just see some guy in like a denim shirt and like, who's smoked like a million

953
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:19,780
cigarettes in his life, and he's just like "Give Peace a Chance, give me a piece of

954
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,780
courage".

955
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:24,620
People being like alive and old right now that were hippies is like so awesome.

956
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:30,700
It's so, it's so fucking cool to like, to meet like an IT guy who was a hippie, you

957
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,700
know what I mean?

958
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:38,300
just that that type like or like a food service worker who was a hippie yeah oh

959
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,220
I I worked with I fucking worked at life alive I worked with people like that

960
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:47,020
yeah that one of my one of the because one of the people I worked with like

961
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,940
wouldn't let me go home unless I did everything on this list she never gave

962
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,260
she never gave me a break and I was like man aren't you supposed to be like

963
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:59,260
anti-authority aren't you supposed to hate the man

964
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,820
new generation of like hippie types like astrology type people and like

965
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:08,420
spiritual but like there's some there's just like something about the original

966
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:12,280
hippies they're really just it really just be hidden different you know what I

967
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:16,580
mean yeah yeah the government was definitely right to just like try to

968
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:21,740
kill as many of them as possible legally you know yeah like if they killed more

969
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,660
maybe we could have stopped like Steppenwolf from happening right you know

970
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:30,700
We wouldn't have to hear "Magic Carpet Ride" whenever like something happens in a movie that's cool.

971
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:35,740
Yeah, we could have because those guys all became people who love Steppenwolf and then that song

972
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:40,780
"Lowrider" from the George Lopez show. That song's awesome. That song rocks. Yeah. It's not a good

973
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:46,220
song. That is a great song. That makes sense that you think that. That song's so cool. No.

974
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:50,940
What are you talking about? Corn did a cover of that. You think E.T. don't like the part where it goes?

975
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:56,000
Cool is a cool song. It's cool for the time. Let me tell you what a cool song is

976
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:05,900
That's a song, you know, no, you know what it is lowriders and skate - so I associate it with

977
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,820
Sweetie - it's serotonin in your brain. Yeah, exactly. So

978
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:17,860
True true. I also associate it with George Lopez show, which also is the most serotonin. That's right, dude

979
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,860
they pumped that shit into my brain.

980
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:20,860
- What was cool about--

981
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,860
- When he goes, "Wapa!"

982
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:25,860
- My cousin told me when we were younger,

983
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:28,860
he loved the George Lopez show.

984
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,860
- Because of the mom?

985
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,860
- I was like, "What is your deal? Why do you love this?"

986
00:49:33,860 --> 00:49:35,860
And he was like, "Honestly, man,"

987
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,860
because he's half Mexican,

988
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:38,860
and he was like, "Honestly, man, it's just so people at school

989
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:41,860
"believe that I'm Mexican because I look so white."

990
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:42,860
(laughter)

991
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:45,860
He just would watch it so that he knew everything about

992
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:52,260
the George Lopez show so that you could go to school and be like yo the Lopez was crazy last night.

993
00:49:52,260 --> 00:50:01,940
That Lopez ep, that epi, lopey had my brain. Wow. What's the guy, what's his like Ernie,

994
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:06,420
his friend Ernie? You know I think I've seen it. You're thinking of Sesame Street and only. Yeah,

995
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,900
no there, no I'm thinking of George Lopez show because. You're thinking of Ernie and Bert from

996
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:12,840
from Sesame Street, your favorite show.

997
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:16,520
- George Lopez collects paperclips and he loves pigeons,

998
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,120
and his friend Ernie's always giving him the shit.

999
00:50:21,120 --> 00:50:22,260
He's giving him shit.

1000
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,720
And they sit there and they live together,

1001
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,520
and there's a rubber ducky, and that's George Lopez.

1002
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,320
- Number 11, no pain.

1003
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,960
(laughing)

1004
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,400
- Yeah, that sucked.

1005
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,320
- No pain or damage to your body ever.

1006
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,800
- We've already gone through this one.

1007
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,400
- No, but listen to the comment, though.

1008
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,320
Listen to this comment from Hai there.

1009
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,400
Said Genie would be about 15 years too late on that one.

1010
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,480
- What?

1011
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,720
- He's saying that he made this wish 15 years ago.

1012
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:56,520
- There's another comment on this that just says, "Venom."

1013
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,560
- That's kind of a scary comment.

1014
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,200
- Yeah, I don't like that comment.

1015
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,200
- Number 12, become the prettiest person in the universe.

1016
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,080
- I think we should skip to number 13.

1017
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:13,020
I think this is the word this is where it's at for me. We is it ramp back up here number 13

1018
00:51:13,020 --> 00:51:15,020
No more Justin Bieber

1019
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:17,120
But who would we make fun of?

1020
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,380

1022
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:33,320
You're really boiling my balls JB. This wish is great. No more Justin means no more problems for boys

1023
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:38,880
He just suck. He is a human and he has the right of what he is doing. What have you guys done in life?

1024
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:42,040
I've hated Justin Bieber. Yeah, I've

1025
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:48,260
My my Justin Bieber jokes are way more creative than ever any song that freak could ever make

1026
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:54,640
Remember that video? I think we watched it on stream, but it's like Justin Bieber is dead metal wins

1027
00:51:54,640 --> 00:52:00,840
Was it a clip of Law and Order or whatever we get shot a thousand times

1028
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,020
Yeah, but it's a kid just it's a kid talking about it with no context

1029
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:07,860
Nice. Oh my god

1030
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:10,520
Wait, no, sorry. Keep going

1031
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:14,040
He what well, it's called it's called Justin Fagber rest in piss

1032
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,360
That's the title of the video

1033
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:23,840
That's pretty good dude, we might need to

1034
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,880
episode name I

1035
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:31,180
Think we just found an episode damn. Yeah, dude. It's one of the it's one of the best like

1036
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,280
like 20 like videos from

1037
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,040
It just perfectly

1038
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,440
Encapsulates the the mindset of a teenage boy in 2010. I

1039
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:44,520
Fucking hate myself, dude. I

1040
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,340
Love you more than anything and I'm gonna marry you you're not gonna. We uh we

1041
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:56,400
We predicted this number 14 is to go back in time and change past mistakes and a comment on here says I can save Freddie

1042
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:03,400
mercury

1043
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:11,480
there's no there's another comment it's a safe delivery definitely

1044
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:17,040
it's not what you've already don't talk that aspect here

1045
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,920
that's over there

1046
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:22,760
not mind you know i'm on and i would go i would go even further back in time and i

1047
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:29,720
I would go to the guy who invented AIDS and say, "Listen, monkeys are not sexy, okay?"

1048
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:30,720
Monkeys are not sexy.

1049
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,720
It doesn't matter.

1050
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:38,520
They may try to trick you with coconut bras and long wigs, but don't fall for it.

1051
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,040
Yeah, I understand.

1052
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,040
Monkeys are beautiful.

1053
00:53:42,040 --> 00:53:44,120
AIDS was created by monkeys on purpose.

1054
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:47,680
They knew that if humans had sex with them, it would be the downfall of humanity.

1055
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,680
It's literally the planet of the AIDS.

1056
00:53:48,680 --> 00:53:51,880
So they dressed up sexy to try and fool this guy.

1057
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:52,720
- Yeah, 'cause they had--

1058
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:54,520
- Is that what 12 Monkeys is about?

1059
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:55,520
- Yeah, I've never seen 12 Monkeys.

1060
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:58,260
- I haven't seen 12 Monkeys either, but it sounds right.

1061
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:00,420
- I think it's about a guy going crazy.

1062
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,840
- I don't think it is.

1063
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:02,680
- It is.

1064
00:54:02,680 --> 00:54:04,040
- I think it's about you.

1065
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,760
And it's about 12 of you.

1066
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:09,080
I think it's about 12 different versions of you.

1067
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,360
- It's basically Cheaper by the Dozen with monkeys.

1068
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,300
So a guy has 12 monkeys in his house

1069
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,680
and his wife is writing a book about it.

1070
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:18,240
And he has, and also Ashton Kutcher

1071
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,560
is marrying one of the monkeys.

1072
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,080
Let's blow through some more of these.

1073
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,120
There are a bunch of really good ones on here.

1074
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:27,800
Number 15, wish for eliminating the evil qualities

1075
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,960
which resides in every person on the planet.

1076
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,640
I hope it includes pervertedness to be eliminated.

1077
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:36,120
That's so true.

1078
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:36,960
Me too.

1079
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,760
Number 16, to bring dead actors back to life.

1080
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,240
Who would you guys, if you can bring one person

1081
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,640
back to life?

1082
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:48,480
One person, or one dead actor?

1083
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:49,840
I would bring one dead actor.

1084
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:55,240
I'd bring Chadwick Boseman back so that we could finish what Marvel started, you know, and he can die again. I don't give a fuck

1085
00:54:55,240 --> 00:55:01,200
But at least that was like I love how that was like the first thing a lot of people said

1086
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,400
Like they're like all the stupid fucking Marvel fans were like

1087
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,920
- I

1088
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:12,960
Mean, they definitely are just gonna CGI him for five more movies, right?

1089
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:16,460
I already have a fucking clone of him dude. Yeah, there's no way they don't yeah

1090
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:22,600
Yeah, they definitely already they either already filmed five movies or they're gonna CGI him

1091
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:28,020
It's just so sad that that he was secretly arrested and then executed by President Donald Trump

1092
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:35,580
It's really sad I would bring Jim Varney back to life so we could get more earnest movies

1093
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:41,440
I would bring Jim Carrey back to life. Yeah, I'd bring his girlfriend back to life to find out what really happened. Yeah

1094
00:55:41,820 --> 00:55:44,740
Yeah, I slipped and landed on a bunch of pills

1095
00:55:44,740 --> 00:55:49,460
I would I would bring Kevin Spacey back to life because the guy that's been doing all this stuff that ain't him

1096
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,900
Yeah, let me tell you he would never do

1097
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:59,180
House of cards I would bring Marlon Brando and Richard Pryor back as two old men and make them fuck again

1098
00:55:59,180 --> 00:56:03,720
I would bring back like I would bring back like a Shakespeare era actor

1099
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:09,460
Yeah, so I could kill them with someone like William Smithington. I would bring back Shakespeare

1100
00:56:09,620 --> 00:56:14,260
Yeah, it wasn't an actor. He wasn't really he was a collective of the biggest actors in the world

1101
00:56:14,260 --> 00:56:17,340
He was not an actor a collective of writers. That's right. Yeah

1102
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:21,220
Wasn't one guy. Mm-hmm. Yep. He was like

1103
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:29,860
Just like David Wayne and and the two Michaels, yeah

1104
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,580
Become the most famous person in the universe

1105
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,860
That's like the fourth time that's on this fucking list dude.

00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:41,460
Number 22 is more genies and the top comment is

00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:49,220
Yeah, no obviously.

1109
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:53,660
It's like how you go to a massage place and you're like I prefer a female masseuse.

1110
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,500
Yeah, I want a female genie.

1111
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,980
Look, getting your wish granted by another man?

1112

1117
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:40,460

1119

Number 30 is wishing for an increase in the size of the Earth's radius for accommodating the increasing population

1120
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:53,580
And then a comment says I love earth Wakanda forever

1121
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:59,000

And then the comment that says this is an amazing wish but sadly and unfortunately

1126
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:26,340
Unfortunately, there's too much prejudice in this world.

1127
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,860
The genie was just like, "Yeah, I can't do that wish, sorry."

1128
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,860
"Sorry, I can't do that wish."

1129
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,180
"Unfortunately, yeah, there's too much of it.

1135
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:06,660
Just like no more evil in the world than what is good. Everyone is equally prolly shit. You're right, dude

1136
00:59:06,660 --> 00:59:11,700
Somebody has to be poor. Yeah, they could just make everybody rich except the one guy

The comment is "I love Miranda Cosgrove and I want that she come to Pakistan for once."

1146
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,900

"One Love, Spirit of Jamaica, One Heart, Let's Get Together and Be Alright." No. No, I don't
