1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Come here, come here, come here!

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let me see your butt!

immediately.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,440
Wait, we have two Calebs?

6
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,200
I'm Caleb, bitch.

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,920
That's not even the two Calebs I was talking about.

8
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:17,920
You're just doing a weird voice.

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,360
What's the two Calebs?

10
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:22,760
We had two Calebs a second ago.

11
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:25,280
There was one Caleb who said, "Can you hear me?"

12
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,600
And then I said, "Yes."

13
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,600
And then another Caleb said, "What about me?"

14
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,100
What?

15
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:33,100
But now he's just doing a face.

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,600
He doesn't want to talk. He wants to ruin the episode right off the bat, I think.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,100
I think he's mad because he told us to come here early and he's late.

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,600
Yeah, and he was very late.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,100
Mm-hmm.

20
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,600
Yeah.

21
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
I was actually the earliest today.

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
You were, yeah.

23
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,600
And I was probably...

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,600
I came here at 7 and I fell asleep on the floor.

25
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,600
Five minutes early.

26
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,600
Five to ten minutes early, maybe.

27
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,100
I was... maybe just five.

28
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:58,500
Joe caught me in my... Joe caught me sleeping in my chair.

29
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,500
Damn, Joe caught me slipping.

30
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,140
And Caleb just sprayed Axe and it's...

31
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:07,540
The whole room smells. The whole room smells like Axe body spray.

32
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,700
He bought Axe body spray on the tour and still...

33
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,200
Whoa!

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,100
Look at that pit stain.

35
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,200
Wow!

36
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,140
I wonder they call them Caleb pits.

37
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,460
It looks like you scribbled on your armpit with pencil.

38
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,300
That straight up looks like you wiped with your shirt one time.

39
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,700
it's tried to keep the shirt 'cause you like the shirt

40
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,120
it's literally dirt

41
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:32,800
that uh... that is actually dirty to do your tour group here

42
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,320
that is straight-up poopy

43
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,240
needs got a weird haircut now yeah

44
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,060
he's not know what he wants us to say he's really not giving us any hand

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:45,840
seeking maybe point is a chunk and he's trying to do like a funny bit he can be

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,080
like point to whatever thing is waiting for us to bring up or if he's not he

47
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,360
could like leave the room

48
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,200
that access fuckin potent yet it's crazy

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,840
it's crazy this literally smell it's mostly because there's no evidence that

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,140
that's that's going to smell like that for like two weeks is not a little

51
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,140
school locker room right now

52
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:05,000
them which is a little bit about that home

53
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,520
what why you attacking me when i thought you had been killed would love to smell

54
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,220
that that's what he did it

55
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,120
yeah yeah

56
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,980
springback memories is in flashbacks yeah that's why

57
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:18,700
he can't speak as he's having a flashback and i was wondering like a dog

58
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:21,440
he's whimpering or more like mister being i guess

59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,880
more did you see mister beans holidays coming netflix in just two days

60
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,640
well i guess probably see mister b_-thirty on netflix was a student

61
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,880
mister b_-n_'s changes name mister b_ and now he's for a versus b_-thirty

62
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,260
smattering of the you know i cannot wait

63
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,640
for man versus b_

64
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,600
he's coming to be you can tell that he's fighting a beef with the little b_

65
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,400
little b_ it's too little to be a little b

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,260
they say a b_ is too little afraid i'm not so sure it believe it's been verses

67
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,260
Bee folks it's Bean vs. Bee. It's one of the craziest things.

68
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,260
It's one of the craziest things.

69
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,260
Bean vs. Bee.

70
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:01,260
When I first heard of it, I thought it was Man vs. Bean.

71
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,260
Folks he put all of his music on DatPiff for free. It's Little Bee.

72
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:09,260
He put all of the albums on Spotify recently.

73
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:12,260
He put them on recently.

74
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,260
Folks you can't listen to In Down Bad. You can't listen to it on Spotify.

75
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:21,420
Spotify. They took it off and had the Seed Boyardee beat. Where did it go? Where did

76
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:28,420

84
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,360
Yep. By saying what's a piff

85
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,360
three minutes

86
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,840
Good point that piff great website. I don't know a lot of free mix tapes

87
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:31,880
Folks I saw I know I'm actually getting I don't know

88
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,840
I'm only joking you can get the piff out of here. You can get the piff out of

89
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,760
here. There's some kind of piff. What is a piff? What's a piff? It's a shoe.

90
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,960
It's a shoe? Yep. Datpiff. I'm going to ask Siri. Siri wouldn't know. What's a

91
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:58,120
piff? Siri might know. Siri would not know any hip hop shit. A piff. Okay, so

92
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,640
it just gave me the Google results for Siri. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Oh

93
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,340
here we go. Oh urban dictionary

94
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:12,460
piff superior to the average, also a potent strain of weed, slash cannabis of

95
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,580
purple color or a shoe.

96
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:19,440
No, doesn't think you're thinking of a john. It says a word most London youth

97
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,020
used to describe someone's appearance used when the person is attractive,

98
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,600
pate, always peef or I thought where down that gal there is piff. She got her

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
own swagger and ting

100
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,320
is a the example you're talking about I thought PIF was the British word for FAGIT

101
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,000
you think that's poof yeah poof da poof da fucking poof da whoa you can't say

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,240
that no it's a British guy saying it no that was you saying that what's pride

103
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,840
month came out of your mouth what that's the opposite rule no pride month you can

104
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:59,720
say whatever the F you want FAG you want I don't I think it's the pride month I

105
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,640
I think it's you can say whatever the F. A. G. You want it's double wrong you

106
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,160
but I think it's horrible. Yeah, what you're doing actually maybe the triple

107
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,400
bad triple bed. Yeah,

108
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,640
here's a good example. It's like it's triple bed. I was chilling with John

109
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,760
yesterday, but we didn't have no piff on us. We were looking for piff and we

110
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,520
called you. You didn't pick up you dumb ass.

111
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:23,840
Me that's what it says. That's an example of what piff means on Urban

112
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,920
Dictionary and you dumb ass is linked

113
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,760
dumb asses on you dumb it says a link to use to insult other people trying to

114
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,840
get something you didn't wait let's all search our names on urban dictionary

115
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,680
okay okay how we done this I don't think we've done this dude Caleb I think I

116
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,760
think we're gonna gonna have a real treat okay here's the top real treat I

117
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:48,080
don't know can I skip the top one and just do the second one I said you have

118
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,120
to know wait for Kayla really for me for you nope you have to do the first one

119
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,080
it always has to be the first one. Okay, well the first one is Cameron, an albino

120
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,620
ghost

121
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:06,120
and then it says, dude, we lost Cameron in the Antarctic.

122
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,020
No, by no, but the second one, the second one is like, I don't care about

123
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,220
the second one. The second one is way more at all. Listen, it says he's been

124
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,820
hurt. He has a past, but he's probably the best guy I'll ever meet. Don't break

125
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:18,220
him because he's already been broken. He loves jokes and he treats his

126
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,920
girlfriend like a queen. He will give you everything he has and then some he

127
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,620
always knows more than he's letting on and can hide his

128
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,320
emotions very well. If he needs to talk, please listen to him.

129
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,920
He loves love and he loves giving love. He just wants to be

130
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,120
loved in return. If you ever get a camera in your life, don't

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,620
let them go. So I think that was probably the first person

132
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,620
probably they meant to they meant to put that under a

133
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,720
different name. Maybe they were like they're using they're

134
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,720
using text-to-speech and they probably said Kevin and it

135
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,820
picked up his camera and then the second one was the correct

136
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:46,520
Texas. We can I use the sixth one? No, you have to go first.

137
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,620
Let me use the sixth one. No, no someone with a massive

138
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,460
first long and not afraid to say it. Caleb has a horse cock. That's to go to

139
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:59,220
the first one yeah the six one. They're all good someone that you love to hang

140
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,940
out with and someone that you need a guy who you come to depend on and trust. He

141
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:09,500
accepts all people who for who they are and as a secret compassion for them as a

142
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,940
heart of gold and has a taste to show it

143
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,180
(laughter)

144
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:20,720
- Keep going, keep hitting.

145
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,660
- That's the funniest sense of humor.

146
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,020
It always speaks his mind even when it may be appropriate.

147
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
He treats his girl well and would do anything

148
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,020
to make her happy even if it means changing himself.

149
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,220
His girl can only think, is he for real?

150
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,300
Is he gonna hurt me?

151
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,740
Am I with the right guy?

152
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,540
He's almost too good to be true.

153
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,940
He's easy to love and makes a girl feel beautiful.

154
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,940
special, powerful, worthy, and a better person.

155
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,840
He's the kind of guy any person would be lucky

156
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,680
to have in their life.

157
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,500
- It's too long.

158
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,760
- If you meet this guy, Caleb, stick with him

159
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,240
'cause he'll make life even more sweeter.

160
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,520
I love him with all I have by Your Hot Girlfriend.

161
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,120
- Whoa.

162
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
- Let's check out this profile.

163
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,260
What other definitions--

164
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,760
- That's her only definition.

165
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,960
- Wow.

166
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,100
Here's one.

167
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,940
Here's Patrick.

168
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:09,580
A really cute, smart, nice guy that would do anything

169
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:15,260
make you happy is also competitive since he is an athlete. If you tell him you can't do something,

170
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:19,660
he'll prove that he can, but you can never lie to him. His gorgeous eyes will make your heart melt,

171
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,580
and every time you want to talk to him, it just melts you. When it comes to relationships,

172
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,140
he is the best guy to be with. He will make you giggle when you're feeling down. Giggle even if

173
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:33,340
you're happy, and just anything to see you happy. His hugs are so comforting to make you feel

174
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:38,700
protective. Patrick is the cutest by Dr. Snuggles. This is interesting. Calebs are usually tall.

175
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:45,500
There's two definitions from Dr. Snuggles, and it's Patrick, and then the second one is Jolly.

176
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,780
Whoa.

00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,580
Wow.

This person is an amazing one whom you do not want to lose. They are great friends and good people.

179
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,940
Who named their kid Jolly?

180
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,540

He is also one of the spongebob's neighbors on the squidward.

199
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:57,060
I think I'm going to go to Patrick.

200
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,960
Okay, yep, I have one now. I this one might be I don't know if I agree with

201
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,860
what's being said in this definition here, but I was one the nicest guy

202
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,780
you'll ever meet

203
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,220
don't

204
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:14,900
I know what this is. This has got to be this has got to be Hitler. It's

205
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:19,940
really oh my God.

206
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:26,380
I knew it. Here's one classic urban dictionary. Yeah, this wired ass kid

207
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:30,100
that has been a lot of crazy bullshit and knows too much for his age. This

208
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,860
will go up and pull a fucking fire alarm at a fucking factory and no one will know who

209
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:45,220
it is. I'm going to go with Patrick again. Dude, I'm so good at this. You do one. I'm

210
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:53,980
answering all of them. Okay, fine. I'll do another one. I'll pull up another one. Fine,

211
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:59,400
I'll do a different name. Whatever. I got one. I got one. I got one. Okay. A weapon

212
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,360
of mass destruction developed by evil Canadian scientists in an attempt to conquer the United

213
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,640
States and make Canada a super country. I think I know this. When the weapon grew, the

214
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:11,520
scientists put it to test on YouTube with it getting millions of views. The scientists

215
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,120
approached the Canadian capital to notice a high torture rate. The scientists told that

216
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,640
Canada would gain control of the US if sent to the states. Convinced, they sent it to

217
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:23,480
the US only to be backfired when he gained teenage girl fans. Furious by this, Canada

218
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,400
commenced search and destroy in order to destroy the weapon, but due to its popularity, its

219
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:31,660
bodyguards would risk to take a bullet for the WMD. Canada is still trying to

220
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,160
reach the weapon, but it's shown no effect so far.

221
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,760
Justin Bieber. That's right. Whoa okay, I got a good one. A fucking idiot who

222
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:48,520
spends his days getting the shit kicked out of him by a rabbit and a duck. Is it

223
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:59,240
Mr. Fudd. It is Elmer Fudd. Wait, I got one more. A practice of sexual gratification in

224
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,860
which a man squeezes Elmer's glue onto his hands, masturbates, and then peels the dried

225
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:10,800
glue from his member. Caleb. That was also Elmer Fudd. How could I have searched another

226
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,600
name so fast? I thought it was Caleb. Well, you know, you might have had someone lined

227
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,600
it.

228
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,600
Elmer Fudd.

229
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
Yeah.

230
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
What do I do next?

231
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
What should I search?

232
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:25,160
Everything that is racist, ignorant, and just plain wrong in the world condensed down into

233
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,040
one fat, hilarious nine-year-old.

234
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:34,040
That's the last thing I thought.

235
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Dennis the Menace.

236
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,040
Nope.

237
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Wait, nine-year-old?

238
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,040
It's got to be Trump, right?

239
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,360
They're just calling him nine years old?

240
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Not Bart Simpson?

241
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,360
No.

242
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,360
Bart Simpson's never racist.

243
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
He's racist all the time.

244
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
He's like the most racist person I've ever met.

245
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,680
What I guess Alberto you must not be watching the newest episodes

246
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,680
a nine racist fat nine-year-old, okay

247
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,960
Here's a

248
00:13:55,960 --> 00:14:00,120
Okay, here's a okay. Do I know who this person is? Yeah

249
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:06,360
Okay, here's another definition. Maybe this will help. Okay, it's super happy fun. Joy time. I was you

250
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,520
He's on the show and is the fat kid who always gets made fun of Oh Cartman. Yep. Yeah. Oh my god

251
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:18,680
Yeah, obviously. How did that? I know right? Holy. I wasn't thinking cartoons even though

252
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,040
we said Bart Simpson. Here I got one. Alright, you guys ready for this one? Yeah. Tough.

253
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:28,000
Alright. Okay. Difficult. Homer Simpson is my hero. He is the greatest man in the history

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,280
of human existence. Okay, so I'm guessing, I'm going to guess Bart again because it's

255
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,960
clear that this is like dialogue. It's not Bart. It's not, I can't tell you that you're

256
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,160
very close, but you know

257
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:49,660
fuck I'll read it again. Homer Simpson is my hero yeah. He is the greatest man in

258
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:55,160
the history of human existence. So who would Homer Simpson who would be who

259
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,400
would have Homer Simpson as their hero is the question. Let me read it again.

260
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
Homer Simpson, yes,

261
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,600
yeah, I know I got that, but okay now let me move to the next line. Homer Simpson

262
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:09,580
my hero Marge Simpson wrong no why is it home you but that but who else could it

263
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:15,940
Homer would be more of his kid yeah Maggie it's not Maggie no the fucking

00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:21,900

266
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,140

00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,640
Homer Simpson, oh, so coffee, no, it's not must be a coffee. It's not has

268
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,340

George Lopez, he popularized. He wasn't the first to do it, but

285
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,080
the beginning of the show where it goes like

286
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:08,000
four notes,

287
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,200
queer ass clown that likes to molest little kids in his play

288
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,320
lands. Caleb, Patrick, both are correct. No,

289
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,160
no, that's not true. What's the answer?

290
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,880
Ronald McDonald. It's Ronald McDonald. I didn't know. Apparently

291
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,380
Ronald McDonald's a molester.

292
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,220
- Yeah.

293
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,680
- I just learned this on Urban Dictionary.

294
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,800
Apparently, Ronald McDonald molests children

295
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,640
when they sit on his lap.

296
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,360
- Breaking news coming in from the Urban Dictionary.

297
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,200
Ronald McDonald is a molester.

298
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,040
- I feel like--

299
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,920
- Urban Dictionary broke the story in 2011.

300
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,840
- Molester's a little too sophisticated of a word,

301
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,520
I think, for a pedophile, yeah.

302
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,820
- I was Ronald McDonald for Halloween as a child.

303
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,960
- What?

304
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,680

310
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,560

311
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,740

312
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:28,840

314
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,520
bumblebee. You know I was really mad when I was in first grade because

I had like a mask like a plastic mask. What about the hair though? You didn't have any?

318
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,760
No, the mask had the hair. Oh, okay. So I was gonna go like in that costume and I

319
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:04,400
think my mom didn't want me to wear it to school because it looked fruity.

320
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:10,920
To have a mask over your head? No, no, no. Yugi's, he, which one is that? He's, I mean every

You had a pot of greed

As the pot of greed yeah, there's that one picture of Patrick where it looks exactly like the pot of greed. Oh, yeah

00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,320
Is that when we went to New York for the first time?

340
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,560
No, you're smiling really big and you're drooling.

341
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,560
And you look like the Pot of Green.

342
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
I remember it.

343
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,640
And you did the perspective change so the bottom of your face is huge.

344
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,640
Yep.

345
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,920
Do you guys want to hear a political joke I thought of on the way here?

346
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm sick of all this fucking divisive bullshit, but yes.

347
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Okay, are you sure?

348
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,640
I mean, it sounds like you don't want to hear it.

349
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,640
If you-

350
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,840
Look, we'll listen to it, but if it's too divisive, I'm not paying attention.

351
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,720
If it's fucking divisive left and right bullshit, then I'm-

352
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,600
It's not, it has nothing to do with left and right.

353
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,360
Is it epic leftist or based populist?

354
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
What?

355
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Is it based as hell?

356
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,360
What?

357
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,360
Or is it actually...

358
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
No, it's just about politics.

359
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
It's not...

360
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,360
I don't know what he's talking about.

361
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,700
Would you say that it's cringe or based?

362
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,700
It's definitely...

363
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,160
Well, it's based for me, but it's cringe for the people it's making fun of.

364
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,160
I would hope so.

365
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,160
Yeah.

366
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,160
But listen, if it's honestly...

367
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,160
If this bullshit is divisive...

368
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Dude, it's not divisive.

369
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,160
If this bullshit is divisive...

370
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,160
It makes fun of the entire political system.

371
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,160
...then I'm doing a...

372
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,160
I'm having a...

373
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,160
Then we're doing a coup.

374
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,160
We're doing a coup.

375
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:08,340

378
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,440
rats having sex yeah but enough of about all these politicians in our government

379
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:26,320
White House on both sides you fucking pissed me off instantly because it's

380
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,040
divisive it's not divisive it's about both sides but there's those are not

381
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,960
even the symbols of the political parties yeah you maybe if you said oh yeah I was

382
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,360

385
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,640
sides

386
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,120
BTS goes to the White House and this guy has to say all these rats are in the

387
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,160
the white house. You hate BTS don't you? You hate BTS. Admit it.

Admit it. Behind the scenes. You're jealous of their rapping abilities.

389
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,160
I just think that they shouldn't be having sex in the White House with each other.

390
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,320
They don't have sex with each other. They don't have sex, they have dances.

391
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:12,560
Yeah. I just don't think they should be like fucking each other in the gutter.

392
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:15,680
That's not what the... That's not what BTS does.

393
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,400
And it's not the gutter, it's butter. They say that in the song.

394
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,080

Alright, here's mine.

412
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,040

00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,040
Here's my political joke.

414
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,540

415
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540

00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Okay.

417
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,540
Oh, what is it?

418
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
I know this won't be divisive.

419
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
I abstain.

420
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
Whoa.

421
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Yeah, that is a fucking joke.

422
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:15,400
The second this recorder turns off, he's going to be talking shit about every side of the

423
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
political spectrum.

424
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,400
He's just afraid of losing money.

425
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:21,840
You honestly fucking talk shit about all four quadrants of the political square, then I'm

426
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
gonna fucking destroy you.

427
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:27,280
He does it the second we press stop or pause or even that we do any other button on the

428
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,680
recorder he starts talking about this stuff.

429
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,880
He thinks I pressed pause.

430
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,480
You're going to get destroyed in a major way.

431
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,440
He's a total hypocrite.

432
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
And a hipster.

433
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:36,920
Oh, what's that, like a political party?

434
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:37,920
You're a total...

435
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,160
Don't say that political bullshit, man.

436
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,720
We're gonna get fucking fired.

437
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,080
I don't care if I get fired.

438
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,080
I'm in it for comedy.

439
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
What the fuck?

440
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,080
Yes, you do.

441
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:46,080
I'm in it for comedy.

442
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,080
No, I don't care at all.

443
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,780
I don't care at all. Okay, I'm not afraid to say I hate both sides of our

444
00:24:50,780 --> 00:25:00,660
Both sides yeah both sides of the street that I have to cross to get home because it's so long in between them on to

445
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:05,900
Walk across the road on the crosswalk. He said that that was honestly there's too many Democrats or Republicans

446
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,200
I'm not big political. That's just about that's a joke about people

447
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,440
What people are politicians you dumb bitch?

448
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,080
Not to I don't think all people at all. They're more like rats having sex in the gutter

449
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,720

458
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,880

It's filled with red jelly.

487
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,040
And a butthole spaghetti.

488
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:16,320
Because that hurts when you do that.

489
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,320
He almost fell over.

490
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Does it?

491
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,920
I saw him almost fall over.

492
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,440
Because that hurts when you do that.

493
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
How do you know?

494
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,360
My friend told me.

495
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:25,920
You know my friend's name is?

496
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:26,920
What?

497
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,120
milk. You're right.

498
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:37,480
Harvey Milk told you that having fucked in the butt hurts. Is that true?

499
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,320
Did he just tell you that unprompted? Did he just text you or he called you?

500
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,360
Those were his last words.

501
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,720
To me.

502
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,120
His last words were itter.

503
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,160
Explained to me. It actually hurts kind of bad. Did you ask him or you just said

504
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,160
it? And if I had to liken it to a food, it would be a

505
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,240
- A donut with red jelly.

506
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,800
- Shake like a butt.

507
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,800
- Because it hurts.

508
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,380
It would be a butthole donut with red jelly.

509
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:12,240
- Come on man, it's fucking Pride Month.

510
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,580
- Obviously this is all a joke.

511
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,420
- Yep.

512
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,640
- 'Cause it's a comedy podcast.

513
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,200
- That's right, we don't care either way what you think.

514
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,160
- Honestly, straight gay, it's all okay with me.

515
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,160
- Black, white, purple.

516
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,000
- Yep.

517
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,280
- Purple.

518
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,280
- Yeah, gay, straight, purple, old, young, purple.

519
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,480
- Eskimo.

520
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,920
- The thing is, guys, man, woman, purple.

521
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,320
- Are you supposed to say Inuit

522
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,720
or are you supposed to say Eskimo?

523
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,560
- I think you're supposed to say Inuit.

524
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,000
- Or Eskimo's a different thing?

525
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,840
- I think they did, they--

526
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,520
- I'm sorry if there's any--

527
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,280
- Did they slurify Eskimo or are you not supposed to say that?

528
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,040
- I think you're not supposed to say it.

529
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,560
Can you still say Inuit like Inuit brother? Oh yeah, like an Inuit kiss.

530
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,000
Yeah,

531
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,640

533
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:14,640

534
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,680
to use like, just to be safe, to use a race that doesn't exist and say like,

535
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,680

00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Inuit kind of works better though.

539
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:30,440
Inuit, I feel like for Inuit brother works better because I was all up in yit.

624
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,620
one character the the actress who plays her has been getting a lot of heat

625
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:47,740
because of the Sun because because of the two sons on tattooing yeah or a

race and it's sad and it's messed up she heat for her race yeah what does that

630
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:35,040
mean she's getting a lot of what is this world come to when a woman can't just be

631
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,600
a twi'lek in peace that's right but there's like a scene where she like for

632
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:47,040
some reason she knows that princess Leia is Luke Skywalker's sister or like

633
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,280
Anakin Skywalker's daughter and it's like how do you know that that makes no sense

634
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,160
and it's like there's genuine criticism to be had about the character but then

635
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,800
like they have like a lot of this isn't to be had well then let's have it let's

636
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:07,240
yep have at it it makes no sense that she knows go on it makes no sense that

637
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,560
that character knows why is why does she know that lay or you know who I want to

638
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:16,840
again it makes no sense I want to see the people on the internet are going crazy

639
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,200
they say you can't have lay or got it no you can't ever know they can't have the

640
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:28,080
third sister no but back why did they call her the sister they should have

641
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:32,640
brought this you're not do it whole show about general grievous general grievous

642
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,160
he needs to make a comeback I've any safety little Benny safety he's on the

643
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,380
show I heard I heard general grievances is door is joining Rob zombies touring

644
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:49,560
band really that'd be dope as hell yeah they were him in five nights if he wears

645
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:53,960
a top hat and he plays two guitars that's the same time what was the

646
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:02,860
double-neck guitar that we on the tour I saw there's that band that we

647
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,480
technically open for we didn't technically oh you keep saying that over

648
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,960
over and over it doesn't make any sense. It's so funny to say that we opened for Led Zeppelin.

649
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:13,020
It's funny to lie. First of all it's a lie, second of all you've been saying it

650
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:16,460
open for and then you added technically open for which makes it more of a lie.

651
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:21,540
Yeah. We technically did not. We did not at all. It doesn't matter. There was an hour in

652
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:25,420
between and then it was their show. It's an early show and late show. Yeah. Would you say

653
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:30,960
if you go see Doctor Strange and then the showtime is right before the another

654
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,820
movie that's out would you say that Doctor Strange opened for that other

655
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:36,900
movie yes I don't think so it's just two different show anyway I saw the

656
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,780
double-neck guitar in person for the first time and I was like damn wait they

657
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:46,820
had one they do they we should have stayed we were allowed to stay we should

658
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:49,620
have stayed and watched yep we should have been it was awesome

659
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:56,300
so so so so so so so so so so so podcasts yeah that's what the sign said

660
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,260
welcome home yeah welcome home so so like maybe get rid of welcome home yeah

661
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:07,260
make enough room for it to say the two different acts yeah well I think so they

662
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:13,940
thought our name was podcast it is I guess it kind of is it was they thought

663
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:17,400
that our name was podcast and then in San Francisco they thought our name was

664
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,700
about list we basically said about list podcast yeah yeah about basically have

665
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:29,380
the best podcast name ever because no should we change it I was I a thousand

666
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:34,980
times we should have changed it like two years ago to Patrick's podcast. It's way

667
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:38,780
too late now. I think that's bad. It should have been Patrick's podcast. It's

668
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,540
only one guess one of the three guys. That's so so funny. That's even funnier.

669
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:46,220
That's probably that's maybe one of the only podcast names worse than podcast

670
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:54,420
about list. Patrick's podcast. How about this Tutti Frutti the show? Tutti Frutti the show?

671
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,720
the show that could actually be good. They could to the fruity but maybe we

672
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,140
change it. Maybe we just throw everyone a curve, but we change the podcast

673
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,360
about lists. Oh yeah, what about

674
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,740
first podcast on the left?

675
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:16,040
That's right first podcast on the list. We are the first podcast on the left. I

676
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,740
mean honestly what we if we getting I we could ruin our at we could try and

677
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:24,580
the SEO and have it be like we could just call it like top ten funny podcasts.

678
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,300
Oh that'd be good. Because then I think that's maybe one of the only because

679
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,620
that phrase podcast about list you can kind of carve out a space there there's

680
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,380
not many web pages called podcast about you search it and you know you get a lot

681
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:40,620
of but eventually you know what's like the worst SEO name not even leaving

682
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:47,540
podcasts like what's just like a two-word phrase we could family watchdog.com/calebpitts

683
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,700
pits Google I don't know I don't know if that's a real web page I think that

684
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,960
probably doesn't exist if we called it like with a swag poop our a worse a

685
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:07,460
worse thing to look up the the the the no the three cookbook PDF that's good

686
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:14,460
spelled right yeah the Beatles podcast yeah I think it's spelled right be a TL

687
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:20,740
yes mm-hmm cuz I'm just such a big music fan the Beatles the bait

688
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:24,500
Beatles the Beatles the Beatles the Beatles

689
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:38,860
I'm Ringo, I'm Ringo, hello it's me Ringo Starr and I love shaving my pussy I heard

690
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:43,660
General Grievous is not joining the Beatles General Grievous is not joining

691
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:50,660
as a drummer with four arms. He'd be such a singlet drummer. He should join every band.

692
00:40:50,660 --> 00:41:01,180
He should join Shine Down. Oh my god, every four armed. So it's General Grievous, Goro,

693
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:07,140
Machamp from Pokemon. They should form a band. Who's another one? Who's another four armed?

694
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:12,640
the Hindu God. Okay, yeah. But is any of them all the one that has arms? I

695
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,040
can't remember Peter Griffin. This is not oh the human centipede has maybe I

696
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,840
think you're gonna have a hard time with that one that not they can work the

697
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:25,540
pedal board. Yeah on the down the road. Yeah, the front they could press all

698
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,040
the pedals for the first time you saw human centipede. I never watched that

699
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,140
movie. I saw I remember it's in pieces. I have a really vivid memory. I was in

700
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:37,180
middle school and they had in my like middle school library. They had like

701
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,340
the like centipede. So they had like they like newspapers and they had like

702
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,020
one that was about like movies and stuff. They had like a movie review

703
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:46,180
thing that I would like turn to. I remember reading about the human

704
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,940
centipede of being like the guy who made this movie should be sent to jail.

705
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:54,100
What is wrong with the world? Well, they also named Tom six yeah. They also he

706
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,460
also did a second one. That's a there are three of them a guy watching the

707
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,060
human centipede and being like I'm going to do that in real life. Yeah, it's a

708
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:07,580
sick. That's the perfect, every good sequel is like that. Yeah, that's a very

709
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:15,940
fun. And the guy in the sequel is so fat. Yeah. He's so fat. Why do you feel the

710
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,140
need to bring that up? And he jacks off with sandpaper. That's okay. Why do you

711
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:23,740
feel like you need to call this guy fat? Because in the first one it was a skinny

712
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:28,060
guy. So he's- It's just the difference between the- He's changing all the

713
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:35,060
sliders. Yeah. The sliders. Yeah. Do they have horns? No. You can't get horns with a slider.

714
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:39,060
No you can't. No that's clearly, that's one where you select the horn. That's a grid.

715
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,060
Yeah, the first movie the sliders are all to the left. What about the length of the

716
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,060
horns? Duh. They don't have that. The first movie the sliders are on the left side. Dude

717
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:48,060
can you control length of hair with slider? No you have to pick it from a grid. There's

718
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:54,060
no sliders. You can show your hair. What? All you want. What'd you say? Do you think

719
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,060
you can change the length of hair with sliders? No you have to pick it from a grid. You say

720
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,060
- Did you say with slizzers?

721
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,740
Yeah, with scissors you can change the length of hair.

722
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,580
- What are you talking about?

723
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,420
- Yeah, what are you talking about?

724
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,240
- You sound crazy.

725
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,740
- No, I'm making you feel so crazy right now.

726
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,580
- You're not making me feel crazy at all.

727
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,660
- You think you're in a dream.

728
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,800
- You're making me think that you're very stupid.

729
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:08,640
- You just got emotionally--

730
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,780
- And you might have a short circuit in your brain.

731
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,060
- You got emotionally dominated.

732
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,380
I have a long circuit in my brain, okay?

733
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,220
It goes all the way around.

734
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,860
- You have one long circuit, that's it.

735
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:17,060
- Yep, and it goes on and off.

736
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:17,960
- It's a circle.

737
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:18,800
It's like when you, it's like one of those--

738
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:19,620
- Yeah, that's what I said.

739
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:25,920
you have a long circle in my brain one of those the male to male plug that they are

740
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,020
you're also you like stuff and you plug it in.

741
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:35,060
You have you have just a plug that's plugged into both of the outlet.

742
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:38,540
Actually I think a male to male plug is actually fine I just decided.

743
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:39,540
But I like a female to female plug a little bit more.

744
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,380
I told you he's having a short circuit in his brain.

745
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:44,540
You know the male to male like you when they make Christmas lights and it's like

746
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:45,860
this one does not exist.

747
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:48,900
Yeah that's what I'm talking about when people do you know do you know that have

748
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:52,900
have you seen that no it's like it's like an extension cord where both sides are

749
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:58,120
the plug yeah like the the mail plug and you they I guess people go into like

750
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:00,540
harbor stores and ask for it because I thought they want to extend their

751
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,300
Christmas lights, but that's like a that's like a suicide plug because you

752
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,860
could just that just like if you plug that you can plug that into into the

753
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:12,160
same power strip like both ends in the same pressure from will just explode

754
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:16,580
yeah, just cause a fire and so sick. I might do that yeah, but like there are

755
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,360
just a bunch of pictures of like a bunch of hardware stores that have signs that

756
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:24,000
are like we do not make these these do not exist don't ask for these if you try

757
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,520
to use this you will die and it's just a picture of like a made out word yeah

758
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:32,840
yeah an extension cord and that's what you have in your brain mm-hmm I don't

759
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:37,680
think so I think I think I have no much at all yeah I think I'm normal oh then

760
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,320
yeah then he's right Pina kind of chicken breast in my brain I like I'm

761
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,040
telling him that his brain doesn't work you like I don't think so you don't

762
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:46,040
think at all, pal. Brain doesn't work.

808
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:25,640
don't have here sales because I did the merch table I don't know yeah you were

809
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,320
out there hawking shirts mm-hmm yeah I don't have sales you're acting like a

810
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,960
snake oil salesman he would be like we ran out of large shirts to be like you

811
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,760
can just buy a small it'll fit you that's right he's trying to fuck he's

812
00:47:36,760 --> 00:47:39,640
trying to flip over the fans you're creating it you know that's a funnier

813
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:43,480
world of big fat guys wearing small shirts you know I like it I didn't try

814
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:47,560
with the smalls I know all style shirts I would say it's benevolent all style

815
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,920
shirts run large and then he said I saw him do he did you know the thing that

816
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,720
the Turkish guy does with the ice cream cone mm-hmm he's doing that with the

817
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,800
shirts I was doing that with the shirt really you were doing the Turkish tricks

818
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,760
I was doing the Turkish tricks with the shirt it was it didn't make any sense

819
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,920
because it was a big ice cream cone that the shirt was why were you handing

820
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:09,520
people that on an ice cream cone we saw the t-shirt cone yeah people believed

821
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,240
And people believe me, these stupid fans.

822
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,240
Oh my god.

823
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,560
I have a t-shirt account, okay!

824
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:20,680
I have an extra large "show me the body" shirt that's printed on the same exact shirts, and

825
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:25,520
I don't wear it anymore because it's so long.

826
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,520
That's dope though.

827
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,200
You could cover your knees and you could look like a sweet...

828
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,720
Yeah, we gotta get those shirts on the website soon!

829
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,720
Oh!

830
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,720
I don't want to!

831
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:38,560
I want to go on to shipo.com and print out all the labels.

832
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:40,560
Big shirts are way better than little shirts.

833
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,560
It's always better to wear a shirt that goes down to your knees.

834
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:48,560
I like big long shirts that make me look like I have a dress on and I wear tiny little, tiny little shirts.

835
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
That's the way to go.

836
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:51,560
I like when a shirt and pants fit just right.

837
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,560
You like a perfect fit.

838
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:54,560
Yep.

839
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:55,560
You're weird, baby.

840
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:56,560
See, that's weird.

841
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,560
That's weird.

842
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:58,560
That honestly is not true.

843
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,560
Whoa, look at that spider behind you.

844
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,560
Ah!

845
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:01,560
What?

846
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,560
Ah!

847
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,560
Ah!

848
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,560
Oh my God.

849
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,560
Look at that!

850
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,560
That thing's huge.

851
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,560
That is a brown recluse.

852
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,060
And we're all gonna die.

853
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:10,480
It's just that thing's so fucking big.

854
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,200
It went, it literally, it went down behind you and then you left and it went back up.

855
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:15,800
It was gonna, it literally trying to kill you.

856
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:16,800
Oh my god.

857
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,800
Cameron just saved Caleb.

858
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,320
Honestly, I'm about to have a fucking heart attack.

859
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,320
That thing is crazy.

860
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
Caleb was just saved.

861
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,320
That is incredible.

862
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:24,320
Cameron, thank you.

863
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,320
I slept next to a spider this morning.

864
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,080
Oh look, there's another one right in that corner.

865
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,560
Yeah, I slept next to one this morning.

866
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,880
Great, my desk is basically a fucking spider Hawaii where they go to vacation.

867
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,880
Awesome.

868
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,880
See that spider right there?

869
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:39,240
Dude, we live in a fucking arachnid paradise.

870
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,160
There's a spider right up there.

871
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,320
Well, it's at the cutout.

872
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
What are these things?

873
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,920
They're some kind of eight-legged freaks.

874
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:46,920
These are some kind of...

875
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:47,920
I don't like this.

876
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,680
They're spiders with long legs.

877
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,560
There's some kind of arachnophobia.

878
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,560
My favorite part about that movie title is calling a bug a freak.

879
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
Yeah.

880
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:57,560
It's like, "Ah, it's a...

881
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:58,560
I don't know what it is.

882
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,560
It's a freak."

883
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:00,560
What movie?

884
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,160
A brainless idiot like you would consider a spider a bug.

885
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
What movie?

886
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:05,160
Arachnophobia?

887
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:07,100
Eight Legged Freaks, awesome movie.

888
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,740
Arachnophobia, that movie, bad.

889
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,900
Yeah, what's that?

890
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,740
You can't have--

891
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,060
Brown Bunny, last 10 minutes, good.

892
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,800
It's very funny to me to make a movie that's like,

893
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:19,660
like to make a horror movie about spiders

894
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,620
and all the spiders are normal size.

895
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:22,460
There's no giant spiders.

896
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,740
They have to be giant.

897
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,780
Eight Legged Freaks, they're huge.

898
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,100
Like I watched Arachnophobia and I was like,

899
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:29,960
okay, I'm ready to see some big ass spiders.

900
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,060
The biggest spider in that was probably tarantula size.

901
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:36,900
There's a Jimmy Buffett song in that movie where he sings about spiders.

902
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:37,400
Really?

903
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:37,900
Yeah.

904
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:40,100
It's on the soundtrack at least.

905
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:43,380
I don't remember that much about that movie because I was so angry.

906
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,700
I was giving myself a stroke being angry about a small spider.

907
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:49,020
But I do know the Jimmy Buffett spider song.

908
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:50,620
Try doing in my car.

909
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,120
It literally has...

910
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,980
Eight-legged bug.

911
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:54,300
I don't think it's that.

912
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,660
He got into my pina colada.

913
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:58,160
No.

914
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,260
Eight-legged bug.

915
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:01,320
No.

916
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:05,380
He needs to get out of my pina colada.

917
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,100
It's pretty good, Jimmy Buffet song writing.

918
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:09,620
Yeah.

919
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,500
Eight legged bug.

920
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,660
He needs to get out of my pina colada.

921
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,420
It's an eight legged bug.

922
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:24,980
I hope it doesn't attack me like a thug.

923
00:51:24,980 --> 00:51:31,020
Just that Jimmy Buffet song called eight legged bug is so funny.

924
00:51:31,020 --> 00:51:36,320
turning on the touch tunes,

925
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:44,200
eight legged bug. I don't remember this one. Eight legged bug, eight legged bug,

926
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:48,800
he needs to go away. I really do not like him. And gradually he stops talking

927
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,900
about pina coladas at all and he just sings eight legged bug, so scary,

928
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:00,400
eight legs. Oh, you know what the song is called? What? Don't bug me. Oh,

929
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:07,080
pretty close actually yeah this is I can help you that might be my favorite

930

00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:24,200
- I kind of agree, we need to have like a little music break.

989
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:29,880
we start playing us. Yo, I actually think I just realized what the next big thing

990
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:35,720
is for podcasting. This just came to me. I think you guys are going to like this.

991
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:38,280
I think this might have become a recurring segment. Yeah.

992
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:45,080
Mystery Science Theater 3000 for music. That is a good idea.

993
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:50,760
That's a good idea. That's a good idea, right? Yep. And we can maybe do that

994
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:51,920
every single episode.

995
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,760
- Can we do that?

996
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,440
Can you pull up Soldier Boy, Superman, Dat Ho?

997
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,280
- We don't have a lot of time.

998
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,120
- Crank dat.

999
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,880
- We got three minutes left.

1000
00:55:58,880 --> 00:55:59,720
- Oh man.

1001
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,160
- We have to fill this next three minutes.

1002
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,360
- Your math.

1003
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,200
- Your math is bad.

1004
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,780
- It's 55 minutes, you said we have three minutes left?

1005
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:07,200
- We have to plug something at the end,

1006
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,240
something very important.

1007
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,240
- What do we have to plug?

1008
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,080
- No we don't.

1009
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:11,240
- We got nothing to plug.

1010
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:15,280
- What about the singing contest?

1011
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,160
- We're not gonna plug that yet, that's not going live.

1012
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,160
Dude, you're gonna spoil it.

1013
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,400
I'm gonna have to edit this out now.

1014
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,240
- Great, so now I'm gonna--

1015
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,240
put on soldier boy

1016
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,240

1017
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,240

1018
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,240
he's not gonna do it

1019
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,240
don't worry about it

1020
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,240

1021
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,240

1022
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,240

1023
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,240
which is eight legged bug

1024
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,240

1055
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,800
to do Mystery Science Theater 3000.

1056
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,640

1057
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:06,600
It feels like we're counting down.

1058
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,040
- I know, Patrick really, really--

1059
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,880

1060
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:09,700

00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,920

1066
00:58:25,320 --> 00:58:30,000

1067
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000

Lean to the music box maybe that's what on my base. I'm Craig your music box. That's why the beat sounds so weird

1093
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,640
Yep, sounds just like a music box

01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:18,880

01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:31,440
Also, they don't bathe they pick the flies out of each other. Yep. That's a logical fallacy. Yeah

1098
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:42,480
It's something like that yeah, it was engaging in a logical fallacy

1099

1105
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:27,260
We should do a singing contest. Dude, stop. You need to stop fucking bringing this up.

1106
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:31,860
We're gonna announce it when it's time. All right, I'm ending the episode. We're going to announce it.
