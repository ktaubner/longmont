[laughter]

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Okay, I'm recording right now.

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,200
Okay, I'm recording too.

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,800
- I just did it in a chat. - Have you done a mic test with that new microphone?

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Yeah, no, fuck my fucking...

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,400
- I don't care about your sandwich at all. - ...fucking thing that goes on my sandwich.

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,900
- I really don't give a fuck. - Yeah, no, it doesn't matter.

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,900
No, no, no, seriously, it doesn't matter that the Capicolo

13
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,400
was like the greatest I've ever had.

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,920
That's great man. Hey Pat, did you do a mic test with that new mic?

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,460
I did record me singing "Don't You" by Simple Minds.

16
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:42,460
Just like Dan Ninen does on his SoundCloud.

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,260
That song is by you, dude.

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,960
That's also the only thing that is confirmed to sound good.

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,840
There you go.

20
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,480
Don't you...

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,160
My favorite part of that song is the lyrics that Pat knows.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,160
My favorite part of the song is the lyrics.

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,160
Yeah.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,360
When it comes to songs, one of my favorite parts is lyrics.

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,760
I do remember having, you know...

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,400
I got this skate wax that looks like weed.

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
Because it's green?

28
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
That doesn't look like weed.

29
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,440
No, look, it's got a stem.

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,440
It's got a stem.

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,840
Get your, your, wait, Pat, this is going to be a disaster with Pat holding the mic.

32
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,840
He needs that arm.

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,080
Yeah, I know, I need to get that arm.

34
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
So the fans...

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,080
We need to hire somebody to hold the mic in front of us.

36
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
The fans need to buy it for me.

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,760
Yeah, we all got new mics, except for Cameron.

38
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,760
Mine is coming in the mail.

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,760
Mine's coming in the mail. My mic goes to a different school.

40
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,760
Yeah. You don't have a mic.

41
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,760
You guys are just jealous because I've had a better mic than you this whole time.

42
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:35,760
Not anymore.

43
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,760
I think my mic would be good on the table.

44
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,760
I think it would not.

45
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,760
Absolutely not.

46
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,760
It would not at all.

47
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,760
I think it would sound good.

48
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,760
You're the stupidest guy I've ever met in my life.

49
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,760
I'm not stupid. I'm not actually stupid.

50
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,760
You're really stupid.

51
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,760
I just act stupid to make myself smart.

52
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,760
You just act stupid.

53
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,760
I'm like Jar Jar Binks in that I act stupid and I'm secretly a Sith Lord

54
00:01:54,760 --> 00:02:01,760
lord

55
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:07,520
Oh, cuz he just sits all the time. Yeah. Got him. Yeah. You think that you, oh, that's

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:17,000
funny? That's funny to you? Yeah. That's funny to you? Yes. Alright. Yes. Say it again if

57
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,960
you think it's so funny. He's a sit lord cuz he's always sitting down. You're

58
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:27,440
sitting down right now. I'm not sitting down, I'm standing up. You're not. You're sitting up.

59
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
You're spitting up like a baby.

60
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
I'm standing up right now.

61
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,800
No I'm standing up.

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,480
I'm actually duct taped to the ceiling.

63
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,520
You're a baby and you're spitting up.

64
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,880
Patrick why are you obsessed with babies?

65
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,480
You're obsessed with babies.

66
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,600
Oh really am I?

67
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,680
Who's the one who keeps talking about them pal?

68
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,440
You keep talking about a diaper.

69
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,440
No I don't.

70
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,440
That you're wearing.

71
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,760
Can we just get back to my sandwich please?

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Never.

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,760
Oh my god.

74
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,760
Why do I even do this anymore?

75
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
Alright fine.

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,760
I need water.

77
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,760
I need a drink, it's 80 degrees in this apartment.

78
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,760
Why didn't you get water before we started recording?

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,760
Because you guys didn't let me.

80
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,760
No we did, we said you could go to the store and get an energy drink if you wanted.

81
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,760
And then Cameron said don't do that.

82
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:12,760
I don't care, you can go. I'm the boss, you can go.

83
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,760
I just made myself the boss.

84
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,760
Yeah, I could, I could, if you guys record...

85
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,760
Well let's do a Patrick man on the street thing right now.

86
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,240
If you record my zoom call because I'm on my phone I could go to 7-eleven in the middle of this

87
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll do the extra editing for this. It's worth it. Yeah, wait. No, this is gonna be tough. I know

88
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,240
We should do that at one point

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Let's do it right now.

90
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Come on.

91
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Okay, wait.

92
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Yeah, I can make it work.

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
I can make it work.

94
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,280
The audio quality for this episode is going to get worse.

95
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,600
Unmute your phone and mute that.

96
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,840
I'm literally, all I'm going to do is go to 7-Eleven.

97
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,080
I'm not going to talk to anyone.

98
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
Oh no, you're going to talk.

99
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
No, you have to talk.

100
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,080
You're going to talk to us or else you're not allowed to go.

101
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,640
Then no, then I don't want to do it.

102
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,640
No, come on dude.

103
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,480
Are you afraid to talk into your phone?

104
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,960
I'm not afraid to talk into my phone.

105
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,960
Look at me.

106
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,960
Fucking look at me.

107
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,160
You see somebody like me, that looks like me, walking down the street.

108
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,160
What is that supposed to mean?

109
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,160
People are going to call the police on you?

110
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,160
What are you talking about?

111
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
I was called, dude, I look fucking crazy.

112
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,160
Oh my god, it's a fat guy on the phone.

113
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
No you don't look...

114
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
They're going to call the police on a fat guy on the phone.

115
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
No dude, this fat guy is video chatting with his friends.

116
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
He's talking about skateboard.

117
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
Can you guys send the SWAT team?

118
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
They would do that.

119
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
We need to put this guy in jail immediately.

120
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
He looks too crazy.

121
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
Just go dude, you're going to get caught.

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
You're going to get caught.

123
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
You're going to get caught.

124
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,160
You're going to get caught.

125
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,160
You're going to get caught.

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,160
You're going to get caught.

127
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,160
Can you guys send the SWAT team?

128
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,160
They would like to SWAT us.

129
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,160
We need to put this guy in jail immediately. He looks too crazy.

130
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,160
Just go dude. You're such a baby.

131
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,160
No, I don't want to go anymore.

132
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
This guy's wearing his hat backwards.

133
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,160
Thanks for ruining the episode, Pat.

134
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,160
I didn't ruin the episode.

135
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
You literally just ruined the episode.

136
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,160
We're four minutes in.

137
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,160
Now what are we going to call the episode?

138
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
I can't.

139
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,160
Everybody listen to wear a mask.

140
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,160
You wouldn't hear me.

141
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,440
- You can hear people through the mask.

142
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,880
- Yeah, are you so quiet that you can't talk through a mask?

143
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,400
Patrick's mask is made of steel.

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,040
- I have like a neoprene one.

145
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,880
- You have a what?

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,120
A neal-breen?

147
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,040
- I have a neal-breen one.

148
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,560
- Neo what now?

149
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,620
- Neoprene.

150
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,880
- Go to 7-Eleven.

151
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,080
- Nah.

152
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,000
- You are the worst.

153
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,320
- You should be fun, dude.

154
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,640
- Yeah, you would've done this--

155
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,660
- You should come to my house and drink 50 beers

156
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:38,000
and sit on my head.

157
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
And now you won't even go to the store.

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
- Yeah, now you're afraid. - It's a scary time.

159
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,360
- What happened to you, dude?

160
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,560
- You go to the store every day.

161
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,440
- He goes to the store every,

162
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,480
you threatened to go to the store before we started.

163
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,440
- Yeah, that's true.

164
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,640
- Just go, oh, okay.

165
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,560
This is how you slowly convince Patrick or something.

166
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,720
He says, no, no, no, no, no.

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
And then at some point it clicks and he goes,

168
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,560
yeah, that's true.

169
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,920
And then it turns into, yeah, I guess.

170
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,960
And then he's doing it.

171
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
So we just have to push him over.

172
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,400
(laughing)

173
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,000
have to push him a little bit and then he'll do it.

174
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yeah.

175
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,040
And then he'll bring up, and the reason why he doesn't want to do it is because like his

176
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:19,520
mom did something at one point that taught him a lesson.

177
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,520
Yeah.

178
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:25,440
I don't know, it's just my mom went to the store recently.

179
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,280
My mom actually gave me a moral about that recently.

180
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,280
I was reading a fable.

181
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,960
I was reading Ace of Fables with my mom.

182
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:37,680
My mom and my dad actually recently went to the store on a podcast and it didn't go well.

183
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,200
I had a friend in middle school who actually played video games all the time, so I don't

184
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,200
know if I should do that.

185
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,840
My older brother, my older brother, Beatle, he went to the store one time.

186
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,840
My older brother, Beatle?

187
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,840
Who is he calling Beatle?

188
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
I don't know his name.

189
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,840
No, you have 15 brothers.

190
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,840
I have two brothers.

191
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,840
The oldest one is Beatle.

192
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
You think you have two brothers?

193
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:54,840
The oldest one is Beatle, he's a black lab.

194
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,840
He's a dog.

195
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,840
You have a dog brother?

196
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,840
I have a dog brother.

197
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
I have a dog brother.

198
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
I have a dog brother.

199
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
I have a dog brother.

200
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
I have a dog brother.

201
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,840
I have a dog brother.

202
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,800
I have a dog. Yeah, my dog brother went to the store and they sent him to jail

203
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,160
because of how crazy he looked.

204
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,680
So I can't go to the store.

205
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:19,640
I walked, I walked, I walked to Whole Foods and I got sushi and I came back so

206
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,720
sweaty that I had to like take my shirt off and eat sushi without a shirt on.

207
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,560
Whoa. I was just sitting here.

208
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,800
I am, I am getting out of here soon.

209
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,920
To where exactly?

210
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:45,020
to

211
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,460
'cause I know it's above a restaurant.

212
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,900
He's typing in.

213
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,140
It is, hold up.

214
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,140
I'm not gonna cut it out, so just so you know,

215
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,980
I'm not doing any extra editing.

216
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,540
All right, it is 137 Rockingham Road.

217
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,460
Rockingham, dude, rock and roll.

218
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,820
That is my new address, send all the mail you want to it.

219
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,300
Yeah, go for it.

220
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,260
Oh, that's that same pizza place, isn't it?

221
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,100
No.

222
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,220
No, it's not a pizza place.

223
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,820
It is, it's your pizza place.

224
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:16,100
Once Patrick moves in there, it's going to be a pizza place.

225
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,820
It's a pizza place, as he called it.

226
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:23,940
It's a, it's not, it's going to be a pizza place at the Crossroads Mall.

227
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:27,220
It's going to be at a Comet, it's going to be a Comet style pizza place.

228
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,260
Once Pat gets in there.

229
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,100
Yeah, true.

230
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:35,940
Once Pat moves in, it basically, immediately it is listed on Google Maps as a ping pong pizza restaurant.

231
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,140
They flip the, like, sold sign into Comet ping pong.

232
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,460
- It just, yeah, just big.

233
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,300
(laughing)

234
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,340
- Just turn it over.

235
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,940
(laughing)

236
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,860
- Oh, fuck.

237
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:54,460
Yesterday, somebody asked, I was in the park,

238
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,300
we were walking around the park.

239
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:57,700
I went to Bushwick yesterday for the first time.

240
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:59,180
- Oh yeah, Caleb's in New York.

241
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,020
This is the first Caleb in New York.

242
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,980
- Oh yeah, this is the first, yeah, I guess you're right.

243
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,700
- I'm gonna be living in New Hampshire,

244
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,820
Caleb lives in New York,

245
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,660
and Cameron lives in New York City.

246
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:10,340
- And I'm living in a new state of mind.

247
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,180
- Whoa.

248
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,580
- New baby penis.

249
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,540
- Yeah.

250
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,820
- 'Cause that's what he has.

251
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,660
- Yeah.

252
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,480
- You wish I had that too.

253
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,320
- Cameron, you do have sort of a,

254
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,460
like you cast the same shadow as Chris D'Elia.

255
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,620
- Yeah, similar outline.

256
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,980
- Yeah, he had like the same paper cutout.

257
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:31,020
- Dude, Chris D'Elia fucking, he laughs like.

258
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,100
- He does.

259
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,820
- He's so, oh my God.

260
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,660
- Dude, he laughs.

261
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,580
- There's something about that guy.

262
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,300
- No, but he does not like close his eyes.

263
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,020
His eyes widen when he laughs.

264
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,020
it's fucking scary

265
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
*laughter*

266
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:49,300
is worse his laugh or his penis than what it does? What it craves.

267
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:55,380
Ooh well because he might be laughing while... You think he jokers? I think he might be jokers.

268
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,580
He's a joker? What does a joker's cum face look like? He frowns. He is. The only time he ever frowns.

269
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:11,220
Yeah. How's his face? With teeth. Stop making that face dude. That's like a 2009 vine face.

270
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,620
Yeah, like it's like a will will Sasso face

271
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:17,840
Yeah, you look good

272
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:25,300

00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Crunker. Yeah, it's just like a Call of Duty knockoff, but like in the browser

313
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:41,480
and it's got like Minecraft style graphic. Yeah, dude, it's so fun. So

314
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,840
fun, but

315
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:47,960
for so long we played it for like we played it. We started playing it like

316
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:52,640

318
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,740
headache and then I went to bed and I dreamed about crunker.

319
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,740
No, no dude it's too powerful.

320
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,780
They placed the crunk's curse on me.

321
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:12,040
We need to DDOS this game dude.

322
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Crunker is so fun.

323
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
No we gotta play it.

324
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
We can't DDOS it.

325
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,240
It literally is just call of duty with minecraft style graphics.

326
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,240
We have to destroy it.

327
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,200
It's minecraft graphics and you can control like the gravity and shit so we were playing

328
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,060
like these games where we would only play crossbows and then like jump super high and snipe each

329
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
other.

330
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
It was fucking dope.

331
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
Oh my god, dude.

332
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,060
Yeah.

333
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,060
Dude, it was so sick.

334
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
It was crunked as hell.

335
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,060
It was crunked.

336
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,820
We're trying to buy Cameron a gaming PC.

337
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,620
Oh yeah, so everyone bump up your pledges.

338
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Bump up.

00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,620
100,000 a month.

341
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,860
If we get everybody to do 100 bucks a month, we could each get a new game.

342
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
I could get two gaming PCs.

343
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,820
We'd have like 30.

344
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,820
How much money would that be?

345
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,820
We would be beating pod damn America.

346
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:49,820
We'd have $30.

347
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,820
We would be beating pod damn America.

348
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:52,820
the

349
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:54,820
the

350
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,820
the

351
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,820
the

352
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:00,820
the

353
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,820
the

354
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,820
the

355
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,820
the

356
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
the

357
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
the

358
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,820
the

359
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
the

360
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,820
the

361
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
the

362
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:24,580
I know I know nothing about it. Yeah, it started unnecessary beef so we can get Cameron a gaming PC

363
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:29,460
That's probably that's probably how we do it. Yeah, and you support us in this in this battle

364
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:35,500
Yeah, this battle in this clash of the Titans between pot about list and goddamn America

365
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:40,340
Yeah, that's up that sub. They stole the first word of their name

366
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:47,420
You're so dude, that's why I can't over see that's my camera needs a piece

367
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,780
I know, I should just get to take one of their PCs.

368
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
That's his thing!

369
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,260
I'm the fat one, Caleb's the skinhead looking one, and Cameron's the smart one, and we can

370
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,460
only make fun of Cameron for being too smart.

371
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,620
Yeah, your brain is so powerful that it's actually, it's dumb.

372
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,100
I fucking hate it when Cameron does his telekinesis on me.

373
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,100
I fucking hate it.

374
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
It's so annoying, dude.

375
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,180
I don't do that.

376
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:12,700
When he can learn every pattern of the railway.

377
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:18,420
Dude, it's so annoying when we're watching a movie and he just guesses the entire plot. Yeah before we get it

378
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,820
They believe press play on the DVD, right?

379
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:26,580
So that's fucking annoying you can extrapolate it if you read the back of the box. It's pretty simple annoying

380
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:31,940
It's so annoying when he hears look at the shiny the rainbow part of the DVD. You can just see what happens

381
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:39,700
It's so annoying you have to unfocus your eyes like a magic guy and you can just watch the movie in the back of the DVD

382
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,700
and

383
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:46,340
And then it's a lot harder with a double-layer disc.

384
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,140
You have to cut it in half down the middle.

385
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,140
Exactly.

386
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:54,140
Because then one eye sees in widescreen and the other sees in fullscreen.

387
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,980
I put the DVD on my finger and I spin it around and then I put a long fingernail down onto

388
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:04,460
the grooves in the DVD and it projects it onto the wall out of my eyes.

389
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:09,700
It's so hard for him to do that with laser discs too because the hole is bigger.

390
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,700
Last night, all he has is one big finger.

391
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,700
That's true.

392
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
You forget about my big finger.

393
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,700
That's his smart finger.

394
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
That's his RFID smart finger.

395
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
You couldn't fit enough brain in your head, so you had to put an extra finger.

396
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
You know what's a good place for an extra brain?

397
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Definitely the finger.

398
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
The finger.

399
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Just getting it closed in a car door.

400
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
Just getting an aneurysm.

401
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,700
Last night, I was in the bathroom, and I was like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom."

402
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
I was like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom."

403
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,700
I was like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom."

404
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,700
I was like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom."

405
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
I was like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom."

406
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,700
I was like, "I'm going to go to the bathroom."

407
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,720
Just getting it closed in a car door.

408
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,960
Just getting an aneurysm.

409
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:47,240
Getting a concussion from typing on the computer.

410
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,080
I've been smoking weed again.

411
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,080
It sucks.

412
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,720
You got that NYC kush dude.

413
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,520
Yeah, the famous New York City weed that Nas talks about.

414
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,520
Yeah, it's more like a thin crust.

415
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,520
[Laughter]

416
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,520
In Chicago.

417
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:09,520
Here we call it chopped grass.

418
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
Chopped weed.

419
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Yeah, it's chopped...

420
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Chopped chiba.

421
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
We just call it chopped cheese.

422
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Chopped chiba.

423
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
Chopped chib.

424
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,520
I smoked weed and I was imagining,

425
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,560
you know that conversation of like,

426
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,040
desert island movies, like what's the movie

427
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,680
you take me to, go to desert island?

428
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,920
I couldn't stop imagining like,

429
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,600
somebody asking that question,

430
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,080
and then me showing them that I own a DVD,

431
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,640
like a special edition of some DVD that comes,

432
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,440
it's packaged in a life raft.

433
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,680
(laughing)

434
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:48,800
And it's just like, I just could not,

435
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,520
I was like, well yeah, the special edition

436
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:55,020
Castaway to come to the work of a life raft and a month's supply of food.

437
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:00,020
You got this special edition of Without a Paddle and it comes with...

438
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,020
It comes with a paddle.

439
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,020
It comes with, yeah, it comes with the paddle and the raft.

440
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,020
And Seth Green.

441
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,020
Yeah.

442
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,020
Yeah, Seth Green.

443
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Keep your hopes up.

444
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,020
He's so small.

445
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,020
Mm-hmm.

446
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,020
You guys want to play action figures?

447
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:17,020
But yeah, that's just, you know, the only...

448
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:21,020
That's the only thing that happened this week besides packing things up.

449
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,020
Yeah, I'm buying boxes after this. I'm packing my shit up this week.

450
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,020
Dude, boxes. So expensive, man.

451
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,020
Oh, I know, dude.

452
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,020
You should try making your own, like out of dirt and rocks.

453
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,020
You get like six boxes, it's like 20 bucks.

454
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,020
I know.

455
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
It's fucked up.

456
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,020
If you want to buy like a pallet.

457
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:41,020
Go out to the side of the street, go to the like, the grass.

458
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,020
Go into their dumpster.

459
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:44,020
Go to the dumpster, okay?

460
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Find glass bottles, melt them down, and make glass boxes.

461
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,020
And then you can see what's inside the boxes.

462
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
That's true.

463
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Good idea.

464
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:56,020
I should have saved the box that my PC came in.

465
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,020
That's true.

466
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,020
Yeah, that was a big box.

467
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,020
That's a good way to move it, too.

468
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
Yeah.

469
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:05,020
If you put all of your clothes in glass boxes, and then you put them in the moving truck when you arrive,

470
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,020
you open up the back, and they're all shattered, and your clothes are just filled with glass jars.

471
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:16,340
And then the mover just says to you, "People in glass boxes shouldn't store clothes."

472
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,200
In glass houses.

473
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
That's right.

474
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
Yeah.

475
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,980
Yeah, and you're moving to a glass house also.

476
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:23,980
Yeah.

477
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:28,780
He says, "I'm glass," and then he breaks it open and he increases.

478
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:29,780
I'm made of glass.

479
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:34,060
By the way, yeah, and I'm glass too.

480
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,300
One time when I was moving, when I worked installing shower doors.

481
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,460
- That was your job?

482
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,980
- Yeah, I used to work as a glass shower door installer

483
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,220
for like rich people.

484
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,060
- Damn.

485
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,420
- And yeah, it was awesome.

486
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,860
And one time I was installing--

487
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,940
- One time the stepmom was stuck in the washing machine?

488
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,180
(laughing)

489
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,980
- And then I passed a contract

490
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,700
into the washing machine in a pen.

491
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
And I said, "Read this and then sign."

492
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:12,300
But I was installing a shower door for basically one of the aunts from The Simpsons, Aunt Selma,

493
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
just exactly that lady.

494
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,300
And she was yelling at me, and I fucked her.

495
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Yeah, and I fucked her.

496
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,300
"Caleb, I need you to have sex with me."

497
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:27,300
And then I was bringing the... she was yelling at me the whole time, like, "Don't hit the cat!"

498
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,300
She had a cat that was running around, she was like, "Don't hit the cat! Don't hit the cat!"

499
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:39,300
And then, um, I, I, because I was so distracted, I was like walking up a brick staircase and

500
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:43,620
the corner of the glass shower door, it's tempered glass, but the corner of it hit the

501
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:49,500
stairs and then the entire thing just exploded into a million pieces, like an $800 glass

502
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:56,300
shower door, and all of the glass landed on her cat.

503
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,820
And so, uh, I just, I was just like, we'll, we'll get you another one.

504
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,820
Sorry, bye.

505
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,820
and just left her just picking,

506
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:05,700
picking glass out of the cat's fucking eyes too.

507
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,140
It was awesome.

508
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,180
I miss that job.

509
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,300
It was such, it was so sick.

510
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,780
'Cause it's like, you truly do,

511
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:16,500
like, everybody who gets a glass shower door is rich,

512
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,580
but some of them will like,

513
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,060
tell you like when you show up, like,

514
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,060
"By the way, I will not give you any water.

515
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,380
You cannot use my bathroom."

516
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,460
Like, "I have kids, don't look at them.

517
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,820
Don't play with their toys."

518
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:31,020
And it's just like, what do you want me to do then?

519
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:34,260
Yeah, I'm here to use your house.

520
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,260
Not giving you water? That's so fucking weird.

521
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,200
And again, not letting me play with, you know, the pretend kitchen set and stuff.

522
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,140
Yeah.

523
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,340
Yeah, that sucks.

524
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,000
I just don't get it.

525
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,600
That really sucks. You don't even get to play with the toys?

526
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,600
You don't even get to play with the reek?

527
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
They have a reek action thing?

528
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,280
This one bitch, she put a lock on the trampoline.

529
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,280
What?

530
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,280
I wouldn't jump on it.

531
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,400
And then I had to crack the code to jump on the trampoline.

532
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,280
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

533
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,280
Well, if you just if you just rocket jump, you'd be able to get into it.

534
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,200
That's how I didn't have a rocket launcher.

535
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,560
It's not glass safe.

536
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,840
That's how Caleb's mom used to trick him into stop playing video games.

537
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:17,960
She would just put a put a padlock on top of the just on top of the PlayStation.

538
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,680
Not connected to anything.

539
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,280
And be like, Oh, no, I need to figure out the code.

540
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,880
Mom locked it.

541
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,640
I guess I'll go outside.

542
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:30,080
Yeah, it's just you sitting with the lock off of...

543
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,480
You're sitting away on the couch just trying to unlock it.

544
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
[laughter]

545
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,560
Yeah.

546
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,760
You try to go outside and you see the lock on your door.

547
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:39,960
Oh my god, I'm locked inside.

548
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,440
I'm locked inside forever.

549
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:46,000
What's the code?

550
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,560
You just have to turn the lock.

551
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,600
No, what's the code?

552
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,240
Did you have locks in your house that were like...

553
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,800
Like the door locks where there's no key to them.

554
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,240
The key is just you put a hole...

555
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,160
Like there's a hole and that's how you unlock it.

556
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,000
- I don't know what you're talking about.

557
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,880
- I used to-- - You put a hole in the door

558
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,440
to unlock it? - I'm sorry,

559
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,960
I told you I've been smoking weed, my brain is a box.

560
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,900
There's like a, there's doorknobs where you have like the,

561
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,620
I give up.

562
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,440
(laughing)

563
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
I don't know what I'm even saying.

564
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,720
I don't know where I was going with this.

565
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,240
- You have to put a hole into the doorknob?

566
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,280
- No, there's a hole in the thing and then you put a--

567
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,800
- A key, you mean a keyhole?

568
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,240
- Not a key. - And then you put a key

569
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,080
into it? - A key.

570
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:26,120
Oh, like the door, like the doorknob has a hole, like a small hole in it.

571
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,620
YES!

572
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,840
Yeah, I had those, but we never had the lock thing.

573
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,600
See, I would lock it and then my mom would just unlock the door.

574
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,520
Fucking bitch, dude.

575
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,320
I still don't know what you're talking about.

576
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:43,880
I didn't have like a lock on my door or anything.

577
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:51,960
Anytime, I think, because my bedroom in high school, like my parents just kind of like built,

578
00:24:52,960 --> 00:25:07,840
the

579
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:20,220
the

580
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:30,220
and

581
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:41,100
the

582
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:44,620
I'd go to diners, smoke cigarettes inside.

583
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:48,220
I had sex with old, old women as a child.

584
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,220
That's what you did as a latchkey kid.

585
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,220
I was a latchkey kid.

586
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,340
Yeah, I was pretty much a latchkey kid.

587
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,540
Me and my teacher had sex.

588
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
Yeah.

589
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,540
Yeah.

590
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
It was pretty much a latchkey.

591
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,620
It's pretty much what latchkey kids do all the time.

592
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,700
Yeah, I used to have to make my own PB&Js and sometimes I'd even have to beat my own

593
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
video games.

594
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,540
I was pretty much a latchkey kid.

595
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,620
My parents weren't around much when I was a kid.

596
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,700
They were always working.

597
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:14,940
- Yeah, they were always in the kitchen and the dining room

598
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,500
and I would just be in the living room.

599
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:19,540
So I had a really kind of isolated childhood.

600
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,020
- I had to have a job when I was a kid.

601
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:22,620
I actually had to do this.

602
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,860
I had to unload the silverware.

603
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,660
- I actually had to play with my friends every few days.

604
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,500
- Yeah, every couple of days I had to play with my friends.

605
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,020
One time I cleaned the bathroom, the downstairs bathroom,

606
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,980
and which was always the dirty one

607
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:39,660
because my dad would have his stinky friends over.

608
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:43,020
And so, yeah, I pretty much had the worst childhood ever.

609
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,860
- Yeah. - Yeah.

610
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,760
I basically, on Christmas, instead of gifts,

611
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,140
instead of one gift, I would get multiple gifts

612
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,820
and it was terrible.

613
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,020
I would get-- - Yeah, it was really bad.

614
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,380
- Yeah, I had a really tough childhood,

615
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,740
but it's really helped my career.

616
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,580
- Yeah, it helped my standup career.

617
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,220
- A standup comedian.

618
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,660
- I had a really difficult childhood.

619
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:08,740
You know, my dad, he would drink like a glass of wine

620
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,740
and then go to bed.

621
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,820
- Yeah, it was pretty tough.

622
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:14,820
- Without even saying goodnight to my mom or me.

623
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:17,660
- Yeah, sometimes when there was a big storm,

624
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,220
the power would actually go out of the house.

625
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,460
- Sometimes there would be thunder

626
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,200
and I would have to go under the bed.

627
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,820
- Yeah, sometimes we would get the mail

628
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,300
and there would be bills.

629
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,140
- Yeah, I pretty much went to public school,

630
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,300
and I actually stopped believing in Santa Claus

631
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
when I was in seventh grade, so that's pretty early.

632
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,140
- Yeah.

633
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:36,020
- It kind of like destroyed my life.

634
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:36,860
- One time when I was playing--

635
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,700
- My parents are actually divorced.

636
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:44,340
time I when I was playing tag it started to rain mm-hmm yeah well I had I had the

637
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,780
worst worst childhood one time I played in the mud and they made me take a

638
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:57,740
shower yeah also I got AIDS when I was a kid I got childhood AIDS and I still

639
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,740
the

640
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,740
the

641
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
the

642
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
the

643
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,740
the

644
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,740
the

645
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
the

646
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
the

647
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,740
the

648
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,740
the

649
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
the

650
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
the

651
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:23,740
the

652
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
the

653
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,740
Let's wake you up, dude.

654
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
Go to the store.

655
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,180
No, if I go outside, I'm gonna just start chafing.

656
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,740
I don't want to like...

657
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,740
Let's do it.

658
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,140
That's Patrick's dance move.

659
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,580
Yeah, he's gonna get too excited and start chafing.

660
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,900
I'm gonna start chafing.

661
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,900
I'm gonna start doing the chafe.

662
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:47,300
So when you put one leg behind your head and the other behind that leg, and you roll around

663
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:51,740
like a ball all the way to the store, and he goes with the chafe.

664
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,060
Yeah, I do a Lincoln chafe.

665
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,060
You do a LinkedIn chafe.

666
00:28:55,060 --> 00:29:02,400
the

667
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,400
Jim Webb.

668
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Which is like as soon as he didn't win he was like Trump's the guy.

669
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,400
Was it Jim Webb?

670
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Yeah I think it was Jim Webb.

671
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,400
Yeah it was Jim Webb yeah.

672
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,560
As soon as like he did not, as soon as he had to drop out he was like I'm dropping out

673
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,120
and I'm endorsing Donald Trump.

674
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
So awesome.

675
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:19,080
It's so funny dude.

676
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,240
He's the man.

677
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,160
That Trump video with the white kid chasing the black kid is the most embarrassing.

678
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,760
Oh my god yeah that too.

679
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,560
It's been on my mind.

680
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,480
I think the funniest part is like, I'm sure people have talked about this,

681
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,880
but it's like, what is the message?

682
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,880
Is the message here that like the cops were playing with the protesters and

683
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,400
that's why the protesters are running away? Like what's going on here?

684
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,560
I don't think there's any, I think it's literally just like, I mean,

685
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:48,360
anything that he posts is just like, Oh, that's kind of funny. Like that's,

686
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,920
that is the only thing he thinks of before he posts it.

687
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,960
And most of the time he's very right. You know, I wouldn't post those, uh,

688
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:08,880
the

689
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
Obama with the big boobs.

690
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:22,240
Yeah, or one of the millions of ones that it's like Obama wearing like a headscarf.

691
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,920
I want him to post one of those and just be like, "Is this real?

692
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,920
Hard to say."

693
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,800
Hard to say either way if this is a real photo.

694
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
Can't tell.

695
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
Can't tell.

696
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:43,280
There were these guys back during the Obama election, I think 2012, there were these guys

697
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,640
who would sit at a table outside the post office and they had a big banner with a picture of

698
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:52,440
Obama with a Hitler mustache and it said "Obama is Hitler".

699
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,700
(laughing)

700
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,540
- Would you go back in time--

701
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,640
- I'm just yelling at people.

702
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,760
- Would you go back in time to kill baby Obama?

703
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,060
Well, you'd have to go back in time

704
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,320
and take a plane to Kenya,

705
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,380
but would you do it and kill Obama?

706
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,400
- Would you go back in time and make Obama Hitler?

707
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,220
- Would you go back in time--

708
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,680
- Patrick, stop playing with a blob.

709
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,520
- I'm not.

710
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,680
- He's eating a blob.

711
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,240
- The only playing you're allowed to do

712
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,720
is going to the store.

713
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,440
- Okay.

714
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:24,680
I'm gonna keep harping on that this whole episode.

715
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:25,520
'Cause you, we--

716
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,000
- I might do it, I can do it at the--

717
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,920
- Yeah, I'll bring my gun.

718
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,240
- Yeah.

719
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,440
- Then I have to get all my stuff together.

720
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,280
I don't wanna--

721
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,100
- What kind of stuff?

722
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,320
- He has a store outfit.

723
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,160
- What are you talking about?

724
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,120
- He dresses up in a suit.

725
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
- He goes full hiking gear.

726
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,120
He has a big, tall backpack with a tent in it.

727
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:43,960
He has a compass, a map.

728
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,760
- He has a full Death Stranding outfit.

729
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,960
- Yeah, just in case I get lost.

730
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:49,800
- Yeah.

731
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:56,000
Yeah, look how mad he is. He's so mad. I'm not mad. He's so fucking mad. I'm not mad.

732
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,120
I'm making fun of him for being too much of a baby to go to the store.

733
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:07,480
Hey Patrick, there's a sandwich at the store. It's literally a block away.

734
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:13,560
People, sometimes you got to work for this fucking, you gotta work for that

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,720
Yes!

00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:26,160
Yeah, but I never hit any of the consent buttons.

Oh wait, I don't have my keys.

770
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,840
See, this is why I keep making up excuses.

771
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:34,840
No, no, I do.

772
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,840
I do have my keys.

773
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,840
They're in my back pocket.

774
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,840
I actually...

775
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,840
Wait, wait, I don't have any of my keys.

776
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,840
I don't have any of my keys.

777
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,840
I don't have any of my keys.

778
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
I don't have any legs or feet actually.

779
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,840
Wait I forgot my brain in my eyes.

780
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,840
He's outside. Oh no he froze.

781
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,840
He already froze.

782
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,840
(Laughter)

783
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,840
Oh there he is.

784
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,840
He's back.

785
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,840
Did it work?

786
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,840
How is it so far?

787
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
I had to shut off my wifi.

788
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,840
How's it going?

789
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,840
It's fine.

790
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Is it scary out there?

791
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Yeah it's very scary out here.

792
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,840
Can you give somebody a hearty boo?

793
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,840
A boo?

794
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,840
Boo!

795
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Can you yell at somebody on the street?

796
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:15,360
No, I'm not going to boo. I'm not going to scare anyone.

797
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,360
Sounds like someone is afraid.

798
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,360
Yeah, you're booing yourself right now.

799
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,360
I'm not afraid.

800
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,360
You are.

801
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,360
You're afraid.

802
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,360
He's very afraid to talk in normal volume.

803
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
I'm not.

804
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,360
You should yell.

805
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,360
Can you just give us one QGL?

806
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,360
Can you give us a play by play at least of where you are?

807
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:43,280
We don't want to see you we want to see you're going to see what you see, okay, there you go

808
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,180
Okay, I'm crossing the street. Okay. It's got this

00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:53,520
You're okay

810
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:58,160
No, all right, he's safe you're fine again

811
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,000
He's crossing jaywalking

812
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,840
His video for the gun, I didn't give you enough credit you're a total badass dude. Yeah, this is a pretty cool

824
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,080

Yeah, let's get a conversation going.

I just hear beeping.

832
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,080
At least show us the guy.

833
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:23,080
Actually, I know the guy who works at that.

Don't you dare fucking hold the door open for me. Say what do you think I'm an old man.

839
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,520
What do you say who do you think I am? I'm not doing that. Pat you used to be fun dude.

840
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:47,880
So I don't care. He turned his video off. He cares dude. He turned his video off.

841
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,720
Why did I turn it off? Oh whoops. Yeah it's okay we know we didn't miss anything because you're

843
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:06,600
the train and go somewhere. Just get on the green line and just see where it takes you.

844
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,160
This is awesome. This is the most innovative podcast experience.

845
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,160
Nobody is doing this right now.

846
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,160
Nobody is doing anything like this.

847
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:17,680
Goddamn America isn't doing this, dude. They don't know how to do this.

848
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,680
This is a...

849
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,280
Did I bring my keys? I don't remember.

850
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,280
You said you had your keys before you left.

851
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
That'd be really funny if I got locked out.

852
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I hope you're locked out.

853
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Oh my god.

854
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
What the fuck?

855
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
Woah a construction thing just went by.

00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,280
You just, okay.

857
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,280
I have bad news.

858
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,280
What?

859
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
My audio on Audacity stopped recording.

860
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,280
Alright we'll just use the zoom call for this one.

861
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,280
You're just gonna have to use the zoom call.

862
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,280
This is gonna be a bad audio quality episode.

863
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,280
This is gonna be the worst.

864
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,280
It's all right. It means I don't have to sync anything. That's true.

865
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:58,920
Probably have to sync the first half. I'm sure my cats are fucking destroyed like

866
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,640
walked all over the goddamn keyboard. Yeah, they walked on the keyboard.

867
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:09,480
You almost said destroyed my entire apartment. They probably walked on the keyboard.

868
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:20,840
They, dude last, so I left my, I left my computer open last night and um, I fucking, I made that video.

00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,600
Push that guy! Yeah, knock him over.

870
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:29,320
Push him! Come on, turn around, go back. Come on dude!

871
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:36,280
No! Remember when we used to play the knockout game? Yeah, that was fun. Remember when we used

872
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,680

873
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:54,240

Successful trip to the store.

You guys ruined my life.

They know what it is.

907
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,820
They heard Green Line.

908
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,120
They heard 7-Eleven.

909
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,720
You're going to, you're done for.

910
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,420
Yeah, you're going to jail.

911
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:08,120
Yeah, you're going to have a, you're going to have an Eminem stand situation on your hands.

912
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,620
Yeah.

913
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,720
This sucks.

914
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:14,320
Yo Pat, I wrote you, but you still ain't calling.

915
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,220
It could happen.

916
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,020
It couldn't.

917
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:17,520
It could happen.

918
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,020
It would not happen.

919
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,620
How do you know?

920
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,720
How do you know it wouldn't happen?

921
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
What if Eminem is a huge fan?

922
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,720
Exactly, that's what I'm fucking saying.

923
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:28,480
He's like, "Fuck, I wish there was a way to be crazy about this guy.

924
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,160
Oh wait, I wrote an entire song."

925
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,160
Yeah, I have an idea.

926
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,000
Let me get my hot daughter.

927
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:38,880
Are you re-wrapping a stick of gum? What are you doing?

928
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,360
Yeah, I just decided against it because we're recording something.

929
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,480
Would you rather date Eminem's daughter or have one million dollars?

930
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,560
I would rather date her and then have her and then sell her back to her dad for two years.

931
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,880
Would you rather date Eminem's daughter and get to be friends with him on PS3?

932
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,160
When?

933
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,280
Or be friends with Eminem on PS3 and you don't have to date his daughter?

934
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,720
Would you rather date Eminem or date his daughter?

935
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,720
Hayley.

936
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,720
Um.

937
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,320
I don't know, I think I would choose, that's a tough one.

938
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,920
That is a tough one.

939
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,920
Who would you rather finger?

940
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,920
Eminem or his daughter.

941
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,920
Who would you rather have sit on you?

942
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:29,920
Who would you rather want to watch Parasite with on a stormy day?

943
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,920
Just cuddle up.

944
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,920
Probably Eminem.

945
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,920
You know Eminem could probably do some fun accents or something.

946
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,920
True, in Parasite especially.

947
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,920
Parasite would kill it, dude.

948
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:44,920
He would kill it with the accents on that.

949
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,640
Yeah, I think he can only do like an Indian accent.

950
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Well, doesn't he only do he goes like

951
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,880
"doing doing doing"

952
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:53,880
Yeah, he's

953
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,720
"doing doing doing"

954
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:01,800
That's all he does. Yeah, you're right. I think he also raps but I might be mistaken. No, he didn't no

955
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,360
No

956
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
No

957
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,920
Eminem is famous for saying the "doing doing doing"

958
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,080
Yeah, he does say it

959
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,840
That's it. No that you guys don't understand the doing doing doing is his like rap alter ego

960
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:21,720
Normally is marshall matters, but then he he turns into the doing doing doing. Oh, okay. Marshall doing doing doing

961
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,040
Marshall doing doing doing yeah

962
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:34,600
M&M does that sound familiar are you talking about marshall going from detroit?

963
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:42,760
yet what are you looking at more agency you just completely he's chipping out

964
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,880
you have a child's face what i want to get you look like a kid watching a

965
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,720
picture

966
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,840

970
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,400
what we should never let that go to the story and i think you do whatever he

971
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:19,400
he

972
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,320
I should be able to walk away. You got a monster energy. You love monster energy.

973
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:28,760
You love the store. You love it. And you didn't even do anything funny like look at the trash while you were out.

974
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:31,240
You guys made me do...

975
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,440
Go back out and look at the trash and show us if there's anything cool. Yeah, go to the store again.

976
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:37,320
I don't want to look at the trash. Go outside,

977
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,240
look at the trash and see if you can find some food and if you do, you're gonna eat it.

978
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:47,800
I'm not gonna do that. You do. Oh my god. I'm not doing that. Unlock the door, go outside,

979
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:50,040
Look at the trash, make it your own.

980
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:50,540
[burp]

981
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:54,200
Put one of your cats in the toilet.

982
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,400
Yeah, put a cat in the toilet.

983
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,280
Put a cat in the toilet.

984
00:44:56,280 --> 00:44:57,420
No!

985
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:58,520
Get a swirly.

986
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,400
Okay, two cats.

987
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,800
Can we go back to a normal episode?

988
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,300
No.

989
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:05,080
We're playing virtual buddy with Patrick.

990
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,760
Yeah, I know you are because this is torture.

991
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,200
Yeah, put sand on you.

992
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,960
Put a bunch of dynamite sticks around you and then float across the room.

993
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,080
And also detach your arms and your legs and your head from the body.

994
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:17,400
No.

995
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,400
Give me 1000 coins.

996
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
Be Greg.

997
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,400
No!

998
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,400
Wait, have a George Bush skin on.

999
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Ugh.

1000
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Can I, I'm paying 200 coins for a George Bush skin right now.

1001
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:29,240
I did not have sexual relations with that woman.

1002
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
That's right.

1003
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,240
That's George Bush.

1004
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,240
Yeah, with any woman, coming from you.

1005
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,240
Yeah, oh.

1006
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Ugh.

1007
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,240
Now say, I had sexual relations with him.

1008
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:40,120
We never make Cameron go outside.

1009
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,120
I can't go outside.

1010
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,120
Cameron is allergic to the outside, look at him.

1011
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,120
Yeah.

1012
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:44,120
Yeah, that's true.

1013
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:45,120
If I go outside, I turn into dust.

1014
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,120
He burns up in his skin.

1015
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,520
He turned into a dusty baby.

1016
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:50,520
If he goes outside, he turns into a girl.

1017
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:51,700
Yeah.

1018
00:45:51,700 --> 00:45:53,020
And I've never been outside.

1019
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:55,360
It'd kind of be the ideal situation.

1020
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:59,900
A girl when you're out, a girl on the streets, boy in the sheets.

1021
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,900
Yes!

1022
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:03,580
Girl outside, boy inside.

1023
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,080
Yeah.

1024
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,080
Like beautiful, amazing.

1025
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,080
Like a vampire.

1026
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,580
It's just like a vampire.

1027
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,240
Yeah, vampires are girls when they're outside.

1028
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,680
But when they're inside, the freakish boy comes out.

1029
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,280
You invite them to be a boy.

1030
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,280
Yes.

1031
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,280
Yeah, they can't turn into a boy unless you invite them.

1032
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:23,280
I'm gonna defeat a vampire here in New York.

1033
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,280
People keep getting shot in the head in my neighborhood.

1034
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,280
Patrick, get off Twitter.

1035
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,280
No.

1036
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Oh my god, we made Patrick too mad at us and now he won't talk anymore and he's just browsing Twitter.

1037
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
No, I'm trying to, yeah.

1038
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,280
Patrick is giving us the silent treatment.

1039
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,480
I have sucked the last couple episodes, I will admit.

1040
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,720
- Dude, you're such trash, dude.

1041
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,520
Me, on the other hand, I'm gonna chew some gum now.

1042
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,240
- Do not chew the gum.

1043
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,040
- I can only be the second worst guy on the episode.

1044
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,320
- Don't chew gum.

1045
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,160
- So I'm gonna chew this gum.

1046
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,320
- Do not chew gum.

1047
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:02,120
- I can't wait until the fans call me fat and gay and,

1048
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:05,360
and stuff.

1049
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:07,080
- It's really getting to his head.

1050
00:47:07,080 --> 00:47:09,520
- They call me a fat gay guy all the time.

1051
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,760
- Who calls you fat and gay?

1052
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:11,600
Let's talk about this.

1053
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:12,600
people who call me fat and gay.

1054
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,600
- Give us some names, we'll go after it.

1055
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:14,600
- Give us some names, yeah.

1056
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:15,600
- We'll call them out.

1057
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,600
We're gonna call them out on the podcast.

1058
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,600
- Yeah, I don't wanna give out any names.

1059
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:18,600
- Okay, so you like being called fat and gay then?

1060
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,600
- I don't like being called fat and gay.

1061
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,600
- Okay, so no, call them fat and gay some more.

1062
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,600
- You know who calls you fat and gay, buddy?

1063
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:22,600
The mirror.

1064
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,600
And you gotta get your confidence right

1065
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,600
before you try and comment in podcasts.

1066
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,600
- Mm-mm.

1067
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,600
- You know?

1068
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,600
- Mm.

1069
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,600
- Pat, if anybody calls you fat and gay,

1070
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,600
we'll beat them up online style.

1071
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
- You cannot do that.

1072
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:31,600
- I won't do nothing.

1073
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:32,600
- You can't beat anyone up.

1074
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,640
uh...

1075
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,480

1079
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:52,880
and i think that there's a big normal people who've been there

1080
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:54,480
he's completely clocked out

1081
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,040
look at the use of his watching a movie

1082
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,720
is what i'm not watching is watching a video of toy trains going around a track

1083
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,620
You can see his eyes following the he's watching a video of bugs

1084
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:08,960
Mm-hmm. Yeah, and he's getting hungry walking sticking it. He's like it's like one

1085
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,640
It's like a frog watching a video of an eye on an iPhone of flies

1086
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:20,080
He's trying to look at the screen. Yeah, he's like that video of the monkey with the iPad who just keeps clicking a penis up here

1087
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:25,000
Yeah, you know the peanuts. Oh, you know a penis appears. Oh, we got him. We got him. Yes

the

1098
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,840
the

1099
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,840
the

1100
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,840
the

1101
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,840
the

1102
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,840
the

1103
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,840
the

1104
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,840
the

1105
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:16,840
the

1106
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,840
the

1107
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:20,840
the

1108
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,840
the

1109
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:24,840
the

1110
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:38,760
the

1111
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,920
again in K2 and it's gonna...

1112
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,760
You can't overdose on Kratom, it's from the earth.

1113
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,840
Well, I'm gonna do it.

1114
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,440
I'm gonna figure out how.

1115
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,400
Telling my mom K2 is from the earth.

1116
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,680
Mom, it's good for me.

1117
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,080
Mom, it's from the earth.

1118
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:56,280
You want me to get a C in biology?

1119
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,680
Let me smoke it.

1120
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,840
Mom, seriously, seriously.

1121
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:01,160
It's called a performance enhancing drug.

1122
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:04,600
The reason it's banned is because it makes you better.

1123
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,600
It's banned because the paper industry...

1124
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,240
It's banned because the white man

1125
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,680
doesn't want me to get a C in biology.

1126
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,240
So think about that.

1127
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:15,920
And maybe try some yourself, mom.

1128
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,600
Mom, I just wanna smoke K2

1129
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:23,480
and I wanna listen to Uncle Adams in the basement.

1130
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,160
Is that too much to ask?

1131
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:26,000
Is that too much?

1132
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:27,720
I have a playlist, it's all uncles.

1133
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:31,800
Uncle Cracker, Uncle Adams, and my uncle Matt's band,

1134
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,720
the Matt DeVita Project.

1135
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:34,560
Yeah.

1136
00:50:34,560 --> 00:50:36,840
Oh yeah, the Matt DeVita Project.

1137
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:39,680
And I just want to listen to those three.

1138
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,120
I want to play PlayStation 2.

1139
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,880
I want to play Crash Bandicoot.

1140
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,320
And I want to smoke K2.

1141
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:47,240
So if you can't abide by that, Mom, guess what?

1142
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,560
I'm moving to Dad's house.

1143
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,360
You're going to have to move out.

1144
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,440
Yeah, you're going to have to move in with Dad.

1145
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:52,940
Just--

1146
00:50:52,940 --> 00:50:55,840
Mom, if you keep acting like such a bitch,

1147
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:57,380
and you're going to move in with Dad,

1148
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:00,160
I'm going to live in your bed with your husband.

1149
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:02,280
And he's going to eat my pussy.

1150
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,400
So you might want to let me do what I want.

1151
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,840
That's what happens.

1152
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,680
Yeah, that's what happened with my dad.

1153
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,960
Your dad ate your pussy?

1154
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,320
My dad ate my pussy too.

1155
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,200
Damn. Damn.

1156
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,400
Damn.

1157
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:18,640
Caleb got ate up.

1158
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,320
Yeah, my dad.

1159
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:20,400
Caleb got ate up.

1160
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,120
My dad is my dad is Alf.

1161
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,200
What?

1162
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,720
What?

1163
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,920
My dad is Alf.

1164
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,040
Who?

1165
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,360
He ate my pussy.

1166
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:30,560
Your pussy cat?

1167
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,680
My pussy cat.

1168
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,400
Alf.

1169
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,520
My dad is Alf.

1170
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:35,520
It sounded like you were saying Alf.

1171
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,520
Yeah, I was like, "Who the fuck is Alf?"

1172
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,520
My dad is Alf.

1173
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:41,520
Caleb thinks that's what Alf is named.

1174
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,520
Yeah.

1175
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:43,520
Owlf?

1176
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,520
Owlf.

1177
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,520
Yeah, 'cause he's an owl.

1178
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,520
Yeah, I'm Owlf.

1179
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:48,520
Yeah.

1180
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,520
You guys like Oofle?

1181
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,520
Oofle?

1182
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,520
I love Oofle.

1183
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,520
That's what Caleb thinks Alf is called.

1184
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:54,520
Do you mean Ooby?

1185
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,520
Ooby!

1186
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,520
I think we're talking about Ooby.

1187
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,520
Bro, Ooby's like my favorite guy on TV, man.

1188
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:17,600
the

1189
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:37,720
and

1190
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:51,600
the

1191
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,860
(laughing)

1192
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:55,240
- Yeah, I don't know if we ever talked about this.

1193
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,640
Me and Tim, this guy who sounded like that,

1194
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:00,720
who came to our, he worked with us,

1195
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:01,560
and he would just come in,

1196
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:03,520
and he would just be like,

1197
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,560
yo, Day of the Dead, dude?

1198
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:07,080
Fire, bro.

1199
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,680
And then every once in a while, I'd be like,

1200
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:11,080
Tim and Eric is like the funniest shit

1201
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,200
I've ever seen in my life, bro.

1202
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:13,840
It's like kinda weird sometimes,

1203
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,080
but sometimes I'm like, oh, you guys are cool.

1204
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,360
- Yeah, he-- - He's so awesome.

1205
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,200
He's the best.

1206
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,360
- He was sick, too. - Yeah, dude, he ruled.

1207
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:22,360
We watched all those Hollywood...

1208
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:24,360
We didn't start air control.

1209
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,360
Oh you did?

1210
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:28,360
That was sick.

1211
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,360
We watched that fucking...

1212
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,360
When I came to work with you guys

1213
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:34,360
we watched all those Hollywood High...

1214
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,360
Oh yeah and we watched the video of the guy

1215
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,360
shooting really fast.

1216
00:53:38,360 --> 00:53:40,360
Oh my god dude.

1217
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,360
That video was fucking awesome.

1218
00:53:42,360 --> 00:53:44,360
I'm gonna retweet that right now.

1219
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,360
It's so fucking funny.

1220
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,360
He's just like a...

1221
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:54,120
stoner like skater guy. He's old. He was in like he's like almost 50.

1222
00:53:54,120 --> 00:54:01,080
Yeah, he was in his 40s. He was telling us about like a skater owned bar in LA and we were

1223
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,280
talking about Hollywood High. Then we saw Hollywood High the next day and I'd

1224
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:08,880
never realized it was like the stair set was that big. I think we literally talked

1225
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,480
about this the last time we recorded Pat. I think we talked about this with the

1226
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:28,480
the

1227
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,980
Oh skateboarding, they just, oh dude, skate four.

1228
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:32,420
- Now it's all about inline skating.

1229
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,620
Yeah, I brought this up at the beginning of the episode.

1230
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:35,460
- You did?

1231
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:37,060
- Yes, and you didn't even,

1232
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,180
I couldn't even bait you then.

1233
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:40,380
- Oh, I didn't hear it.

1234
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:41,860
- What do you think of skate four?

1235
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,840
- Dude, I'm excited, but also,

1236
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:51,820
I'm excited, but like not, I'm skeptical.

1237
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:52,860
- Yeah. - 'Cause it's EA.

1238
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,860
- He's skeptical, 'cause he can't count higher than three,

1239
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:58,860
So he's skeptical about whether they picked the right number.

1240
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:00,860
He thinks they invented a number.

1241
00:55:00,860 --> 00:55:04,200
See, I think they're just going to call it skate again.

1242
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,380
I think it's going to be S-K-4-T-E.

1243
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,380
Oh!

1244
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:16,500
I think it's going to be 5K 4+3-B-O-O-B-S.

1245
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:18,500
Skate boobs.

1246
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,500
Yeah.

1247
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,220
That would be the greatest video game of all time.

1248
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,220
That's an $80 game new again. Yeah

1249
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:29,940
Rated AO

1250
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:32,380
Why

1251
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:39,220
It comes with a Donkey Kong Bongo style set of boobs that you play with yeah

1252
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:46,860
You play it with it with a race car steering wheel to play skate boobs. Mm-hmm. Yeah, and you have to turn

1253
00:55:46,860 --> 00:55:49,500
Yeah

1254
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,060
Yeah, and you play this awesome skater named Dale Earnhardt Jr.

1255
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:59,100
Dale Earnhardt Sr. and he's like, "Just remember to turn left, that's all."

1256
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:04,940
That was one thing that people don't acknowledge about Dale Earnhardt is that he just got confused,

1257
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,940
left and right.

1258
00:56:05,940 --> 00:56:09,140
Sometimes he'd get confused in the kitchen and he just forgot.

1259
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,140
No, he went to the bathroom.

1260
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:11,140
He went to the bathroom.

1261
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:12,140
He just forgot.

1262
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,140
He just forgot.

1263
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,140
He just forgot.

1264
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:15,140
He just forgot.

1265
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:16,140
He just forgot.

1266
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,140
He just forgot.

1267
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,140
He just forgot.

1268
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:19,140
He just forgot.

1269
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,140
He just forgot.

1270
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,840
No, he went camera left. That's the problem.

1271
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:29,940
Yeah, he was also, he had recently starred in a local theater production as Seymour in Little Shop of Horrors.

1272
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:33,640
And so he learned the term stage left and stage right.

1273
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:36,440
Yeah, and somebody said left and he was like, oh, stage left.

1274
00:56:36,440 --> 00:56:39,140
Yeah, he's a performer at heart.

1275
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:43,140
Yeah, and he, yeah, and the boy was at a finale.

1276
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,340
Yeah, he went out with a finale.

1277
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,340
Yeah, he went out with a finale.

1278
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,740
Yeah, he went out with a finale.

1279
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:51,300
He went out with an ending.

1280
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,780
Yeah, just the worst news anchorman ever.

1281
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:58,740
Yeah. And Dale Earnhardt, he went out with an finale.

1282
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,780
Yeah.

1283
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,980
And the tragic story of Dale Earnhardt,

1284
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,680
the tragic story of Dale Earnhardt unfortunately ended with the end.

1285
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:12,480
Yeah. My name is Pussy Impossible.

1286
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,800
This is Channel 5 News.

1287
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:16,600
Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

1288
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,580
Yeah, it's the morning news and he

1289
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,580
says good night.

1290
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,880
That's right.

1291
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,500
And then they're just like, oh, I

1292
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,720
guess we have to turn off the I

1293
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,100

1294
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,800
night. We have to turn the channel.

1295
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,560
Pack everything up, I guess.

1296
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,520
Yeah. And then he says he says

1297
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:32,520
San Diego means

1298
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,520
a whale's vagina.

1299
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:36,840
And I'm Todd Burgundy.

1300
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:39,880
Yeah, I'm red Burgundy

1301
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:44,200

Suck my dick, bitch.

Back to you with the weather, idiot.

1333
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,000
Stupid bitch.

1334
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,120
You stupid sucker.

1335
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,160
Good morning, Arizona.

1336
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:26,520
You're gay and I'm your dad.

1337
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,840
You're gay, I'm your dad, and you're the news today.

1338
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,800
And you're the news, hey,

00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,920
how 'bout you tell me some news, you pussy?

1340
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,600
Here's a piece of news, shut the fuck up.

1341
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,320
Here's my news, ready?

1342
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:41,360
(high pitched squealing)

1343
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:47,040
And now I'm gonna reenact an entire episode from the second season of Workaholics.

1344
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,840
Alright, and go.

1345
00:58:48,840 --> 00:58:49,960
Hi, what's up?

1346
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:50,960
I'm Topher!

1347
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,840
The real Topher Grace.

1348
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,680
The real, no, he turned out to be real Topher.

1349
00:58:58,680 --> 00:58:59,680
Yeah.

1350
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:00,680
The real Topher.

1351
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,680
Topher da Toker.

1352
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,200
No, Chris D'Elia played Topher on Workaholics and he was a pedophile.

1353
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,200
A pedophile.

1354
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,720
Ah, ah, turns out Crystal Lee is a pedophile.

1355
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,720
Can't have that.

1356
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:16,720
No.

1357
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,720
No.

1358
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:18,720
No.

1359
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:19,720
We can't have that.

1360
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:22,800
Oh no, Crystal Lee is a pedophile.

1361
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,120
We can't have that.

1362
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:29,240
Crystal Lee is kind of like the white male of pedophiles.

1363
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,560
The straight white male of pedophiles.

1364
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:33,560
Norse.

1365
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:37,560
Yeah, and everyone in the audience claps and like, I guess that's correct.

1366
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,560
Yeah!

1367
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:39,560
*laughter*

1368
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:41,000
That's a good point.

1369
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,360
That's a good point, Nanette.

1370
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:44,220
Yeah.

1371
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,320
You've done it again, Nanette?

1372
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,320
*laughter*

1373
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:47,960
Nanette?

1374
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,100
Good one.

1375
00:59:49,100 --> 00:59:51,840
Ah, crikey Nanette, you've done it again!

1376
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:56,120
Another amazing fuckin' stand-up special, Nanette!

1377
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,360
I can't believe you're dunked from half-court like that!

1378
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:02,400
You're beautiful on the inside, love.

1379
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,600
*laughter*

1380
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,480
I'm Nanette.

1381
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,240
Outside, you fatter shit.

1382
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,240
the

1383
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:17,240
the

1384
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,240
the

1385
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,240
the

1386
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,240
the

1387
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:25,240
the

1388
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,240
the

1389
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,240
the

1390
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,240
the

1391
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,240
the

1392
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,240
the

1393
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:37,240
the

1394
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:39,240
the

1395
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,240
the

1396
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:43,240
the

1397
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:45,240
the

1398
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:50,240
Yeah, I watched that in 5th grade.

1399
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,240
It scared the shit out of me.

1400
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,520
there's a point where they're like,

1401
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:55,600
the document is like,

1402
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:59,960
and they had a CIA handler whose name was Maxwell.

1403
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,840
As we see in this song, when we play it backwards,

1404
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:05,540
they have a strong message to send to him.

1405
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:07,480
And it's like yellow submarine or something.

1406
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,600
If you play it backwards, it goes like,

1407
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,920
fuck you, Maxwell.

1408
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:13,200
(laughing)

1409
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,020
And they're like,

1410
01:01:14,020 --> 01:01:17,360
obviously this means the CIA handler's name was Maxwell.

1411
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:18,200
(laughing)

1412
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:19,040
And not even,

1413
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:19,860
fuck you, Maxwell.

1414
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:24,660
Not even like considering like the Maxwell silver hammer. Yeah. Yeah

1415
01:01:24,660 --> 01:01:27,780
Q Maxwell fuck you Maxwell

1416
01:01:27,780 --> 01:01:33,460
All right, yeah, we're done see where yeah

1417
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:39,740
Habit Pat's happy I could do another two hours. I could all right second. I'm gonna stop recording

1418
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:43,520

1419
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:45,520
