1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,600
Hello, everybody. Today we're having a dnd episode with no randomness at all.

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:16,960
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, wait, do the chimes on random chimes be like random chiming

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,520
cheese potato. Okay, we got out of our system. We're ready to go. No randomness

4
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:29,080
the entire episode. Okay, well, very soon we'll be no randomness random air horn

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:33,520
and I'm a horn. Damn, damn,

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:40,160
I wish we had an AI voice that could do random dancing for different. Okay,

7
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,400
yeah, we're just doing a podcast over patches. I watched I watched Patrick

8
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
turn it into just a regular conversation.

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:53,560
All right, last time on the diaper network, Tron. Why are we like so close

10
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:57,520
together this one? Because there's four of us because I didn't move the table

11
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,380
still needs to be yeah, but

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,460
isn't he usually off and then Cameron has a new hat. There we go. I want to

13
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,020
change up my character a little bit. I don't like being the same guy every

14
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:11,420
damn time. That's fair. I was talking about a werewolf. What happened last

15
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,620
time? A milk man to what happened? Well, we'll find out what happened last time

16
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,580
on the diaper network. Tron Mark Eduardo and the finger bros twins continued

17
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,740
their journey into the

18
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,940
diaper network source code.

19
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,620
A reminder of the setup, mostly for you guys here. I mean, for the people

20
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:37,620
listening, but you know, they can... time is different for them because of the

21
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:42,060
episode, how that works. While the three were on trial, so while you three were on

22
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:48,140
trial for a three-way courtroom battle, that's what I wrote, over the creation of

23
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:54,820
the Diaper Network, you guys decided to settle who created the website, the Diaper

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:01,180
network once and for all with a court-ordered code-a-thon.

25
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,460
Suddenly, though, before the code-a-thon

26
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,060
could even get underway, you guys were sucked into a computer

27
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,460
by FieldCompletely, a program that controls the diaper

28
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,620
network.

29
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,440
Now you must fight your way out by performing

30
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,340
an overly elaborate series of tasks

31
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:18,300
to destroy FieldCompletely and ensure that there

32
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,380
are zero redundancies.

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,500
So two sessions ago--

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,540
this is going to be brief.

35
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,580
So two sessions ago, you guys broke out of the Play Play Games prison

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:30,980
with fellow prisoner Joe Music 1976,

37
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,860
a member of an elite group of Diaper Network power users who were sucked

38
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,900
into the system before you guys,

39
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:43,340
before you guys were when Phil completely was testing his new user

40
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,980
sucking software.

41
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,820
You then killed Joe and stole his ship, the SS Nappy,

42
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,740
and rode the wedding way to the Tinkle Lair.

43
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:00,140
That's right. I remember that there you souped up your bikes with a very high

44
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,080
intelligence role

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,780
turn into hover bikes

46
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,940
all right

47
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,280
easily gliding above the shimmery, but sallow sea.

48
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,880
Why don't you do the chimes? This is shimmery. Oh, shimmering. Well,

49
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,040
shimmering is not really kind of a key word in my brain to but yeah, I guess

50
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,000
don't shimmer yeah, but I that was a good size should have picked up on that. I

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,700
was kind of just thinking about yeah, how about you other take care of the

52
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:27,760
sounds badges? How about that

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:34,020
asshole? So you guys glided over the sea, oops reaching the I was a mistake

54
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:37,840
y'all and you found the emergency mass communication tower, emergency mass

55
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,860
communication tower. It was going to allow you guys to communicate with

56
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:45,540
outside people outside the computer to give you a hash in slow motion and we

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:49,540
did right. Yes, you did and well here's before you did that with that time

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,840
ramping really didn't make that much sense to me. It didn't make sense in Tron either,

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:04:01,120
so I got nothing for you there. That's fair. So when you reached there, you ran into Joe

60
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:09,880
Music 1976's leaky legends comrade. We sent him away. Sissybaby34. I'm remembering. Who

61
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:15,660
suspected you guys of killing his comrade Joe Music 1976. Completely baseless accusation.

62
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:20,780
you guys told him you killed him. Well it was false. After disposing of him and a cross-eyed

63
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:28,500
fliper you entered the tower. Thank you and met with a Dylan program. Dylan being the

64
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:34,060
guy who helped fund and jumpstart Zuckerberg's. You don't gotta intro Dylan man. Sorry yeah

65
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:40,020
sorry. Everybody here knows Dylan. That program of Dylan who was created helped use the emergency

66
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,140
mass communication tower to communicate with the bailiff in the courtroom who sent the hash

67
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,380
hashed code into the computer and you guys now have it, which by the way,

68
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,140
which one of you has the hashed code? I think I think I think you do to pretty

69
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:56,740
sure because you tried to I wasn't sure because he because we tried you to the

70
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,340
thing he went into the world. Yeah, I figured it was you who the world yes,

71
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:05,660
and he was doing mischief. Afterwards, you visited the leaky legends HQ

72
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,180
through the damp layer. That's the second level of the diaper network source

73
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,500
code. You smooth talked your way into being allies with them and fought

74
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,760
alongside them to enter into the PVN launcher. It's a private virtual network

75
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:23,600
launcher, which sends you guys up to the private virtual network through the

76
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,840
Stinky Cloud. You have a new friend, Forst, who is a Diaper Talk power user and now

77
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,520
a member of the Leaky Legends. Forst is his real username.

78
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,120
- Wow.

79
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:41,160
- And he joined you and he flew with you guys through the Stinky Cloud on the PVN.

80
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,360
Now he is stationed there, ready to, the second you guys kill with the hashed code, filled

81
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,720
completely, he will on his end, enact, destroy the redundancy of, of, of, of, uh, filled

82
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:03,720
completely in that brief gap where there is no one to oversee that kind of like regeneration

83
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,600
of like, you know, standing up another, basically another network.

84
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,280
Well, let's hop to it, man.

85
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,200
I want to get out of this computer for the rest of my life.

86
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:18,280
So you guys are now in Soaked City, where Warm Feeling and the rest of the Leaky Legends

87
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,720
told you he'd meet you guys here.

88
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:32,320
So in Soaked City, it's a simulation of the kind of the world that Phil completely wants

89
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,320
to create.

90
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,280
it's got where, like the tinkle layer was yellow and the damp layer was brown

91
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,280
and dark and damp.

92
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:44,860
The the soaked city is bluey blues everywhere. You see

93
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,220
lots of clean water rubber duckies rubber duck. Yes, rubber duckies like in

94
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:53,900
the water, I guess. How do you know that I fucking guess and there's it's all

95
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:59,440
it's sort of it's the Venice of the Internet. You can ride on gondolas that

96
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,840
not is it still here? It is still diapered out. Okay, so that what it is

97
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:08,120
is it's a simulation of the world he wants to create. So you're gonna hear

98
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:12,360
from a lot of different members of the diaper talk community,

99
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,560
all different creeds. Yeah,

100
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,280
who are living in here as if they're in a city. It's a simulation of

101
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,640
their accounts basically being manifest here. So they are it's them interacting

102
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,480
on the forums, but it being represented. What's the dominant religion in soaked

103
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:34,080
city. Probably atheism is a theist. I was trying to come with funny. I think it's

104
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,880
Shinto atheism Shinto. I think they believe all the diapers and poops have

105
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:41,280
spirits and they have to make offerings to them that to make offerings to the

106
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,280
diaper. I will say that so the thing is is now you're closer and closer to

107
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,980
filled completely. So, you know, you have to just be smart, you know, you can't make

108
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:57,100
too much noise to my you know what have been a good character name is hash

109
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:00,540
brown. So you can't we can't make too much noise and we need to be kind of

110
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:04,060
low key. Yeah. So should we be like maybe we could do disguises? Yes, you

111
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,580
can. I'm already wearing my disguise. I'll disguise myself as a one man band.

112
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,940
I'm disguised. I'm a werewolf. I'm disguised as a milkman.

113
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,620
I'm carrying bottles of milk. I'm disguised as a horse, but I don't have

114
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,300
the costume.

115
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,580
So it's a one man band, a horse and

116
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,900
do your heads in your brother's my brother's head is in my butt yeah

117
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,660
yeah and I yeah

118
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:32,660
we're trying to be incognito. That's fine. That's that is very not on every

119
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:32,940
door

120
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:39,460
you get a

121
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:44,080
I'm knocking on everybody's door and ringing everybody's doorbells. Well

122
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,140
yeah, you got to deliver milk. You have milk with you yeah milk. Well, he's

123
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,900
got to explain to them that I have some of the milk. You can't have any of the

124
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:55,140
no, it goes to houses. You know, okay, you don't go to the mailman and say,

125
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,700
can I have some of that mail? You guys are wait to actually saw a lady try to

126
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:01,240
do that the other day and the mail man always want to do it. The mail man had

127
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,280
to say legally I cannot give you the mail, not through the mailbox, and she

128
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:09,140
was like that makes sense. Yeah, I always think about doing so you guys

129
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,860
entered in through the

130
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:16,700
adult baby. I'm sorry, an adult baby introductions for him. Okay, so when

131
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,440
knocking on people's door. I go into some knock on the one that says how to make

132
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,800
friends. Yeah, I knocked on that one for sure. Cool. So when you open when you

133
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,720
knock on the door, you see a cow, an anthropomorphic cow. It says moves quick

134
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,120
guide to making friends on the diaper talk network. Fill out your profile as

135
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,720
many fields as you possibly can. The more if in this this by the way goes on

136
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,760
for the as explains the entire I go up to the cow and I start naying at it and I

137
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I try to speak to it in barnyard. Okay, you are blocked. It is blocked from

138
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,060
from the

139
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,700
so I say okay, I'll start filling up my profile occupation, milk man, species,

140
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,640
wolf man name,

141
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:05,200
milk wolf. I try to type everything in, but my hooves make it impossible. You

142
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,520
don't have who's well. I'm pretending that I have

143
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,840
pretending it's a possible. I'm doing this. I'm just going

144
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:19,080
I my setting my name to one man band with a one tan hand because I put my hand in

145
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,160
my diaper and got poop on it. You got one man band with... Your poop is tan? Is what fit?

146
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:28,720
Well, maybe your one hand is tan your other one is dark brown with yellow and

147
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,360
green flecks. No, it tanned my hand with poop. So I left it in there for so long.

148
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:38,160
One man band with... With a one hand tan. No, that's it couldn't fit. One hand band wit.

149
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:45,160
I somehow type in Hashbrown.

150
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,160
And your name is Milkwolf?

151
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,160
Mr. Milkwolf.

152
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
Mr. Milkwolf, okay cool.

153
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
Mr. E. Milkwolf.

154
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Yeah.

155
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,160
At an absolute minimum, you must have an avatar set on your profile.

156
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,160
This is required to get to EC status, which lets you message people.

157
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Lena Dunham.

158
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I want to do a photo shoot with y'all.

159
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
Yeah, I also pick Lena Dunham.

160
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:14,720
This is kind of a barnyard animal. Mine I put my phone on the ground and I stand over it.

161
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,680
I love doing that. I set it on self-timer and I put it screened down too so I can get

162
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:28,800
the really wide angle and I said turn the flash on of course and I go in and I'm putting

163
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,800
the exposure up. That would be a really scary photo of a werewolf. Put the brightness down.

164
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,680
I'm telling you, I'm sharpness. Oh, no, don't deep fry that

165
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:42,160
saturation way of God. I'm putting on the tilt shift and a vignette. This

166
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,080
shit is actually okay. Wait, I put on the I put my phone on the

167
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,640
on like a thing and then I put the horse filter on and I stand

168
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,360
on all force

169
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,840
the horse and your name is hash brown and my name is hash brown.

170
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,040
Okay, and you're Lena Dunham, right? Yeah, but you can't even tell because

171
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,340
have so many instruments in front of me. It doesn't I picked it because I just

172
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,440
feel like she could carry a lot. See a combination between her and her ex

173
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,200
husband, so post post. She's got shoulders built for shopping bags man.

174
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,900
She built like a rescue hero.

175
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:18,940
She carried two batches of groceries in one trip. No perfect housewife and one

176
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:23,240
day she'll be Costco come back, put all the bags on your shoulder, drive back to

177
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,700
all the beer that that shopping again open up.

178
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,860
What are you

179
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,020
that's a horrible. That's awfully misogynistic. What the heck we don't

180
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:36,720
engage with that kind of conversation. It's got to be me. She's a artistic

181
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,060
genius. I just

182
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:43,300
you're disgusting. Can get her heart broken. Posted introduction, which is

183
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,940
more information about who you are, your likes, interests, etcetera. Show us how

184
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,140
interesting you can be. Tell an interesting story about yourself. You're

185
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:57,220
trying to portray yourself as a person who is likable. I want to hide. Oh, go

186
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,800
good. Let's say our story in your character in your care.

187
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:08,380
What's a character? One time I was eating hay and

188
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:13,660
it tasted good because I got the finger bros twins. Well, we're trying to be

189
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:13,860
the

190
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:19,860
you and have your voice in the horse. One time I was trying. I was a little

191
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:24,300
higher than I tasted good. Meanwhile, okay, now lean it on a one time. I was

192
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,700
hey and it tastes so good. You I delivered milk to a whole family. Okay,

193
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,060
mine is a bunch of will. I watched the whole. I watched the whole family drink

194
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:40,640
my milk. That's mine. My I was milked. Mine is all will. I was built for the

195
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,940
book. If you ain't first, you're last. I like you, but you're crazy.

196
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:50,300
What else man? My I feel this down in my plum. They're all they're all will

197
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,460
feral quotes, but they're only from kicking and screaming more cowbell and

198
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,160
and at the end I know the pieces fit.

199
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,160
- All right, cool. - Damn.

200
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,260
I chaperoned a field trip to my house.

201
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,420
- That's Moo's quick guide to making friends.

202
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:04,300
Moo is a staff member of the website.

203
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,740
- So I leave the milk on the doorstep and I close the door.

204
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,820
- Simple as.

205
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,660
- Cool. - Easy.

206
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,380
- So now you guys are now registering the site.

and I just realized I made my name mystery milk wolf because I said Mr.

213
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:29,580
E. I didn't even realize I did that's a mystery milk. Well, I made myself a

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,860
horse. Yeah, so you guys receive a message on your in your I just realized

and he shows you a little map of you have to kind of ride the waterways

218
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,580
through a number of

219
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,780
discussions

220
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:55,880
and threads to get on doesn't make that noise. So like bubbles, I've been I'm

221
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,540
trying to be a moral vigilance. These gondolas are the I was supposed to chime

222
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,640
these gondolas. I appreciate it. Thank you. These gondolas are all big. They're

223
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:08,940
all big rubber duckies, little diapers on them and they're piloted by programs

224
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:09,380
that

225
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,180
oops

226
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,980
he made he made me say we made me a robot

227
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,980
accident. Is that everyone? A complete accident. I swear to God it was that time for real.

228
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:26,340
Okay. The time when I said hamburger I'm going to come clean, that was on purpose. But that

229
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,700
one was a real accident. Alright, well let's get on one of those gondolas. Let's go, let's

230
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:33,940
go, let's go. So you guys get on one of the rubber ducky gondolas. Oh, very nice. Where

231
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:42,940
did you find that? You gave it to me. Probably for this. Whoa. What happened? What happened

232
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:50,780
What happened? I don't know if I that wasn't smart. I don't remember what

233
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:55,260
that is. It's called Tsunami W, the master shoot on me.

234
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,780
That's crazy. It had a little thing in it anyway. Sorry, I'm sorry to do I was

235
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,060
trying to

236
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,260
you did a great job yeah. I just for some reason, very happy,

237
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:11,260
so yeah this these programs, you know, collect and send user data,

238
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:15,420
So they are piloting the rubber ducky for you guys.

239
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,420
But it's important to maintain your disguises while you're in these things

240
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,420
because of the fact that their whole thing is about scanning, understanding user data.

241
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:27,420
So if it's flagged that you guys are one of the three humans who are in here

242
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,420
besides the Leaky Legends, right?

243
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,420
I asked for an apple.

244
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,420
The program goes, "Sure, I will give you"-- I'm a robot voice.

245
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:41,420
I can give you a robot voice. You just have to give me one second here.

246
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:46,020
I just have to switch it to what are you to yeah, no, I'm four years old.

247
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,820
You're four.

248
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,520
Who's who's who?

249
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,220
I'm four.

250
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,220
I'm four.

251
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,320
Yeah, I'm four.

252
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,520
I thought I was four.

253
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,120
There I go.

254
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:55,620
There we go.

255
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:55,820
Wait.

256
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,020
Now I'm wait.

257
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,720
What the fuck are you permanently a robot now?

258
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,320
What can't be saved?

259
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
Take glaze on through it.

260
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,720
I don't know how it's not supposed to be happening.

261
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,220
No way.

262
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:07,920
I'm not back.

263
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,320
Okay.

264
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,520
What do you want me to say?

265
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,820
man. I'll say what the fuck is going on. Is this going to be? Oh, no, am I stuck

266
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:14,660
as a whatever

267
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:19,180
not a big deal. Okay,

268
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,060
can you just I what did you ask again? What do you want me to say? I asked for

269
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,700
an apple.

270
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:30,500
Yes, you can have an apple

271
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:34,080
affirmative apple

272
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,600
required. I'm there we go. Oh my God,

273
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,400
being a human, that was the first time that we've ever had a glitch on it. We

274
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,240
made you a permanent rope. I was really fucking scared. I'm not I was scared to

275
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,560
was going to ruin the episode. I was fucking scared that I was straight up

276
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,920
scared of shit dude. I had to turn on a different robot effect and then turn it

277
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:00,120
back. Okay, well thank God you figured yeah. Well, do you mind? Can you try

278
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,600
again? There we go.

279
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,600
Caleb say something

280
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
I have an apple.

281
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:12,000
All that. All that was worth it. There'll be other times for robot voices.

282
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,200
I asked for a carrot now. I got to get the, you know,

283
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,800
no, we do not have carrots. Okay.

284
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,480
My goal is to go to the other side of the world and deliver milk to a tribe

285
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,600
that never discovered it.

286
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,200
You tell it you tell him that yeah,

287
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
that sounds great.

288
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
And I like I'm playing

289
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,500

290
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,340

00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,160

300
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,900
you hear the music playing as you're doing it,

301
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,140
as the one man band playing,

302
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:58,060
and you reach the first forum,

303
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,460
the adult baby forum.

304
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:06,460
So did someone actually get caught?

305
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,560
Were some people here actually caught in a diaper with a pacifier or anything

306
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,960
else ABDL related? What was the reaction?

307
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,860
How did your relationship develop from that point?

308
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,360
We have to answer this?

309
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,760
You guys can answer this and then I got some other answers for you.

310
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:24,960
Oh, I thought that we had to like, yeah, it's being discussed.

311
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
It's being discussed.

312
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,560
Okay.

313
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:26,960
Yeah.

314
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,200
Um, yes, that shit happened to me at one of my one of my sold out Madison Square

315
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,340
Garden one man band shows. I was painting my house and I was wearing only a

316
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:40,480
diaper so I didn't get stains on any of my cool sweatshirts or my sweat pants.

317
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,840
I'm a horse. You're a whore. So pretty much everyone in my life knows my

318
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,360
co workers, my family, my friends. I'm an out of diaper boy. It's been really

319
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,000
interesting. And after the initial seriously, it didn't really change

320
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,300
change anything. No one treats me differently. No one is weird. I didn't

321
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:03,640
lose any friends. It's been a complete non issue. I expected more pushback.

322
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:07,440
L. O. L. All I got was the opportunity to be myself and not stress about

323
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,720
wearing a diaper cap. Your friends all hate you. I reply. I reply with a cap

324
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,800
emoji. Your friends and family all despise

325
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:19,080
thanksgiving is weird at your house. I reply with a reverse emoji and a shoe

326
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:24,640
emoji. You guys keep going along to the best pacifiers for thumb suckers.

327
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,140
How does orthodontic sizing work?

328
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:33,080
That's a good question. Tell you as a milk man, I would have no expertise in

329
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:36,960
that. I have no expertise on anything human related because I'm a horse.

330
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,600
Passifier wouldn't fit no mouth. How about a pacifier shaped like a thumb? I

331
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,760
you have a that's a good idea.

332
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,520
You replied that's a good idea. I replied that's a good idea.

333
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,600
I reply I have no room for a pacifier because of the harmonica and then a

334
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,500
photo of me performing in front of another sold out show. I reply, I reply,

335
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:04,560
"Any y'all want some milk?" And then I reply to Caleb and I say, "I post a

336
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,680
picture where I have a bunch of bottles of milk laid out in a bed.

337
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,560
I got milk, anyone buy a milk? Anyone want milk?" And you immediately get 10,000

338
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,200
DMs of people like, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes,

339
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,080
yes, yes, yes." I reply to Caleb's post and I say, "What about

340
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,280
harmonica pacifier. That's a good idea. Maybe I'll pull that out the next time

341
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm performing at the Greek to a completely sold-out audience. You see a

342
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:30,920
one that's about... How the snow? About what what kind of wetness that they like and

343
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:34,320
you see one person says, "I like it when it's wet enough to make it harder to

344
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,520
walk. I literally can't sleep unless I am somewhat wet. I usually pee my diaper

345
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,640
before bed. I'm going commando on a puppy pad because after all this hot weather I

346
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,740
why I have a diaper rash

347
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:51,080
that's sad on the ground diaper to Justin says probably eating nothing but

348
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,540
baby food for two days straight, then wedding and messing my diaper is

349
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,220
sleeping in it. I reply with a photo of my teeth,

350
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,420
my gnarled horse to

351
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,960
close up

352
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,420
mine swinging like a pendulum and it's making me waddle when I walk. Oh, the

353
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:20,040
diaper is I thought I just love how squidgy it is when I sit down heart,

354
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:26,420
heart, tear to your heart, heart, baby sign, thumbs up, baby sign. There's a

355
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,340
baby sign, a baby sign. Y'all the only witness I like is the condensation on

356
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:35,220
the outside of a milk bottle. I got milk low low prices. Anyone want milk hit my

357
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,860
am you get a message you get a

358
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,500
theory

359
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:47,660
to this wallet. You get a message from from baby for ninety two, whoa saying

360
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,480
milk, milk, milk, milk, milk, so pretty. I want your milky milky milk five

361
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,300
thousand dollars.

362
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,780
This is the richest Eduardo has ever been

363
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:02,340
whoa by the baby for bought the milk. You have okay. I delete my account. Oh

364
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:07,140
my God, not given this guy any milk. You don't have oh you have some milk,

365
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,500
some milk. I have houses to visit on my route, but what if you just put it

366
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:15,620
okay? I'll give them I sent upload the by paper clip, the milk to my dm use

367
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,340
after milk.

368
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,900
Finally, make it to the positive vibes area,

369
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,140
no matter how big or small name one good thing that happened to you today

370
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:28,060
made a band made five bands

371
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,820
five bands off my friend made five racks

372
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,920
flipping milk

373
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,520
and you you hear from you here from another rubber ducky nearby you.

374
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:49,320
My day was good because we're going to take down fill completely and it's warm

375
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,020
feeling. Hey, warm feeling yo

376
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:57,020
hey warm feeling. Call me a different call me. Call me a different name. Hey

377
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,220
-Fo-red. -Hey, Mr. Milk Wolf.

378
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,920
-Fo-red? -Hello, Fo-red.

379
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,920
-Fo-red is fine. -I'm a horse.

380
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,820
-How you guys doing? -I'm a horse.

381
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,320
-We're good, man. -We're a horse now.

382
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,920
-Where's your bro-- Oh. All right. -He's in my butt.

383
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,720
I know a few guys who are into that, so...

384
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,420
Um, all right.

385
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:16,120
So, we're gonna storm...

386
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:18,120
-The capital? -The Mazy Gate.

387
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,620
Well, sort of.

388
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:24,620
Between Soaked City and Fill Completely

389
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:27,420
is the messy maze where the messy tour lives.

390
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,300
You have to break through the mazey gate membrane though first.

391
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,780
Now, fill completely as the messing hour.

392
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,860
Every hour where all users inside Soak City, whether they want to or not,

393
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,740
fill their diapers completely.

394
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:46,700
At that moment, we have to crap.

395
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,460
Wait, we will not.

396
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,660
My brother's head is in my butt.

397
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,320
I'll be crap because we are not

398
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:59,680
that compose. It's too bad now that we all have to crap at the crappy. No

399
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,780
announcing our well, you seems like you guys have to

400
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:07,220
I like that, but not before you guys cast around. It seems like this guy's

401
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,000
saying that me and this one man band guy don't have to do that, but you do for

402
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,660
us for some reason. Oh my God, no how well I mean you're tempting me that it

403
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,740
should be what happens, but

404
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,380
you know what? So no, no, no, just because I want that to happen. Hold on,

405
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,300
I'm not in control here.

406
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:31,020
What we need to do is during that missing hour, that's a brief window that

407
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:35,100
me and the rest of the leaky legends will strike.

408
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:43,020
What's up? You just shit in your I was testing.

409
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:48,940
I was doing a test run. Stop don't don't draw attention to yourself right now.

410
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,660
- Okay. - We'll go in there.

411
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,860
- Why am I smelling it?

412
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:54,460
- In the three of you, then-- - In real life, I'm smelling it.

413
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,040
Somehow.

414
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:57,300
Once we strike and distract the elite guards,

415
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,900
the three of you will break through the membrane

416
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,220
and enter the messy maze.

417
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,380
We will break through the membrane.

418
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,660
We gonna break through the brain.

419
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,620
Insane in the maze!

420
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,620
And once you get--

421
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,620
(laughing)

422
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,620
It's crazy.

423
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:11,460
Once you get through the membrane--

424
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,860
I'm sorry, once you get through the maze

425
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,340
and defeat the Messytaur,

426
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,420
then it's just you versus Phil completely.

427
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,260
You guys ready?

428
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,380
Do we have a chance to heal before?

429
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,460
- Ready as Oliver Peabra.

430
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,300
- Are we gonna, do we have like a save point outside of the?

431
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,100
- Yeah, where are your, I just realized

432
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,420
I have not looked at your sheets in a little bit.

433
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,020
- Eight, eight.

434
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:28,860
- I'm full.

435
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,680
- You guys should, yeah.

436
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,780
- 10.

437
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,660
- Yeah, you could fill up to your max HP,

438
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,300
'cause it's gonna be, I would say that like,

439
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,780
you've done enough. - Oh, we should fill now.

440
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,500
- You've done enough short rests-ish.

441
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,340
- Fill completely?

442
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,100
- No.

443
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,800
- Meow?

444
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,640
- Well, yes.

445
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,460
- Oh, yes, I guess so. - Fill to the max.

446
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,300
- Yeah, fill completely.

447
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,900
- All right.

448
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,740
How many do you have?

449
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,820
You have four left.

450
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,140
You should get your moves back.

451
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,260
This is gonna be a brutal fight.

452
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,100
If you guys have been spending your resources.

453
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,620
- Whoa, a brutal fight.

454
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,660
- Oh my God.

455
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,360
- Good thing I have eight HP.

456
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:01,020
- Yeah, get your resources back.

457
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,020
I think that's fair.

458
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,860
- Okay.

459
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,900
- 'Cause I didn't get a--

460
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,620
- I still have makeover party.

461
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:07,460
Oh, I guess I'm a horse.

462
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,620
- I didn't go this through a fine tooth comb.

463
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:15,100
All right, so you guys ride on your parallel rubber duckies

464
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,620
until you reach the messy gate.

465
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,740
And you and the Leaky Legends are just sort of ambling about,

466
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:25,540
and about five or so minutes goes by,

467
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,380
and a warm feeling goes to you and he says,

468
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,280
"All right, it's about to be the messing hour

469
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,360
"in about 30 seconds.

470
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,300
"You guys ready?"

471
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,940
- 30 second heads up.

472
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,540
Yeah, man, yeah, that's good.

473
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,020
Yeah, that's a really efficient thing.

474
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,500
- Yeah, I'm ready.

475
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,660
- Maybe I skipped all the other heads ups

476
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,500
that I was given.

477
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,300
- Yeah, sure, whatever, 30 seconds, sure.

478
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,080
Let me just get excited.

479
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:51,880
Now you're now you're in character. It's good. I hold I hold my brother in it.

480
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,980
Don't I can't stress enough. You do not need to crap your brother out. If you

481
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:59,180
don't want I hold I hold his shoulders and I say I'm doing this because we have

482
00:27:59,180 --> 00:27:59,380
to

483
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,980
cake.

484
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,880
So

485
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,180
as it's winding down, you see the sky with all its bluey blues and it's sort of

486
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:13,080
all the water. You see it start to turn red slowly

487
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:17,280
and like start to pass over and get dark.

488
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,340
- I've said pass over.

489
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,680
(laughing)

490
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:25,620
- And you see the members of the diaper network

491
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,600
who are not humans like you guys

492
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,560
and see their eyes roll in the back of their heads

493
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,840
and you hear a rumbling of a thousand stomachs.

494
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,360
Yes.

495
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,200
- Holy shit.

496
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,600
- And you hear a warm feeling go, now!

497
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,160
and they all, the League of Legends charge and attack

498
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:49,440
the elite guards there while they are having an ecstasy,

499
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,600
orgy, porgy style shitting themselves kind of moment.

500
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,960
And you guys now, in this moment,

501
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,440
are you guys breaking through the membrane or what?

502
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,280
- Let's go man, yeah.

503
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,200
- Let's break through. - Okay.

504
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,720
You guys go through, what do you do?

505
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,320
Do you shit your brother out too?

506
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,640
- I shit on my brother's face

507
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:06,120
and then he jumps up and runs.

508
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:06,960
- Okay.

509
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,320
- So now he has poop damage or something, I don't know.

510
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,640
- And now they can't tell him apart.

511
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,640
Yeah, well now they

512
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,000
can tell us apart.

513
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,320
You're right.

514
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,200
Whatever. Wait, they can't tell us apart?

515
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,240
I don't understand.

516
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,240
They can't. I thought.

517
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,160
What do you mean?

518
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,480
I just like I'm sorry.

519
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,360
I don't know. I was just trying

520
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,360
something new.

521
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,840
Well, don't try it again.

522
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,800
You guys burst through the membrane

523
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,600
into the messy maze.

524
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,960
Now, the messy maze is

525
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,080
what I turn left, then right, then

526
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,800
right, then left, then left, then

527
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,480
forward, then right, then left,

528
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:42,060
stop and straight. Did I get to it?

529
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,220
No, I go

530
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,640
right

531
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,000
BA start. That is a Konami code. How are you going to go be an A in a maze?

532
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,720
I hit the T. I already did that one time and I beat him. That was true.

533
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,760
That was the worst. I hit the Teal day and I hit I type in

534
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:03,920
no clip and then I talk about maybe our best campaign to

535
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:08,680
think about that one where I defeated you. Yes, yeah, sorry. What are you

536
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,320
I hit the teal day and then I type in no clip and then I hit enter and then I

537
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:18,640
click through the whole maze. Okay we're in a maze yeah. Okay can I roll a perception check?

538
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,560
I go all the way down. Yes you may roll a perception check. Look at that. Okay Mr. Baldur's

539
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:27,760
Gate. Yeah I've been playing Baldur's Gate 3 guys 20 minutes at a time because I get so bored.

540
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:34,320
Here I go. A 7 man. Okay cool. What were you trying to like pick up on by the way? Trying

541
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,520
Trying to pick up on what way seemed the best direction to go. Yeah, it's hard

542
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,620
for you to tell. So,

543
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,020
what you do know is that the... And sorry, Warren Filling would have told

544
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
this to you in the lead up, I should have mentioned this earlier.

545
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:50,120
The way that the messy maze works is that all the walls and sort of

546
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,320
the sky above it, which is a little bit more...

547
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,220
Has a little bit more like motherboardy kind of texture. It's a little less

548
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:01,820
like trying to be idyllic and more back to being what it's supposed to

549
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,820
be, like the inner webs.

550
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:10,520
it's brown. When it's brown, you don't move and when it's good game and when

551
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,320
it's yellow, you go. What's red light green light, which is before it's good.

552
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,020
No, so it's not really a good game. Well, it's also a maze. This is a hat on a

553
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:24,620
hat man. Yeah, but like well either that or we had to set up the camera so I can

554
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,520
do an actual maze mean. Okay, so then I'm just going to proceed through the

555
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:33,920
maze. I'll turn every corner. No, I'm still going to Brown. I'll stop moving.

556
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:37,800
There'll be checks. There'll be checks. Let's go then. And I'll want to bring it

557
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:43,120
on. Bring it out of the mind. Cool. You guys will also know that if you move

558
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,600
while it's Brown, the messy tour will go get you.

559
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,560
Is it hard to tell when it's Brown? It's not hard to tell. So it should be fine.

560
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:57,280
Okay. Right. But maybe something scary will happen and come to get me like

561
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,560
a cloud of bees, the only a cloud of bees yeah and I'm like oh God, I don't like

562
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,720
I might be allergic to cloud of beef stew, clouded, clouded beef,

563
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,300
clouded beef, bro. You watch videos about clouded beefs all day, Bert

564
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:11,820
Kreischer.

565
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:22,520
No, it's Bobby Lee and Brendan Chaube.

566
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,680
Also, two bears, one cave might be over guys.

567
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:31,140
you're just dropping that and then drawing on the table like you're some

568
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,000
kind of a fucking

569
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,640
like you can you hit pause on the episode right now. I need to I need to

570
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,640
go to the bathroom real quick. You can just go. It's the whole no it's not

571
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:45,800
because of a p. Oh I see. Oh it's because of a t. It's because of it's

572
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:50,760
because of a seat. Oh con. Sorry. What the hell. I'm sorry. I'm not even

573
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,440
gonna cry. Our fans say that

574
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,760
When you say cunt, they turn into cricket and I'm not saying I'm not

575
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,360
saying it. I'm simply repeating. So today was the day patches got

576
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,080
cancelled. Y'all

577
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:07,600
patches haters be like

578
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:13,920
okay, so

579
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,640
it turned yellow. So now you guys can go

580
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:23,200
so roll who wants to take lead here? I will lead. Okay, I'm like the

581
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,600
Oh, why don't we take twin leads?

582
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,800
What's your what's role?

583
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,900
What kind of role are we doing?

584
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,000
Good question.

585
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,300
So it's up to you guys though.

586
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,300
So you can either strong or ball.

587
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,300
No, no.

588
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,600
No, so it's taking the lead is figuring out how to get out

589
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,900
of this maze so you can use either, you know, you can use

590
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,700
your intelligence, right?

591
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,400
Your brain.

592
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:41,900
Uh-huh.

593
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,400
You can use more of your wisdom to figure it out.

594
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,200
So can we roll all three of it is like investigation versus

595
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,700
like perception, right?

596
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,600
I think you should do it.

597
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,400
Can we I was going to say can we roll all three?

598
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
can we roll like the three things?

599
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Can we roll like I can roll strength,

600
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,900
he can roll intelligence and then he can roll like perception.

601
00:33:58,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Describe to me what you're going to try to do.

602
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,700
I was just going to roll strength and try to barrel through everything.

603
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,500
You're going to say you want to try to knock down the walls.

604
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,000
Yes.

605
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,500
Okay.

606
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,700
I want to knock down the walls until I create a path.

607
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,700
You can try to do that.

608
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,100
What are you guys going to try to do?

609
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,000
I'm going to follow the rules, man.

610
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,500
Yeah, I think I'm going to.

611
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,800
I don't want to take any chances here.

612
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,100
I'm going to follow the rules as well and maybe try to go really fast

613
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,100
while it's yellow.

614
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,020
I got an eight to run really quickly. An eighteen. Yeah, because it's strength

615
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,780
plus three. Yeah. Okay. It's very good. You're not able to knock down these

616
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:32,700
walls. I mean, you would have to have gotten a twenty basically, but knock

617
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,580
down every wall. What? No, you would have just well, you would have been able

618
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,500
to knock start. Yeah, I guess you would have been able. I would. That's

619
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,820
probably what I would have had to do. But beyond that, it's like you're able

620
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:48,220
to like knock into it and rattle around a bit, but that's about it. Yeah, I

621
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:55,660
notice anything or oh, I like that. What if you're when it's like a bat kind of

622
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,340
sonar thing? Yeah, let's have you roll. It's a horse thing.

623
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:04,860
A hole in the wall small enough so they can't get through. Why don't we try?

624
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:09,460
Let's have you do a owl. Okay, see if you could do it. I like that. That's fun.

625
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:14,540
No, there's a two. I was a two damn. All right, yeah, you don't quite get the

626
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:18,860
makeup of the maze. Okay, try though. I like that. Okay, cool. I would have

627
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,860
the wind going into different caverns of the cave. Yes, you would have heard. But

628
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:26,700
now all I did was give myself a concussion. You're just like kind of a

629
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:34,460
little dazed right now. Okay, so suddenly though you guys do actually all of you

630
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:39,700
roll perception check. Suddenly. That's owl. Yeah, that's owl. Sorry, roll owl. That is

631
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:46,700
is

632
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,620
17

633
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,340
Who was leading?

634
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:53,100
Me no it was I thought it was Pat

635
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,060
It was it was it was Pat

636
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:02,820
Whatever man that was a time. I save you okay. Well we passed the honesty test so we get another role

637
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,260
Caleb's character dies

638
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:12,580
I'll be lying for sending you can't die from lying so Pat is not able to hear this despite being a horse

639
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,820
But you're a rush of brown

640
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:20,700
flowing through. You do. And you have roll a... What do you want... Actually, so don't

641
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,940
roll. What do you want to do? You have a moment right now where you could potentially help

642
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:28,180
your team like not get...

643
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,180
I just yell stop.

644
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:35,180
That's a good start. Do they listen to you? Do you guys listen to them?

645
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,180
Yes.

646
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,340
Nice. That makes it a lot easier, I think. But now all of you guys have to roll constitution...

647
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:44,860
You still have to roll like strength checks rather to see if you get bowled over.

648
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:49,100
it won't be as hard for you. What did you get?

649
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,100
Thirteen.

650
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Ten.

651
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,100
Okay.

652
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,100
I got a five.

653
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Damn.

654
00:36:55,100 --> 00:37:02,100
So, it turns brown, you two manage to stay still, you do fall over.

655
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,260
Like I fucking noticed.

656
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,620
You screamed so loud that you threw up.

657
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,620
No, I just shit.

658
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,660
I think a cloud of bees came and scared me.

659
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,540
There's no bees in the website.

660
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,540
There possibly is.

661
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:17,880
In front of you, you see it. A minotaur wearing a diaper. It's a

662
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:23,340
massy taur. Can we kill it? You can certainly try. Or can we seduce it?

663
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:26,540
You could also try that, I guess. As a horse.

664
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:33,260
Oh, man, I do like that. Oh, shit. I hate when you do that. That's good.

665
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,980
'Cause what am I gonna do, say no to that? That's a really funny idea.

666
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:38,500
wait and I and I have cows.

667
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:45,320
I'm a horse with one. I have cows milk and a minotaur is a type of cow and I

668
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,340
can play a horse song.

669
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:53,320
Yeah, okay, so so so I'm painting the scenario here. So you you're playing

670
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:57,500
like a fucking like neo soul, can actually song bird, but it's called

671
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,940
song or Kenny G song bird is the other angle. You can go. You are giving your

672
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,700
are you going to install milk in him?

673
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,980
that's a good idea that you gotta do that. That's a good idea. I guess

674
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,580
squirt in his brother's. I was thinking it's just like you know if someone's

675
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:16,380
coming running at if you're someone's running at you to kill you and you hold

676
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,740
up, you're just holding a bunch of breast milk. They're probably gonna

677
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,940
they would definitely not they might not stop, but they're definitely gonna be

678
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:27,420
like. I thought you guys were gonna like build a sexy scenario. Yeah, I thought

679
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:31,260
that's what was sexy. Let's build a sexy scenario. Then messy tore into milk,

680
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:37,260
leave a trail of milk leading to his body, but only the bottom half is

681
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:40,060
believe his brother and get fucked by the maybe I'll pretend

682
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,820
yeah and then I

683
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,660
my brother's my bottom half. Yeah,

684
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:49,180
yeah, I guess the milk can be used in any way that you deem fit.

685
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:53,980
I like to hand me the milk. I can pour the milk talking bugs, bunny in a

686
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,940
dress, okay, or a bombs

687
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,260
brother. If you guys were a monster, would you rather have sex with a horse

688
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,260
that was covered in milk or one that wasn't covered in milk? Because I'm a

689
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,380
weird fucking. That's what I'm thinking, too. So I'm just going to pour the

690
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,340
milk on saturate his outfit. Yeah, make it what's a wet T shirt. Contest. Oh,

691
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:16,260
well, no, don't do that because I don't see the human underneath. I do this.

692
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:20,500
Well, I'm not. I make the milk look like I'm guys. I make the milk dribbling

693
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,500
down the corners of his mouth and out of his butthole. I want to I want to

694
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:29,620
let's reiterate I'm in a horse. I'm in a horse pose, no cost to a milk pie in his

695
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:32,500
but that's what I'm going to do and then I'm going to act like I'm just taking my

696
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:35,700
thing out of his butt and go. Oh, that was great. That was the best I ever had,

697
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:39,060
but you know I would make it better if I was a monster. Oh, what I am a

698
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:43,380
I'm a monster and I like this even more than we want than and fucking a

699
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,540
fucking human human

700
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:50,620
and I'm not a human. I'm a horse. Okay, let's let this play out. So what's what

701
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:55,060
so I put milk into his but and pretend that I got a leak out as if it was my

702
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,540
jizz my high yeah, so it's very you know that can we put up a big you know, I

703
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:04,980
can see of my nut. We put up a big Las Vegas style, so I'm pretending I'm

704
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,020
pulling my wolf cock out of his ass

705
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:13,060
as a werewolf. This was number one. We put up a big. We put up a big Las Vegas

706
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:19,340
like little like iridescent light bulbs. That's a free horse sex yeah.

707
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,500
and I stay and you're playing a sexy song. I'm playing a

708
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,700
yeah

709
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:27,840
okay,

710
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:33,220
so a couple I want to put this all together in a few different that's all

711
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,080
with a harmonica. You need me to explain my part of it again. I got a

712
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,520
played by a bus. Yeah, that's a

713
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:43,700
full harmonica. Don't roll yet. Don't roll yet. I'm going to tell you, though,

714
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:46,720
what we're going to do when so, but don't roll until I

715
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,540
stop bitch.

716
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,000
I was a good rule. It's fair. I got my bad roll out of the way to yeah, but

717
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,940
you did so okay. I think really good. We're going to do for you. It's going

718
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,020
to be a performance check for

719
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:06,220
or sorry talking to talk about how much you lie about how good it was. Good.

720
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,580
It was a pussy. Okay,

721
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,100
animal handling. We don't have

722
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:17,180
I roll now or I'm waiting. Still, sorry, still waiting. I want it all like

723
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,420
outlined what's happening. Yeah, you

724
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:24,820
why don't you put up the lights? Okay, and so that will be an

725
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:29,120
intelligence check. Okay, so that's one role. Your second role will be a

726
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,120
performance check for the music. Okay, and that's balance ball. That's sorry.

727
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,220
No, that is talking, talking. Okay, this is talking for both.

728
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,320
I plus talking and brain. Okay, two is best talking in brain tests.

729
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,120
You

730
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,220
I got a twerk.

731
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:51,720
that's a strength. You got to twerk that ass. It's a horse. It's our twerking is

732
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,640
not it's a butt strength. You got to have a it's if you think that twerking does

733
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,800
not take strength, but you get down on the ground and try it right now. You show

734
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,440
us right now. Just do it. You get upside down and you upside down.

735
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,360
Now, while

736
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:11,680
busted open for me, buddy, it's literally flexing your muscles.

737
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,880
It's such a great idea. We should all do our best roles. Yeah,

738
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:19,720
I'm not doing my best role, but it's all good. I'm rolling man.

739
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:24,640
The time to roll, but cheek strength, you got to pop those ass cheeks up.

740
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,720
We'll have you roll. Okay. You can do that.

741
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,920
You can use strength instead of performance,

742
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,840
but I'm going to make the difficulty class higher.

743
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,360
Fine. Then I'll do performance. Okay. I'm going to roll my fine.

744
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,040
Are we going in order? Yes. Because we have to see how each one of these

745
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:46,440
he succeeds okay all right. So first so first me so first the minute or so he

746
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,180
goes for here's the sense senses movement during brown and turns the

747
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,320
corner, the messy tour and

748
00:42:54,320 --> 00:43:01,480
you are now okay. I'm like three and a half inches deep yeah and I'm in it

749
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:06,600
three and a half inches deep and let me say as a werewolf that's only two

750
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,080
percent

751
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,060
yeah

752
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:12,180
for a fucking yeah, fucking

753
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:14,860
try to think of it as a very

754
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,460
it's fifty times

755
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,800
it's a hundred and fifty and a half inches and a half times foot, a hundred

756
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,560
and seventy five inches, one seventy five inches long.

757
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:32,200
So you're you're on the other side of the map

758
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,380
hundred and seventy five inches would be the other side of the map to you.

759
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:37,780
Yeah

760
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,860
little

761
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:45,760
and I'm like Oh my God, this this beats

762
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,660
not fucking horses. I know you had to go in as a werewolf as a and as and as

763
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:59,220
now that I think about it, I bet any monster around here not only could but

764
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:02,260
will enjoy a pleasure such as this

765
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:05,260
(laughter)

766
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Okay. That's sexy. That's sexy.

767
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,260
I have like a kitty from that 70's show laugh.

768
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:11,260
Alright, roll that.

769
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:13,260
I want to see how that pans out.

770
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:14,260
14. Very good.

771
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,260
That's good, man.

772
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Pretty solid. Okay.

773
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,260
So now me. I've got to set up the lights.

774
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
What was the other thing I'm doing?

775
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
You're going to set up the lights and play the music.

776
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,260
You're playing "Let's Get It On" I guess.

777
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,260
Here's for the lights.

778
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,260
That's a 7, y'all.

779
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,260
Okay. So you didn't spell "horse" right.

780
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:30,260
That's fine.

781
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:37,300
wait, how did he spell it? H O R S? Yes, whores free, that's actually an

782
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:40,540
accidental win. Trick me and an eighteen for the song. You know,

783
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,860
I've been really

784
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,900
amazing

785
00:44:44,900 --> 00:44:47,820
to know.

786
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:53,300
It's like when you see a subway like an eighteen is like when you see a subway

787
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,620
performing. You're like I know they're good.

788
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,620
I know they're good, but I'm on my way to work.

789
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,040
♪ I've had this feeling for so long ♪

790
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,280
♪ And if you feel ♪

791
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:05,120
- And you.

792
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,100
- Eight or 17, man.

793
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,140
- 17. - Or no.

794
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:09,980
- Wow. - Nevermind.

795
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,660
It's 'cause it was performance, right?

796
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,500
- Oh, yeah. - So it was a 13.

797
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:14,340
- No? - Okay.

798
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:15,180
- That still passes.

799
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,900
- No, 13 is--

800
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:19,140
- 'Cause it was a 14 minus one.

801
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:20,380
- No, what do you mean minus one?

802
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,200
What's performance?

803
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,400
Oh, is performance talking?

804
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,780
I thought performance was ball.

805
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,820
- Performance is talking.

806
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,760
- He got an insight check of a six.

807
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,720
oh, so he doesn't know we're tricking him into sex

808
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:38,400
way. He's had a he's doesn't know we're together to trick him into having a

809
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:45,080
computer program minotaur. So now whoever can real thinking feeling thing

810
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,080
no, that's right. Can't prove it

811
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:55,000
the hell so sinister. No, it was not what I was. Yeah, it was not that was

812
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,240
not how I was supposed to go out.

813
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,240
I

814
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:02,540
didn't know that that's what that sounded like anyway. Yes, you this

815
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:08,000
thing is is horned up by you. It is doing it is stopping its feet,

816
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,860
dragging it back. Do we have a fail safe in

817
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:16,300
I'm just getting fucked by the Minotaur. Hey, you know what we went through?

818
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,540
At least me. We went through this entire thing without even considering that it

819
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:21,860
means that he's about to get fun and there's no

820
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:23,660
advantage for us at all.

821
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:28,420
Well, maybe it'll let us just walk through the whole. Yeah, he fucked his

822
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:33,860
ass. I guess I have to roll performance. Huh? We can try and just go well. He's

823
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:36,860
he's fucking one of the brothers. We can take everyone else. Oh, yeah, the whole

824
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,300
point was I thought was a sacrifice. One of the

825
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:44,380
I was gonna roll per sacrifice a man. I don't like sacrifice. You'll just gonna

826
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:44,580
get

827
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:48,020
fucking somebody in their top half runs away.

828
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:55,880
would you keep going here? We are sacrificing him because we're going to

829
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,520
we're leaving behind to get fucked and we like run to the end of the maze and

830
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,160
like an hour later he catches up and he's like hey guys are like hello. No

831
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:02,600
man

832
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,460
you can't be

833
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:08,960
I mean we're going to get you will get you an hour.

834
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:14,360
You stay way too long. That's way to smoking in bed.

835
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:19,860
We had like a thing man. That was weird. All right, what I

836
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:21,980
Yeah, it's up to you.

837
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,680
Leave. I'm going. All right. My top has going.

838
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,620
Okay. He knows even hey or whoa.

839
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,520
Whoa is definitely staying.

840
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:36,820
Where is the sext all version of you right? Oh, are you kidding me? Mo

841
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:39,220
Mo broke it.

842
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:40,920
Oh broke. Mo is fucking it.

843
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:46,120
Mo is the minotaur. Mo is the minotaur. Yeah. Mo, I guess I put it in

844
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:48,020
the closet because my girlfriend's

845
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:55,320
my girlfriend's mom visited and it was on the in the living room after we did

846
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,980
that troll to show or allegations with Alex and she didn't know where to put it

847
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:05,460
and put it in the closet and then somehow grabbed the foot out of the closet and

848
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,060
popped it.

849
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:09,740
He wants to do that to you, man. He thought it was you. Imagine opening a

850
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:13,740
closet and see you deflated. Yeah, I did this morning.

851
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:20,400
it's still on the floor in there damn yeah. Well, that's what happens only

852
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,120
that's what happens to your brother. Yeah, poked and deflated by an animal

853
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:24,600
yeah.

854
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,480
Well, minotaur probably has what does he say as you guys are printing away

855
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:31,520
animal king? Well, this minotaur is in the whoa in the whoa

856
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,200
whoa

857
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:39,680
whoa and you guys it's and it's the it's the fucking or the one time we're going

858
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,320
back to the social network. It's all in tilt shift. It's like the the regatta

859
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,720
he's like a total animal

860
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:55,540
yeah with all the facial expressions from that scene right and yeah you just

861
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:55,860
hear

862
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:02,620
and you cruise through the maze and you reach it finally filled completely

863
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:05,940
looks like a sort on

864
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,840
type of guy,

865
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:09,920
but a diaper.

866
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:14,800
I drew him. It is it's a diaper or it's a face wearing a diaper. He's like the

867
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,760
first thing I drew when I was first doing this.

868
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,960
You were drawing

869
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:24,120
yeah, oh, it looks good. I like it. Yeah, what is it? It's all poop. Yeah, I'll

870
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:28,560
put this on screen. Maybe it's a poo. It looks it's poop wearing a bandana or

871
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,240
it's a diaper. I see it's a diaper. I didn't really finish, but I was supposed

872
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,320
to look like I knew that was going to happen.

873
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:39,160
Yeah, I'll master control. He screen shots into to be heard of the

874
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:44,920
odd discord. We can do that part. Yeah, sorry. I didn't send that. I just it was

875
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:48,040
like I just drew it when I was coming up with the campaign idea. I was like I

876
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:53,200
need to have a guy like this. Anyway, he turns to face you give me my most evil

877
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:58,440
fucking robot voice. Please do give me a second here and and pray. Yeah, I will

878
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,840
pray pray for Caleb.

879
00:49:59,840 --> 00:50:05,320
Why is it doing this?

880
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,920
Caleb

881
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:10,920
It's still

882
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:16,780
How do we fix this am I better he's better I recovered

883
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:33,520
He turns to face you he swivels around and he says he's a sorry

884
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,320
three. Oh, my God,

885
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:41,320
yes,

886
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:47,020
my brother got his butt fucked by a monster by a monster. It was kind of

887
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:50,700
funny. Are you the brother that's left? Are you the brother who had the your

888
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,520
face up the butt or who had your brother's face up

889
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,020
fully

890
00:50:56,020 --> 00:51:01,820
that was like

891
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:08,820
He ran and then the other one was like, wait.

892
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:21,220
He says, which one of you created me?

893
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:22,220
Me right?

894
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,900
I thought we decided it was me in court.

895
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,500
No, it wasn't Eduardo man.

896
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:27,740
No, it was me man.

897
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:29,100
It was all fucking me.

898
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,540
I created you bro.

899
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:31,040
you

900
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,240
it was off. I created you and I don't I gotta get out of here man. I got stuff

901
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,460
to do, I got, but I created at least twenty five to fifty percent of you. We

902
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:43,940
can agree that I created you a hundred percent and he gave me like fifty bucks

903
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:48,840
that created this. Okay, now we're just doing the court thing again. Don't

904
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,220
worry about it right now. Okay,

905
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,820
any and you guys best friend, you guys do

906
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:01,100
pretty good. You guys do like you're somehow compelled to silence.

907
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,540
Couldn't that be, it would be great if I could do that.

908
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:05,940
And he says,

909
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:11,420
"You can't decide who created me.

910
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:19,620
You either mask your insecurities in a false sense of superiority, offer nothing

911
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:25,700
of value except $1200, or you're stupid and there's two of you."

912
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:27,280
(laughs)

913
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,120
- What?

914
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:31,040
Can you turn the voice off?

915
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:35,500
Okay.

916
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,020
- It's me.

917
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,100
- Okay.

918
00:52:38,100 --> 00:52:41,100
If it's what we have to do to get out of here, I admit it.

919
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:41,940
Okay.

920
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,740
Eduardo created the website.

921
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:48,760
That $1,200,

922
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:52,860
I used that $1,200

923
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,200
to get all the server space. I lied about everything else I did with it was all

924
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:04,020
the server space and not only that, that cost $200, $1000. I he doesn't remember

925
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:10,560
this. I he gave me 1200. I spent 200 on server space and spent the other $1000 to

926
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,040
pay him to make the website.

927
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,920
He doesn't remember this. He doesn't remember it because he's not that bright,

928
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:22,520
but I asked him to write some code and he wrote the entire website. I'm like my

929
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:27,600
your body is biologically like shutting down. I'm like overclocking. My heart

930
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:27,900
rate is

931
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:32,840
two fifty beats per minute. Your mouth is wide open. Yeah, I'm like in freeze

932
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,840
frame. I'm like

933
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:36,080
and that's the twist guys.

934
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:38,200
It was Eduardo. The

935
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,580
and

936
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,360
from above

937
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:53,320
a pipe flies from the sky and goes inside of you like it like a fix. This is

938
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,180
what I was hoping was going to happen. I was really hoping that I could fight

939
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,980
really hard to be the creator and then a laser would shoot out and you start

940
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:01,940
being filled

941
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,840
with poop.

942
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:13,540
Once you are failed, we will be together and we will ingest the entire world

943
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:15,020
into the diaper network.

944
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:17,100
You have ten turns

945
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:19,100
To kill him?

946
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,100
To kill Phil completely.

947
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,100
Oh shit.

948
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,100
Or Eduardo will be your best friend.

949
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,100
This shit's easy.

950
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,100
Roll initiative.

951
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:28,100
I mean I really don't care if Eduardo dies.

952
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:30,100
I know but just for...

953
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,100
We have to have some stakes sometimes.

954
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,100
18 on initiative.

955
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,100
Okay.

956
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:35,100
13.

957
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,100
5.

958
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:37,100
Alright.

959
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:38,100
Oh shit.

960
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:39,100
5.

961
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,100
Luckily I'm DPS man.

962
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:41,100
I'm gonna destroy this thing.

963
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:42,100
What'd we get?

964
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,100
We got...

965
00:54:43,100 --> 00:54:44,100
Okay we got 19 for Phil completely.

966
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,320
Actually have no damaging abilities.

967
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,920
Yeah, Eduardo's a very good character.

968
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,920
You have intelligent stuff you can use.

969
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,320
I don't think any of us do any damage, I'm not going to lie.

970
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,320
I do.

971
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,320
You have Ice Beam or something.

972
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,320
I have Shell Launcher.

973
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,320
I gave you like an ice ability.

974
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,320
No, you didn't.

975
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Last session you did an ice power.

976
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:03,320
Oh, I don't remember that at all.

977
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,320
It was crazy.

978
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:05,320
That was probably five months ago.

979
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,320
I'm going to write it down.

980
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,320
Sorry, who got 16?

981
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
You, right?

982
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,320
I got five.

983
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,320
Caleb.

984
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,320
I got 16.

985
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,320
Caleb, I'm sorry.

986
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,320
I got 16.

987
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:30,040

989
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,360
can't say I'm like

990
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:43,440

turn all the microphones down and we'll turn and face the wall and we'll talk

993
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:56,280
into the wall. Honestly, I see the thing I learned is so crazy to even if I said

994
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:59,520
it when we turn back around, everyone would tell what it was based on the

995
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:04,400
facial expressions. Wait, can we just please say it all right? Okay, fine,

996
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,760
completely. I'm going to say it really quick. Homer has returned to strangling.

997
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:13,040
But I thought really it was false all along. Are you serious? So he didn't

00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,440
work. Is that actually true? Never stopped. You've never. Are you serious?

999
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,920

1070
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:52,520
18. All right, we're looking good. Was your first one good? It was also good.

1071

All right, you're up now.

1072
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,520
I guess I'm going to do another shell launcher.

1073
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,520
That'll be your last one once you do it.

1074
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:00,520
It'll count.

1075
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:02,520

1076
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,520

Y'all are carrying my ass.

1079
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:10,520
It's a really good ability that I made over at work.

1080
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,520
I just realized I have a healing.

1081
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,520
You do have healing, yeah.

1082
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,520
It's honestly not even worth healing me because I don't have any damage I can do.

1083
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,520
Seven.

1084
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,520

1086
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,200

Okay, they do it in order success. There you go. I failed one. I'll go again. I guess I

1145
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:47,200
could yeah failed again. So now it's to do it on when all right, you're stabilized.

1146
01:05:47,200 --> 01:06:02,680
Fail, I think. Yeah, fail or is a fail. When 19. Okay, success. 16. Oh, success. 20. Okay,

1147
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:04,280
-stabilized. -All right, I have one success,

1148
01:06:04,280 --> 01:06:06,980
another success.

1149
01:06:06,980 --> 01:06:10,480
-What's ten? -Oh shit.

1150
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,280
-Success? -Yeah, right.

1151
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:16,880
-That's how I know this. -I'm pretty sure it's a success. Yes,

1152
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:19,380
it's a success. It's got it. Yeah, one to ten, eleven, yes, yes,

1153
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,080
-yes. No, it's a fail. -No. Oh, she's right. It'd be okay. It's

1154
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:23,880
a fail. So to success, hold on.

1155
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:26,480
I'm going to keep going. It should be a fail.

1156
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,080
-It should be a fail. -Eleven success.

1157
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:33,460
Yeah, it is ten. No, it's one through nine rolling lower than a ten one

1158
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:36,580
through nine is a failure should be a fail. I know it's dumb, but I

1159
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:40,420
can't keep rolling as if I got a failure because I don't agree with that rule.

1160
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:40,940
Okay, kind of

1161
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:47,100
yeah, it's success. Cool. All three are stabilized. Yeah, okay. So now the

1162
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:51,220
brother comes in now. My broke but brother comes in and filled completely

1163
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:51,740
says

1164
01:06:51,740 --> 01:06:54,540
what do you want

1165
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,380
Hello. He wants to hit him with the shell. I'm going to hit you with the

1166
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,380
shell, man.

1167
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:06,680
This is big. This is big. It all comes down to this role, man. Please make

1168
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:07,380
this good on

1169
01:07:07,380 --> 01:07:12,880
it hit this. We got a re roll. Yeah, hit this. I influence the role. He

1170
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,180
influenced the role. All right,

1171
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:21,280
15 plus. I need influence the role plus what that hits. Okay, so that hits.

1172
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:22,680
So 48. Oh, yeah.

1173
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:25,680
Eight.

1174
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,180
Oh yeah.

1175
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:27,680
We play some dramatic music right now.

1176
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:28,180
One.

1177
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,680
Daddy think.

1178
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:30,680
[Laughter]

1179
01:07:30,680 --> 01:07:31,180
Six.

1180
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:31,680
Fifteen.

1181
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,680
You know, people usually like how harsh I am.

1182
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:35,180
Seven.

1183
01:07:35,180 --> 01:07:35,680
Twenty-two.

1184
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,180
How I always live by the rules, but sometimes, you know, I can be a little bit of a sucky.

1185
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:40,180
Twenty-two, man.

1186
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:41,680
And I want to see you guys win this one.

1187
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:43,180
And he's dead, right?

1188
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:44,680
Twenty-two damage.

1189
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:45,680
Describe your kill.

1190
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:51,180
I turn around, and I blast a...

1191
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:52,680
You blast what?

1192
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:53,180
A fart.

1193
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:54,180
Yeah.

1194
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:55,940
and I'm glad he's gonna like that.

1195
01:07:55,940 --> 01:07:59,340
I blast of load of minotaur nut.

1196
01:07:59,340 --> 01:08:02,280
Oh shit, so hard.

1197
01:08:02,280 --> 01:08:05,720
That it comes out in a spear.

1198
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:08,360
It comes out shaped like a spear.

1199
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:11,260
And it goes.

1200
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:14,620
It's like the what's that thing?

1201
01:08:14,620 --> 01:08:15,720
The holdo maneuver.

1202
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,000
The what from Star Wars 8?

1203
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:22,960
Oh, oh, when every all the sound

1204
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:23,660
you stop

1205
01:08:23,660 --> 01:08:28,480
that's sick.

1206
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:35,480
Yeah, all the sound in the world stops. Whoa now

1207
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:41,120
has to I mean you can you can also how do you heal people? What was the

1208
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:44,480
ability I gave you was it like what you feel your party for two D four plus

1209
01:08:44,480 --> 01:08:48,960
what do I call it? Twelve? I don't have enough things anyway. Nobody he can

1210
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:52,800
called twelve hundred dollars. I'm with you bro. Oh, okay. I said oh shit. So oh

1211
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,600
shit. Well, you can rummage through your pockets and get take the twelve hundred

1212
01:08:55,600 --> 01:09:02,600
dollars. I think and heal you guys if he wants to you have this chance to throw

1213
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:09,500
the hashed code like in Tron the movie the disc the disc into filled completely

1214
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:14,100
and then at the same time you have to tell forced up in the private virtual

1215
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:18,800
network to do the exact same thing to stop the redundancy. I'm going to do

1216
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:23,440
it. You do it describe. Okay, how do you do it again? It comes out of my

1217
01:09:23,440 --> 01:09:23,760
but

1218
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:29,700
the hash go to their yeah, it's kind of it's kind of like storage. I wear have

1219
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:32,720
been keeping all my items this whole time. It's been in my butt filled

1220
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,920
completely his diaper. First, he's dead. Now, his diaper starts to unravel and

1221
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:41,760
his shit just starts falling out you and that move he did where it looked like

1222
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:45,160
the whole network was shaking and things were falling from the sky.

1223
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:50,320
it's now more and more and more and more as the whole diaper network starts to

1224
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:55,040
fall apart. All these years that you guys spent building it and fighting over who

1225
01:09:55,040 --> 01:10:00,160
built it and not actually building it all are washing away as you feel

1226
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:00,740
yourselves

1227
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:02,480
suck your

1228
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,320
on so your so suck ourselves

1229
01:10:05,320 --> 01:10:08,640
yourself. So I like this feeling

1230
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:15,920
out of the computers. Oh my God, back into the courtroom right when the bailiff

1231
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:20,260
it's just walking away days. He doesn't know why he started to yell about a

1232
01:10:20,260 --> 01:10:25,840
hash code and it's like only like half a second later, you're back in the

1233
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:28,260
courtroom, we're all covered in shit. Yeah,

1234
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:30,640
my brother is nude yeah

1235
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:34,220
and Sullivan, Joyce, only

1236
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:37,660
order

1237
01:10:37,660 --> 01:10:41,980
let the code of on begin.

1238
01:10:43,380 --> 01:10:49,320
I type in boobs. You guys going to do the code on I have realized what I'm a

1239
01:10:49,320 --> 01:10:50,940
werewolf. I've already admitted to it.

1240
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:55,620
The courtroom cops are shooting me.

1241
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:58,060
Bullets just hitting you as you're typing

1242
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:01,860
ricocheting on your body. Yeah, I

1243
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:08,900
I sit down to do the code on to prove my might and then I realize I still think

1244
01:11:08,940 --> 01:11:15,100
and then I realized that Eduardo not only built the website, but y'all

1245
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:21,460
he's my best friend. Oh my God! Wow! So instead of opening up the

1246
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:26,500
command line, I open up a photo of me and Eduardo, right click, set as desktop

1247
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:31,460
background, push my chair away from the computer. Wow! I still think I'm a horse.

1248
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:35,040
so I'm using my hooves on the I'm getting I'm getting shot by the by the

1249
01:11:35,040 --> 01:11:39,220
and I'm like down in the corner.

1250
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:44,040
You walk out the court room like I just did the right thing like yeah,

1251
01:11:44,040 --> 01:11:46,560
and you think you're doing this

1252
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,960
by

1253
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:55,820
I guess by default, the creator of the website is hey hey and whoa

1254
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,120
dark horse pick wow

1255
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:06,420
long. We plan this y'all yeah cut to you. You're a cover of time magazine

1256
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:09,440
yeah all that stuff

1257
01:12:09,440 --> 01:12:17,020
go to the Hamptons party that all white Hamptons party yeah and I have one

1258
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:18,180
final thing to say

1259
01:12:18,180 --> 01:12:21,720
whoa

1260
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:27,640
It's pretty good. And then I shit out a hole. I shit out the minotaur.

1261
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:32,520
I shit out the minotaur into the real world. And now there's a minotaur

1262
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,060
problem.

1263
01:12:33,060 --> 01:12:37,360
And I think we have our sequel already written for us.

1264
01:12:37,360 --> 01:12:41,760
Happy Halloween, everyone. GGs, guys. GGs.

1265
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:49,500
Wait, guys, we should literally become spa workers so we can see women naked

1266
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:50,120
all the time.

1267
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:54,520
That's a fucking, it's a great idea.

1268
01:12:54,520 --> 01:12:58,240
Hey, I'm all these people who are wasting their time, jacking off to porn.

1269
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:01,080
Just get a job at a YMCA.

1270
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:05,000
We have to go on shark tank and we have to pitch this.

1271
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:06,960
Mark Cuban and Mr.

1272
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:07,480
Wonderful.

1273
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:10,280
A spa for women who don't mind being ogled.

1274
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:10,980
Yeah.

1275
01:13:10,980 --> 01:13:16,000
A spa where you, how about this, a spa where you go for free and you get a bunch

1276
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:20,680
of perverts who pay, like if a woman wants to go to a spa, you could either, you

1277
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:22,680
The perverts are paying double what the wards would pay.

1278
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,680
Yeah, you can either pay, this is a great idea,

1279
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:28,680
you either pay $50 to go to a normal spa or you pay zero.

1280
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:32,680
Meanwhile, the perverts, Patrick and Cameron, are sitting behind a...

1281
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:34,180
I didn't say that I was going to be there.

1282
01:13:34,180 --> 01:13:35,180
Oh wait, here's the thing though.

1283
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:36,180
You could even do tiers.

1284
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:38,680
I'm literally the inventor of this company. I wouldn't be one of the perverts.

1285
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:40,180
You could even do, well you'd have to test it out.

1286
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,180
You could even do tiers of the...

1287
01:13:42,180 --> 01:13:44,680
I would honestly be whipping and torturing the perverts.

1288
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,180
The pervert tiers could be this, dude.

1289
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:48,680
Listen to this. You could either have...

1290
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:57,000
It's a pervert honeypot. We pitch this business on Shark Tank and then we post that. We tell

1291
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,240
them afterwards, and this is the secret, don't air this part on your TV show, but actually

1292
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:06,840
we're going to kill all the perverts. We're going to get that Anton Chigurh. You guys

1293
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:11,040
are fucking idiots because you're wasting a million dollar idea. He wants to go. You

1294
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:16,960
could even have it be tiered where there's windows that can be seen through both sides

1295
01:14:16,960 --> 01:14:22,440
and that tickets $50. But then they shut up. There's one that is a mirror, what do they

1296
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:27,960
call that? A double sided mirror, a one way mirror, a two way mirror, and that one is

1297
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:32,840
more money so that your identity is hidden. And then there's one that's even more that

1298
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,880
is a private cube.

1299
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,840
They have this already, the window and everything. It's called a peep show.

1300
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:42,760
These women are just doing their own thing. They're not putting on a show.

1301
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,760
Yeah, but wouldn't you want to pay for women doing the show?

1302
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:48,760
Okay, so wait, now that we're trying to maximize profit, I just thought of an even better idea, Caleb.

1303
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,760
Kind of jumping off of your two-way mirror idea.

1304
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:51,760
Uh-huh.

1305
