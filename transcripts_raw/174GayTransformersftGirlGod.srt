1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:11,240
- Okay, I'm gonna get to our guests.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,600
You guys hang tight for just one second.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:14,800
I asked Patrick.

5
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,640
- Still?

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,480
- Yeah.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,120
(laughing)

8
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,320
I asked Patrick to get me a cup of coffee, right?

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,740
And we had doubts.

10
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,580
Everybody had doubts.

11
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:25,400
- Well yeah, so--

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,240
- 'Cause he didn't wanna do it.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,360
- I'll provide witness here.

14
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,400
He left the room and I said,

15
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,040
"I don't know if he knows how to do that."

16
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,840
- Yeah, and I was like, I had this horrible realization.

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,920
I said, "You know what?

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,340
"I think you might be right."

19
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:37,180
That's something he's never done before.

20
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,120
- 'Cause he doesn't drink coffee.

21
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:40,120
- Doesn't drink coffee, and only that.

22
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,360
It's not that he generally has a hard time doing stuff.

23
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,400
It's just that.

24
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,640
So he left and I was a little worried,

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,880
but he came back with this, right?

26
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,520
And I'm thinking, "Okay, by God, he did it."

27
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,760
He hands it to me, I feel it, it's cold.

28
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,200
I go, "Okay, it's iced coffee.

29
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,860
"He got it out of the wrong thing."

30
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,120
Wow, very funny.

31
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,040
He claims he did it on accident, right?

32
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,940
But then I take my first sip, hold on.

33
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,080
It's Dr. Pepper.

34
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,760
(laughing)

35
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,600
He put Dr. Pepper.

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,680
- If you want your coffee, it's over there.

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,000
- You also did get a coffee and you hate it?

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,680
Dude, fuck you.

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
Fuck you.

40
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,640
You are a piece of shit.

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,520
I don't like, you are pissing me off today.

42
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,880
Somebody wants a Dr. Pepper.

43
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,200
- It's actually Dr. Pepper.

44
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,040
- It's a diet Dr. Pepper.

45
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:24,860
- That's really funny.

46
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,700
- Yeah.

47
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,540
- That's really good.

48
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,100
- You know what sucks is I filled it up

49
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,420
outside before I came in and I didn't know that when you put the lid on

50
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:39,440
There's like that tiny hole right there. I put the lid on outside there. It just fucking sprayed it just

51
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:48,620
Were you were you even thinking like like that I was gonna feel it realize it was cold you thought yeah

52
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:53,320
I thought that you would think that I accidentally got you a cold coffee. You're a bad guy

53
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,380
extra money

54
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:00,880
- If you somehow heated up a fucking Sprite,

55
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,820
I am going to shoot you in the head.

56
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,660
- I wish I thought of that.

57
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:06,100
- I still put it in the also Dr. Pepper.

58
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,020
- That one's coffee.

59
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:11,240
- I swear to God, the first time we were here,

60
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:15,860
you did not the same thing, but you also fucked up on coffee.

61
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,980
I don't remember exactly, I think that one

62
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,020
was maybe more genuine.

63
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,420
But I remember we were waiting and waiting

64
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,460
for you to bring coffee back.

65
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,300
I swear to God.

66
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,160
- It might have been, yeah,

67
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,900
'cause I think that's when that deli was first getting built.

68
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,740
- So you were trying it out.

69
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:32,580
- I went and got some construction workers.

70
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:35,700
- I'll go ruin something over there to kind of celebrate.

71
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,540
We're here with--

72
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,820
- I'm saying you might be in a loop.

73
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,080
(laughing)

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,580
- Probably about the same time last year too.

75
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:44,620
We're here with Girl, God, Grace, and April.

76
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:45,460
How are y'all?

77
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,280
- We're doing good.

78
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
- We're doing good.

79
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,960
- Doing incredibly.

80
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,780
- We're doing great.

81
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,620
I'm April, that's Grace.

82
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,580
- This is Grace, that's April.

83
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,980
- We're doing really good.

84
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,620
- Are you guys getting ready to start

85
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,180
- The longest tour ever right here?

86
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,220
- We are about to do the longest tour ever.

87
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:00,180
- We're about to do the world's longest tour.

88
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,020
- They're calling it the world's longest tour.

89
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,700
They're saying it's not even allowed to be this long.

90
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:05,540
- Yeah.

91
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,380
- Somebody should stop me.

92
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,700
- They're saying we'll never be allowed

93
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,540
to go on a tour this long.

94
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,380
- Osha's gonna step in.

95
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,820
- They're saying that we're exploiting each other.

96
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,740
- Yes, they're saying we're exploiting each other.

97
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,700
They're saying it's insane to book a 300 seat theater

98
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,660
in Phoenix, Arizona to do anything.

99
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,500
(laughing)

100
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,140
They're saying that that was a bad decision.

101
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,540
They're saying that we shouldn't have done that.

102
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,100
Don't listen to them.

103
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,380
Here's what you do.

104
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,540
They're saying that that was a mistake.

105
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,420
Add a late show.

106
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,220
That's what you do.

107
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:31,720
Oh, no.

108
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,700
There you go.

109
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,540
You add another show.

110
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,380
You add a late show.

111
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,940
Because people will be like, oh, the demand is insane.

112
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,660
We've actually--

113
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,980
Well, people aren't buying tickets to the early one.

114
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,140
They're like, I'm going to be too awake.

115
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:42,620
We've actually--

116
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:43,860
I'm going to be in a tired head space.

117
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,620
I need to be drunk.

118
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:46,300
We've been telling everyone that the show is sold out.

119
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,300
That's why we have so many tickets there.

120
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,380
Because to create desire, we've been saying, oh, it's sold out.

121
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:55,180
You can't come don't you want a late-night giggly sleepover vibe? Yeah

122
00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,420
Don't you love the like you do a show in our pajamas learning when I was like younger?

123
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:08,260
Y'all don't sleep you don't sleep in pajamas I do you don't have PJs on with a butt flap

124
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,100
That's pretty crazy. Yeah, that's amazing sleep

125
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:32,780
Yeah, I think that like if you need anything to help you sleep if I thought I mean like a blanket or underwear

126
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:39,460
Sleep at all. You're also it's like you didn't

127
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:45,100
Using performance enhancing cloth, yes

128
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,700
- That's true.

129
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,400
- Do you guys ever think about how before you were

130
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,440
like doing shows like that, like selling shows on tour,

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,500
you would see people post maybe on their Instagram story

132
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
like low ticket warning or something,

133
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,640
and now you're on tour and you have a show

134
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,960
that is a 90 cap and you've sold four seats

135
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,400
and you're posting low ticket warning.

136
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,500
- Low ticket warning!

137
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,420
Low, low, low ticket warning.

138
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:09,120
- And you go, oh, okay.

139
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,960
- Yep, yep.

140
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,540
- And you're trying to trick everybody.

141
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,780
- They don't realize that what you're saying

142
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,860
is low ticket amount sold.

143
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,120
(laughing)

144
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,060
- Yeah, warning, warning, I'm going to kill myself

145
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,740
if the tickets remain this low.

146
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,580
(laughing)

147
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,420
- That's really good.

148
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,240
- The tickets sold.

149
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,860
- I'm gonna do a live stream where I hold a gun to my head

150
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,500
and threaten to kill myself if tickets don't sell out.

151
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,820
- Please, please, please, please, please buy these tickets.

152
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,980
- I'm gonna make the news.

153
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,980
I'm gonna get on the local news by doing that.

154
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,940
- A law of touring is people will,

155
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,780
whenever you're on like an earlier tour

156
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,700
or you're going to a city,

157
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,740
you've announced some cities

158
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,780
and their city isn't like announced,

159
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,920
they'll be like, "Oh, you gotta come to Orlando,

160
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,760
you gotta come to Orlando."

161
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,240
- I can't believe you're not coming to Orlando.

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,020
- And then that same person six months later will be like,

163
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:52,680
"You were in Orlando?"

164
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,940
(laughing)

165
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:59,240
- Oh man, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I can't make the show.

166
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,720
I actually don't live there.

167
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,980
(laughing)

168
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:07,260
- Hey, I'm sorry, I can't go to the show

169
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,820
because I checked out your comedy and I hated it.

170
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:12,060
(laughing)

171
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,860
- I actually saw a clip and I don't stand for it at all.

172
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:15,900
(laughing)

173
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,060
- That's what I do, I use a VPN, I send my IP to Indiana.

174
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,340
I leave 150 comments on every Instagram reel.

175
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,260
Oh my God, come to Indiana, please.

176
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,700
(laughing)

177
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,600
All of a sudden they're pulling up in Indiana.

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,940
But you do show up, but just people.

179
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,780
- You're the only person in the crowd.

180
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,980
- And I'm going like this.

181
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,820
(laughing)

182
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:34,640
- What's up, yo?

183
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,020
- Now that I have you here, I'd like to talk to you

184
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,540
about my restaurant idea.

185
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,380
(laughing)

186
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,420
I think that you two.

187
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,380
It's Smashburgers, but it's done different.

188
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,340
It's a new kind of Smashburger, where the bun is also a burger.

189
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:52,820
What if the mayo was just mayo?

190
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,860
Not a Thousand Island thing.

191
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,020
It was just straight up--

192
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm pretty much done with the Smashburgers.

193
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,580
I'm ready to go back to--

194
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,080
No.

195
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,180
Yeah, I'm going to fuck it.

196
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:06,540
The problem with the big boys is a bad quality--

197
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,380
Yeah, tell them the problem with big boys.

198
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,100
Bad quality smash burger is like fine. Yeah, but a bad quality like thick burger

199
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,420
Like that's been like in the freezer for a year tastes like shit

200
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:26,020
It's like to stack on a night you fucking yeah, I'm glad that smash burgers have taken that over

201
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,920
Yeah, I like the big like trend cuz that like

202
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,260
26 or 20 14 to like

203
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,460
2018 that's all you could fucking get is like like a $20 burger that way tall

204
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,700
Why do you have some burger era in your head of four years?

205
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:58,160
All right, we still kind of scold him for having a mental there's no what was tell me what was before 2014

206
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
What was the burger?

207
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm going to give you a year and you're going to tell me what the burgers were like.

208
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:10,160
I think before 2014, you'd have a regular sized burger that was over ketchuped.

209
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Yeah, I'm going to tell you in 2024, my type of burger is going to take off. It's going to be everywhere.

210
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:18,160
It's a smash burger, but it's smashed the other way.

211
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:24,160
It stands up in between the bun. It looks like a capital letter I if you look at it from the side.

212
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,160
But you still cook it top and bottom so it's completely raw for about 8 inches in the middle.

213
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,000
- It's a raw strip of beef.

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
- It's called a smash burger hot dog style.

215
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,600
- My dad used to make hot durgers when I was a kid.

216
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:36,440
- Oh, smash hot dogs would be great.

217
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,280
- You cut the hot dog in half.

218
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,240
- I made a hot burger in the toilet this morning.

219
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,480
(laughing)

220
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,320
- Come on, man.

221
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:48,360
My dad, David, he made a hot durger,

222
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,360
which you split.

223
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
- Hot durger.

224
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,020
(laughing)

225
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,860
- That fucking dad.

226
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,040
That's probably the day my mom was like,

227
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,240
I gotta divorce this guy.

228
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,080
(laughing)

229
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,760
'Cause he was in the living room.

230
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,480
She was like, I've got an amazing idea. It's called the hot burger.

231
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,400
She was like, Hey, I'm busy. Can you make dinner for the kids?

232
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,160
He's like, I got it. He's cutting hot dogs.

233
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,600
That's the problem with marriage is you have to get married to someone before

234
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,560
they come up with that idea.

235
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,000
There's always an invisible clock in everyone's life of like good relationship.

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,600
Well, cause now my dad's a, my dad has, he's a billionaire because of that idea.

237
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,400
Wait, you're Caleb Durger?

238
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
My dad David Derger.

239
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,040
Oh my god!

240
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,040
The hot Derger.

241
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,040
You're Caleb Derger.

242
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:39,580
It became such a ubiquitous thing in my house that my dad stopped calling them hot Dergers

243
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,680
and did just start calling them Dergers.

244
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,080
It's not that much of a step.

245
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:49,040
But that's how many times we eat them he'd be like, "Do you want Dergers tonight?"

246
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:55,760
It's interesting how many migrant workers have gone missing at the Derger plant.

247
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,760
Probably a lot.

248
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,880
- You do a dangerous job making durgers all day.

249
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,360
- Can you clarify for me what a hot durger is?

250
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,440
- You take a hot--

251
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,280
- A hot durger.

252
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,360
- A hot hamburger bun.

253
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,200
A hamburger bun.

254
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,040
- A hamburger bun?

255
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,860
(laughing)

256
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,160
A hot durger's on hamburger buns.

257
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,760
- You take a hamburger bun,

258
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,080
and instead of just cooking a hot dog,

259
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,360
you split the hot dog in half,

260
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,320
and you cook both sides,

261
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,840
but you leave the one end of the casing on

262
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,600
so that it has, so it's connected.

263
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,640
- They literally do that at Moo-Ya.

264
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,440
- Yeah, but my dad did it at Booyah.

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,180
That's what he called the kitchen.

266
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,760
Every time he took a bite of the Durger.

267
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,840
- Wait, does he cut the hot dog--

268
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,160
- Lengthwise. - Lengthwise.

269
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,680
But then does he cut it horizontally too?

270
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,520
- Depends on the bun.

271
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,120
- So it's just stick it out of the bun.

272
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,200
- Depends on the bun.

273
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,080
Well, I'm gonna be real. - You use two buns, right?

274
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,680
- Yeah, well you use two dogs.

275
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,160
You use two Durgers and you make kind of a lattice.

276
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,000
- Oh, a double.

277
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,400
- Yeah, you make a tic-tac-toe.

278
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,240
Yeah, you make Lincoln logs with the Durgers.

279
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,200
- That sounds really good.

280
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,200
It's just a hot dog.

281
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
It's really clever.

282
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,800
Both sides.

283
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,840
That's the innovation.

284
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,160
My dad was trying to maximize

285
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
surface area.

286
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,040
That's like a math problem.

287
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
That could be like a crispy perfect way.

288
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
He's pretty smart.

289
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,360
There was a YouTube video of

290
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
a guy.

291
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,880
So it was an advertisement

292
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,760
for a novelty meats

293
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
website.

294
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,040
And the whole video is this guy

295
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,360
selling big hot dogs.

296
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,400
And they're like the size of your

297
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,120
forearm. And it's a whole hot dog.

298
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:31,120
and he advertised it like you just cut off the like you cut off the part of the hot dog that you want and then you can just put it on the grill and just make it like that.

299
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,120
So it's basically like a big ass thing of bologna.

300
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:37,120
But, whoa, it was a good I watched that video a lot.

301
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
I thought that guy was really funny.

302
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
I really like hot dogs.

303
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,120
That's too big.

304
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,120
That is way too big.

305
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
That's way too big.

306
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,120
Hot dogs are like as far as stuff that's like that can give you cancer.

307
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,120
Hot dogs are like pretty much the number one food.

308
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
- Oh, yeah. - Oh, for sure.

309
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,120
- There's no better thing to eat at 3 a.m.

310
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
- They don't tell you this, but you're not supposed

311
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
to put them up your ass.

312
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,120
It's actually bad for you.

313
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
- That's carcinogenic.

314
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
- It's actually carcinogenic.

315
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
- Oh, there's the thing.

316
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
- Get it in through your anal.

317
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,120
- More people are getting-- I actually have--

318
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
it actually-- ass cancer, for that reason,

319
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,120
runs in my family, because we're just all incapable

320
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,120
of not putting the hot dog up my ass.

321
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,120
- My problem with the hot dog--

322
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,120
a big hot dog like this, it's like,

323
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,120
all right, you're adding a lot of meat.

324
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Come on, give me some more casing.

325
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,120
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah, we need more casing.

326
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,840
- More casing, we need more casing, you're right.

327
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,680
- A whole lot more casing.

328
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,600
- I have hot dogs at home for that reason,

329
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,120
but I always have hot dogs in my kitchen,

330
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,200
so I can't turn my back when she's over.

331
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,040
- That's right.

332
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,860
- She's like a clutch dog.

333
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,700
- I turn over and I'm like,

334
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,360
how do you shove that whole six pack in there?

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,200
(laughing)

336
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,040
- It's really good.

337
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,600
- Backwards through practice and training.

338
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,680
- It's kind of prairie dogging out a little bit.

339
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,520
- Yeah.

340
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,680
- The hot dog, 'cause so many are fitting.

341
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,760
- I love the idea of like insisting

342
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,720
that something is hereditary in your family,

343
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,680
but it's actually just all the way down the line,

344
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,320
you've all been so stupid enough to do the same.

345
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,520
Yeah, actually getting hit by a car is hereditary.

346
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,360
(laughing)

347
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,920
In my family, actually.

348
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,800
- I've been recently just not looking both ways

349
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,800
before I cross the street.

350
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:01,080
But not on purpose, I've just been walking with other people

351
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,680
and then just being kind of pulled out of the,

352
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,040
yeah, Noah had basically pulled me out of the crosswalk

353
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,120
the other day 'cause I just wasn't even looking.

354
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,480
I think I'm getting close to an accidental death.

355
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,200
- Well, you can actually build up a tolerance.

356
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,040
- You can build up a tolerance.

357
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
- You can build up a tolerance.

358
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,840
- Maybe I get hit by a golf cart first.

359
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,680
- You're working your way up.

360
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,420
- Five miles per hour, 10 miles per hour.

361
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,820
Really before a golf cart,

362
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,780
you could probably just have Patrick run at you.

363
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,620
- It's like--

364
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,460
- That's scary, that's scary to watch.

365
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:26,960
- It's like drugs, eventually even getting hit by a truck

366
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,300
won't do anything for you.

367
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,140
- That's true.

368
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,980
- You're gonna need bigger cars to get that same height.

369
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,300
- And then you'll have to get hit by a plane,

370
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,940
which is what some people said is why 9/11 happened.

371
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,780
- Yeah.

372
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,820
- Some business folks.

373
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,660
- Some business guys.

374
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,480
- They set it up.

375
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,740
- What they don't talk about is the extreme high

376
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,060
that everyone in this house has experienced.

377
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,380
- Did you guys ever--

378
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,540
- Real quick, I just want you to know,

379
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,760
you just foreshadowed the most insane arc of our lives,

380
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,660
which is that you said you're getting ready

381
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,800
to be hit by a car, and I have my road test

382
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,940
in like two weeks.

383
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,340
(laughing)

384
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,300
- Okay, wait a second.

385
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,140
- Something's bad.

386
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,140
- We gotta watch the news for the next month.

387
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,060
See what's up.

388
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:06,380
- I lost my thought, that was so--

389
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,060
Oh, did anybody ever tell you guys that when--

390
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,420
- No, just joking.

391
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,220
- No, I'll just drink my Dr. Pepper.

392
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,060
- Oh hey, Caleb.

393
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:14,900
- Did anybody--

394
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,540
- Caleb, Caleb, she doesn't, don't listen to her.

395
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,540
- I'm gonna ignore her.

396
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,500
- She's got eight hot dogs up her asshole right now.

397
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,780
- This will keep you preoccupied.

398
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:23,620
- My bone!

399
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,700
(laughing)

400
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,180
- Did anybody ever tell y'all in middle school

401
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,260
or some shit that burning alive actually feels really good?

402
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,100
- No.

403
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,920
- Really?

404
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,620
- You've asked us about this before

405
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,620
and we've told you no, that person was just crazy.

406
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,780
- I think that you wanna try it.

407
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,620
- I don't think that--

408
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,460
- I don't think that's how you can cry.

409
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,300
- I don't know if you can cry.

410
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,420
- What I have heard is that drowning feels really good.

411
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,260
- That's definitely not.

412
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,100
- I think dying just feels good.

413
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,920
- That's really not.

414
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,760
- Yeah.

415
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,600
- It feels amazing to die.

416
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,420
- Not for the first part of it.

417
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,260
- I love that no one can prove to me that.

418
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,700
- That's true, when you go to heaven

419
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,540
and you're in the clouds.

420
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,380
(laughing)

421
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:56,220
- Yeah.

422
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,060
- Floating up and seeing the entire world.

423
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,900
- Yeah, that probably feels pretty good.

424
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,620
- It's like an ecstasy as you're about to go.

425
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,940
- Well, yeah, 'cause you live,

426
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,620
every part of your life flashes before your eyes

427
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,660
and you remember all the times that you had sex

428
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,500
or you watched a funny movie.

429
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:11,860
Is that the same feeling that someone gets when they're jacking off and hanging themselves, right?

430
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,860
I think so you can't breathe

431
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,740
It is real

432
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:23,740
Every celebrity does it every celebrity died that way yeah Robin Williams died that way

433
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:28,660
That's what you know some people say that yeah, actually

434
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,780
my brother said

435
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,400
- That's how David Bowie died.

436
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,320
It's how Princess Diana died.

437
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,880
- Most celebrities, yes, that's true.

438
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,840
That's what she was doing in the car on the avenue.

439
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,460
- Dude in his speeding car is,

440
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,520
I mean, she pulled it off, she came before she died.

441
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,360
- The ultimate dream, yeah.

442
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,180
(laughing)

443
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,220
She had a belt that was wrapped around the steering wheel,

444
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:50,060
around that guy that was with her, and around her neck.

445
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,340
And she was kind of in this like perfectly suspended,

446
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,940
where any way that she moved,

447
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,780
it would add tension to her neck.

448
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:55,620
- That's really good.

449
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,300
- That's why she was in a white Bronco.

450
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,900
- She was in a white Bronco,

451
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,900
And she was running from those LAPD.

452
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,300
They have really good belt loop.

453
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,820
The wheel has a very good belt loop thing

454
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,580
that you can put the belt through.

455
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,660
That's why I think OJ didn't do the murder.

456
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,860
Oh yeah, explain that.

457
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,540
There's a lot of evidence to him having been,

458
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:20,980
you know, jacking off with a belt around his neck at that time.

459
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,580
In the house. He was in the house.

460
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,340
He just didn't want to admit it.

461
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,980
That's why the gloves shrank too.

462
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,180
Yeah. Right.

463
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,100
It is so fun to ... I don't think he did it.

464
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,700
I think if somebody says that OJ did it, I still think they're racist.

465
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,660
I'm like, "Yeah, no.

466
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,660
You're wrong."

467
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,020
I also think he did not do it.

468
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
He's innocent.

469
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,020
There's a crazy maniac.

470
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
He's still on the loose.

471
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:42,900
I still need to learn about this case.

472
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:47,900
Well, hey, do you need to learn about it or do you need to just learn how to trust a friend?

473
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:48,900
Yeah.

474
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:49,900
I think we need to look at all the evidence.

475
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,900
You don't think that we know what we're talking about?

476
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,200
I'm still down the middle.

477
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,900
I think if they were to reopen the case right now, I could probably be on that jury.

478
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,900
You'd be a jury.

479
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,900
Yeah.

480
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,500
- I'm gonna assign you to the case as a detective.

481
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,000
- Whoa. - Put you in a trench coat.

482
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,840
- That's really good. - Imagine being

483
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,860
trying to figure out the OJ case.

484
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,540
- How do detectives do that shit?

485
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:12,020
How the fuck do they get to a body and go like,

486
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,340
I get-- - This room smells weird.

487
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,620
- Yeah, it smells like their brother.

488
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,540
- Well, they train.

489
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,380
They train. - They train.

490
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,260
- A lot of nose baits. - They train.

491
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,780
- Well, they practice on a bunch of cases

492
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,460
of people who've been killed that don't really matter,

493
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,820
like homeless people or people who are weird people

494
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,180
who people don't like, and then eventually

495
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,020
they work their way up. - And you have to work,

496
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,860
- Work your way up from solving simple things

497
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,580
like is he dead to how did he die?

498
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,660
You have to really start at the bottom.

499
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,300
- That's really important to be able to tell

500
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,420
if someone's dead first.

501
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,260
- Totally.

502
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,940
You have to kind of learn how to do that.

503
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,660
Yeah, I used to want to be a detective,

504
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,020
but I was really bad at telling when someone was dead.

505
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,860
- Yeah, she thinks I'm dead all the time.

506
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,300
- I would spend years solving a case

507
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,900
only to find out the guy's been alive the whole time.

508
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,740
- Really?

509
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,580
- You didn't even see the body also.

510
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,400
- I didn't even see the body.

511
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,380
I just kind of jumped to the--

512
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,580
- Maybe he missed work.

513
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,420
- Yeah, it was just a big thing.

514
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,860
- Sometimes I'll be talking to April

515
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:58,260
for like 10 minutes and she'll be like,

516
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,140
"Holy shit, are you a ghost right now?"

517
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,980
(laughing)

518
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:01,820
I'm like, "No, I'm still here."

519
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,100
- It's so annoying when you're talking to April

520
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,140
and she tries to put her hand through you.

521
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,580
- She's constantly poking me.

522
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,420
- Oh, okay, okay.

523
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,020
- Listen, I've been fooled before, okay?

524
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:13,420
And I'm not gonna let it happen to me again.

525
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,460
- Who fooled you?

526
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,660
- It's not, it doesn't matter.

527
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,740
It's not important.

528
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,220
- Ghostly Carmichael.

529
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,860
- It's, yep.

530
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,900
- Ghostly Carmichael, is that what you said?

531
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:23,940
(laughing)

532
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,380
- That's the name of the famous ghost in Fooled April.

533
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,120
- Ghostly Carmichael.

534
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,100
- He's always getting into,

535
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,820
and I think that there was a certain amount

536
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,540
of romantic tension between the two at one point.

537
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,380
- Yeah.

538
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,300
- And I think that--

539
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,900
- Wait, between me and Ghostly Carmichael?

540
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,140
- Between you and Ghostly Carmichael.

541
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:42,980
- I don't believe him, I don't think he's real.

542
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,900
- Only from his direction though.

543
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,740
- Oh yeah.

544
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,580
(laughing)

545
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:48,580
- But he was really trying to make you believe

546
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:50,380
he was real so you would date him.

547
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,940
Or he was still alive so you would date him.

548
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,180
- I have a Casper question,

549
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,860
but you two might be the ones to ask about that.

550
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,900
- Yeah, probably. - Yeah, totally.

551
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,020
- With Casper-- - And why's that?

552
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,460
- I just feel like y'all maybe know something about ghosts.

553
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,620
You've been talking about ghosts for a couple of minutes.

554
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,700
With Casper, is Casper confined to,

555
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,340
does he have to live in that fucking house?

556
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:08,380
- Yeah. - Really?

557
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,220
So if you're that,

558
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:11,300
because you're like a kid-- - It's actually his punishment.

559
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,460
He did something horrible when he was alive.

560
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,020
- He was seriously-- - Those walls could talk.

561
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,780
- His eternal torment is living in that house forever.

562
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,620
- The live action movies, I do think he has something--

563
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,580
- That boy was horny.

564
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,700
Let's just say that boy was corny.

565
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,420
- In the old school cartoons,

566
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:30,060
he would be on the moon and stuff sometimes.

567
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:30,900
- Yeah, really?

568
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,740
- He'd be everywhere.

569
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,620
- So he was, at one point he was a boy?

570
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,460
- If you were.

571
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,280
- At one point he was a boy.

572
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,120
- What the fuck did he look like?

573
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,960
Did he look like that?

574
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,780
- He looked like that, yeah.

575
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,620
- He was bald and giant eyes?

576
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,100
- He looked small and pointy on the bottom too.

577
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,940
- Of course he died.

578
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,420
- He was killed by the government.

579
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:46,260
- Yeah.

580
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,080
(laughing)

581
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,920
- This is not how he looked.

582
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,140
- He was road killed.

583
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,780
Roadkill and his body just sat on the side of the road

584
00:19:52,780 --> 00:20:04,320
What I really don't believe that yeah, I don't believe that at all I don't believe

585
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:12,540
Remember him that was the headline by the way in case you missed it if Casper was in my house though

586
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,940
Especially if I'm like a bolt like a growing boy

587
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,940
- Wait, what is that?

588
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,580
(laughing)

589
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,420
- Does that just mean he died as a kid?

590
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,680
(laughing)

591
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:29,120
- Yeah, my son wanted to be Casper so bad that he died.

592
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:29,960
(laughing)

593
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,140
- I took him out back for his birthday.

594
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,740
(laughing)

595
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,260
- He wanted to be Casper.

596
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,100
- Wait, somebody needs to--

597
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,260
- I had to give him his birthday present.

598
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,820
I had to go take him out.

599
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:40,660
- Yeah.

600
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,500
- Wait, somebody needs to let Casper's--

601
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,540
- Casper's low-key bad.

602
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,500
- Someone needs to let his spirit free.

603
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,900
Yeah, 100%.

604
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,980
- The Casper movie is so weird

605
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,780
because there's this romantic tension

606
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,020
between Casper and the girl.

607
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,340
- Is he pointy on the bottom?

608
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,180
Am I misremembering?

609
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,000
- Well, that's the thing.

610
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,260
If I was a girl growing up in the Casper house,

611
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,500
I'd be fucking that ghost every day.

612
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,220
- But it's like a toddler.

613
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,060
- Oh man, you were, hey, he's not a toddler.

614
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:04,900
- Hey, come on.

615
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,740
- I know, he's a buddy.

616
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,780
He does, it's weird that she's into this--

617
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,060
- He's like 80 years old.

618
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:12,020
- It's weird that she's into this smooth toddler.

619
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:16,340
Is that he died as a hairless baby or he died as a

620
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:25,060
In this version he died like as a 14 year old or something, but he certainly

621
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:35,460
He basically be a couch I just be like kind of experimenting with my ass

622
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,300
- With your ass.

623
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,140
- I don't know what girls do.

624
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,960
I don't fucking know.

625
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:41,300
- If I was in the Casper house and I wanted to free him,

626
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,180
I feel like the way you free him is you probably just have

627
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,180
to defile his grave or something, right?

628
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,540
I'd be out in the backyard trying to dig him up

629
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,540
and piss all over his body.

630
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:54,540
- You're digging him, why is he buried in the backyard?

631
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,340
- He's a ghost in the house,

632
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:58,180
he must be around there somewhere.

633
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,620
- Though you die, I think--

634
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,420
- There used to be a lot of ghosts in the house.

635
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,260
- I think there's a lot of ghosts in the house.

636
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,580
- I think there's a lot of ghosts in the house.

637
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,580
There used to be a lot less land.

638
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,580
Yeah, there's way more land.

639
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,580
Alright, fine. Then I go, okay. I go to the...

640
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
Bury someone in your backyard because there just wasn't land for a day.

641
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,580
Or maybe he was like...

642
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:18,580
Then I just go to the graveyard. I'll dig up every kid and see which one's...

643
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,580
Just piss on all their bodies until he disappears.

644
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,580
Rub a bone.

645
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
Rub a bone against your dick.

646
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:27,580
My bone!

647
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
Yeah, we get it, April.

648
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,580
Nice bit, April.

649
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:33,580
He still has a bone now.

650
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:39,860
If I had a I would Casper would be a serious Ghostbusters situation for me. I'd be wanting him exterminated

651
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,760
Calling the Ghostbusters on they're like torturing this ghost child

652
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:59,900
I would yeah, I would call the Ghostbusters and on Casper and I would see like their antics

653
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,100
I would see they're a little goofy and I'd be like no you guys get out of here

654
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,100
I need people who are fucking serious about this.

655
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,100
We're gonna fucking kill this ghost and get rid of him.

656
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,100
I don't want you joking around and dancing.

657
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,100
No, you wouldn't want to do that. You'd get hit by one of Bill Murray's sarcastic quips.

658
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
I'd slap Bill Murray.

659
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
I'd slap the shit out of Bill Murray.

660
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:17,100
I'd be like, "Bow!" Back of the hand. Right to the face.

661
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
I'd knock his teeth out.

662
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,100
I do think I could take on all of the Ghostbusters.

663
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,100
Dude, if Bill Murray pulled up and started eating my fucking critch for guys, dude,

664
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,100
I would be his old man shit.

665
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
I'd say, "Believe this, bitch!"

666
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:33,100
- Have the Ghostbusters ever tried just using a real gun on you?

667
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
- I don't think so, they should.

668
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,100
Especially the fucking Stay Puft Marshmallow Man.

669
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
You blow some holes in him.

670
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:41,100
- I honestly feel like a gun could just kill it.

671
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,100
- Yeah, probably.

672
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,100
- I think it'd be fine.

673
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,100
- A lot of their ghosts are just monsters.

674
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:52,100
- It is ostensibly a ghost, or ostensibly this mythic thing,

675
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:56,100
but it has heft in a way that others don't.

676
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
- It explodes.

677
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,140
- Yeah, because they use their fucking proton packs

678
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,180
and unlike all the other ones,

679
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,340
it just makes it go on fire.

680
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
- Yeah.

681
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,020
- Like it's not like.

682
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,860
(laughing)

683
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,680
- True.

684
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,660
- They have such an easy,

685
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,660
I rewatched Ghostbusters pretty recently

686
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,900
and I was shocked at how easy of a time they have

687
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,500
defeating the big bad.

688
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,020
They really just have to like shoot him

689
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,300
and when that's not quite enough,

690
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,660
they're like, all right, let's cross the streams

691
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,500
and then that works.

692
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,340
(laughing)

693
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,500
- Yeah, oh, that's what it was.

694
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:30,700
I was like, don't they just like, don't they just think like,

695
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,060
"Oh, it's not real anymore. It's Freddy Krueger."

696
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,700
I conflated the two.

697
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,300
Wait, that's the ending of Freddy Krueger?

698
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,900
Is that really?

699
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,300
No, the real ending of Nightmare on Elm Street is even funnier than that.

700
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:43,700
They drag him into the real world and they like get him or whatever.

701
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,900
And then at the very end, the kids are like, "All right, bye!"

702
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,300
Like they're leaving and they go and they get into a car

703
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:53,300
and the car is the same colors as Freddy Krueger and it goes, "Ha ha ha ha ha!"

704
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,300
And he drives away.

705
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:59,300
- The mom gets pulled through the tiniest window.

706
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,140
- That's happened to me.

707
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:00,980
- Yeah.

708
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,800
- Whoa.

709
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,300
- But at the end he's a car, he turns into a car.

710
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,140
- Yeah.

711
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,980
- He turns into a car.

712
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,480
- That's like the twist ending is that he was a car all along.

713
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,540
- I don't know if he was a car all along.

714
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,380
- It's a twist ending.

715
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,220
- The whole time he was a car all along.

716
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,700
- The twist ending is probably that they're in a dream.

717
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,540
- No, you know what I mean.

718
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,360
- He's a car all along.

719
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,200
- In the real world he's a car all along.

720
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,440
- That's kind of the experts here

721
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,100
on what people were all along.

722
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,860
(laughing)

723
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,380
- He was a car all along.

724
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,220
- He was a herbie?

725
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,620
- He was a car all along.

726
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,420
- What if they retconned it and made him back

727
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,940
into a pedophile the rest of the movie?

728
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,180
- He was a boy who got transformed into a car.

729
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,180
- Yeah, he was a transformer.

730
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,020
He was a Decepticon.

731
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,780
(laughing)

732
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:35,980
- He was a transformer.

733
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:39,620
- I would watch kind of a dark Transformers reboot

734
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:43,300
about just a single Transformer car.

735
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,860
He's not a pedophile, but maybe he's--

736
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,420
- I thought you were going in the same line

737
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,260
as Freddy Krueger.

738
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,180
- Oh, a Transformers version of Dexter.

739
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,020
- Oh, yeah.

740
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,300
- Where he's like a Decepticon,

741
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:56,300
but he gets hired by the LAPD to destroy,

742
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,820
to kill every single person in Skid Row.

743
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:02,500
- I want a sitcom about a decepticon.

744
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,700
- Yeah, no, he just comes and he starts hitting 'em.

745
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,220
I think it's just a bunch of news stories

746
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:10,580
that are like crazy hit and run in Skid Row.

747
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:13,220
- A decepticon hitting a guy and then the cops show up

748
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,900
and he turns back into a transformer

749
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,340
and is like, "I didn't see anything."

750
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,540
(laughing)

751
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,700
- What, you think I can drive?

752
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,860
- Yeah, you think I can drive?

753
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,860
I'm a huge robot!

754
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,860
How would I fit in a car?

755
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:25,860
I can't drive one of these fucking cruisers!

756
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Yeah, I'd drive a fucking, I'd drive a beetle.

757
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
I have a Volkswagen.

758
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,860
I can't fucking kill anybody.

759
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,860
What are those wheels in your chest that are covered in blood?

760
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,860
Are those supposed to do anything?

761
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,860
Trust me though, if I was a car, I'd look cool as fuck.

762
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:41,860
But I can't be one. I can't be one.

763
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
Not today.

764
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,860
Oh, why do I have these wheels?

765
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,860
On my arms?

766
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:50,860
- Oh, that's just how my people do things.

767
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,700
- Yeah, that's robot jewelry.

768
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,020
- This is jewelry, yeah.

769
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,620
- You could get away with actually killing somebody

770
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,460
with your car by being like,

771
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:01,300
"No, my car's a transformer," and it took,

772
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,140
I had no control.

773
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,020
- "Is this Tesla right now?"

774
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,860
(laughing)

775
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,660
- I guess you're right.

776
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,640
But then you have to be like,

777
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,180
"No, see, he's gonna transform."

778
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,020
But then it's inaccurate.

779
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,020
- That's really good.

780
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,220
No, I'm pretty sure my car is a transformer.

781
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,060
- Yeah, what kind of car do you have?

782
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,540
- I haven't seen it transform, but I'm pretty sure.

783
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:20,700
- It's a transformer, but it's like gayer than any of the--

784
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,900
- My car's the one fruity transformer.

785
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:24,420
(laughing)

786
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,260
Hello.

787
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,420
(laughing)

788
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,260
I'm a decepticon.

789
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:31,140
- She has a bright canary yellow Fiat.

790
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:31,980
- Oh, that is a gay car.

791
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:34,780
- Or like a bright canary yellow Faggot, you know?

792
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:35,620
- Yes.

793
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,460
- Yeah.

794
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,280
- I get what you're saying.

795
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,900
- Yeah, it's the gay transformer.

796
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,580
- The one gay transformer turns into a gay ass car.

797
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,100
- I think Michael Bay might be,

798
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,780
probably next movie there will be a gay transformer.

799
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,620
- There will have a gay ass transformer.

800
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:47,020
- They've literally had to hold him back

801
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:51,020
every single movie. He's been like walking towards the computer to write a

802
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:55,120
script and they're like, "The interns are grabbing him. No, no, no, we need this job!"

803
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
They're showing him like a Beats pill. He puts a Beats pill in his ass.

804
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,020
He puts a Beats pill in his fucking ass.

805
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:04,520
The 100,000 like interns whose job it is just to render like different body parts

806
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,020
of the transporter, like, "No, please! Please, no!"

807
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,020
He has like a, they even, yeah, they got that.

808
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,520
"We're gonna get in trouble! We'll get in trouble if you make a gay one!"

809
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Michael Bay's like, "I get it, we can't do gay, we can't do gay.

810
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,520
"We're a gay Filipina."

811
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
(laughter)

812
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
And they're like, "Oh yeah, go ahead."

813
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
"We're not gonna do the gay one, but here's my pitch for a new Transformer named Rickshaw."

814
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
(laughter)

815
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
(laughter)

816
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
They're like, "Go right ahead."

817
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
"Go right ahead, that's fine."

818
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
His gay Transformer would literally have like a baboon ass.

819
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
(laughter)

820
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,520
Like a bright, with like neon signs pointing into an asshole.

821
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
His anus would prolapse into a cannon.

822
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,780
(laughing)

823
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,600
- That's really good.

824
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,440
- That's really, that's really good.

825
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,760
- You're just seeing him go to a gas station.

826
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,600
(laughing)

827
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,440
- Jessica, and they're like,

828
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,140
"Oh wait, how do I fill it up?"

829
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,400
(laughing)

830
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,040
- What about, there's a transformer

831
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,880
that turns into like a sex machine when he's in the car.

832
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,700
(laughing)

833
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,540
- He's never in a car.

834
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,380
(laughing)

835
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,120
- He's never in a car.

836
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,280
- He turns into a little box and goes, "Ahh!"

837
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,120
(laughing)

838
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,280
- He has no idea how cars work also.

839
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,120
He's like, "So gay."

840
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,380
(laughing)

841
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,880
- It is cool that they have transformers that turn into--

842
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,560
- They should have a hot girl transformer.

843
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,400
- They do. - Do they really?

844
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,440
- Yeah, they do. - No, not--

845
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
- They have a hot girl spider transformer.

846
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,720
- Yeah, they have a literal hot girl transformer.

847
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
- Oh yeah. - Oh wait.

848
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,520
- Does it have tires here?

849
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:34,160
- Yeah, it's like the not Megan Fox, the other girl,

850
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,920
and then she turns into a robot.

851
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,560
So she's a transformer who can transform into a human?

852
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,720
- 12 or 13 and seeing that--

853
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,960
- Imagine your girlfriend's arms just fall off.

854
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,100
- What the fuck, they could be anywhere.

855
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,260
(laughing)

856
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,980
- They could be.

857
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:48,160
They literally could be.

858
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,400
- They have one that's a big spider too.

859
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,880
- The spider lady, I think they took like the,

860
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,720
I was reading some article about this.

861
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,400
- She's fine fine, how lady?

862
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,660
- They took all of the designers or whatever

863
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,920
to a strip club to like make the,

864
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,680
for like reference stuff. - Oh my god.

865
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,600
- And they, all the notes about the--

866
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,920
- They didn't know how to woman look?

867
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,960
- No, they were transformers, design artists.

868
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,240
- They had to go to the fucking strip club?

869
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,800
- They were like, the design notes and stuff

870
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,840
were like so horny that they were like,

871
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:14,680
all right, we gotta like,

872
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,640
we gotta cut back on this.

873
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,040
- And her pussy's fucking red.

874
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,240
(laughing)

875
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,920
It's basically like a big target.

876
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,000
- Hot pink, red.

877
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,040
(laughing)

878
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,880
Right, red.

879
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,700
- Right, red.

880
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,480
- And she probably gets her period

881
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,880
and nuts and bolts fly out.

882
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,120
(laughing)

883
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,240
Yeah.

884
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,280
We should go back to that.

885
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,100
- Yeah, that's good.

886
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,940
- Yeah, that's good, right?

887
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:37,780
- Do that, do that.

888
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,120
- And the boobs are two tires.

889
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:39,960
- Yeah.

890
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,640
- The boobs are two tires 'cause she's a motorcycle.

891
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,600
- That's really good.

892
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,640
Oh, she's a motorcycle.

893
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
- When she squirts, it's movie theater pop.

894
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,880
(laughing)

895
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,240
- And her lips are candy.

896
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,720
(laughing)

897
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,480
- She gets wet and there's just oil dripping.

898
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,920
- And also, yeah, she has long hair, too.

899
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,760
- Normal hair.

900
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,080
Normal hair.

901
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,120
It's not even metal.

902
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,960
It's real hair.

903
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,240
- She reminds me of my mom.

904
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,580
- It's real hair.

905
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,520
(laughing)

906
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,840
- Oh my God, a trans woman with real hair

907
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,400
that turns into a car that just has hair on the front.

908
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,440
(laughing)

909
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,940
- Why does this car have a wig?

910
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:15,200
(laughing)

911
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,880
- Who's the hottest Transformers babe?

912
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,080
- It's just human hair.

913
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,200
- How, dude, what kind of pipe was that?

914
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,360
- Whoa! - Oh my God!

915
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,840
- Holy crap! - What the hell?

916
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,800
- They need to chill. - Oh my God, those knees.

917
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,640
- They need to chill.

918
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,120
- Why is there a lens flare on its boob?

919
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
- That's its nipple.

920
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,160
- That's part of it. - Nipples are lens flares.

921
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,840
(laughing)

922
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:38,520
- How strong was, Shia LaBeouf had the most insane pipe game

923
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:40,040
of all time. - Definitely.

924
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,080
- In those movies.

925
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:41,920
- He was funny AF in those movies.

926
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,560
- He was pulling some fire women.

927
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,640
- Definitely. - Back to back to back.

928
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:47,380
And he was like 15.

929
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,220
- Yeah. - That's so crazy.

930
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,040
- I think he was 12.

931
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:49,880
- Yeah, he was one or two years old.

932
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,840
- That's the weirdest part of those movies

933
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,320
is that child of F is supposed to be like a teenager.

934
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,160
- Yeah. - Yeah.

935
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:55,980
- And he's fucking-- - He doesn't look

936
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,820
like a goddamn teenager.

937
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,840
- He's fucking Megan Fox on his friend's head.

938
00:31:58,840 --> 00:31:59,680
- Absolutely. - Like his best--

939
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,720
(laughing)

940
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:02,920
- That's actually true.

941
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,480
- His best friend in the world is like,

942
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,540
"Can you open up your body?

943
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,880
"I'm gonna fuck a tanny."

944
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,360
(laughing)

945
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,840
In the middle of you. - Imagine you've had sex

946
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:13,280
with a guy like a bunch of times and all of a sudden the car you've been having

947
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:17,280
sex the whole time like wakes up. Oh shit, oh shit, it's been here the whole time.

948
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Oh shit, the car left.

949
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:26,840
Like Megan Fox's character is like, I've never had a threesome and Sheila Booth's character is like, what do you mean?

950
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
Every time we fuck in my car, that's the threesome.

951
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,840
It would have been.

952
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,840
Bumblebee is a member of our relationship. This is a throuple.

953
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,880
- Every time they're having sex in the car,

954
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,980
like a mechanical penis starts to come out.

955
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,920
(laughing)

956
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,840
- Just very slowly, just kind of lift.

957
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,840
- And then Shia keeps hitting it and it goes back down.

958
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,920
- The seatbelt buckle.

959
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
- Yeah, the seatbelt buckle starts to turn up.

960
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:50,200
Or like the hood of the car opens or something.

961
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,040
Yeah, that's good.

962
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:51,880
- It just, "Vroom."

963
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,240
- That's really good, yeah.

964
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,160
Shia, why is your car, what's happening with your car?

965
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,000
Oh, don't worry.

966
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,440
- Bumblebee, you can't make it bigger than mine.

967
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,280
Come on.

968
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,840
- It would have been cooler if he,

969
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,360
instead of him owning Bumblebee,

970
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,160
if he had bought Optimus Prime.

971
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,000
- Does he own Bumblebee?

972
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,240
- He drove so much truck around.

973
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,080
- Wait, does he own Bumblebee?

974
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,800
- He bought it for like three grand.

975
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,640
- Oh wait, I love the idea that--

976
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,480
- He bought it for Bernie Mac.

977
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,680
- He's actually like enslaved.

978
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,720
- Oh yeah, he's a slave.

979
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,520
Yeah, Bumblebee is a slave, 100%.

980
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,360
- But he likes it, he wants to stay.

981
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,000
- Do the cars respect ownership?

982
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,840
- Bumblebee is--

983
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,040
- That little Bumblebee at the end of the first movie--

984
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,440
- Sorry, sorry Bumblebee, but your insurance lapsed.

985
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,400
(laughing)

986
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,240
- We gotta crush you into a cube.

987
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,640
- I forgot to pay the car, you're getting a repo.

988
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,920
Unfortunately, Bumblebee got repoed.

989
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:33,120
Bumblebee can't talk, he can't even talk, he can only speak through the radio, and then

990
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,680
at the end of the first movie, the Transformers are going away, they're leaving or whatever,

991
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,120
and then Bumblebee, he gets the ability to speak for the first time, and the first thing

992
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,120
he says is, "I will stay with the boy."

993
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,960
Bumblebee is the same logic as Pluto in Mickey Mouse.

994
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
He's pretty much a dog.

995
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,200
He's the only one who can't talk, and he has an owner.

996
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Interesting.

997
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
It's just you don't ask the question.

998
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,160
Well, there are some that even more can't talk.

999
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:01,280
Some that are just go like, "Rawr!"

1000
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,200
And they're just big monsters.

1001
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,360
- Some are dinosaurs also.

1002
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
- That's so true.

1003
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,200
That's really true.

1004
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,840
- There's a lot of Transformers lore

1005
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,260
that I did not even fucking think existed

1006
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,660
until I met Cameron.

1007
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,500
- He knows everything.

1008
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,400
- Really? - I don't know anything.

1009
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,240
I only know about the Michael Bay ones.

1010
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,560
- Have you read any of the comics?

1011
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,400
- No.

1012
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,240
- The comics are crazy.

1013
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,920
- Yeah, I would like to.

1014
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,320
- I didn't know you knew about Transformers too.

1015
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,240
- You would.

1016
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,760
You would know about Transformers.

1017
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,840
That's too many. - Two people in my life

1018
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,720
that know a lot about Transformers.

1019
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,880
- That's too many.

1020
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,520
I don't even know anything about Transformers.

1021
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,360
I just like them.

1022
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,180
I just think they're cool.

1023
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,480
- It's a modern day space opera.

1024
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,320
- Yeah.

1025
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,160
(laughing)

1026
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:35,980
- I have to look into it now.

1027
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,820
- I don't know about that.

1028
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:37,840
- It's pretty sick.

1029
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:38,680
- It's very cool.

1030
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,920
- I only saw the first three though.

1031
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,760
I didn't see the rest of them.

1032
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,580
- Dude, five is so sick.

1033
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,780
- I saw the first one, that's it.

1034
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,280
- Are they good past that?

1035
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,320
- Five is really good.

1036
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,640
Four is kind of bad.

1037
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,480
- Okay, why?

1038
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,720
- Five, the earth explodes

1039
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,640
and they fight on all the different parts of the earth.

1040
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,480
- Oh, that's cool.

1041
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,300
- They're like flying around.

1042
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,160
- Wait, I saw the one with, who is it?

1043
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:56,220
- Mark Wahlberg?

1044
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,720
Or some guy who looks like Mark Wahlberg?

1045
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,560
- That's the one.

1046
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,600
- TJ Miller's in that.

1047
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,480
- Oh yeah, it's like Mark Wahlberg and his daughter?

1048
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,320
- Yeah.

1049
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,140
- Okay, that's the fourth one.

1050
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:04,980
- And TJ Miller dies.

1051
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:05,880
- I saw that one.

1052
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,720
Oh, whoa.

1053
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,540
- He does.

1054
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,920
- Oh yeah, he gets him turned into metal.

1055
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,760
- That's so cool.

1056
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:11,760
- Yeah, 'cause he's like,

1057
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,400
isn't TJ Miller one of the science guys?

1058
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,160
- No, he's like his dumb friend.

1059
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:17,000
- Oh, okay.

1060
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,840
- Yeah.

1061
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:18,660
- Yeah.

1062
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:20,680
- He's just like, "Holy crap, there's freaking

1063
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,520
transformers."

1064
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,680
- And then he gets brutalized.

1065
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,720
- Yeah, and then he gets turned into a metal statue

1066
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:25,720
And then it explodes.

1067
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,720
Wow, that's so cool.

1068
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,720
It is pretty cool. It's the only part I've ever seen.

1069
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,520
Even, they even like, they wrote Megan Fox out of the movies like completely no, nothing.

1070
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,820
They just like, she was in a movie and then she wasn't in a movie.

1071
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:39,220
But TJ Miller, they were like, no, we're going to kill him on screen really crazy.

1072
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,220
This character's not going to be in anymore.

1073
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,420
We're going to really destroy him.

1074
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:48,320
That's the only scene from that movie I've ever watched because I just YouTube just TJ Miller death scene and it came out.

1075
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,920
The scene where he's Mark Wahlberg's in like a barn and he gets up and just goes,

1076
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,520
I think we found a transformer.

1077
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,020
Yeah.

1078
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,020
He's so fucking sick.

1079
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,020
He's still got like the Boston accent even though he's in like Kansas or something.

1080
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,520
He's supposed to be like a bum kid.

1081
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,020
You know what his name is in those movies?

1082
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,820
Gigg.

1083
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,020
Cade Yeager.

1084
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:09,020
Oh yeah, we've talked about Cade.

1085
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,020
Cade Yeager.

1086
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,020
And he's in love with a girl named Vivian Wembley.

1087
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,020
She sounds rich.

1088
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,020
Yeah.

1089
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,520
She sounds sexy.

1090
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,020
She's a beautiful British woman.

1091
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:19,020
Does her legs up?

1092
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:20,020
Oh, she long legs.

1093
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
Is that the daughter?

1094
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,020
Or is that a different person?

1095
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,020
Yeah, that's his daughter.

1096
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:25,280
(laughing)

1097
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,120
- He's in love with his daughter.

1098
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,960
- That's a beautiful British guy.

1099
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,980
(laughing)

1100
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,900
- That's really awesome.

1101
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,480
- I would love to drop Mark Wahlberg

1102
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,540
in the middle of London and just let him

1103
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:33,380
do whatever he wants.

1104
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,480
- There's a documentary.

1105
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,460
- Listen, if Mark Wahlberg was in London,

1106
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,800
things would have gone down a little bit.

1107
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,640
(laughing)

1108
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,800
Just in general, just in general.

1109
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,640
- Everything would be different.

1110
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,000
It'd still be fucking Peaky Blinders over there right now.

1111
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,840
- Oh yeah.

1112
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,680
- He would have made sure.

1113
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,220
- Yeah, the Irish would take over.

1114
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,060
- Yeah.

1115
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:49,880
- Is he Irish?

1116
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,720
- Yeah.

1117
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,560
- Oh.

1118
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,380
- Is he?

1119
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:55,620
He's a he's he's Boston Irish

1120
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:02,340
It's funny

1121
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:19,740
Thank you

1122
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,740

1123
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:32,420
You know it's Wow actually

1124
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:38,060
But it's

1125
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:44,580
Where you buy the domain google.com or something hoping someone will go there by somebody will accidentally walk into wall

1126
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:54,180
We have to sit on this domain, I think that Marky Mark is gonna fuck in he's gonna make a wall food soon

1127
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,060
Yeah, he's a used car dealership in like, Ohio. Do you know that?

1128
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,740
Yeah, he's got like in it like

00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:10,960
He goes he goes to every talks to every

1130
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:15,960
- He thinks every one of them might be a Transformer.

1131
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,000
- Opening, yeah.

1132
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
- Come on.

1133
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,680
- Come on.

1134
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,520
- Every day he walks in and I'm like,

1135
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,340
"I know you can fucking do it."

1136
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,180
- I know you can do it.

1137
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,020
- I think I found a Transformer.

1138
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,840
- No, no, Mark.

1139
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,640
- No, the Chargers, I know the Chargers

1140
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,480
is gonna talk to me.

1141
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,320
- No, Mark.

1142
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,140
- It's gonna fucking talk to me.

1143
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:27,980
- No, no, no.

1144
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,820
- It's gonna fucking talk to me.

1145
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,520
- Go home, go back to Boston, Mark.

1146
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,360
- Come on, Mark.

1147
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,480
- Mark, we don't want you here, you don't own this place.

1148
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,120
- I know, I know, you put your name on the,

1149
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,200
you only bought your name on the building,

1150
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,540
- You only bought your name on the building,

1151
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,940
you don't own anything else.

1152
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,500
You don't have to leave us alone.

1153
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:46,140
You just bought the words, you need to put them somewhere.

1154
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,900
- He takes out a sack of McDonald's hamburgers

1155
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,500
and he gives them to each car,

1156
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,500
and then just takes one out and smashes it on the hood.

1157
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,540
It's like, is this food?

1158
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,180
Do you like this?

1159
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,020
- You like the food?

1160
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,860
- He's a--

1161
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,460
- I'm gonna feed you, you're my car.

1162
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,540
- He has like a half a billion dollars.

1163
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:02,460
- Dude, I'm surprised he doesn't have more than that.

1164
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,700
- He's also hella Catholic.

1165
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,340
- And ripped, by the way.

1166
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,700
- Yeah, and he sleeps like one hour a night.

1167
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,040
- God, we should do that.

1168
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,180
We should figure out how to do all that.

1169
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:14,020
- You already sleep one hour a night.

1170
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:14,860
- That's true.

1171
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,680
- I gotta work on that though.

1172
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,520
- I'm almost there, I'm almost there.

1173
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,980
- He's pretty much sleeps one hour a night.

1174
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,140
- That's Catholicism.

1175
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,340
- Yeah.

1176
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,700
- You should join his, what's his app called?

1177
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:23,540
It's called like--

1178
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,360
- Hallow.

1179
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,200
- Hallow, yeah.

1180
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,040
- I've seen the app.

1181
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:26,860
- What is that?

1182
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,700
- It's a Catholic app?

1183
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,900
- Mark Wahlberg's Catholic app.

1184
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,740
- What does it help you with?

1185
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:30,580
- It helps you do like,

1186
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,400
- Be Catholic.

1187
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,240
- Catechism and stuff.

1188
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,840
It helps you remember the prayers and shit.

1189
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:37,360
- I don't really know that much about Catholicism.

1190
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,520
- What's his stupid fucking--

1191
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,080
- Mark Wahlberg's app.

1192
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,040
- There's a--

1193
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,640
- Join Mark Wahlberg as Father Stu on Halo.

1194
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,760
- Oh, so it's a Halo exclusive.

1195
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,480
Look at that fucking (laughs)

1196
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,320
- Wow.

1197
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,840
- It's a shitty DVD cover.

1198
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,720
- Yeah, I'm making a movie and I'm only releasing it

1199
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,560
on my app.

1200
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,760
(laughing)

1201
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,600
That's it.

1202
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,440
- So, we've only had 12 viewers so far,

1203
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,880
But when you scale that to how hard it is to use the app,

1204
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,280
it's not easy to be a movie theater.

1205
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,920
That's basically like 100 million people saw the movie.

1206
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,320
Wow, these are some good reviews.

1207
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,720
That is definitely a real quote.

1208
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,280
This is the best app I've ever downloaded.

1209
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,860
Guy who's downloaded a roll of an app.

1210
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:19,000
I like that you can't see the font in the background

1211
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,120
are the same color.

1212
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,840
It's really quite poorly made.

1213
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,080
I would like to--

1214
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,320
let's see if we can find some--

1215
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,600
Whoa, Jim Caviezel's on there.

1216
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,520
Mark Wahlberg-- no, just choose Mark Wahlberg.

1217
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,480
Choose your paragraph.

1218
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,240
- Obviously, I'm going with Mark Wahlberg, it's his ad.

1219
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,980
- I went from not praying at all to praying twice a day.

1220
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,520
That's a pretty big increase.

1221
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,120
- That is a huge increase. - Just continue with Google.

1222
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,140
- Yeah, just signed into Google there.

1223
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,200
- There we go.

1224
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,720
- All right, we're gonna get right into here.

1225
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,600
- I'll do a prayer.

1226
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,280
I would like to get religious pretty soon.

1227
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,440
- Oh, a 14-day free trial.

1228
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,280
- Wait, what?

1229
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,520
You have to pay for this?

1230
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:49,360
- It's cost-free.

1231
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,560
- Of course you have to pay.

1232
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,080
- Caleb, Caleb, get your card out real quick.

1233
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:52,920
- Yeah, let's just say--

1234
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,760
- Look, getting close to God isn't easy.

1235
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,520
- So Visa always starts with 4117.

1236
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,320
(laughing)

1237
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,160
- Pajaradrone.

1238
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,980
- Pajaradrone.

1239
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,820
- Pajaradyrone.

1240
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,660
- Pajaradyrone, yeah.

1241
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,980
- All right, what's the card number?

1242
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,280
4 4 7 0.

1243
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,460
Okay, no Zivisa.

1244
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,100
- All right, now let's do a bunch of random numbers.

1245
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:09,540
- Yeah, just throw in a random card.

1246
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,480
I think it'll work.

1247
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,980
(laughing)

1248
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:12,980
- Okay.

1249
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,180
- We need to make an app, man.

1250
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,020
- Can we get a free trial?

1251
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,840
- Wow.

1252
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,680
- That was too many numbers?

1253
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,340
- Yeah, I think that was way too many numbers.

1254
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,180
- Yeah, I think you put in too many numbers.

1255
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,020
- No, I think that's the right amount of numbers.

1256
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,580
- That's the correct amount of numbers.

1257
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,780
- No, it must be too many numbers

1258
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,900
That's why it's not working.

1259
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,760
- Let's see if we can guess a credit card number.

1260
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,600
(laughing)

1261
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:29,980
- If we guess a credit card number live on the air,

1262
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,820
it'll be great.

1263
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,660
- What, how hard can it be?

1264
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,980
- And we're gonna be here until we do it.

1265
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,820
(laughing)

1266
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,980
- We're not getting up until we guess a credit card number.

1267
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,780
- I've always thought it probably can't be that hard

1268
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,740
to guess a credit card number.

1269
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,020
- I mean, it's just chance.

1270
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,860
- Yeah, exactly.

1271
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,980
- I could sit down and do it right now.

1272
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,540
I mean, it might not happen, but it might.

1273
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,780
- It's probably the same odds as like playing the lottery.

1274
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,620
- Yeah.

1275
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,440
- But you can do it for free.

1276
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,280
- It's even better.

1277
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,120
- Exactly like the lottery.

1278
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,720
- Yeah, it's the same odds as the lottery.

1279
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,760
- What the rules are, because I bet someone's figured out,

1280
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,440
well, visas start with 4323,

1281
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,440
and they go from this set of numbers

1282
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:03,680
to this set of numbers.

1283
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,520
- Yeah.

1284
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:06,360
- I need to just get a job at Visa.

1285
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,760
- Maybe, that's good.

1286
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,120
- So stealing cards.

1287
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,200
- That's really, really good.

1288
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,120
- I guess credit card numbers all the time,

1289
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,880
but it's not really guessing, you know?

1290
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,160
It's just like knowing the rules.

1291
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,680
- Oh yeah.

1292
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:20,640
Have you guys ever seen those videos?

1293
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,480
- I haven't paid for anything in years.

1294
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,800
- I see numbers in front of me constantly.

1295
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:24,640
- My whole life is free.

1296
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,880
- The whole world is just a series of math equations.

1297
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,720
- I just bought a house.

1298
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,440
- I know how all of you are gonna die.

1299
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:34,220
- Car, kills himself after he kills me with a car.

1300
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,000
Drowns in the bathtub.

1301
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,820
- And I'm a mortal.

1302
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:39,280
- Actually, car, same car, same car.

1303
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,520
(laughing)

1304
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,360
- Whoa.

1305
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:43,560
- And I'm gonna be on the street taking it all in.

1306
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,400
(laughing)

1307
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,220
- Whoa.

1308
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,060
- Just leave your phone, non-citizen.

1309
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,520
- That's how you die?

1310
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,360
- Yeah.

1311
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,480
- That's how Grace dies.

1312
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,980
- Heart attack from like, "No, my friends!"

1313
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:53,300
(laughing)

1314
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,140
- My friends!

1315
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:54,960
- "No!"

1316
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:57,880
- I die from the grief of realizing

1317
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,000
I should have done anything to stop it.

1318
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,520
- Patrick's gonna be the first person to die

1319
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:05,480
since like 1300 to die of fear.

1320
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,320
- Yeah.

1321
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,440
(laughing)

1322
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,800
- Do people die from that all the time?

1323
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,200
- I almost died from that a couple times.

1324
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,840
- My brother's old house.

1325
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,400
- Halloween is the worst for me.

1326
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,120
I go to the hospital every year on Halloween.

1327
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:20,800
People used to die from fright, but now it's just cardiac arrest.

1328
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,080
My brother had a house that burned, after he moved out, it burned down and it was a girl

1329
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,820
and her grandma lived there and the girl died in the house from the fire and then the grandma

1330
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:32,560
ran out and got so scared that she had a heart attack and died.

1331
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,200
Which is some like Coen Brothers shit.

1332
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,200
That's crazy.

1333
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I'm talking about dying.

1334
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,200
That's really unfortunate.

1335
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,560
Your heart, it's not even about a heart attack, you're just so scared that you just can't

1336
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:41,560
be alive.

1337
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,280
There's no physical way, there's no reason why you died in the coroner report.

1338
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,320
It's like Looney Tunes, you come out of your body and that's just it.

1339
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,320
and then you're just a blue thing just kinda floating.

1340
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,160
- And then you're a ghost away.

1341
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,000
- They always look--

1342
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,200
- That's what happened to Casper.

1343
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,400
- Yeah, it's exactly what happened.

1344
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,960
- He was just scared of puberty.

1345
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,480
(laughing)

1346
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,120
- Oh, my body's changing!

1347
00:43:59,120 --> 00:43:59,960
(screaming)

1348
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,960
- And then he got flown out of his own body.

1349
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:03,800
- Yeah.

1350
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
- He one day woke up to this giant cock

1351
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,520
and just jumped out of his own shit.

1352
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,760
- Oh no, there's pubes!

1353
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,240
- And by the way, he's shaggy.

1354
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,720
- I need to be smooth, I need to be pure,

1355
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,560
I need to be clean!

1356
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,560
I

1357
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,120
Just thought of the best evil plan of all time

1358
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:24,440
What's that I will learn to astral project and I will make someone else learn to do it with me or I'll find someone else

1359
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,160
Who knows how to do it?

1360
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,400
Well astral project together and then right as they leave their body. I'm gonna go into their body and steal it

1361
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:39,640
Bagans

1362
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,640
series of paranormal books that came out around when we were kids.

1363
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,100
And he was always getting into hijinks like Astral Project.

1364
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,600
And the guy's name was Zach Files?

1365
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
Yeah, the guy's name was Zach Files.

1366
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,800
Wait, Astral Project? That's a hijink in that show?

1367
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:56,300
It was a TV show too, but it was also a series of books.

1368
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:58,300
Kind of like a series of unfortunate events or something.

1369
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,800
Oh, okay. I don't remember those.

1370
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,300
I thought you were talking about Zach Bagans, the ghost hunter.

1371
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,300
Nobody's read the Zach Files.

1372
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:05,800
No.

1373
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:06,300
You made it up.

1374
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,300
I think he did.

1375
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,800
I made it up.

1376
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:09,800
I don't believe it's real.

1377
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:10,800
I wrote it.

1378
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:11,800
I wrote it.

1379
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:12,800
That's so awesome.

1380
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:13,800
You guys are the greatest publishers ever.

1381
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:14,800
It's a great YA book that's coming out this year.

1382
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,800
Do you guys have any kids in your lives that you want to order?

1383
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
It's a great book.

1384
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,800
The author, I hear she's really nice.

1385
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:18,800
She's really great.

1386
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
She's really, really good.

1387
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,800
I feel like everybody has one.

1388
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:21,800
Someone called her brilliant.

1389
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,800
Everybody has one thing like that that they loved when they were a kid that nobody else

1390
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,800
has ever fucking heard of.

1391
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,800
Oh, yeah.

1392
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,800
And I know exactly the one.

1393
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:26,800
It's like the kangaroos and they have elemental powers and the kangaroos have super powers

1394
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,800
and they can fly.

1395
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:28,800
And they can do all kinds of things.

1396
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,800
And I think that's what's so cool about it.

1397
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,800
I think it's so cool.

1398
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,000
like that that they loved when they were a kid that nobody else has ever fucking heard

1399
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:39,100
of. Oh yeah and I know exactly the one it's like the kangaroos and they have elemental

1400
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:43,360
powers and the kid falls into a well. What are you talking about? They're called warriors

1401
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:50,360
of virtue. Warriors of virtue. Is that a spin off of the cat warriors? No. A spin off of

1402
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:57,440
the cat warriors that's about kangaroos? No they're their own property it's called warriors

1403
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,440
- You guys have read the, has anyone here read

1404
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,660
Warriors and the Cats? - I read like one,

1405
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,500
I read like one in fifth grade

1406
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:03,020
and I was like, I can't do this.

1407
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:06,280
- Yeah, I read like, you know, just like 30 in fifth grade.

1408
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,540
(laughing)

1409
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:12,660
- For me, that one thing is probably this one porn video.

1410
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,500
(laughing)

1411
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:14,340
It was so good.

1412
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,160
- I gotta come back.

1413
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,900
- When I was like five years old, it was amazing.

1414
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,020
- I know of one.

1415
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,300
- It was my secret planet that I used to travel to.

1416
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,140
- Yeah. - Oh, that's good.

1417
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,960
- That no one else could go to,

1418
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,020
and my secret spaceship. - That's really good.

1419
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,260
- No, I've actually been there.

1420
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:25,100
- No, I don't think you have.

1421
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,140
- I have, I've actually been there.

1422
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,340
- No, 'cause we have detectors there that detect people.

1423
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,460
- No, I've actually been there a few times.

1424
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,460
Well, they didn't work on me.

1425
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,300
- Oh, okay.

1426
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:32,940
- You're in fantasy land.

1427
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,740
What you're saying makes no sense.

1428
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,580
- No, no, no, he didn't code them to recognize women.

1429
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,580
- You've never been off-world.

1430
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,420
- So I, so.

1431
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:40,660
(laughing)

1432
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:49,680
- My alarm should have gone off.

1433
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,860
- I've been-- - You're air-tagged.

1434
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:56,780
- I've been off world.

1435
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,620
- You have not been off world.

1436
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,460
- I've been off world.

1437
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:00,020
- You've not been off world.

1438
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,860
- I've been off world.

1439
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,820
I've literally been off world.

1440
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,220
- Imagine how much it would suck if you lost your wallet,

1441
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:07,940
you checked the air tag and it's like zoomed out

1442
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,980
to show the galaxy.

1443
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:09,820
- Oh no.

1444
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:10,660
- Yeah.

1445
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:13,380
- It's fucking space junk now.

1446
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:14,220
- You get a--

1447
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:17,380
- My Air Pods, my fucking Air Pods are in the--

1448
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:19,900
- You just open the thing, you can't even see the dot

1449
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,500
'cause it's so zoomed out, it's just a full picture of stars.

1450
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:23,340
- Yeah.

1451
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,180
- Oh great.

1452
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,820
One time I tried to throw my air tag as high as I could

1453
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,020
and it just never came back down.

1454
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:29,020
(laughter)

1455
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:30,820
Damn, you're fucking strong.

1456
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,420
I know, it's crazy.

1457
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,620
Somebody needs to get an air tag on one of these UFOs

1458
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:35,620
that are running around the block.

1459
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,620
Oh, yeah.

1460
00:47:36,620 --> 00:47:38,620
Somebody's got to get an air tag on one of these UFOs.

1461
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:42,420
Actually, it's foolish of you to think there isn't one.

1462
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:44,920
You know, they all do have air tags.

1463
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,720
Where do you think the air tags came from?

1464
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:47,720
Yeah, exactly.

1465
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,220
That kind of technology makes no sense at all.

1466
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,620
It was here before us.

1467
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:52,120
Air tags were here before.

1468
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:53,120
(laughter)

1469
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,480
When we arrived, the air tags were here.

1470
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:57,880
People will be digging up in their backyards,

1471
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,080
they think they found an arrowhead.

1472
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,000
No, that's an air tag.

1473
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,120
It's the original air tag.

1474
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:05,160
It's a primitive air tag, yeah.

1475
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:06,960
It's the same metal that they use.

1476
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,000
It's like Halloween 3.

1477
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,480
And they have the chips in the back.

1478
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,000
Yeah, back in medieval times, I used to air tag my son,

1479
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,120
and I just always could tell where he was.

1480
00:48:15,120 --> 00:48:16,520
I could just tell.

1481
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,080
I do think that you should be able to,

1482
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,640
everybody should have a chip in them.

1483
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,960
They're like a mark of the beast.

1484
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,040
Yeah, that's good.

1485
00:48:24,040 --> 00:48:25,960
She got that chip in her.

1486
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:27,240
Yeah, exactly.

1487
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,240
It would be nice to get a chip in me,

1488
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:32,080
because then I would just know that I was going to hell.

1489
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,880
Yeah.

1490
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,840
Exactly.

1491
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,600
Just come out with it already.

1492
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,680
Just do the mark of the beast already.

1493
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:40,280
Obama, come back, put a chip in my right hand.

1494
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,960
Yeah, there's dudes like those fucking stupid--

1495
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:43,760
what are they called?

1496
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,120
The cyber whatever.

1497
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,120
The cyber whatever.

1498
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,920
The cyber whatever.

1499
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:48,960
The guys who put RFID chips in their hands

1500
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,360
and lock their doors.

1501
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:52,240
- Yeah, that's cool.

1502
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,560
- I saw some guy who had a chip in his head

1503
00:48:55,560 --> 00:48:58,120
and some sort of implant that like,

1504
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,500
I don't know if it was a speaker

1505
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,960
or it just reacted to music,

1506
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,000
but it made his whole head like,

1507
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,520
going, like his skin would like wave out.

1508
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,560
- Whoa. - Yeah.

1509
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:08,800
- It really looked gross.

1510
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,440
Like it really looked pretty disgusting.

1511
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:12,440
And I don't know what the utility of that was.

1512
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,040
- Yeah, what is that called?

1513
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:16,440
There's a word for that that I'm like completely blanking on.

1514
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,440
- Cool as hell.

1515
00:49:17,440 --> 00:49:18,280
- Yeah.

1516
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:19,440
- Technology.

1517
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:20,840
- Transhumanist?

1518
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,360
- Transhumanist, that's what it is.

1519
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,600
- I don't believe in any of that crap.

1520
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,920
Keep it away from my daughter.

1521
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,240
(laughing)

1522
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,400
Keep that shit away from my daughter.

1523
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,520
- Are you grooming my kid to become one of those robot dogs?

1524
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,560
(laughing)

1525
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:33,400
- I don't let my daughter--

1526
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,680
- Are you grooming my kid to be one of those robots?

1527
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,400
- You come around here with those AirPods,

1528
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,800
I can tell that you're trying to groom my kid

1529
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,920
to love technology.

1530
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,480
- Apple is grooming our kids.

1531
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,840
- You send your kid to kindergarten,

1532
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:47,880
they come back with pink hair and red eyes

1533
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:50,140
(laughing)

1534
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,120
- What the fuck are they doing in there?

1535
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:56,280
- And a tog made out of the tape and done with a VHS.

1536
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,780
(laughing)

1537
00:49:57,780 --> 00:49:59,480
What the hell's going on?

1538
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,600
- My five year old daughter is so strong,

1539
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,040
I can't even hit her anymore.

1540
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,040
(laughing)

1541
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,360
She hits back and it hurts like hell.

1542
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:07,200
- It hurts me.

1543
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:08,040
- She's got these rubber dogs.

1544
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:09,840
- And her eyes are fucking cameras,

1545
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,600
so she remembers everything.

1546
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:15,240
- And obviously her hair is all ribbon cables.

1547
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,440
- And obviously her hair is still real hair.

1548
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,700
(laughing)

1549
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:20,780
- She was like,

1550
00:50:20,780 --> 00:50:21,880
(laughing)

1551
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,080
My daughter told me she was like,

1552
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,200
- Obviously she still has real hair.

1553
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,040
- Oh, what do you think?

1554
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:26,860
What do you think?

1555
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,700
(laughing)

1556
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,540
What do you think would happen?

1557
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:30,000
They're not gonna put any kind of fucking cables

1558
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:30,840
in her head.

1559
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:32,080
No, that hair is normal.

1560
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:35,400
- They replaced her feet with a bunch of robotic crabs.

1561
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,520
So she's always scuttling around.

1562
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:40,580
- I tell my daughter,

1563
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,260
you better get rid of all that robot crap.

1564
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,100
She says, I hate you.

1565
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:43,920
I'm running away.

1566
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:44,960
I say, oh yeah, we'll see how far you get.

1567
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,240
She blasts off through the roof.

1568
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,280
(laughing)

1569
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,280
I see her on the moon now.

1570
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,280
She's in satellite images.

1571
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,280
She's a cloud of smoke.

1572
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,280
She packed up her books.

1573
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:58,280
I'm pretty sure she's having sex with the ghosts of the moon.

1574
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,280
Of the civilization that used to be on the moon.

1575
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:03,280
That has since fallen.

1576
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,280
It's so fucked up what's going on in this god damn country.

1577
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,280
My fucking kid's got a second Saturn in its chest now.

1578
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:16,280
I've been playing games on my kid.

1579
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,520
(laughing)

1580
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,360
- But it is fun though,

1581
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,120
it does make game night a lot easier.

1582
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:22,680
- I gotta fuckin' blow on the cartridge every night

1583
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,480
to put his bedtime story into his chest.

1584
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:26,320
- Hey, hey, hey.

1585
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,600
- I gotta fuckin' huff and puff.

1586
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:29,400
- Son, get down here, I'm trying to play,

1587
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:31,400
daddy's trying to play a damn game.

1588
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,240
Get down here so I can play my games on that.

1589
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,880
- Hey, daddy's got 2K.

1590
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,720
- Yeah.

1591
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,880
- When you just got the new 2K, get over here.

1592
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,480
- When you play a video game on me,

1593
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,320
I black out until you're done.

1594
00:51:40,320 --> 00:51:41,160
- Good.

1595
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,000
- Okay.

1596
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,160
(laughing)

1597
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,160
You're a growing boy, you need to sleep.

1598
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,920
(laughing)

1599
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:48,520
- It doesn't matter what I do,

1600
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,280
well, you're blacked out playing the game.

1601
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:53,160
- All these cyborg kids, I heard there's a new cyborg kid,

1602
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,400
they're putting a breathalyzer on him

1603
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:55,800
to make sure you're parenting him right.

1604
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,160
- You have to blow on him.

1605
00:51:58,160 --> 00:52:00,280
- You have to blow on the back of his head.

1606
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,760
- Before you order him to do his homework or anything,

1607
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:06,080
you gotta make sure you're not drunk.

1608
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:07,120
- I've talked about it before,

1609
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,960
but it would be so amazing if they made a TV

1610
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,240
that went in the back of your girlfriend's head.

1611
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:13,680
- My son's breathalyzer's on his dick, is that normal?

1612
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,920
(laughing)

1613
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,960
- I think you choose, you have to choose where to put it.

1614
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:19,800
- No.

1615
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,280
- Yeah, you get to choose where to put it.

1616
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:23,120
- No.

1617
00:52:23,120 --> 00:52:25,360
- You're like, I chose to put it on.

1618
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:26,880
- The doctor talked me into it.

1619
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,360
- I don't think so.

1620
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,520
(laughing)

1621
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:31,120
- What do you mean doctor, there's no doctor here.

1622
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:32,880
- So I flipped a coin.

1623
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,560
So I flipped a coin, big deal.

1624
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,200
(laughing)

1625
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,440
- You don't wanna know the other side of the coin though.

1626
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:40,000
(laughing)

1627
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,640
- Thankfully it was the good side.

1628
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,760
(laughing)

1629
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:45,760
yes it was a three-sided coin

1630
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:47,760
it's not important what the other side was, ok?

1631
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,760
it doesn't matter what the other side was

1632
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,760
but anyways, now I'm blowing my kid in more ways than one

1633
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,760
every time I want him to do his goddamn homework

1634
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:58,760
it's not sexual, but uh

1635
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,760
that would be maybe...

1636
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:03,760
son, it's time for dinner

1637
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,760
wait, wait, what?

1638
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,760
I think it's great that every...

1639
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,440
- I'm getting cramped back and forth.

1640
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,440
- Every pod, April finds a way to talk about her future son.

1641
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,920
- And blowing him?

1642
00:53:18,920 --> 00:53:21,160
(laughing)

1643
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:25,600
- But in this time, I guess you did it for good reasons.

1644
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,440
- Yeah.

1645
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,680
- We're talking about a cyborg kid, this is not a human.

1646
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,760
- I'm talking about a dystopian future.

1647
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,600
- Exactly.

1648
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,800
- I'm talking about how much it would suck.

1649
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,120
- This is a cautionary tale.

1650
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,560
- It's a cautionary tale.

1651
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:39,800
- This is a Margaret Atwood--

1652
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,480
- This is 1984.

1653
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:42,320
This is a brave new world.

1654
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,200
- Margaret Atwood's new novel.

1655
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:46,240
Parents have to suck off their kids.

1656
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,240
(laughing)

1657
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,080
- For some reason.

1658
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,440
- It's called The Handjob Tale.

1659
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,360
- Yeah, it's what it's called.

1660
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,680
- It's a Margaret Atwood book

1661
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,960
that starts with the main character's watching child porn.

1662
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,800
And she's like, "Yeah, everybody does it."

1663
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,840
- What book so that I can not read it?

1664
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,520
Yeah, no, tell me what book and what pages

1665
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:04,960
so I can not read them.

1666
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:05,800
(laughing)

1667
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:07,680
- Oh, yeah, it's Oryx and Greg,

1668
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,000
and probably like the first few Jap days.

1669
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,940
- Cool, so I'm gonna go, I have to go not,

1670
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:13,920
(laughing)

1671
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,200
I have to go not read that really quick.

1672
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,760
Really quickly, I have to go not read that.

1673
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,480
- She's a one sick puppy, I could never come up with that.

1674
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,480
I'd probably put-- - Some twisted ideas.

1675
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,880
- I'd put the girls in bikinis if I was her.

1676
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,080
- That's what I would do. - Some red dresses.

1677
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:26,920
- Can I say something?

1678
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:27,760
- Like maybe they're watching--

1679
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,080
- Yeah, speak on it. - Can I say something

1680
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,240
really quick, Cameron? - Yeah, go ahead.

1681
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:32,920
- So lately I've been reading some science fiction.

1682
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:33,960
- Okay. - And it's kinda funny,

1683
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,120
'cause I've been reading science fiction,

1684
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,360
I think to myself, that's funny,

1685
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:39,440
'cause a lot of modern science is fiction.

1686
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,840
- Yeah, evolution, abortion, gay marriage.

1687
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:43,680
- Gastropubs.

1688
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:44,800
- These are scientific--

1689
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,760
- Gastropubs are fucked, yeah.

1690
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:49,640
- In what world, what's gastro about this pub?

1691
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:51,680
- Oh yeah, what I do in the bathroom after?

1692
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:52,560
- Yeah, that's right.

1693
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:53,600
- That's where the gas--

1694
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,560
- I trow, I trow all the gas.

1695
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,760
- That's where the gas go.

1696
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,440
- I trow the gas out me.

1697
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,640
- I trow the gas in the toilet.

1698
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:01,760
I trow the gas.

1699
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:03,200
(laughing)

1700
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,720
That doesn't make any sense, you fuckin' gastropub.

1701
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:10,360
That's why they're always Irish themed, because you trow da gas at ya.

1702
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,360
If I don't see bubbling...

1703
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,360
Oh, it's Irish?

1704
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,360
Oh, I trow da gas at me!

1705
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:18,360
That's an Irish accent.

1706
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:24,360
If I don't see bubbling blue and green liquids when I go into a gas drum pub, I'm shooting the whole place up.

1707
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,360
I'm gonna fucking shoot the place up with a fucking gun.

1708
00:55:28,360 --> 00:55:32,360
There's one of those science bars down the street over there.

1709
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,760
Well, I'd be careful because I'm going to go check it out.

1710
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:37,520
I'm going to pretend I'm the science inspector.

1711
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:40,680
If it was a real gastropub, the crazy thing is,

1712
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,520
because of all the molecular gastronomy that would be happening,

1713
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:46,320
you fire one bullet and it would all blow up.

1714
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:47,320
Yeah, true.

1715
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:51,360
So you can tell they deserve it because you fire a few bullets and nothing happens.

1716
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:52,240
Exactly.

1717
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:53,440
Yeah, I wouldn't even aim for people.

1718
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:54,440
I'd aim for the beakers.

1719
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:58,960
As a terrorist, I need to get my hands on that little thing

1720
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,800
that Walter White uses in Breaking Bad where he blows up the whole place

1721
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,640
- Oh, that's good. - Oh, yeah.

1722
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,480
- Stuff cold. - We better pray

1723
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,600
that the terrorists don't get that.

1724
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,240
- That is, I was watching, I was like,

1725
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:08,800
"Bro, do you really want people to know about this shit?"

1726
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,640
- Um, actual terrorists here, and--

1727
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,840
(laughing)

1728
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,640
- We actually already used that.

1729
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:15,680
- First of all-- - And we learned

1730
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:17,880
about it from the show. - Oh, fuck.

1731
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,760
- It's a white crystal, he throws it at the ground,

1732
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,320
it blows out every window in a two-story building.

1733
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:23,640
- And a bunch of car alarms go off outside.

1734
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,920
- And then he just walks out, not a scratch on him.

1735
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,160
Whatever that is, is an amazing, amazing super weapon.

1736
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,080
- I'm imagining like a guy that's like,

1737
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:36,080
- I've seen a guy from the Islamic State being like,

1738
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,080
"It's so fucked up that they showed a white guy doing that."

1739
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:40,920
(laughing)

1740
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:44,080
Every guy I know who knows how to do that

1741
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,960
is not a white man.

1742
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,200
(laughing)

1743
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,560
- You had it up there, Jubio.

1744
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,400
You were passing.

1745
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:51,220
- Wait, why are they googling?

1746
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:52,060
- We almost found out what it was

1747
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,900
and you went back to the cyber guys.

1748
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,720
- Go back to it.

1749
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,560
You need to show a picture of this thing.

1750
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:56,640
- Why were they googling pictures of my dad?

1751
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,040
- That right there.

1752
00:56:58,040 --> 00:56:59,120
- This is not meth.

1753
00:56:59,120 --> 00:56:59,960
Wait, they're faking it.

1754
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,360
- It's perfect, it's a gift.

1755
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:03,480
See, I really need this.

1756
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:04,320
- It's the little thing.

1757
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,140
- Oh my god.

1758
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,960
- Can we make it even smaller?

1759
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,800
- Yeah, let's shrink this gift down.

1760
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,140
- Can we make it even smaller than that?

1761
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,600
- No, that was the opposite.

1762
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,800
- There we go.

1763
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,640
Oh, there it goes.

1764
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,460
- Yeah, get it smaller.

1765
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,300
Get it as small as it can be.

1766
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:18,640
- It's too big, I can't see it.

1767
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,480
It needs to get smaller.

1768
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,960
- I'm making a spilling my whole field of vision.

1769
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:23,800
I can't figure out a single detail.

1770
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:25,360
- I'm overwhelmed, I'm overwhelmed.

1771
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,640
This is how it's supposed to be.

1772
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,480
- Do you think that that was a wake up call

1773
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,720
for police officers and law enforcement in this country,

1774
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:32,560
where they were like,

1775
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:33,760
"We need to start looking at the scientists."

1776
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,600
- Yeah. - Probably.

1777
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,720
- We need to learn about science.

1778
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:36,560
- Because scientists probably--

1779
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:38,060
- You think there's a cop sitting in the back

1780
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,080
of every single science class?

1781
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:41,220
- Yeah, there's one--

1782
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:42,600
- Trusted pinwheel hat.

1783
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,600
- Actually, one person in every science class

1784
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:46,280
is the science marshal.

1785
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:49,240
The undercover cop in every high school science class.

1786
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:51,440
- Just the one guy in your science class

1787
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,640
who has tissue paper on his face

1788
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:54,800
'cause he cut himself shaving.

1789
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,440
- And the one in my high school

1790
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,880
always tried to sleep with all the girls

1791
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,720
and was really cuddly.

1792
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,920
- He was like, "What, I'm a high schooler."

1793
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,200
- I'm a clearly high schooler.

1794
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,560
- He was like, "Oh, you guys like science?

1795
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,360
"Okay, I just took this concoction, now I'm 15."

1796
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,960
(laughing)

1797
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,800
It's okay.

1798
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:16,520
- Yeah, it's fine, it's totally fine.

1799
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:21,360
- As a police officer, after Breaking Bad came out,

1800
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:23,720
whenever I was arresting somebody,

1801
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,640
kind of a hoodlum type with a hoodie,

1802
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:27,800
and seemed kind of young. - A thug.

1803
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:35,100
Yeah, a thug. I'd have him up against the car, holding him, and I'd be like, "Who's your science teacher? Where's your science teacher at?"

1804
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:43,100
Listen, as a meth dealer, that's actually very traumatizing for us. I just thought you might like to know that so you can change your ways.

1805
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:46,300
I actually find that traumatizing when that happens. Just speaking from my perspective as an actor.

1806
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:56,300
Whenever I yell at April, she really freezes up. So if you really want to know where her dealers are in the Adiata, you've got to kind of buy her Mickey D's first.

1807
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:58,740
- Okay, that's a good tag.

1808
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,060
- Right now, the shamrock shake is back.

1809
00:59:01,060 --> 00:59:01,900
- For real?

1810
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:04,940
- And put the McDonald's logo at the bottom of the screen.

1811
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,220
- That's none of my fucking business.

1812
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,900
That shamrock shake, I will never have one

1813
00:59:07,900 --> 00:59:08,740
for as long as I live.

1814
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,580
- You are insane.

1815
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:12,100
It is one of the greatest things ever made at McDonald's.

1816
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,980
- Here's what you gotta do.

1817
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:17,980
You gotta bring Caleb coffee, put shamrock shake in it.

1818
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:19,100
- I'll fall for it.

1819
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:19,920
- And that's how we're gonna get him

1820
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:20,760
to drink shamrock shake.

1821
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:23,100
- I think that I'm finally an adult

1822
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,580
'cause I can't do a milkshake.

1823
00:59:24,580 --> 00:59:26,980
It's not that I'll still watch Transformers.

1824
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,580
I'll still watch Yu-Gi-Oh!

1825
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:30,300
But I can't drink a milkshake.

1826
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,660
And I think that makes me--

1827
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,300
no, not anymore.

1828
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,220
Actually, I just stopped right now.

1829
00:59:35,220 --> 00:59:38,300
Something just made me realize I shouldn't watch Yu-Gi-Oh! anymore.

1830
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:40,940
Something about it seems kind of gay to me now.

1831
00:59:40,940 --> 00:59:43,980
Yeah, actually, I always thought it was stupid, too.

1832
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:45,180
Yeah.

1833
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:47,380
I mean, yeah, I just thought better of you than that.

1834
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:48,540
It's just mega shit.

1835
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,940
You know?

1836
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:51,780
Yu-Gi-Oh!

1837
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,100
I actually did stop watching Yu-Gi-Oh!

1838
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:57,980
maybe three years ago. So yeah, I remember you pulling up to recording one day with

1839
00:59:57,980 --> 01:00:01,020
like a Yu-Gi-Oh t-shirt and I was like, Oh, you can have a Yu-Gi-Oh t-shirt.

1840
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:06,260
That's cool. You have a CKY t-shirt on. That is,

1841
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:09,780
they're a good band. That is the same. That's the same as you.

1842
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,060
That is not the same as Yu-Gi-Oh, cause you learn about it at different times.

1843
01:00:13,060 --> 01:00:15,220
You can make money playing Yu-Gi-Oh. True.

1844
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:19,820
You can make money getting in a shopping cart and having your friend throw you

1845
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:20,660
- Not anymore.

1846
01:00:20,660 --> 01:00:21,480
- That's true.

1847
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:23,480
- You actually can't make money off of it.

1848
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:25,320
- That's true, that's actually true.

1849
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,680
- Pat still kind of thinks that's a job

1850
01:00:26,680 --> 01:00:27,520
he could maybe get away with.

1851
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,620
(laughing)

1852
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:29,460
- That's like his fallback.

1853
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,560
- I'm only doing the podcast to kind of try to get in it.

1854
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,400
- Yeah, it's so I can fund, like, I'm gonna buy--

1855
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,100
- How pissed were you when they made a new Jackass

1856
01:00:36,100 --> 01:00:38,720
and you didn't even get a little bit asked to do it?

1857
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:41,040
- I don't want to talk about it on here.

1858
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:41,880
- It really pissed you off, didn't it?

1859
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,700
- I actually--

1860
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:43,980
- I don't want to talk about it on here,

1861
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,420
but my audition tape was really fucking good.

1862
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:48,780
- I actually got a callback for the new Jackass.

1863
01:00:48,780 --> 01:00:51,980
They asked me to be in it too and I was like, I would love to be in it, but honestly, I don't

1864
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,980
really care enough.

1865
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,980
Yeah.

1866
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:55,980
I made a video of me just kind of cutting myself.

1867
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:58,980
Like self-harm cutting on my leg.

1868
01:00:58,980 --> 01:00:59,980
Cutting this in your leg.

1869
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:00,980
And they were like, that's not jackass.

1870
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,980
I was in the mirror going, you're worthless.

1871
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:04,980
You're nothing.

1872
01:01:04,980 --> 01:01:05,980
You're a piece of shit.

1873
01:01:05,980 --> 01:01:08,980
They said my stand up was too good.

1874
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:11,980
I believe it.

1875
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:14,980
Speaking of your stand up, guys, where can people go look for your tour?

1876
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:15,980
What's the website?

1877
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,980
Girl.live.com

1878
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,980
Doing a million and billion cities

1879
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,980
I'm going to list literally all the cities off right now

1880
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,980
List them

1881
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:25,980
If you forget any of them I'm going to verbally abuse you

1882
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:27,980
On Thursday we're starting in Richmond

1883
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:29,980
And then this weekend we're in Orlando

1884
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,980
And then Atlanta

1885
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,980
Nashville, Detroit

1886
01:01:33,980 --> 01:01:35,980
Milwaukee, Chicago

1887
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,980
St. Louis

1888
01:01:37,980 --> 01:01:39,980
Iowa City, Denver

1889
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,980
Phoenix, San Diego

1890
01:01:41,980 --> 01:01:43,980
San Francisco

1891
01:01:43,980 --> 01:01:47,480
Portland, Seattle, Los Angeles.

1892
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:48,980
You did really good. That's all of them.

1893
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:50,980
That was really impressive. I couldn't remember all that.

1894
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:55,480
So you can go to girlguidelive.com and you don't have to buy 100 tickets, but it's, you know.

1895
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:55,980
It's definitely helpful.

1896
01:01:55,980 --> 01:01:56,480
It's encouraged.

1897
01:01:56,480 --> 01:01:56,980
It's encouraged.

1898
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,980
Yeah, it's really encouraged.

1899
01:01:57,980 --> 01:01:59,980
Especially if you're in Phoenix.

1900
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:03,980
And the CAPTCHA for all of our tickets are "Select all the real women."

1901
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:04,980
Yeah.

1902
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:09,980
If you want to buy tickets to Girl Guide, you can select all the bio women.

1903
01:02:09,980 --> 01:02:11,980
All right, thank you all for coming on.

1904
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:12,820
Thank you all for coming on.

1905
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,380
- Don't buy a bunch of San Francisco tickets in my name.

1906
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:15,880
- Buy a bunch of San Francisco tickets.

1907
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:17,460
You'd fit right in, right?

1908
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:18,740
- Hey. - Gay city.

1909
01:02:18,740 --> 01:02:19,780
- Okay, bye guys.

1910
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:20,620
- I went there for some reason.

1911
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,020
- Thanks for having us guys.

1912
01:02:22,020 --> 01:02:22,860
Bye bye. - Bye.

1913
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:25,100
Peace.
