[laughter]

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,800
Oh my god, we have Mario.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,800
I don't look like Mario. Stop.

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,800
Hey, so Mario, does it hurt?

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,800
Oh my god, my name's Patrick and I'm Mario.

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,800
I don't look like Mario.

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,800
You also sound like Mario.

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm gonna shut the-- I can shut this off right now.

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,480
- Mario's classic outfit right now.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,920
- So then it'll just be me, Cam, and Mario.

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,360
And then we can ask him questions.

15
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,080
Hey, does it hurt when you go into the pipes?

16
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,760
Does it squeeze you really hard?

17
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,760
- I scream!

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,600
- You scream?

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
Really, they cut that out of the games.

20
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,880
They must turn the volume down.

21
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,320
- They make me mute my microphone

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,040
when I go in the pipe 'cause I scream.

23
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,880
- You guys knock it off.

24
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:46,700
- That's another question.

25
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:47,540
When you're acting in the games,

26
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,120
do you have like a lav mic on?

27
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,400
Like, how do they get your audio?

28
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,200
- They put a mic on me.

29
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,240
I don't know what it's called.

30
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,480
- Mario, you're so fucking stupid.

31
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,880
You fucking idiot.

32
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm just an actor, I don't worry about the...

33
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,480
Fucking short ass idiot.

34
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,480
Are you a dwarf or is Peach really tall?

35
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,520
I was born six feet tall, I got small.

36
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,720
Oh, you got smaller when you got older.

37
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,280
Oh, okay.

38
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,360
Are you guys done with this?

39
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,200
Are you guys done?

40
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,720
Can you not interrupt?

41
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,160
If you're gonna dress like Mario,

42
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,520
the least you can do is let us talk to Mario.

43
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,880
Caleb and I are both doing an interview with Mario,

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,800
okay, right now?

45
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,320
- Oh, so Caleb, keep asking all the questions

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,640

00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,160
- My other red socks fitted was too big.

54
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,000
- Yeah, well 'cause Mario shrinks over time

55
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,360
as we've already established.

56
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,200

And i'd say you're not wait your teacher your teacher told you you're not supposed to have drawers

98
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,780
You're pretty disappointed teacher tried to fuck everybody until I was 15

99
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:11,020
Yeah, pretty much. Try to fuck anybody. Yeah. Yeah, new family members, you know you go to

100
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,940
like a Thanksgiving and they're like, "This is your, this is your like uncle's best friend's

101
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:19,780
cousin." Something, not blood relation, but like people be like, "This is like your, your

102
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:26,860
like twice removed married in cousin." Yeah, "This is your new niece." Yeah, no. No. What

103
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:32,660
was that? Or somebody like, you know, like friends, parents and stuff, just try to fuck

104
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,300
them show my ass. Yeah, or like your mom got a new haircut and you got confused.

105
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,620
You gotta show, you know what, the thing is, I mean, underboob's a big

106
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:50,460
thing now. Is it? Is that a big thing now? It's a thing. People are doing

107
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,780
underboob and stuff. I've seen it. What do you, like, when you say people are

108
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:02,040
doing under boob yeah what does that mean? Like a like oh women oh oh oh.

109
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:07,980
They're doing under boob I think I think men should have something similar I think

110
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:12,740
we should have you know maybe like a like just one slit cut in the crotch of your

111
00:06:12,740 --> 00:06:16,820
pants so a ball can hang out. Oh that's actually really smart like okay so so

112
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,340
your zipper makes like a T right and you unzip the bottom part and just like not

113
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:24,540
like I mean we're not getting disgusting you're not gonna see my entire balls but

114
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,340
- No, it's just a little bit of it.

115
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,460
- Yeah, you're gonna see like a little three, basically.

116
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,140
- It could be like right between--

117
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,660
- You'll see one long pube that I've been growing out

118
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,900
on my ball. - Yeah, that would be nice.

119
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,580
Or it could be like a little horizontal slit

120
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,900
that shows just under the base of the shaft,

121
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,020
but before, if your ball's hanging low enough,

122
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,180
just a little bit of skin.

123
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,180
- What about just like, pair of pants, right?

124
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,940
And just around the zipper and the crotch,

125
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,100
like the whole crotch area, clear plastic.

126
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:57,020
That's pretty illegal, yeah.

127
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,300
Yeah, like a window into your dick and balls.

128
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,420
I think loincloths might come back.

129
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,220
A reverse loincloth is what we need though.

130
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,220
Yeah, that's what we're trying to make here.

131
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:11,220
I don't know if you've ever seen a caveman wearing a loincloth.

132
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,420
That thing only works from one direction.

133
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:17,100
Trust me, I've seen a few cavemen in loincloths in my day.

134
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,900
Also wait, okay, so a loincloth, can't people still see your butthole?

135
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,940
Like I'm way more worried about people seeing my butthole and my penis.

136
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,220
Yeah, because you could have TP crumbs on it.

137
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,420
Because like my butthole is like fucking disgusting.

138
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,420
You know, like disgusting.

139
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:38,540
I don't know what it looks like, you know?

140
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,540
And the first time that I...

141
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
You probably a whore.

142
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
You know exactly what it looks like.

143
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:44,060
I can draw what it looks like for you right now.

144
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,380
Please do, I would like to know.

145
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,380
Yeah, okay.

146
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,940
Press the shift key on your keyboard.

147
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,940
Okay.

148
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
Hold it down.

149
00:07:49,940 --> 00:08:01,660
press 8. What does that do? You see what is typed in? That's what it looks like. Open

150
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:07,980
up Google Docs, set the font size really big. Set it red too. It does kind of look like that.

151
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,320
No mine isn't red dude, I'm not a porn star. It looks like, I mean it's well worn. It looks

152
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
It's more like shift three, I think,

153
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,560
is what situation you're working with.

154
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,400
(laughing)

155
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,480
- Yeah, oh yeah, 100%.

156
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,920
I would say shift three with a shift eight in the middle.

157
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,400
- Mine is, I think mine is shift two.

158
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,600
I think that's what I'm working with.

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,440
- Oh, definitely, yeah.

160
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,520
But it keeps spiraling on for eternity.

161
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,280
- Well, no, it's shift two 'cause I have a hemorrhoid problem.

162
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,040
- Honestly, my asshole looks like an Uzumaki spiral.

163
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,880
- Yeah.

164
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,000
- Yeah.

165
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,840
- It really does.

166
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,160
more of a I've got an alt one type of deal going on I don't know if you're on

167
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,840
I have an alt one in the front.

168
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:52,840
yeah

169
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,240
that's what my meatus looks like

170
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,120
I think that was that's like a nasty today Jesus. You are nasty. The biggest reason I

171
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,600
probably could never do porn

172
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:07,200
besides being ugly with a small penis is that I could never do that shot

173
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,600
where they go behind the guy's butthole and they make it

174
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:19,240
anybody can. Yeah, no one can pull that off, but when someone pulls that shot off, I mean, come on.

175
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:24,120
At its best, they're doing like, you know that the way that they came up with that shot

176
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:32,280
was somebody's watching Empire Strikes Back as the ship started moving past the frame.

177
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:38,520
They're like, I just had the best idea for a guy's balls and butt. This is gonna be perfect.

178
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,840
When the Millennium Falcon's flying out of the worm, that's the exact same shot.

179
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:51,160
Yeah, and it just keeps going and going and you're just like, "Dude, this would be so funny to make

180
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
people watch this and put on a guy's balls."

181
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,880
I know, I think I've said it before on here, but the porn industry is so lucky that Smell-O-Vision

182
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,680
never caught on.

183
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,160
Oh, yeah.

184
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,560
Because that would have been over.

185
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,480
You imagine what it smells like.

186
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
The whole room, horrible, horrible smell.

187
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,160
Yeah, just under hot lights, camera right up in the hole.

188
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:16,680
I mean, I pretty much only have missionary style normal sex and it smells like salami

189
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,560
every single time.

190
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:26,600
So like, if there was a woman vomiting and crying and butts and holes involved, then

191
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
that would be like...

192
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,560
Yeah, like stage lights and also like five guys who stand there whose job is to confer

193
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,160
with each other and then go, "Faster, faster, okay, slower."

194
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,000
Yeah. I've had an Italian sub kind of just sitting out all day next to me.

195
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,440
That's your smell. You nailed it.

196
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:47,560
Yeah, that's exactly what it would smell like.

197
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,120
Yeah.

198
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,480
I mean, you leave that next to you, like, while you're watching it, you'll have the full picture.

199
00:10:55,480 --> 00:11:02,280
Sex, like, at its best, like cleanest, right out of the shower, smells like a friend's car.

200
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,920
So like the worst version of that is like...

201
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,920
[Laughter]

202
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,720
Like it's gotta be so bad.

203
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,720
[Laughter]

204
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,720
It's gonna be so fucked up, bro.

205
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah, it's gonna be fucking horrible.

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:29,160
Yeah, one of the... yeah, five McDonald's bags that are like hiding under the passenger seat.

207
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,920
They're like, "Sorry, people don't usually sit in the passenger seat."

208
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,200
"Hold on, before you get in, let me move a bunch of bags."

209
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
"Yeah, let me..."

210
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
"Let me..."

211
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,840
There's a box of french fries in the back of the car that are like perfectly preserved

212
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,840
somehow.

213
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,920
"Yeah, hold on, we just, yeah, no, you, here, you can sit in the passenger seat, just roll

214
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,120
that wheel of cheese out of the way and you'll be good."

215
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,000
"Can you, can you move my wheel of parmesan?

216
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,360
Can you move that to the back seat?"

217
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:59,040
"Yeah, just don't, just don't hit your head on the fish tank, okay?"

218
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,300
(laughter)

219
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:04,460
- Yeah, and then they're like,

220
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,100
you're like, "What the fuck is under me?"

221
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
And you're like, "Oh, sorry, that's my birth certificate.

222
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,540
"I've been looking for it for quite a while.

223
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,700
"Will you hand it to me?"

224
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,300
And then they just like lick a side of it

225
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,860
and stick it to the windshield.

226
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,380
(laughter)

227
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,700
- Yeah, no, can you hand me, no, not, next to the onions.

228
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,180
Next to the bag of onions there.

229
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,100
- Next to the onions.

230
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,940
- Yeah, can you hand me that CD?

231
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,780
Yeah, it's a single CD of Tracy Chapman.

232
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:32,080
fast car. I really want to listen to it.

233
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:38,860
As somebody who's never owned a car, I have a lot of fun being on my high horse about that.

234
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:43,420
There is nothing I love more than walking down the street and seeing a car that's hoarded

235
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:47,540
style full of trash. Every time I just want to stand and look through the window and see

236
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,540
what's in there so badly.

237
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,180
Yeah, play I Spy with it.

238
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,060
Exactly. I just want to be like, "Oh, I want to see where they've been eating. I want to

239
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:58,180
see what what yeah what what CDs they gave up on and threw into the back like I just

240
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,140
always everything it's always a pleasure to come to the end of like a like a two

241
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:07,100
hour road trip and like not really think about it but then open up the door and

242
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,820
they'll be like all right time to clean the car out and you realize that you ate

243
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,980
it like five different fast-food places over that two hours and you have like

244
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:21,180
giant bags from I'm so fucking glad that I don't have a car yeah reason you would

245
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:24,960
have the most evil car imaginable. I would have the most disgusting car. You'd be one of those

246
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,580
fuckers who keeps Taco Bell sauce in his glove compartment. Yeah. You know what? You know

247
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:36,580
that you have to refrigerate this at some point, right? You know, I honestly didn't think of

248
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,900
that until you said it, and I totally would. I would have like six things of like the Diablo

249
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:46,980
sauce just in the car. Just like, "Oh, I just forgot to throw that out." Yeah. It'd be like

250
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,220
a fucking there'd be like a like a the components of an MRE scattered across

251
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:58,020
your car. You could like fully make one. I gotta eat and drive at the same time. I'll be doing a lot of

252
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:03,980
work. I'll be doing a lot of driving. This is for my new... oh man. I gotta get you behind the wheel of a car

253
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:08,660
dude. Yeah I gotta learn. I didn't know. No, before you learn I have to see you drive

254
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:12,580
one. No you wanna learn. Do you wanna learn together? I'm gonna learn in the fall I

255
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,100
I think I might I don't know that's you want to teach each other

256
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:31,620
You guys should get one of those instructor cars it has two steering wheels and brakes and you guys could just both drive

257
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:37,020
That's very good. I mean one of us would fuck up eventually so that the other one could fix it

258
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:41,000
I could drive my way around a parking lot and stuff and I'll be me too

259
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I can do parking lots, I just can't.

260
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,500
- That's pretty much all there is to it, as far as I know.

261
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,560
- I took a driving test.

262
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,240
I took two driving tests in my life.

263
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,220
And the second one, when I failed it,

264
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,700
they said that if I fail a third time,

265
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,800
I'll have to go to court to prove.

266
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,300
- You have to go to jail.

267
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,140
- Pretty much.

268
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:59,280
- If you fail a third time.

269
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,720
- You got into the car and the first thing,

270
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,920
you buckled your seatbelt and then you put

271
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,920
an empty McDonald's bag onto the instructor's feet

272
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,840
and they immediately failed you.

273
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:15,760
So I was driving, I was taking the test in Manchester,

274
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,560
which is like, everyone told me afterwards,

275
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,000
like, oh yeah, that's like the hardest one.

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,500
You should have gone to like this town or whatever.

277
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:28,200
And I, 'cause Manchester's like kind of the city,

278
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,440
so I was like in like downtown Manchester

279
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,000
and I was like turning on some street corner

280
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,780
and I didn't know like how to turn the car.

281
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,080
Like I just like went in, like I just went in

282
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,480
was like I'm gonna take my driving test today because I passed the written

283
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:48,880
because I was like oh fuck it whatever and I like stopped in like a two-lane

284
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,200
like thing like I fucked up so bad that she and like she got like really mad at

285
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:59,560
me she got like super pissed at me I don't remember where the story was going

286
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,280
but I did hit a curb on the way back to the DMV after nothing did after I hit

287
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:21,400
the

288
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,320
you like you should take us out for all for a drive around the block like to

289
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:31,660
with your new license and he immediately hit a cat with his entire family. Well a

290
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,160
cat they don't prepare you for. I remember when I took the driving test

291
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:40,160
they they do like one of the most evil things of all time when you're in the

292
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,200
driving car where they're you're like you drive they find like a little stretch

293
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,960
of road for you to drive on usually in like a neighborhood or something and

294
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:52,120
say okay accelerate like as fast as you can you're like oh okay yeah sure and

295
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:57,160
then like before you are really thinking about what's the next step is the guy in

296
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,200
the passenger seat goes stop and you have to just stop as fast as possible

297
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:07,920
and it's like so fucked up dude it's like the most evil part of the test dude

298
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,800
the thing about the thing about New Hampshire I think is if like even in

299
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:15,600
that driving test if you miss even one of their instructions like if they tell

300
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,000
you to like turn onto this road and you miss it even if they tell you like like

301
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,900
as it's like you're passing it and you don't do that I guess like that you can

302
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,400
get points docked last time that I went so if you if you don't do the thing they

303
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,320
tell you to then you know like it's docked you if you like I know I know you

304
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:41,680
fuck you last time I need to go get a new license cuz mine's like insanely old I've

305
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:49,360
talked about that before. I get fucking, I mean dude, the Roastmasters at the TSA just

306
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,920
fucking own me every time. But last time I went to the DMV, I had to like, I think it

307
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:01,320
was to get my license renewed or my registration renewed or something, and I showed up and the

308
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:07,520
lady was like, "Okay, so number one, your license has been suspended for a year, and

309
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:11,120
And number two, there's a bench warrant out for your arrest because you didn't show up

310
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,860
in court for the reason why you got your license suspended.

311
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:15,860
And I had like no idea.

312
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:20,140
And she was like, "So, one or two things could happen.

313
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:26,520
Either I could tell that police officers over there to arrest you and you would go to jail,

314
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:31,900
or you can tell me that you were having somebody pick you up from the DMV and you're not going

315
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,300
to drive home and then I just won't tell anybody."

316
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,420
And I was like, "Well, I choose fucking option two, dude.

317
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
What are you talking about?"

318
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Right.

319
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,420
Why did the boy even give you the option?

320
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:44,300
Yeah, I was like, "What are you talking about, dude?"

321
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:48,940
I guess she did, yeah, she had to like call my lawyer and apparently like my dad's like

322
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,060
traffic lawyer that like handled my passing a bus, a stop to school bus ticket.

323
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,060
He apparently-

324
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,660
Of course, yeah, your dad has a traffic lawyer on call.

325
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,220
Oh, dude, he literally does, yeah.

326
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:06,500
He pays like a hundred bucks every time he does something horrible in a car.

327
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:12,020
But the guy apparently was like, I was like, "Hey, did you not show up for my court appearance

328
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,020
for this?"

329
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:20,340
And he was like, "Oh yeah, I was just like really hungover and I just didn't go."

330
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:25,060
And I was like, "There's been like an arrest worn out for me for like three months, dude.

331
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,060
Like what the fuck?"

332
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,300
And he's like, "I meant to tell you, but I just forgot."

333
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,980
So he's pretty much the best lawyer ever.

334
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
I don't even know his name.

335
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:33,980
Yeah.

336
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,980
Dude, that's fucking the hungover lawyer.

337
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:41,660
Yeah, the hungover lawyer.

338
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:45,180
It was an amazing Better Call Saul moment in my life.

339
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:50,580
I was just turned 18 and I'd never had any problem with the police.

340
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,380
I never had a lawyer before.

341
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,300
And the lawyer was just like, "You're going to go to jail."

342
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,300
The hungover lawyer.

343
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,300
Let's do it.

344
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,300
Ready?

345
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Oh, your honor, I'm so hungover.

346
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,300
Oh, I'm so hungover.

347
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
I don't even want to do this.

348
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,880
May I approach the bar?

349
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:10,020
I have a motion for a fucking nap break.

350
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:14,100
Yeah, objection, I'm the hungover lawyer.

351
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,060
Motion for a McDonald's break, your honor.

352
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:20,780
Motion for a bloody Mary, because I need some more booze in me.

353
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,020
Do you have a fireball nip on you for some reason?

354
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,060
The bailiff seems cool, let's hang out later.

355
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:32,420
I fuckin' the fireball nip in the morning, that's a perfect hangover cure.

356
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:37,380
Yeah, 'cause it's candy, which is always gonna make you feel better, and alcohol.

357
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,380
Yeah.

358
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:44,300
Mix that with a yerba mate, and you'll die.

359
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,540
That's a really great idea.

360
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,540
You'll wanna die immediately.

361
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:55,100
Yeah, that's the fuckin'-- something with that much caffeine you should not mix with

362
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,100
alcohol.

363
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,140
It's pretty funny that the only hangover cure is beer.

364
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,140
Yeah.

365
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,140
Yeah.

366
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,940
It's like, it's almost like it's a bad idea.

367
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,820
It's almost like drinking's bad.

368
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,300
It's almost like it's some kind of cycle that it's pushing you into.

369
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,300
I don't know.

370
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,540
It almost makes no sense to my brain.

371
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,540
It's confusing.

372
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,260
It's hard to figure out what's going on with it.

373
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,260
I don't like drinking at like breakfast, like Bloody Marys and like mimosas and all that

374
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,260
shit.

375
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,260
I fucking hate Bloody Marys.

376
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,700
Shit'll make me fucking fall asleep, dude.

377
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:28,220
you'll like like like when my family's in town I'll like my brother will get some

378
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:32,700

379
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,340

The Last Jedi I meant to say I for the world premiere you were on the red

388
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:23,620
The Force Awakens. The day of the premiere, not the world premiere.

389
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,460
December 15th or something like that. You fucking suck. Or something like that.

390
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:38,220
Something like December 15th. Then I fell asleep. I smoked weed with my

391
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:42,560
friend Alex and my friend Dylan and then we went to the movie theater and I was

392
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:46,980
like way too high because anytime I ever smoke I just like can't function at all.

393
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:53,300
and I was trying to take a picture of just like how big the crowd was because I

394
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,380
thought it was funny it was like all like there was a dude dressed up like

395
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,140
Darth Maul a couple feet in front of me so I was trying to take a picture of like

396
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:04,020
a bunch of people and just like a Darth Maul standing there and I was just way

397
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,820
too high and I had the flash on and it went off like in front of this woman's

398
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:38,660
face. She turns to me and is like, "Did you just take a picture of me?" I was like, "No, I was trying to take a picture of the crowd." And I like, I needed to just like, go in. So like, they like, I went to the bathroom and came back and then like, they were letting people in. And that was at like, five and the movie didn't start till like, eight. And I just immediately just like passed out in the theater. Just because I was way too high. I like woke up before

399
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:46,700
like I think the first like the I woke up like around that time the first day the

Guys came onto the train the other day while I was trying to listen to a podcast and started doing lunch time again.

429
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,120
*laughter*

430
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Oh, it's so annoying. They should ban lunch time from the train.

431
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
*laughter*

432
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:46,120
Oh, someone is spinning donuts on all the rails and shit. It's so fucking annoying.

447
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,120
*laughter*

448
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:28,120
"OHHHHH! OH WHY AM I WEARING THE EDIBLE UNDERWEAR I WANNA EAT IT!"

449
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,120
*laughter*

450
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,120
So what happened on the train?

451
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:36,120
I was just fucking destroying a Dunkin' Impossible sandwich.

452
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,120
Just like shoving it in my mouth as fast as possible.

453
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,120
And like looked up for one second to a lady taking a photo of me doing it.

454
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,120
And I just like full Sasquatched looked right at the camera.

455
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
*laughter*

456
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
And then I just ignored it.

457
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,860
So I just am aware that there is a photo of me just like,

458
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:57,620
like cheeks full, chipmunking a fucking

459
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:00,880
impossible Dunkin' sandwich, and looking directly

460
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,720
at the camera. - I hope somebody finds

461
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,120
that photo, I hope somebody sends it to us.

462
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,120
- Me too, man, she's out there somewhere.

463
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,720
I doubt that she listens to the podcast.

464
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,240
- That was a fan's mom.

465
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,160
- Yeah. - Oh, it could've been.

466
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,640
- Honey, here's that bald guy you keep trying

467
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
to show me during dinner. - What?

468
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,240
- Yeah, did it look like-- - That's not him,

469
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,200
that's a monkey.

470
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,920
- Did it look like someone you knew?

471
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:20,640
- Yeah, it actually looked exactly like my best friend.

472
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
Really? Yeah, my bad. You're right. Is that true?

473
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
It was actually my best friend, yeah.

474
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,640
Oh man, I really fucked that up. I thought it was a stranger.

475
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
Yeah, you could have fuckin', you could have told them.

476
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Yeah, it was Darla, my best friend.

477
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,640
You could have told them, "Hey, I'm your best friend."

478
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Yeah, I would say. They probably would have sent you the picture.

479
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
"I'm your best friend."

480
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,640
[laughter]

481
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Have you guys ever been, knowingly, had a photo taken of you in public?

482
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Um, I don't think so.

483
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Yeah, I don't think so either.

484
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Unless you count selfies taken with my beautiful friends that I love.

485
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Yeah.

486
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,240
- No, I don't, why would I count those?

487
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,920
That makes no fucking sense, dude.

488
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,800
- I've had like friends take a picture like of me

489
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,600
from behind and then send it to me.

490
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,800
- You've never dressed especially stupid one day

491
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,480
and then like a bunch of construction workers

492
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,920
take a photo of you?

493
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:02,760
- No.

494
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,680
- Oh, yeah, me neither.

495
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,400
- I mean, in high school I think,

496
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,360
in high school I probably like,

497
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,440
so I'd like tuck my shirts in sometimes.

498
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,640
- I'm sure it's happened that I just didn't notice it.

499
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,200
It's happened to everybody.

500
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,540
- Yeah, I guess.

501
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,460
- I think, it's okay, Caleb,

502
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,160
that happens to pretty much everybody.

503
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,960
- Yeah, everybody has that day, right?

504
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,200
- Pretty, yeah, exactly, a day a week.

505
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,960
That's how often it happens to most people.

506
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,800
It's normal.

507
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,640
- Yeah.

508
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,760
(coughing)

509
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,840
- Like second grade?

510
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,000
- Yeah, everybody has that day where you walk out

511
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,880
in downtown Boston and then the next day

512
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,320
you see a post on Twitter with 500 million likes.

513
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,640
It's a Snapchat photo of that with the caption,

514
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,400
"He on Charlie Brown today."

515
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:47,640
(laughter)

516
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,080
- Everybody's had that happen to them, right?

517
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,820
Everybody's been in that situation.

518
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:56,400
- What was, oh, speaking of just like, you know,

519
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,500
dressed in stupid, second grade,

520
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,500
they had crazy hat day, and yeah.

521
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,340
- For a week.

522
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,880
- Some of those hats were crazy.

523
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,840
- What a boon.

524
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,680
- Those hats that day.

525
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,520
- You would not believe this one guy was wearing a hat

526
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,800
looked like a damn chicken.

527
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,160
I said take that off your head.

528
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,000
- It looked like his head was--

529
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,840
- You are not doing that today.

530
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,840
But I, uh, I showed up.

531
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:20,400
Any other day, but not on crazy hat day.

532
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:26,440
I had that Darth Vader mask, like the one, the two piece one that has like the chest piece

533
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,860
from like Halloween.

534
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:32,240
And I like showed up wearing that and I was like pressing the button like talking through

535
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:37,860
it and they told me I couldn't wear it because it was like too distracting.

536
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:43,220
So I just went around that whole day with just like the Darth Vader like headpiece thing.

537
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,460
you know like in space balls where he wears like the big helmet and he's just

538
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:50,300
like yeah all he's wearing I was like dressed up like that for like the rest of

539
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:54,980
second the day in second grade damn you were a stupid ass seven-year-old dude

540
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,540
that's like the stupidest fucking move you can make it's like oh yeah I'm gonna

541
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:02,460
bring I'm gonna bring my whole Darth Vader

542
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,380
Oh yeah, we have like a test today.

543
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,380
Yeah.

544
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,380
Yeah.

545
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,380
Yeah.

546
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:16,620
I know, did you guys dress up for Halloween at school?

547
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Yeah.

548
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Did I?

549
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,620
I don't think so.

550
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:23,900
I wasn't, in fucking, in first grade I was pissed about this.

551
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,540
My mom didn't let me wear my Yama Yugi outfit.

552
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,540
Your Yamaka?

553
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,940
My Yugi Moto, is that it?

554
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:31,940
What are you talking about?

555
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Yugi from Yu-Gi-Oh.

556
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,940
Who is the?

557
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,120
Yami Yugi's when he turns big.

558
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
That's the one I was wearing.

559
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Yeah.

560
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:43,240
She didn't let me wear my Yami Yugi outfit because she thought that it was violent or

561
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,240
something.

562
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:51,700
The school banned Patrick's Pharaoh outfit for certain reasons.

563
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,700
But I had to go dressed up as Scooby-Doo that day and I was pissed off.

564
00:30:55,700 --> 00:31:03,100
Scooby-Doo of all the fucking people in the show that are humans?

565
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,100
dressed up like the dog?

566
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:08,100
But then when I got home, when I got home I changed.

567
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:10,100
What was the costume like? What did it entail?

568
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:13,100
Like a full Scooby Doo...

569
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
Like a costume?

570
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Like a big furry costume.

571
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:21,100
Was it the thing where the dog's head was over your head?

572
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,100
Yeah, the dog's head was over my head.

573
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:25,100
Yeah, your face is in the neck.

574
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:30,100
I had to wear that instead of my fucking sick Yami Yugi outfit.

575
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,100
That's horrifying, bro.

576
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:39,180
That's maybe I was pissed I was fucking oh my god cuz I came home that night and I could go trick-or-treating as Yugi

577
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:44,240
But I couldn't fucking wear yami Yugi to school. Did you have a dual disc?

578
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:50,020
Yeah, oh I had the whole fucking serious. Do you still have that duelist? Those are we're not a lot of money now

579
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,020
I broke that when I was a kid my mom

580
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:55,140
What I I didn't even like

581
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,580
Like watch Yu-Gi-Oh that much. I just thought the costume was sick

582
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,820
everybody thought Yu-Gi-Oh was cool without watching that much of it.

583
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,820
That's the point.

584
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:06,220
I wasn't a camera level Yu-Gi-Oh fan.

585
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:08,260
It was like, to me, I wasn't either as a kid.

586
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,020
I got into Yu-Gi-Oh in college.

587
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,060
It sucked, dude.

588
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:18,660
My family always thought like any Japanese TV show was demonic.

589
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
Yeah.

590
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:23,940
It was like, Pokemon were the devil, Yu-Gi-Oh was the devil.

591
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:28,460
But my mom made me dress up like Harry Potter and go to one of the Harry Potter premieres

592
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:31,180
when I was a kid and that was one of the worst days of my entire life.

593
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:36,860
It's also, I remember my parents, like I would try to watch like Harry Potter.

594
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:43,600
I remember trying to watch like anime, like trying to like watch anime on TV or like Pokemon

595
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,740
or Yu-Gi-Oh or something and then adults being like, "Ugh, like this animation is so, it's

596
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:49,740
so horrible.

597
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:52,980
Like only, like their mouths are moving and they barely even match up with the words and

598
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,900
it's like, it turned on like a Hanna-Barbera or something instead and it's like this is,

599
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,900
Oh yeah.

600
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,620
Are you watching Dora the Explorer again?

601
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,220
That devil TV show?

602
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,620
You fucking piece of shit.

603
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:09,420
My uncle, one of my uncles, my uncle Kevin would just like tell us we couldn't watch

604
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:10,900
Dora because she got deported.

605
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:15,020
Well that's not even, that's just a joke.

606
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:17,980
That's just kind of a, kind of an alright joke by Kevin.

607
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
Yeah.

608
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,980
Yeah whatever Kevin.

609
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
It was pretty funny.

610
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:21,980
Did you guys call him Clever Kevin?

611
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:22,980
No we never called him that.

612
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,460
You had to have called him Clever Kevin.

613
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,660
I mean I know, I know that guy was going to call him Clever Kevin.

614
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
It's like my uncle Mental Michael.

615
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,580
(laughing)

616
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,860
Mental Michael had a lot of really good jokes

617
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,020
when I was a kid, dude.

618
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:35,860
Yeah.

619
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,780
Yeah, Mental Michael, I remember one time,

620
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:39,900
dude, this one blew my mind, when I was like 10,

621
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,620
I was like, yeah, I love horror movies,

622
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,540
and he said, "Um, they prefer to be called

623
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,180
"prostitute movies."

624
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:46,020
Oh my God.

625
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:46,860
I was like, oh, you Mental Michael,

626
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,680
you fucking, you mentaled me again, you Michael.

627
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,940
I've definitely talked about Uncle Kevin before,

628
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,860
because his, somebody, my cousin Timmy was like,

629
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,200
"I want an eye touch for Christmas."

630
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,460
And he said, "Oh, I want an eye touch myself."

631
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,340
- I mean, that's a mental Michael Lyne fucking word for word.

632
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,340
I feel like all the uncles maybe have a shared consciousness

633
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,180
or something.

634
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,600
- We've definitely talked about this,

635
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:12,100
but the eye touch was just a gift for uncles.

636
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,600
- Yeah, definitely.

637
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,860
- I mean, not as a joke, I mean, just like,

638
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
get your uncle an eye touch.

639
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,700
- Yeah.

640
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,140
- It's a good gift for your uncle.

641
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,140
- Yeah, 'cause they don't have anybody to talk to,

642
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,060
but they would like to play games on it.

643
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
They would love talking to us.

644
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:28,740
They need a camera right now.

645
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,180
Steve Jobs did focus groups and he saw, and whenever an uncle was in the focus group, you

646
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:37,940
know, they would be in there and they'd be going like, "Yeah, you know, I think this

647
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:41,460
little device is pretty cool, but I want an iPod myself."

648
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:44,780
And then they'd raise their eyebrows and nobody would laugh.

649
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:48,960
And then Steve Jobs was like, "We need to take this up a notch.

650
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,960
We need the eye touch."

651
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:50,960
Yeah.

652
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
That's the next step.

653
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:55,440
cancer and he was like I need to eat so many grapes now.

654
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,440
Yeah.

655
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
Fuck.

656
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,440
I was thinking about that the other day.

657
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
I need juice.

658
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
It's so fucking funny dude.

659
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Yeah.

660
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,040
That Steve Jobs got like the worst most like fucking aggressive cancer that is like somewhat

661
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:10,720
treatable and he was like I'm gonna eat a very I'm gonna eat a pineapple and a coconut.

662
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,600
The funniest part of that is that every guy like that who's like insanely rich like some

663
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:19,280

00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,960
You have to repeat it.

682
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,960
You can't like sit and write it.

683
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
You're pulling it away.

684
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:35,960
You're covering your mouth.

00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
insanely stupid

741
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
and like too fast-paced when we were kids.

742
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
Watching that and like how slow the jokes come,

743
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960

It's just they don't want to like.

756
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,480

757
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,200
You can't kill Barney on TV.

776
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,200
This is like Larry Sanders show.

777
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,720

779
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
And Friends.

780
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,880

785
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,240
Like we need to make a kids cartoon now.

786
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,200

787
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,020
- Yeah, dude.

788
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,360
- What about, okay, let's just, let's think about,

789
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,940
let's think about like the apps we could exploit for that.

790
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,400
- Oh yeah, 'cause we would, for us to get picked up,

791
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,860
we'd have to come from an app.

792
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,520
Let me look at apps on my phone.

793
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,360
- The Grindr logo.

794
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,520
- Pee nowadays, people would probably love that,

795
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:15,120
tell

796
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
This is perfect.

797
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
You can't see it.

798
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
It's too bright.

799
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,760
What about, oh, here's actually an app on my phone that I was thinking could be good for

800
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
this one.

801
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,520
And, you know, if you need more details about it, you could just ask me what it is.

802
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,800
But I was thinking this, I'm looking at this app right now called BoFa.

803
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,720
Wait, BoFa?

804
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,720
What could that possibly be?

805
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,720
Hold on, I'm getting a call.

806
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:35,720

from Santa? That's kind of weird.

You don't FaceTime him? Huh. Oh, strange.

840
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,200

00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:09,420
Can you imagine how good of a guest Santa Claus would be

902
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,220
on this show and we could do his list?

903
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:14,100
- Yeah, so think about this.

904
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,900
- We could do--

905
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,700
- We could file that idea away is all I'm gonna say.

906
00:48:18,700 --> 00:48:20,900
- We could help him make the list and check it twice.

907
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:25,060
- We talked to him a little earlier so I don't wanna--

908
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:27,420
- Someone here does have his number.

909
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:28,860
- Yeah, so we--

910
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:31,100
(laughing)

911
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:39,380
I did send him a letter or two, and I have been leaving out a plate of cookies for him

912
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,380
on every holiday.

913
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:46,380
I have left out a plate of cookies every night.

914
00:48:46,380 --> 00:48:49,580
Do dads always eat all the cookies?

915
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,360
Do you think moms help too?

916
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,060
I think moms eat the carrots for the reindeer.

917
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,060
Yeah, moms eat the carrots.

918
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:55,460
And dads eat the cookies.

919
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:56,460
Carrots?

920
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,460
And the kids eat the presents.

921
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:00,500
You didn't leave out carrots for the reindeer as a kid?

922
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:03,140
I was a fucking hippie dude. What are you talking about carrots?

923
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:05,460
I left out carrots too. Carrots and cookies.

924
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:06,460
You guys are gay.

925
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:09,020
I still leave them out.

926
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:13,900
No, cookies dude. Reindeer, you're getting cookies.

927
00:49:13,900 --> 00:49:18,980
You're the reason that the reindeer are unhealthy. You were leaving out so many cookies.

928
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:23,620
What do you mean they can't eat the cookies? They're magic. What are you, you fucking idiot

929
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:26,700
dude. They can eat anything. They don't exist.

930
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:27,700
You can't.

931
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,700
What do you mean they don't exist?

932
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,700
Shut the fuck up.

933
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,580
- Listen, I will accept that Santa was made up, okay?

934
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:34,420
- But the reindeer.

935
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,980
- But the reindeer are real.

936
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,900
I heard them jingling on the roof when I was seven.

937
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,540
- The reindeer and the-- - You can't fake that.

938
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:44,860
- And the Christmas cards are real.

939
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:46,420
- You can't fake the reindeer.

940
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,620
- Did you guys know anybody

941
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,580
who believed in Santa way too long?

942
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,620
- Yeah, me.

943
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,180
- Really, when did you stop believing in Santa?

944
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,260
- I was like nine.

945
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:55,540
- I don't know how, yeah, I was probably in like--

946
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:56,360
- Actually my brother probably--

947
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:57,460
- First grade when I found out,

948
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,860
but I found out from a friend,

949
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,540
as opposed to like from my parents,

950
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,980
which I don't know if that just means it's too late or not.

951
00:50:03,980 --> 00:50:07,460
- I knew somebody whose family,

952
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:09,000
like their entire family,

953
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,860
would get really in on just like selling Santa Claus

954
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:14,020
until they were like 13.

955
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,980
- Yeah. - And then, yeah,

956
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,180
they used to like fucking,

957
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:17,860
they would like leave mud tracks

958
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:19,980
like of his boots all over the house.

959
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,100
They would have their grandpa

960
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,500
like come sit outside of the window at night,

961
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,500
like dress like Santa,

962
00:50:24,500 --> 00:50:25,620
like the whole fucking nine hours.

963
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:30,980
I remember I was talking about Santa when I was in elementary school with a kid who was

964
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,100
a grade below me or something.

965
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:38,040
He told me, "Yeah, actually, it's not Santa who brings the presents.

966
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:39,040
It's actually Jesus."

967
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:41,500
I was like, "Is that true?"

968
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:46,180
I went home and I told my mom, "I just found out some people actually believe that Jesus

969
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,180
brings the presents."

970
00:50:47,180 --> 00:50:49,020
She was like, "What are you talking about?

971
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:54,940
No, there's no person who thinks that.

972
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:56,900
It's not like one of the options.

973
00:50:56,900 --> 00:51:00,140
This girl told me that like after she found out Santa wasn't real she was like, "Yeah,

974
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:03,940
it pretty much like ruined my relationship with my parents for like 10 years."

975
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,540
I was like, "Yeah, I guess that makes sense."

976
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:13,140
She's like lying about the world like so explicitly for so long, making you like, like cursing

977
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:17,300
you to be the weird kid at school who's in like eighth grade and they're like, "Are

978
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:18,820
you gonna go to Tammy's party?

979
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:20,860
Like we're gonna have sex."

980
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:27,460
she's like oh no I'm busy writing my letter to Santa this year I stopped

981
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,180
believing in like the tooth fairy and the Easter Bunny before I ever stopped

982
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,660
believing in Santa like it was like well those are fake yeah those obviously

983
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:40,780
obviously those are fake but like once a tooth yeah Santa that guy's real I mean

984
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:46,660
I get a presence yeah exactly the tag says Santa right I mean it's not he

985
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:48,180
He would not write his name.

986
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,020
- Exactly.

987
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:51,060
- And he has different, way worse handwriting

988
00:51:51,060 --> 00:51:51,880
than my parents.

989
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,020
- If it was my dad leaving the presents,

990
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:55,940
he would write dad and then cross it out

991
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:57,460
and then write Santa.

992
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,500
Because he got confused.

993
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,060
It's hard to just write another person.

994
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:00,980
It wouldn't work.

995
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:03,740
- Yeah, my dad's bad at impressions.

996
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,020
He couldn't do that.

997
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,980
Doesn't make any sense, dude.

998
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:08,940
Do you think, if you guys ever have kids,

999
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,540
you think you'll tell them Santa's real?

1000
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,580
- Yeah.

1001
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:12,420
- Oh, are you kidding me?

1002
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,860
- I mean, at first, I would try and--

1003
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:15,700
- Until they're like six maybe.

1004
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,980
- And get rid of it pretty early though.

1005
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,820
- Six?

1006
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,540
- I think that's like, yeah, I think you gotta,

1007
00:52:19,540 --> 00:52:21,620
I think it's gotta be something, you gotta set--

1008
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,500
- See, but I wanna lie to my kids about everything.

1009
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,340
- Yeah.

1010
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:26,700
- Yeah, so like I'd like to start that,

1011
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,540
set that precedent pretty early.

1012
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:29,380
- Yeah.

1013
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,200
- You know?

1014
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,220
- Yeah, I mean you could make up,

1015
00:52:31,220 --> 00:52:32,720
that's the thing about Santa,

1016
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,340
you can make up whoever you want and tell them,

1017
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:36,180
tell your kids that person exists.

1018
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:38,380
- You have to go to sleep, Santa Claus is coming tonight,

1019
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,780
and Dad is the mayor, so he has to go back to work

1020
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:42,220
at the mayor's office.

1021
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:43,820
He has to sign a bunch of bills,

1022
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:45,580
he's gonna make every drug legal.

1023
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:49,820
And if Santa Claus sees you out of bed, he'll kill you, and I won't be home to protect you.

1024
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:54,540
And I can't stop him, you know, because he's like basically one level above Mayor.

1025
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,460
My dad just whispered to me, he just said, "I was Santa."

1026
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,180
Your dad was Santa?

1027
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:02,780
Tell him what the fuck happened.

1028
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:03,340
What happened?

1029
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,740
Hold the mic up to him.

1030
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:07,980
What do you mean, what happened?

1031
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,220
Say, "Why aren't you Santa anymore?"

1032
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:11,900
Why aren't you Santa anymore?

1033
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:13,900
He grew up.

1034
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,900
We had a fight and we told him there's no more fricking sound.

1035
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:21,500
here we still have worst interview we have ever fought there saying you're the

1036
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,860
worst interviewee

1037
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:26,500
of all you have to get closer to the yeah imagine if you're watching a guy get

1038
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:29,380

00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:45,780

1045
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:48,980

00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:12,940
- He's gonna sit on my weiner.

1051
00:54:12,940 --> 00:54:14,580
- He's gonna sit on your weiner, I'm not telling him that.

1052
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,540
- He just heard that, that counts.

1053
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:18,700
- I guess it does.

1054
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,100
- Tell him he's gonna-- - I guess you've tricked me.

1055
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:20,940
I guess you've tricked me into that.

1056
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:22,220
- Tell him he's gonna sit on my weiner

1057
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:23,840

00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:29,260
And he's gonna be making some face like,

1060

1061
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,580
- He's gonna make the weiner disappear like a wizard.

1062
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:34,540
Say that.

1063
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:37,260
- Tell him he's gonna hang off my weiner like a meat hook.

1064
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,500
- I'm not gonna say that.

1065
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,980

00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,080
He said wiener. He said you're gonna hang on his wiener.

1070
00:54:51,080 --> 00:54:52,480
Hang on his wiener like a meat hook, huh?

1071
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:52,980
Yeah.

1072
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:53,980

Say the thing about the wizard. Say, say the thing about the-

1074
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,980
I don't, I'm not gonna say this fucking thing about the wizard.

1075
00:54:58,980 --> 00:55:00,980
Tell him he's a little piggy and he likes it.

1076
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:01,980
I'm not gonna-

1077
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:02,980
No! Come on!

1078
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,480
Tell-

1079
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,980
Ask him if he wants to say he's a little sloppy little piggy.

1080
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:10,380
I'm not saying that to him.

1081
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,380
Why?

1082
00:55:11,380 --> 00:55:16,140
No, I have too much respect for my father.

1083
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:20,100
I will not tell him he's going to eat your slop like a pig.

1084
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:22,140
Tell him he's going to hang clothesline off this penis.

1085
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,140
No.

1086
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:26,060
You're going to look like a damn t-shirt hanging off this thing.

1087
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:29,540
Tell him I'm going to put my round peck in his square hole.

1088
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,260
He left the room but he said yummy yummy.

1089
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,620
Tell him he's going to use my dong like a diving board.

1090
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:37,540
And tell him he's going to play wipeout with this yeehawn.

1091
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:41,060
Tell him I got a USB and I'm gonna upload some data into his womb.

1092
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:43,980
He had his Guinness and he left.

1093
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:44,980
Tell him he's about to fucking...

1094
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:45,980
Tell him...

1095
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:46,980
He's gone!

1096
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:47,980
I can't tell him anything else!

1097
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,980
Go find him.

1098
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:49,980
I...

1099
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:50,980
No!

1100
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:51,980
I don't want to care about where he is.

1101
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:52,980
Go find out where he is.

1102
00:55:52,980 --> 00:55:53,980
Tell him...

1103
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:54,980
Okay.

1104
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:55,980
But...

1105
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:56,980
Okay.

1106
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,980
When he comes back...

1107
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:58,980
One more thing.

1108
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:01,020
Tell him that when he gets over to my house pretty soon, he's gonna walk up to my wiener

1109
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:06,020
wearing big tall boots and cherry pie will be playing and he's gonna do an insane flag

1110
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:07,020
- He's gone.

1111
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,020
- He's gone.

1112
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:09,020
- He's gone.

1113
00:56:09,020 --> 00:56:10,020
- He's gone.

1114
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:11,020
- He's gone.

1115
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,020
- He's gone.

1116
00:56:12,020 --> 00:56:13,020
- He's gone.

1117
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,020
- He's gone.

1118
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,020
- He's gone.

1119
00:56:15,020 --> 00:56:16,020
- He's gone.

1120
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,020
- He's gone.

1121
00:56:17,020 --> 00:56:18,020
- He's gone.

1122
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,020

1123
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:20,020

1124
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:21,020

1125
00:56:21,020 --> 00:56:22,020

1126
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,020
- He's gone.

1127
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,020
- He's gone.

1128
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:25,020
- He's gone.

1129
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:26,020
- He's gone.

1130
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:27,020
- He's gone.

1131
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,020
- He's gone.

1132
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:29,020
- He's gone.

1133
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,020
- He's gone.

1134
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,020
- He's gone.

1135
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,020
- He's gone.

1136
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,020
- He's gone.

1137
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,020
- He's gone.

1138
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,020
- He's gone.

1139
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,020
Tell him.

1140
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:37,020
I'll tell him.

1141
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,020
I'll tell him.

1142
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:40,500
Okay, will you tell him that he's going to sit on my wiener like it's a throne, but he's

1143
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:43,580
actually going to be sitting on my balls like they're the bottom of the throne, and then

1144
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,220
the wiener will be like the back of it, and he's going to sit on it.

1145
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:49,740
And I guess my pubes will be the arms of the chair, too.

1146
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:55,740
Tell him I'm going to play Unblock Me with his butthole until I get a clear path inside.

1147
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:57,220
Tell him he's going to kiss it like he's meeting a dog.

1148
00:56:57,220 --> 00:57:01,700
You know, Unblock Me, that app, I'm going to be swiping different interlocking pieces

1149
00:57:01,700 --> 00:57:07,140
a poop away until you know there's a space I can climb in.

1150
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:15,260
I'm gonna be clearing lines of dookie like Tetris up in your dad's fucking shitter.

1151
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:17,740
My long straight piece is gonna do a triple Tetris.

1152
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:19,660
He's gonna slide it into his dookie Tetris.

1153
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:21,740
I'm gonna T-spin, just tell him I'm gonna T-spin in.

1154
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,740
Just say that, just say that.

1155
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:23,740
You don't have to say anything else.

1156
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,160
That's all you have to tell him, is that so hard?

1157
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:30,380
I'm gonna T-spin into his asshole and I'm gonna spit out a drop of cum out of there.

1158
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:32,380
That's it, okay? Nothing else.

1159
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,380
Just tell him I'm gonna-

1160
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:34,380
Can we talk about something different?

1161
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:37,380
Yeah, we'll talk about how your dad's gonna play Dig Dug in my thick rug.

1162
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:38,380
Just tell him that.

1163
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:42,380
Downstairs.

1164
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,380
Just tell him that, dude.

1165
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,380
Oh my god.

1166
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:50,380
Just tell him I got the big dot from Pac-Man and I'm feeling hungry.

1167
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,380
That's right.

1168
00:57:51,380 --> 00:57:55,380
Tell him he can shoot some ghosts in my mouth, 'cause I'm the hungry Pac-Man.

1169
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:58,380
And I'd be Mrs. Pac-Man if he likes it.

1170
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,380
This is my father.

1171
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,880
Oh, so somebody can't even like talk to their dad? That's sad as fuck.

1172
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,380
Yeah, I mean, come on.

1173
00:58:05,380 --> 00:58:07,880
This guy can't even be honest with his dad, you know?

1174
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:12,880
And say, "Listen, my brother Caleb, his wiener's the Hungry Hungry Hippo,

1175
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,880
and your balls are the only food he's ever wanted."

1176
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,880
My brother?

1177
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:16,880
I'm your brother now.

1178
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:17,880
Tell him, hey, tell him, just tell him.

1179
00:58:17,880 --> 00:58:22,880
If you're my brother now, that makes this whole, that makes the conversation very fucking weird.

1180
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,880
Just listen, okay? Just quiet for a second and just tell him, the next time you see him,

1181
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:31,360
him that I have the plug and play joystick and we're gonna play pole position. Just tell

1182
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:36,320
him. Please tell him that he's Homer and my wiener is Bart. You better start ringing that

1183
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:43,320
neck. Yeah. Exactly. Please? Yeah. Tell him, just tell him this. This is what I get for

1184
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:52,840
going home. Just tell him I said this. You guys are upset that I'm at home with my family.

1185
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:58,320
When you got a peter like griffin everything looks like a chicken.

1186
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:07,360
Tell him it's about bedtime and he needs to close his eyes and brush his teeth.

1187
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,580
Please.

1188
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:11,140
Just please dude.

1189
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:15,400
It's cause I'm home now and you guys are mad, you have separation anxiety and you're latching

1190
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:16,400
out at me.

1191
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:17,400
I'm not latching out at you.

1192
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,400
Caleb's special.

1193
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,400
I'm not at you.

1194
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,040
Caleb's latching out at my dad cause he's jealous.

1195
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:25,620
I'm gonna be latching on to him.

1196
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:27,280
- I'm gonna be latching like Minnie Mouse

1197
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,080
when I seduce your dad.

1198
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:29,960
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

1199
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,080
- You better not.

1200
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:31,920
- Ding, ding, ding.

1201
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:32,760
- You better not seduce my dad.

1202
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,120
- Oh, hey. - He loves my mom.

1203
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:37,080
- He's about to love my bomb.

1204
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,040
That's what I call my fucking cock, dude.

1205
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,440
Call it a bomb.

1206
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,720
- Yeah, 'cause it's round and it has a wick.

1207
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:44,560
- Yep, that's right.

1208
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,200
Yeah, it does, so what?

1209
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,300
Your dad's about to light this fuse.

1210
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:50,880
I got a burning bomb for your daddy.

1211
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,320
He's about to see me explode.

1212
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,800
My dad's not going to watch you explode.

1213
00:59:54,800 --> 01:00:03,400
Will you just tell him just like a single time we want our wieners to play Ren and Stimpy?

1214
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,920
Can you stop saying this about my father?

1215
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:09,760
I just want to sweep around inside his minds.

1216
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,760
You know?

1217
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:11,760
That's right.

1218
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:12,760
Yeah.

1219
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:13,760
That's fucking right, dude.

1220
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:14,760
Until I hit the mother load.

1221
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,880
Tell him he has to do a hacking minigame on my wiener.

1222
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,600
It's as simple as that.

1223
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,320
Just tell him Deus Ex.

1224
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,320
You know, you don't have to go into any more details after that.

1225
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:22,820
Just say like...

1226
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,320
You're not gonna have a day of sex with him.

1227
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:26,320
Just say, just say like, just say, just say like...

1228
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:27,320
[laughs]

1229
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,820
Just say like, "Bioshock Infinite."

1230
01:00:28,820 --> 01:00:32,820
Just go to him and say, "Bioshock Infinite," and he'll understand what I... where I'm going for.

1231
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:36,820
Tell him my metal here is solid, and he better not be seen by my tower.

1232
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:40,820
[laughs]

1233
01:00:40,820 --> 01:00:44,820
I can't even participate in this. It's about my own father.

1234
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:48,320
Tell him he's about to rim me 'til I go up in the sky.

1235
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,320
[Laughter]

1236
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
What?

1237
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,320
That's right.

1238
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:58,320
Yeah, tell him, I'm gonna be all over his Elder Scroll.

1239
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
You know what I'm saying? Yeah.

1240
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,320
Yeah, tell him, and we ain't stopping, because I got more to end.

1241
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,320
That's right. [Laughter]

1242
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,320
[Laughter]

1243
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,320
[Laughter]

1244
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:10,320
[Laughter]

1245
01:01:10,320 --> 01:01:14,320
And when we're done, that butt's gonna be oblivion.

1246
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
[Laughter]

1247
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:19,320
Tell him it's that fucking simple dude.

1248
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:23,320
Tell him I hope I don't fall out his new A-MAS.

1249
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:33,320
[Laughter]

1250
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,320
Yeah, I mean just tell him.

1251
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,320
Next time you see him just say I'm gonna have sex with him.

1252
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,320
Yeah, just all that shit.

1253
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,320
Bye guys.

1254
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:51,320
