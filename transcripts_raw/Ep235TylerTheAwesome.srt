1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:12,200
- Freddy's Nightmare.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,040
- I have--

4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,320
- Worst start of all time, looked at something

5
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,000
on the screen that wasn't showing up,

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:17,840
and you said--

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:18,660
- I thought it was on the screen.

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,500
- You just read it.

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,400
- Okay, we were gonna change the name of the podcast

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,560
to Normal Podcast 'cause the one episode that we did

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,680
where we started the episode with the Mortal Kombat

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,120
theme song and it said, "Test your mic, Normal Podcast."

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:29,760
- Why are you talking like an eye of a dog?

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,200
That's the context.

15
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:32,440
That's the context.

16
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,880
They like to set me up and then make me look like

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:35,720
fucking dog shit.

18
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,040
- Wait, okay, so then explain how that

19
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,520
carries over to Freddy's Nightmare or whatever you said.

20
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,360
- Yeah, why did you just--

21
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,180
- Well, Jubio was looking up spaghetti podcasts.

22
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,240
- You're right, we made you look like a moron there.

23
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:48,560
- Yeah, Jubio did.

24
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:50,480
Jubio made me look like a moron.

25
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,720
- You know what, will you show the people

26
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,680
why you're acting like this?

27
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:53,520
- I'm not acting like--

28
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
- Show the people why you're acting like--

29
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,560
- Yeah, okay, they didn't let me go and get a Red Bull,

30
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,220
So in an act of defiance, I drank a white claw

31
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,640
that was laying around here in the office.

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,400
- What the hell, he's drunk on the job?

33
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,240
- He's literally drunk off his ass.

34
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,220
- Yeah. - It's one o'clock.

35
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,060
- Uh-huh. - 112 PM.

36
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,000
- And I have a problem again.

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
- No. - Again?

38
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,280
- Dude. (laughs)

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,280
- No, dude, no. - Yeah, yeah.

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,680
I have a problem again.

41
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,700
- I have a problem.

42
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,000
- I drink every single night and day.

43
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,920
- Night and day?

44
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,760
- Every single night and day.

45
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,160
- Do you think you could maybe slide

46
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,000
into being like the East Coast Burt Kreischer?

47
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,500
No.

48
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,740
You don't think I could?

49
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,240
No.

50
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,040
You think you could?

51
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,280
Yeah, I think I could do it.

52
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,240
Because he's already got that position filled.

53
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,200
I mean, you are a party animal.

54
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,320
Yeah.

55
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,280
You would be if it wasn't for the fact that Amber got there

56
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,780
first.

57
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,280
Yeah.

58
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,080
He-- you haven't understand him for a while.

59
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm not riding his damn coattails, you know?

60
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,400
But I remember in Boston--

61
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,240
I wouldn't be wearing any coattails, buddy.

62
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,740
Yeah, no.

63
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,680
You would not be wearing-- you'd be reversing--

64
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,120
Get off stage.

65
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
I'm certainly not going to get off stage.

66
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,640
I'd put on like an old-fashioned piano recital,

67
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,920
like the one with the really long coattails.

68
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,160
- You're gonna be called Reverse Kreischer

69
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,600
and you're gonna go up on stage with no pants.

70
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
- That would be upside down Kreischer,

71
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,640
that wouldn't be reverse.

72
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,160
- Reverse Kreischer would be putting two shirts on.

73
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,880
- Revert Kreischer.

74
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,880
- Oh.

75
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:12,880
- Invert Kreischer.

76
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,520
- Invert Kreischer, invert Kreischer, there it is.

77
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,760
- That's pretty good actually.

78
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,520
- Invert Kreischer, you go up no pants and you say,

79
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,040
I'm a...

80
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,000
- So dating is weird.

81
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,160
- What's the opposite of a machine?

82
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,560
Yeah, they call me the organism.

83
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,060
Yeah.

84
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,360
The only thing I knew how to say was

85
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,960
I went to Ukrainian school and they called me the organism.

86
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:35,660
We're actually coming up with a funny as fuck comedy bang bang character right now.

87
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,460
Yeah.

88
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,360
Invert Kreischer.

89
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,860
Yeah.

90
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,860
No pants.

91
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,660
The only thing I knew how to say was I am nature.

92
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,360
Yeah.

93
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,160
I am a tree.

94
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,160
I am a single celled thing.

95
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,160
You're trying to think of the, okay, what's the opposite of machine?

96
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:47,960
A tree.

97
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,560
Yeah.

98
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,160
That's just stupid.

99
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,560
Yeah.

100
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,660
No, that's not charged.

101
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,660
Oh, C. F.

102
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:55,660
Yeah, you're fail.

103
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,660
I'm fail today.

104
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,660
Okay, we're not going to start with that.

105
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,660
No, you're not doing fail flop.

106
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,660
No, no failing, no flopping today.

107
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:00,660
Yeah, because they already did it.

108
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:01,660
We're in a flop free, fail free.

109
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
We already did it in another episode.

110
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,660
I'm actually in an amazing mood today.

111
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,660
Something about us is once we do bits, we don't like to repeat them.

112
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
Fuck no!

113
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,660
Our bits are kind of one-off bits.

114
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,660
We're paid professionals.

115
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,660
We do not repeat anything.

116
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,660
I have a new favorite band, guys.

117
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,660
Do you guys even give a shit?

118
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,660
It's the Grateful Dead or Bob Marley.

119
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,660
No.

120
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,660
Okay, you have two guesses.

121
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,660
You have two guesses who the band is.

122
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,660
It's the Grateful Dead.

123
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,740
Do you guys want to give a shit?

124
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,020
- It's the Grateful Dead or Bob Marley.

125
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:19,860
- No, okay.

126
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,420
You have two guesses, you have two guesses

127
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,780
who the band is.

128
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,260
And let me give you one little hint.

129
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,620
- Imagine Dragons.

130
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,980
- That's actually close.

131
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,820
- Yeah.

132
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,660
- 21 Pilots?

133
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,860
- It's two words.

134
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:33,340
No, it's actually more than that.

135
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,060
It's two states.

136
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,180
- Florida Georgia Line.

137
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,420
- Yes.

138
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,980
- You already talked about this.

139
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,220
- It is meant to be, it'll be, it'll be.

140
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,220
- He went home.

141
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:45,060
He's gonna be over this in a couple weeks.

142
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,060
No I won't. I went to North Carolina.

143
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,060
I became a... it's called bro country, okay?

144
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,060
And actually I found the Wikipedia page for it

145
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:53,060
so I'll find it while you guys talk shit about me.

146
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:55,060
Literally all I can do is tsk.

147
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:58,060
He likes Morgan Whelan for his actions, not his music.

148
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:01,060
I don't know how I don't even know.

149
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,060
Morgan Whelan got caught saying the N-word at a high school party.

150
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
He got caught?

151
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:09,060
It wasn't... okay. He did say the N-word.

152
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
But it was not at a high school party.

153
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
It was in his front yard.

154
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,480
- It's really funny to phrase it like

155
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,860
he got caught doing it too.

156
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,700
Like if someone like came around the corner and was like,

157
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,040
"Ah, I gotcha!"

158
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,620
- Hey!

159
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,780
Bro country songs are often musically upbeat.

160
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,740
Oh yeah, that sounds terrible, guys.

161
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,700
With lyrics about attractive young women,

162
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,340
the consumption of alcohol, partying, and pickup trucks.

163
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,460
- I don't fuck with that.

164
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,060
The kind of country that I fuck with

165
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,340
is actually the kind of leftist kind of country

166
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,460
where it says, "I joined the damn union."

167
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,300
- There's been criticism.

168
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,260
- Yeah. - Wait, what?

169
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,180
It's been criticized by listeners and music reviewers

170
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,540
for its repetitive subject matter,

171
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,540
namely lyrical themes of partying associated with Friday--

172
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,100
Associated with Friday nights.

173
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,340
(laughing)

174
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,180
What the fuck?

175
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:56,980
Alcoholic beverages, euphemistic references to sex

176
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,660
and trucks, as well as its lack of female country artists.

177
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,140
It's called bro country, you SJWs.

178
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,220
It's been criticized for being about Friday night?

179
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,780
He's really not gonna like when I start my new podcast,

180
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,980
Patrick's Music Corner.

181
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,800
Yeah.

182
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,040
both have your own separate shows now.

183
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,800
- Why is that a problem that it talks about Friday?

184
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,600
- Yeah, I'm still trying to kind of puzzle over that.

185
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,440
- Yeah, it's Friday.

186
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,280
- Euphemistic references.

187
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,560
- I think there's only one problem in there, right?

188
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,520
- Yeah, euphemistic sex, euphemistic references

189
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,020
to sex and trucks.

190
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,760
(laughing)

191
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,600
- Euphemistic references to trucks.

192
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,440
- I hate these truck euphemisms.

193
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,440
We're back in the bed and I talk in my room.

194
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,760
Shut up.

195
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,720
How is that bad?

196
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,160
That's cool.

197
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,000
- I'm driving my metal animal.

198
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,760
I don't fuck with trucks because of their gas guzzling.

199
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,680
And I fuck with, you know what I fuck with is Priuses.

200
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,320
- I fuck with most everything.

201
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
- I fuck with Priuses and Bell and Sebastian.

202
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,800
- Luckily Blake Shelton is to the rescue in January 2013.

203
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,920
He came to the rescue.

204
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,280
He said he didn't care about old farts

205
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,880
who complained about his songs.

206
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,720
- Okay. - Yeah.

207
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,540
- That's right.

208
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,480
- Well. - Fuck you farts.

209
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,760
- You know what? - I don't like farts.

210
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,680
- I'm not too much a fan of these new farts either.

211
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,000
- I like that country music that's about being

212
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
like a cowboy gets shot and the ones where it's like,

213
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,680
"I drank so much and I'm fucking killing myself."

214
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
- That's what Morgan Wallen is.

215
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Morgan Wallen is "I drank so much."

216
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,280

240
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,080
Do you wish?

241
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
What is kind of hair does Pete Holmes have?

242
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,200
When I was 16 I wore

243
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:46,160
Navy

244
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,160
Down I thought TJ Miller swag

245
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,360
- Dude, that fucking, that special where he like,

246
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,600
does a really bad joke and then confetti shoots everywhere

247
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,040
and he pulls out an AK-47, that was actually sick.

248
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,880
- I don't remember that.

249
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
- That was a good one.

250
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,000
- Have you seen his new one where he talks

251
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,280
to a mentally disabled guy?

252
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,120
- No.

253
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,400
- It's awesome, it has like 4,000 views on YouTube.

254
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,800
(laughing)

255
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,720
- Is it just like, was he a heckler?

256
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,240
- Yeah, well the guy starts talking to him on his special

257
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,240
and he's like, "Ah, this guy's weird."

258
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,920
And then he starts talking to him and realizes

259
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,280
that he has a mental disability,

260
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,880
and then he named the special like,

261
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:24,640
hello Jeffrey or whatever the guy's name is.

262
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,480
- Wow.

263
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,300
- It's kind of beautiful.

264
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,140
- Yeah. - Yeah.

265
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,160
- Yeah, it kind of should be a box

266
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,000
if you ask me. - Dude, stand-up is like

267
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,280
a fucking art form, and when you get

268
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,360
beautiful moments like that,

269
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,720
it's actually insane. - No.

270
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,480
- Insane at the moment. - No, no, it's over.

271
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,520
- It's actually, it's pure, no, it's just, it's work.

272
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,360
- Yeah. - It's labor.

273
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
- It's labor. - That's how I treat it.

274
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,160
- It's just a job. - There should be a union

275
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,680
if you ask me. - Yeah.

276
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:42,920
- And a confederacy. - Bro.

277
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,560
- Yeah. (laughs)

278
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,800
of stand-up comedians.

279
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,840
- There kind of is right now,

280
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,560
between Brooklyn and Manhattan.

281
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,640
- Wait, wait.

282
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,480
Now hold on, who's who?

283
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,120
- It's the Seller versus BCC.

284
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
- Now who's who?

285
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,840
- Who's who?

286
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,640
(laughing)

287
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,480
- Shut up.

288
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,300
- Yeah, this needs to end.

289
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,140
- The fuck up.

290
00:08:59,140 --> 00:08:59,980
(laughing)

291
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,800
- I didn't like that at all.

292
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,640
- I didn't either.

293
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,140
- I didn't either.

294
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,640
I couldn't even keep the bit going,

295
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,920
that was so fucking stupid.

296
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,800
- No bits today.

297
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,440
- No bit, no more fucking bits, okay?

298
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,280
- So I was--

299
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,160
- Jubio, pull up just the word history on Google,

300
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,760
and then we'll read that.

301
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,560
- So I was lying in bed and I was thinking,

302
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,920
well so recently I think I've been losing my vision a little.

303
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,760
- You were lying in bed?

304
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,800
What'd you turn to your girlfriend and say you were straight?

305
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,460
- Did you know that history is the study of change over time?

306
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,360
- These are both great, go ahead.

307
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,280
Take 'em away. - I already got mine.

308
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,160
- Take it away Pat, let's go.

309
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,080
- It covers all aspects of human society, political.

310
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,700
- And I was thinking, 'cause I think I've kind of,

311
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,440
my vision was going a little blurry to the point

312
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,080
I think maybe I might go blind soon.

313
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,760
and I was, do you think that if I lost vision in one eye,

314
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,160
like say my left eye, which is the one

315
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
that I might go completely blind in,

316
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,040
do you think that the doctor, if I asked,

317
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,280
would just sew it completely shut for me?

318
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,120
- Maybe.

319
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,040
- And do you think I'd look cool

320
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,720
if I had one eye that was sewed shut?

321
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,000
- You could look like my cat Moe, with his weird eye.

322
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,360
- Does he have a sewed shut eye?

323
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,200
- Not yet.

324
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,680
- Would you want it to be, you want stitches,

325
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,760
like going back and forth, like zigzag?

326
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,000
- Yeah, stitches across my eye.

327
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,840
- But they'll dissolve.

328
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,940
- Do you think it would impress my crush?

329
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:19,380
I think if anything to impress your crush you should look like what's his name the

330
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:24,340
Klingon guy from undiscovered country who has that built-in eye patch into his skin

331
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:29,100
so like lost on me one two three like I only like cool stuff like you don't

332
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:35,940
formers mate mate I don't know any Star Trek look at my shirt look at my shirt

334
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
- And you're made entirely out of rags?

335
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,140
- No, no, no, no, I'm skin and flesh and bones.

336
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:45,980
- Or saggy. - The stitch closed mouth.

337
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,220
- And you have a little bit--

338
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,020
- You know what, here's what I do, right?

339
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,980
I go out on my first dates and I duct tape my mouth closed.

340
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,900
Right, and I show up and I say, yeah, it ends today.

341
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,540
Censorship is ending today.

342
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,980
And I take off my--

343
00:10:58,980 --> 00:10:59,820
- Censorship.

344
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,860
(laughing)

345
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,700
- What?

346
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,520
What are you saying?

347
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:08,260
- I go, I show up for the date and she's like,

348
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,500
wait, this guy said something so dangerous

349
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,860
that they duct tape his mouth closed.

350
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,700
- Hey, you know what?

351
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,540
- Now go.

352
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,360
- How do you say,

353
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,200
how do you buy the duct tape and you say,

354
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,040
"You're beautiful."

355
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,860
- You say, "Brr, brr, brr."

356
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,700
- Yeah, I know.

357
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,540
- 'Cause your lips are still tucked together.

358
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,360
(laughing)

359
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,360
- Yeah, wait, how did you get the date if your mouth

360
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,200
is closed?

361
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,040
- That's all those comedy specials

362
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,560
where they have the duct tape on their mouth.

363
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,240
I'd like to see them try to do fucking stand up

364
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,200
with duct tape on their fucking mouth.

365
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,480
I dare you, Bill Burr, go up on stage,

366
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
Eliza Schlesinger. - Does she do that?

367
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,600
- I don't know.

368
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,440
- I know Eliza Schlesinger.

369
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,220
Yeah, but she's got him on her nipples too.

370
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,000
Go up there and try to tell your jokes

371
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,280
with duct tape on your mouth.

372
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,200
And if you can, then I'll--

373
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,440
We will actually respect you as not--

374
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,640
and it has nothing to do with your gender.

375
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,140
No.

376
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:50,880
It has everything to do with--

377
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,000
I'll go on a date with you, Elijah, if you can do that.

378
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,760
I'll go on one date with you.

379
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah, he'll go on a date with Elijah.

380
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,920
I'll go on one single date with you, Elijah.

381
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,420
Elijah.

382
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,480
Yeah, the book of Elijah.

383
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,080
Elijah.

384
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,320
I know what you're hiding.

385
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,400
Yeah, it's probably a movie called The Box of Elijah.

386
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
- I would shorten her name down a little.

387
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,240
- What?

388
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
- Like E-S.

389
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,520
- I think her name starts with an I.

390
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:10,680
- E-S Schleslingler?

391
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,280
- Well it's just, yeah, see it's,

392
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,880
you triple, you can't say it without--

393
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,720
- Tripler?

394
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,540
- Having an issue.

395
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,240
- Should we get into, should we all do a--

396
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,160
- Trish.

397
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,000
- Should we all do a--

398
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,820
- Trisha.

399
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,660
- Trisha.

400
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,500
- Trish, that'd be a good name.

401
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,320
- Here's how we change your whole thing.

402
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
- Who would have the best--

403
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,400
- Your name is now Trish.

404
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,960
- Your name is Trisha, we're gonna change your hair to blue.

405
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,800
- Uh-huh.

406
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,620
- And you're--

407
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,460
- Don't even say blue hair.

408
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:40,220
comic. Who of us would have the best T.S. Eliot style two letter? Not me. Not me. P.E.

409
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:47,340
Dora. I've already talked about it in my fucking bank account. Bank of America changed it.

410
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,340
Yeah. P.E.D.O.? No. But remember how I used to open the Bank of America app and it would

411
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:58,820
just say P.E.D.O. star star star? Because of my name? Well that's cool though, it makes

412
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,700
- It's like Beto Killer or something.

413
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,540
- Yeah. - Well, no, no, no.

414
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,820
- Like the Club Penguin's internship.

415
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:07,420
- The exact amount of letters is the same amount

416
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,100
as Peter Wiles. (laughing)

417
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,300
Every time that I would open it up.

418
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,260
- Dude, your parents are so stupid.

419
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,620
- I, dude, it's so fucking stupid.

420
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,700
It's so, my name is Patrick, my mom's name is Patricia.

421
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,620
- C.E. Fetter's kinda good, I could see that

422
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,140
on a shampoo bottle. - C.E. Fetter.

423
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,260
- A shampoo bottle? - Yeah.

424
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,300
- C.M. Pitts. - Whoa.

425
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,020
- That's like an ergonomic brand, I think.

426
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,860
- C.E. Pitts.

427
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,780
- Some kind of lifestyle chair brand or something.

428
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,380
- Middle name is Michael, guys.

429
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,700
Guess what, yeah, I tried to go as Michael

430
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,540
for a little bit when I was a kid.

431
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,300
- I tried to go as Edward for a little bit

432
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,900
because people kept calling me Patricia.

433
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,900
'Cause they would say I was a gay girl.

434
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,220
- That's, yeah, well, you would've been Edwardina

435
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,900
if you were Edward, that just happens no matter what.

436
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,060
My last name was Pitts going around in middle school.

437
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,260
- But it's a layup.

438
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,300
- And I smelled bad.

439
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,900
- And it's a layup, though.

440
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:01,060
Patricia and then I and then I it's a push up with a backed into a corner like a wimp and I say

441
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:06,460
Wack you off even more. Yeah, I'll whack you worse and I'll board you

442
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,580
Whack me. I'll whack you up corner. I will literally whack you all are you and what?

443
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:17,020
I'll whack you will not whack me off. I mean, I'm gonna get up. I'll whack you right now. Don't whack me

444
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:22,420
I'll whack you off right now. I'm gonna pinch the bottom of your butt. Don't don't pinch my butt till it closes

445
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:25,740
So it closes if he has ever experienced something I

446
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,980
Don't you dare I talked to don't you dare pinch my butt until it

447
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:35,580
Talked to two people this week who told me that sometimes they get something that they call butt chills

448
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:41,320
Have you ever had experiences where something is something disgusting will happen in a movie or something and you'll go

449
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,540
Oh god, and your asshole will close up. Oh wait

450
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,980
It's like chills on the back your nap, but but in your asshole and around your butt

451
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,340
I've never had that I there is sometimes anytime that I get anytime that in a movie somebody

452
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,900
hurts their vagina though, I feel a phantom pain as if I had a vagina.

453
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,460
There is something like very specific...

454
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,060
You guys ever get that?

455
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:04,960
Where I'm like, "Ugh! If I had a vagina, I would feel something right now."

456
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,360
I guess in your brain, you're just thinking, "Everyone's got nuts."

457
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,360
I always, you know...

458
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,760
It is a little bit like... But I feel it exactly between my asshole and my balls,

459
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,260
like in my taint, and I go like, "Oh, if I had a vagina there..."

460
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,860
You think you're gonna grow a vagina?

461
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,260
I've always thought that.

462
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,020
When I was a kid I thought that I used to have one

463
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:22,940
and they sewed it shut.

464
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,140
Yeah, we talked about that.

465
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,980
I know.

466
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,100
We've talked about that ad nauseum.

467
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,940
Yeah.

468
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,740
Yeah, nauseum, for real.

469
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,340
Yeah, nauseum, me thinking about you with a vagina

470
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,180
makes me throw up.

471
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,300
You know when people do the thing--

472
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,140
You're fucked up.

473
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:34,980
I'm not fucked up.

474
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,800
You are.

475
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,620
Where someone is underwater in a movie,

476
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,500
you hold your breath and you count

477
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,020
to see if you would survive.

478
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,020
Yeah.

479
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,860
No.

480
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,220
I do that too, but I can only hold my breath

481
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,460
for like three seconds.

482
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,060
I get really upset every time I have to turn the movie off.

483
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,140
You gotta endurance train you.

484
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:48,980
That is sad.

485
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,380
I think we have the dunk tank episode.

486
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,380
Instantly holding your breath.

487
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:58,980
I can't do it.

488
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,300
Not me because I won several breath holding competitions.

489
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:04,220
No I can hold my breath for probably ten hundred minutes.

490
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
That's just not fucking true.

491
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,220
You're not David Blaine.

492
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,220
Fuck you asshole.

493
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,700
I was going to hold my breath but then I remembered something.

494
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Then I remembered something.

495
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,940
My little brother when he would get mad that he couldn't get an action figure at the store

496
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,740
or something, he would yell at my mom and say,

497
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,460
"I'm gonna hold my breath until you bite me."

498
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,300
- That's a classic kid move.

499
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,540
- That is a classic, yeah.

500
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,900
- I bet holding your breath, like, (gasps)

501
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:26,740
yeah.

502
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,260
- That's like a-- - Oh, what,

503
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,860
and train your lungs to be one day an Olympic swimmer

504
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,940
and buy me a million dollar house?

505
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,780
You have boo fucking hoo.

506
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,220
- I feel like that's something that you,

507
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,900
sometimes you're a kid and you watch a movie about kids

508
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,140
and you learn something about being a kid from the movie

509
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,580
and you're like, "Oh, I'm supposed to do that."

510
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,420
- Yeah, I did. - That's one of those things.

511
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,460
- I did spend a lot of-- - You learn from Home Alone

512
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,380
- There was definitely years of my life--

513
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,260
- You see The Good Son as a kid and you're like,

514
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,820
okay, this is--

515
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,820
(laughing)

516
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:53,380
- There were years of my life where I just pretended

517
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,420
to be whatever kid belonged to Adam Sandler

518
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,860
in a given movie, who was like a funny brat.

519
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,140
And I just did that for a little bit.

520
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,640
- Yeah, or you watched Scooby-Doo,

521
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,180
you watched Malcolm in the Middle as a kid,

522
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,300
you're like-- - You just ate a big sandwich

523
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,140
with all the stuff on it.

524
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,860
- Yeah, Malcolm in the Middle, I thought, I was like,

525
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,300
I just thought-- - You thought you were Reese.

526
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,180
- I thought I was Reese, definitely thought I was,

527
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,460
I actually thought I was Malcolm 'cause I was

528
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,760
middle child and my brother was a complete Reese. I literally wanted to be

529
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:24,800
an inventor. Tell me more what did you invent? Flashlight. Flashlight with tape on

530
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:34,460
it? Yeah. So the button stays on forever. I wanted to be an inventor so bad. I knew that I did not have inventor in me but I

531
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,920
I knew that I maybe had Inventor's Assistant.

532
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,860
- Yeah, you would be a good Inventor's Assistant.

533
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,640
- Just a really low level dream for a kid.

534
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,480
- Yeah.

535
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,300
- Yeah, well.

536
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,400
- A position that doesn't exist either.

537
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,800
- I loved, I wanted to make a Rube Goldberg machine.

538
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,000
- The Inventor's Apprentice.

539
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:52,840
- You could do that though.

540
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,080
- When you're like a kid and you're like first,

541
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,840
you first get like a thing of dominoes

542
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,600
and you're like, oh my God.

543
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,320
- But then you realize it only goes like,

544
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,640
it's only like 15 dominoes.

545
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,480
Like you would need to spend--

546
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,800
- I did a pack of dominoes that are for like,

547
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:09,880
old guys to play at like, on a table.

548
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,320
- Yeah, I did, and also it takes so long to set them.

549
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,200
- I would try to come up with a Rube Goldberg machine,

550
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,800
I'd always hit the impasse where I'd be like,

551
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,960
okay, so here, the dominoes fall, all right,

552
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,880
they hit this book, the book falls over,

553
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
it hits a marble, the marble goes up this ramp,

554
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,240
and then it shoots across the room

555
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,040
and it goes out the window.

556
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,720
Well how am I gonna do that last part, I don't know.

557
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,400
- Also, what is it, what is it,

558
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,120
like, I don't have any use for it, what am I,

559
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:31,960
what is the end? - Exactly, I don't know.

560
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,960
- What's the last stage? - I'm a kid, there's nothing I need to do.

561
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,960
- Yeah, it knocks over the last domino.

562
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Hey, I built a Rube Goldberg machine that knocks over a domino.

563
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,960
That's like what I would think of.

564
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,960
- Yeah. - Like, I'm not gonna make it.

565
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:42,960
- Yeah, you always get to the one where it's like,

566
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,960
"Okay, and then this needs to fly up and hit the ceiling."

567
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
- Yeah. - "This needs to spin around like a helicopter."

568
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
- At least Pee-wee had the right idea. - I guess I quit.

569
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
- Hmm. Let me think about this.

570
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,960
I think that what I'll do is I'll quit doing this now.

571
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
- I think instead I'll just draw it.

572
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,960
- I'll draw it and I'll imagine it for a while.

573
00:18:58,960 --> 00:18:59,800
(laughing)

574
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,360
And then I'll think about how it might go

575
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,280
as a scene in a movie for a little bit.

576
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,120
- I wish I could watch a movie and be like,

577
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,800
I didn't like that movie, I'm just gonna imagine

578
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,360
it's a different one instead.

579
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,520
- Did you ever do the thing growing up

580
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,800
where you would be watching a movie

581
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,680
that you'd seen before and you would just be like,

582
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,560
I'm pretty sure that it will be different this time

583
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,040
and the bad stuff is not gonna happen.

584
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,040
No, I still do that.

585
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,000
Sometimes I'll-- - You know what?

586
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,800
- I rewatched Barbarian and I was like,

587
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,320
I think this time she's just gonna call the police.

588
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,160
- Yeah.

589
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,440
- She did call the police though,

590
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:27,840
and they ignored her. - But in the beginning.

591
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,720
I was like, I think while she's still pretty,

592
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,780
she'll call the police, 'cause that's a good idea,

593
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,800
but she didn't do it.

594
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,640
- Yeah.

595
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,560
- So I'm hoping that happens next time I watch it.

596
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,320
- That was one of the only movies I saw last year.

597
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,880
- Speaking of seeing movies.

598
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,720
- Oh man.

599
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,540
- Oh my God.

600
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:44,160
- Do we have a treat for the listeners of this pod, Cameron?

601
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,500
- Can you just read your full review?

602
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,340
- My full review?

603
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,640
Well, I'll just do a, I didn't really.

604
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,920
- I wish we had like a screen that could pop up

605
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,920
that had just like a photo of you in a box of popcorn.

606
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,960
- I wish we had a screen that could pop up.

607
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,600
(screams)

608
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,040
- I guess we have one.

609
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,040
I saw John Wick 4, ladies and gentlemen.

610
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,800
And I actually didn't even want to do a review,

611
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,440
I just wanted to share a funny thing that happened,

612
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,640
but I'll do a review.

613
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,720
- Give us the review.

614
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:18,040
- Fans of the violence inherent to the three prior movies.

615
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,560
- What?

616
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,800
- Will be flocking in droves to see the new John Wick 4

617
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,080
and they will not be disappointed.

618
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,080

00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,200
- Yeah.

626
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,340
- Just, okay.

627
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:59,640
- I want you to, this is gonna be an IG reel, so.

628
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,480
- Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

629
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,080
- All right, so you're gonna be in a movie theater.

630
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,700
- Two hours and 49 minutes of pulse-pounding action

631
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,800
is the name of the game,

632
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,160
and the name of the movie is John Wick 4.

633
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,960
Directed by Keanu Reeves' director,

634
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,440
and starring Keanu Reeves,

635
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,880
this movie did not disappoint when it came to

636
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,840
fighting with different characters,

637
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:24,200
many different actors playing the characters,

638
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,820
- And all sorts of music, pulse pounding action

639
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:29,720
and pulse pounding music as well.

640
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,560
Dubstep and that's one song.

641
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,500
What's the one?

642
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,200
- Don't focus on the score, focus on the action.

643
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,560
- Okay, and there were, there's a scene

644
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,520
where cars in the circle, there's a scene

645
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,120
where the firings.

646
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,940
- We don't want spoilers.

647
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:45,780
- Okay, no spoilers.

648
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:46,600
- No spoilers for you.

649
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,400
- The ending will shock you.

650
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,240
- Cameron, just give us a one minute,

651
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,120
one minute, one minute.

652
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,120
spoiler-free review from Cameron's Corner.

653
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,600
- The popcorn will fly across the seats at this flick.

654
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,440
How's that?

655
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,280
That's like a brief--

656
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,280
- It's a minute.

657
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,120
- The soda--

658
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,200
(clapping)

659
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,040
- The soda will fizz.

660
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,680
- The soda will flow.

661
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,920
(laughing)

662
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,480
The popcorn will fly and the soda will flow

663
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:18,160
this week at John Wick 4.

664
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,240
The action fans are sure to have something.

665
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,740
- And there's no spoilers here.

666
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,260
- Make sure to see it in IMAX for the biggest screen possible.

667
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,700
- And if you're interested in spoilers,

668
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,020
might I recommend going to see Fast and Furious instead,

669
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,700
if you're that kind of an action fan.

670
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:36,300
- Or my new movie, Spoilers, about rotten apples.

671
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,840
- And rotten kitties.

672
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,060
(laughing)

673
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,420
- Anthropomorphic rotten apples,

674
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:44,820
it's a sequel to Shrinkers.

675
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,660
(laughing)

676
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,580
It's about a bunch of guys who shrink down

677
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,500
and have to fight rotten apples called spoilers.

678
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,040
- And the tagline.

679
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,840
- And you have to stop them from getting into the bags

680
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,180
with the other animals, 'cause they make themselves a spoil.

681
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:02,140
- The tagline is, "This is one bad bunch."

682
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,780
- So you were saying that John Wick 4

683
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,980
has a lot for the action fans.

684
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,980
- But what happened in this theater, Cameron?

685
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,580
- No, but listen to me.

686
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,980
You're a bit of an interrupter today.

687
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,860
That would be the movie about Patrick.

688
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,460
- It'd be a good movie, though.

689
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,980
- That would be a pretty good movie, the interrupter.

690
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:21,060
If you're more of a fan--

691
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,180
- Interrupting the news.

692
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:25,660
- If you're more of a fan of the talking parts of John Wick,

693
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:26,700
is there something for you there?

694
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,140
- Oh yes, there's something for everyone.

695
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,620
The action fans, the fans of talking,

696
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,220
the fans of two, one female character,

697
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,740
or many, many male characters,

698
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,380
many of whom do not have names.

699
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,580
- The fans of Keanu's long hair.

700
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,740
- Fans of Keanu's line reads.

701
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,500
- And his hair line.

702
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,620
- And his hair line.

703
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,460
- Longer.

704
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,460
- His red hair.

705
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,820
- Will be disappointed.

706
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,620
- Oh, 'cause his hair is still black.

707
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,860
(laughing)

708
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:54,220
- Keanu Reeves--

709
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:58,020
- But fans of his red gunfire will be slavering

710
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,820
and cyberpunk and slobbering.

711
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:01,860
- Slavering?

712
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,260
What are you talking about slavering?

713
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,300
What, that's not a word?

714
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,140
- That's a word.

715
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,540
- Cyberpunk 2077, Keanu Reeves red hair mod.

716
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,100
- I'm a film critic, I have to know all the words.

717
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,380
- Will you look up slavering to see if that's a word?

718
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:14,380
- Slavering is a word for film critics.

719
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,180
- See?

720
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:21,740
- To let saliva run from the mouth.

721
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,860
- Slavoring.

722
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,240
- It's similar to dribble.

723
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,360
- Oh, okay.

724
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,100
- Dribble.

725
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,180
- Fans will be dribbling.

726
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,980
(laughing)

727
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:35,020
And fans of action stars from throughout the ages

728
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,620
will be dribbling out of their lips.

729
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:39,120
- People also ask, what is the meaning of dribble?

730
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,500
- No, that says dribbable.

731
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,900
That has too many Bs.

732
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,900
- Yeah, there is no meaning.

733
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,500
- Oh, it's also trickle.

734
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
trickle. Fans will be trickling in their seats.

735
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
-Triple.

736
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:55,500
-John Wick 4. Does he go to different countries? Oh wait, sorry.

737
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
-Yes, he does.

738
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
-Just tell your fucking story.

739
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:02,020
-I mean, it's a good movie. You should see it. I really liked it. But I was sitting in

740
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:07,900
the IMAX theater next to an old black guy and the entire movie.

741
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,660
-Stop right there. That's a pretty good story.

742
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:14,380
-The entire movie, every single time that somebody got shot or stabbed, which is like

743
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,740
literally probably at least like 300 times.

744
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,580
- Yeah.

745
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,940
- Like the most shootings and stabbings

746
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
I've ever seen in a movie.

747
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,780
- Yeah.

748
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,540
- Every single time he like visibly jumped,

749
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:29,540
like he was like, literally every time someone got killed,

750
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,860
he was like.

751
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,700
- That's a guy who's--

752
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,940
- It was so crazy.

753
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,900
- That guy's definitely a veteran of some kind.

754
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
- Yeah, something was going on with him.

755
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,740
- There's some kind of issue.

756
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,560
- And I was kind of worried about him,

757
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,020
'cause I was like, this does not seem like he's having fun.

758
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,860
But at the end, like when there was one really crazy thing

759
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,500
it happened he was like oh oh okay he's good.

760
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:56,180
When you get that oh in front of the ho ho ho's that's how you know oh that's a good time.

761
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:00,140
All right I'm gonna have to see that. Yeah yeah but it is three freaking hours long.

762
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:05,820
Three hours? I think it should be four hours one for every movie it is. I hate the movies so

763
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:09,700
much now because they're all three hours long. I remember when movies used to be

764
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:16,180
21 minutes at advertisements and they'd be 30 minute blocks and there's a bunch of different channels back in the movies used to have

765
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,100
commercials in them

766
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,420
And they used to be modified for the smaller screen movies used to come in these little

767
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:24,780
Cartridge things and you put them in your movie player

768
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:29,160
And then you play them around with a with a play around with myself when I watched them

769
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,420
And if you put a man's got a watch lose your seat lose leisure

770
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,900
Let me try that again.

771
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,220
This guy watched it leisurely seat Larry.

772
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,300
- Flop. - Or seat.

773
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,300
- That is a flop.

774
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,280
- Leisure suit.

775
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,220
- Speaking flop.

776
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,660
- Speak flop.

777
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,940
- Okay. - Speak flop.

778
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,060
- No, I didn't speak in a flopping way.

779
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,940
He just farted.

780
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,780
- No, it was a burp.

781
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,420
- No, you acted like you were burping

782
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,260
but it came out of your ass.

783
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,340
You moved your mic away from your mouth to fart.

784
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,180
You went.

785
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,000
- I didn't even fart.

786
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,840
- Yeah, you did.

787
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,680
- I would have admitted it.

788
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,500
- I felt it.

789
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,580
- No, no, no, no, no, 'cause it would,

790
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:01,620
my farts have been just rancid lately.

791
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,020
Ask Noah.

792
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,920
- Ask Noah about my farts.

793
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,760
Call him right now.

794
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,800
- I'll ask him. - Call him at work.

795
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,640
- I'll ask him.

796
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,460
- We'll call him at work.

797
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,300
He's gonna tell you that my house has been stinkerton city.

798
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,140
I know that he's gonna use that word.

799
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:14,800
- That's exactly what he's gonna say.

800
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,860
(laughing)

801
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,340
- That's exactly what Noah will say.

802
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,660
- Yeah, he did it stinkerton.

803
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,500
(laughing)

804
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,680
- He did it stinkerton in the living room.

805
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,460
- I'm calling him on speaker.

806
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,100
So you're saying he's gonna say,

807
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
- He's gonna say stinkerton city.

808
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,960
- The house has been stinkerton city.

809
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,360
- Yo, what's up?

810
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,000
- Hey, I was wondering if Patrick has had

811
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,900
really, really stinky farts recently.

812
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,440
- I haven't noticed.

813
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,000
He hasn't been around me recently though.

814
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,840
He's been dodging me.

815
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,680
- Whoa.

816
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,500
(laughing)

817
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,480
Whoa, that's an accusation.

818
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:48,480
- I hung out with him, we watched home movies last night

819
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,400
on the Plex.

820
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,240
- All right, well.

821
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,680
- Yeah, first time you spent time with me in months, dude.

822
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,040
- All right, you're sounding--

823
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,920
- You are--

824
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,840
- You're sounding really, really whack right now.

825
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,680
I just wanna say that.

826
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,520
You're sounding pretty whack.

827
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,440
- I guess you (beep) made you soup.

828
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,320
I said her name, I can't say her name.

829
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,120
- Yep, and now we have to bleep that out.

830
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,600
We're on the show right now.

831
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,320
But basically, we thought that we were gonna--

832
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,480
- Patrick's farts are smelly, but they're second to yours.

833
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,320
- Can you, thank you.

834
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,140
- Ooh.

835
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,640
- Thank you very much, thank you very much for that.

836
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,400
Could you, we thought that we were gonna call you,

837
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,960
you were gonna call his farts Stinkerton City.

838
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,720
That's what we anticipated.

839
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,480
- No, they're not that bad, that's definitely you.

840
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,680
You're Stinkerton City.

841
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,520
- Okay.

842
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,340
- Well, he's still sitting.

843
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,900
Guys, this backfired on me in a massive way.

844
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,100
I hope you have a nice day.

845
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,260
(silence)

846
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:34,540
(laughter)

847
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,980
Well that couldn't have gone worse.

848
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,340
(laughter)

849
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,140
That couldn't have gone fucking worse.

850
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,300
(laughter)

851
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,780
- I thought straight up he would have said

852
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,060
Stinkerton City at least three times.

853
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:45,900
- Yeah.

854
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,740
- Yeah.

855
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,820
- I could have seen it happening.

856
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,220
- I thought he was gonna say Stinkerton City population

857
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:52,860
whatever, do all of his different lines in a row.

858
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,700
- Yep.

859
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,860
- And we were gonna go Noah, you bastard.

860
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:57,680
- He's acting like I didn't hang out with him.

861
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,000
He and I watched that video.

862
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,520
- By the way, I think if he had known

863
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,680
that he was on the show, he wouldn't have been so kind of,

864
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,320
that guy was pretty female,

865
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,840
the way that he was complaining like that.

866
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,680
- Yep.

867
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,520
- Right?

868
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,640
- He's saying that I dodged him.

869
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,160
I watched that video with him last night.

870
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:16,160
You know the Tweek Tweek, the meth head pedophile?

871
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,640
And he backs his car up into the pole and stuff

872
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,480
and gets tackled. - No, I don't know that.

873
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,320
- Have you seen that video?

874
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,140
- I don't think so.

875
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,980
- Oh my God.

876
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,800
- Yeah, I don't seek stuff like that out usually.

877
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,800
I don't search meth head in a file.

878
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,800
I usually, yeah, I look for like kind of like...

879
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
The video where the guy, he's in a Vons and then he's like...

880
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Yeah, you shouldn't Google yourself, Patrick.

881
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:38,800
He's in a Vons grocery store and he's like on meth and the guy's like, "Why are you trying to hook up with my 13 year old brother?"

882
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,800
And he's like, "I'm buying fiber so I can poop!"

883
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,800
And the guy chases him.

884
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
These videos never make any sense if you explain them.

885
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,800
Yeah, they don't.

886
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,800
So why even try?

887
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Yeah, but this one's the best one.

888
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Noah and I watched the full 13 minutes.

889
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,600
When you see this, you're gonna understand.

890
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,400
- Why have you had such diabolically

891
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
stinkerton city toots, man?

892
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,080
- I think it's 'cause I made that cabbage thing.

893
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,120
- Two weeks ago?

894
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,360
- Yeah.

895
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,880
And then I've been eating a lot of gut stuff,

896
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,400
like fermented, like I made myself.

897
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,040
- That's good for you, that will make you not fart.

898
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,680
- I think the farting is good.

899
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:15,520
- It gets you at first though.

900
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,840
- I think it's clearing my gut biome.

901
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,680
- Oh yeah, I've been on it.

902
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,280
- I'm eating a lot of fermented foods and stuff.

903
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:24,280
- I'm starting to believe that my stomach

904
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,280
is more important than my brain.

905
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,960
And the way that most people obsess about their brain health,

906
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,360
that's how I'm obsessing about my stomach for now on.

907
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,360
- Do people obsess about their brain health?

908
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,960
- I do that too.

909
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:35,800
- Oh, is that a thing?

910
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,360
- You can't do anything for your brain.

911
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,760
- Well, like vitamins and stuff.

912
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,560
- People think that you can take ashwagandha,

913
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,160
you can take nootropics and stuff.

914
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,320
- It doesn't work on him.

915
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,280
- None of the brain stuff works.

916
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,320
- No, not for you.

917
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,160
- You can't change what you're immune to.

918
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,480
- It doesn't work on me either, 'cause I outsmart it.

919
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,640
- I take the ashwagandha and my brain kind of like

920
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,480
plays around, it's like, oh I see what you're trying to do.

921
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,320
- Dude, ashwagandha is not a nootropic.

922
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,140
- No, no, no, no.

923
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,560
- No, I take like lithium and then I'm like.

924
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:00,260
- Yeah, my brain is like, I see that coming in.

925
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,760
- Lithium, what's that, a battery?

926
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,060
Come on now, matrix.

927
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,480
Trying to charge my brain up?

928
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,720
Get out of here.

929
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
- You know who needs some lithium?

930
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,360
Elmer Fudd.

931
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,200
- Yep.

932
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,040
- Wiffium.

933
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,480
- He does, he's bipolar as fuck.

934
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,720
- Wiffium.

935
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,600
- I didn't take my wiffium today.

936
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,440
(laughing)

937
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,840
I didn't want to kill you, bunny.

938
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,080
(laughing)

939
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,320
I don't want to kill the bunny.

940
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,040
It's duck season.

941
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,200
It's wabbit season.

942
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,240
It's duck season.

943
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,040
It's wabbit season.

944
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,680
Oh, no.

945
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,040
But yeah, Elmer Fudd should be helped.

946
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,520
He should be at least put into a mayor's prison.

947
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,880
Or a foster care, yeah.

948
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:33,480
The thing is--

949
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,640
People forget that about him.

950
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,240
If Elmer Fudd existed today, he'd be all over TikTok.

951
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,600
You literally couldn't make Elmer Fudd today.

952
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:43,600
You definitely could not.

953
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,760
He'd be called Elmira Fudd, and he would have pronouns.

954
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,760
- What's his name, Elmer Fudd, age 83.

955
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,000
- Wait, what?

956
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,860
- We're not doing guns,

957
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:54,580
Elmer Fudd loses his white to bare arms.

958
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,620
- Oh my God.

959
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,040
- That's kind of rude to say.

960
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,720
- Is there an Elmira Fudd on Baby Looney Tunes?

961
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,380
I feel like I know that, but I just need to--

962
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,700
- Elmira Fudd?

963
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,960
- Yeah.

964
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,520
- Is Elmira Fudd a millionaire?

965
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,320
- Elmira Duff.

966
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,300
Elmira Duff.

967
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,160
- Oh, okay, that's stupid.

968
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,000
I hate that.

969
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,540
- And it wasn't on Baby Looney Tunes,

970
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:15,000
it was on the other one.

971
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,800
- I literally would smack the fuck

972
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,800
got on most of the Looney Tunes were they real?

973
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,940
- Oh, me too, bro.

974
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,600
- If I saw Taz, I mean, you know,

975
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:25,040
I'd have some tranquilizers on me first.

976
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,460
- Let me tell you what-- - But if I saw Taz--

977
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,600
- I'm going lethal.

978
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,400
- Yeah, I see Bugs, that's an open hand, front hand slap.

979
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,240
Bah!

980
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
Right, he spins around.

981
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,520
- If I see Daffy-- - Then I turn,

982
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,320
I turn, Daffy, boom, backhand,

983
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,160
the knuckles crack his fucking beak.

984
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,920
- That's what I would do with Bugs.

985
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:42,760
- Porky, what are you doing to Porky?

986
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,600
- I'd smack the shit out of Bugs,

987
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,080
say, "That's for the transphobia, mister."

988
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,480
And then I see Pepe Le Pew over there, I'm spinning my arm like I'm winding up for a baseball pitch.

989
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,080
That's for the sexual misconduct, Pepe.

990
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,580
I walk over, I walk over, boonk! Right on the head.

991
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,080
Yep.

992
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,080
His head goes down into his chest like a Mortal Kombat fatality.

993
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,580
Gossamer, I'm picking up Gossamer by the legs, I'm using him as a bat.

994
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,580
Who's Gossamer?

995
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,580
That's the big orange guy.

996
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Oh, I hate him!

997
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
I'm swinging Gossamer right at Granny.

998
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:11,080
Thanks for making me think that you were a mascot for a sports game team.

999
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:13,580
You know how they do a speed bag and they go boo boo boo boo?

1000
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:14,080
Yeah.

1001
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
Like that, I'm going up to Tweety Bird

1002
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,600
and I'm doing that with two fingers.

1003
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,440
Uh-huh.

1004
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,280
Mm-hmm.

1005
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,100
(imitates gun firing)

1006
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,420
That's for having a speech impediment.

1007
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,480
And for being a boy.

1008
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,320
And then there's a lot of--

1009
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,840
That's for being a boy when I thought that you were a girl.

1010
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:25,960
(laughing)

1011
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,440
Asshole.

1012
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,440
I'm lining up all the ones with speech impediments.

1013
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,280
Come on, Elmer.

1014
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:32,000
And then I'm slapping them all in the mouth.

1015
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,160
I'm taking Elmer home and I'm starting to tell people

1016
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,640
that he's my brother at the grocery store.

1017
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,480
Yeah.

1018
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,400
(laughing)

1019
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,920
And I know I would say, listen, I'm walking around,

1020
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,760
I'm slapping Daffy, I'm poking Tweety,

1021
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,760
I'm doing ever slap and Daffy sounds like

1022
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:52,800
That sounds like like a song from the 50s. Yeah, like having sex in a car. Yeah, I'm walking

1023
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm what I you know I've been I've been doing hand-to-hand combat against these tunes, but I see Porky Pig. It's on-site

1024
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,480
I'm literally I literally I'm gonna walk home. I'm

1025
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,120
Put a tracker on him first of all so I know where he is before I walk

1026
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,000
walk tag on

1027
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,800
Going on my closet open up my gun safe. You think there's a gun in there. No. It's a spiked flail. Holy shit

1028
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,800
I ride my horse back to where he is

1029
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,900
Marvin the Martin is going I mean soda can that one I think is an even matchup between me and him he would laser me

1030
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,900
to death

1031
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:33,280
Why is he never included in any of these like Homelander versus Superman things yeah add Marvin

1032
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,840
He could he could he could go up or add that motherfucking Roadrunner

1033
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,920
- True. - He's invincible.

1034
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,160
- Superman versus Road Runner.

1035
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,000
- That's true.

1036
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,400
- I think that's been done though.

1037
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,240
- If I could go into-- - Really?

1038
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,640
- I think it's been done to death.

1039
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,160
(laughing)

1040
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,200
- You might be right.

1041
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,200
- If I could go into the Toon world--

1042
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:54,520
- Yeah, I don't know man, I think it's been done to death.

1043
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,120
- I'd go up to Wile E. Coyote and be like,

1044
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,040
"Yo man, stop fucking around."

1045
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,760
I would just say that and literally just from that,

1046
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,320
he'd grab the Road Runner and just shred him up.

1047
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:07,920
- I'd show Wile E. Coyote Dance with the Devil

1048
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,360
by Immortal Technique, change his fucking,

1049
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:15,360
like fuck him up in a way that is like so visceral

1050
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,920
in his brain through that song that he's like,

1051
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,720
I'm like, I can't control my emotions,

1052
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,560
I'm buying a piece today.

1053
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,120
I'm fucking shooting that road.

1054
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,960
- He needs to get after it.

1055
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,320
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1056
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,440
- Be about it.

1057
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,760
I'd sit down, I'd kneel down, 'cause he's really small,

1058
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,400
he's a coyote, I'd put my hand on his shoulder.

1059
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,360
I'd say, hey buddy.

1060
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,620
- After he's done the deed?

1061
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:41,300
I don't know. Before, this is how I would say it. Honestly, I've been watching your show

1062
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:50,300
for years. I like you. I think you're a good guy, but you're not about it.

1063
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,500
I don't care.

1064
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
And I think I...

1065
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
Because he looks up to you.

1066
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,500
Exactly. He knows me.

1067
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,500
He looks up to you.

1068
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:01,180
Well, before that, I'd formed a relationship with him over a few years. So he did look

1069
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,180
up to me at that point.

1070
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:07,300
So you'd drive up with your limo, and then he'd come up and say, "Gee, Cameron, you're

1071
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,780
one of my favorites.

1072
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,620
- And I'd say, you're one of my favorites too,

1073
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,700
except one thing I really don't like about you is

1074
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,700
you don't want it like that.

1075
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,540
You're not hungry.

1076
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,220
- And you also don't got it like that, really.

1077
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,060
- You don't got it like that.

1078
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,240
- You literally, it's almost like the point of the show

1079
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,540
has become your failure.

1080
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,260
- Yeah, and then he'd see me walk away

1081
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,380
and I'd walk up to the Roadrunner and be like,

1082
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,540
"Yo, what's up?"

1083
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:27,580
And we'd start partying.

1084
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,420
- Roadrunner.

1085
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,860
- You're being the Roadrunner, we'll be partying.

1086
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,140
♪ He's got cold, I'm wondering why ♪

1087
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,420
- That show should have been two episodes, okay?

1088
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,540
It should have been, the first episode should have been

1089
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:40,740
Killing the Roadrunner on the second episode should have been what he does with the body disposal

1090
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,900
Yeah, and then maybe a third episode. It's an investigation basically Fargo is what that's a good idea

1091
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,500
Yeah, they're doing it with fucking honey the poo

1092
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:56,740
Shut up, can I just speak my shit

1093
00:36:56,740 --> 00:37:00,540
Talk like shit

1094
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:05,820
Can I just talk like shit please and just say hubbada, but with it and you guys not stop me for once in my life

1095
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:08,620
Okay, because it hubbada, bubby

1096
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:11,700
Okay, I looked at you

1097
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,660
That's right there and he's one beer deep so I know he gonna do the whole squad

1098
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:28,080
Would you do the gang if you had one beer you can't stop but then having to apologize your girl for the next day

1099
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:35,100
I'm sorry, baby. I had a I think I said this before I drink half of a raspberry white claw and I did the whole gang

1100
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,060
I did let the whole squad hit I said this a while ago

1101
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,260
I think but I want I don't it wasn't I think I just said it to you guys at lunch

1102
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:43,260
I always want to maybe get it on recording

1103
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,620
But if I was a girl I would

1104
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,000
Yeah, I would be giving it up to Patrick

1105
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,040
Yeah, for certain and I know it sounds like it sounds like it said but listen I go for a BP

1106
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,300
I'm just not finished here. Okay. It sounds like that means he's like

1107
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,940
I think he's really hot or special or whatever.

1108
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,660
But if I was a girl, I'd just be fucking literally everybody.

1109
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,500
- Yeah.

1110
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,980
- I'd give it to anybody who asked.

1111
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,820
- Yeah, dude, of course.

1112
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,480
- They would literally,

1113
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,460
they would call me in and out burger.

1114
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,860
'Cause people would be in and out there

1115
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,420
and my shit would look like a burger.

1116
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,660
(laughing)

1117
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,860
- A burger, I'd do a burger.

1118
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:18,700
I would.

1119
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,140
All right, do we wanna get into the list?

1120
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,460
- Yeah, let's go to the list for today.

1121
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,980
- Intro to it.

1122
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,500
Actually, I'd also just remembered there was something we can we'll save it to the very end

1123
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:36,140
There was a picture to show this is a title slide. This is a good title slide. So this is just a

1124
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:39,460
Blog that I found this is

1125
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:47,060
Here I'll show you the tables moved weird today, cuz I just like pulled a hamstring. I'm so sorry you pulled a hamstring

1126
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:49,120
Yeah, you floss with hamstring. This is the

1127
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:52,020
This is the blog of Tyler

1128
00:38:54,020 --> 00:39:01,740
That was really good. Tyler the awesome. Tyler the awesome. And this blog has probably enough content to literally do maybe a

1129
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:09,020
hundred episodes on. Wow. From Tyler? From Tyler. Tyler like is really a high-volume creator. Maybe this is where he got Igor.

1130
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:15,620
Mate. Huh? Do you realize what you just said? What did I say? Tyler is a high-quality V8 creator. What?

1131
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:22,900
Oh, I should. Does it remind you of any rap, mister? No, wait. No, you're too indie. You're thinking animal collective.

1132
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:30,180
I'm trying to think of rap iron and wine. No motherfucker. Who are you talking? He pretended to be gay for four years

1133
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:35,940
So he could sell an album called flower boy. Yeah. Yeah, so that way and it all fell apart

1134
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,620
So when everybody got mad at a model, yeah

1135
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,280
Yeah

1136
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:44,940
I'm I think my favorite thing my my my secret pleasure my happy joy is that when?

1137
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:49,500
Whenever somebody an artist or something doesn't make something for a while

1138
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,740
they make a bunch of music and they stop because maybe they're happy or they become fulfilled

1139
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:56,100
or whatever. I think I'd hate them when I say you fell off.

1140
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
Yes.

1141
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,180
I gotta say, you didn't make an album in a few years, you fell off.

1142
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,180
Frank Ocean fell off.

1143
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:04,300
Yeah, exactly. They found what they want to do with their life. They're living a beautiful

1144
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,300
private life.

1145
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,300
Fuck you.

1146
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:07,300
You're mid, bro. You fell off.

1147
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Yeah, you fell the fuck off.

1148
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:13,020
You need to be getting interviewed by Drewski right now or you fell the fuck off.

1149
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
You fell off.

1150
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,860
Dude, imagine though that interview.

1151
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,860
Drewski.

1152
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
Drewski.

1153
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:22,500
Drewski and me? Yeah, I can imagine it. I've thought about it a lot.

1154
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:27,980
If we want to circle back to our point before this, Drewski, Wiley Coyote interview where

1155
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,540
he's talking about like, "Yeah, I saw you in Cameron's limo."

1156
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,540
Wow.

1157
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,540
You saw the celebrity photo.

1158
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,540
I have a strong feeling that Wiley Coyote and Cameron in a limo would be a Megan The

1159
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:43,260
Stallion's Tory Lanez kind of situation. Where you might shoot a hole right through his fucking

1160
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,260
leg, right?

1161
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:50,260
right? Yeah, he'd be like, so basically the cover would be like, I'm just driving him to his house,

1162
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:54,180
I'm driving him home in my limo. I'm like, "Oh, you want to get a ride?" Like, "My limo's right here."

1163
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,220
He goes to get, he's like, "Thanks for the ride, Cameron. Okay, I'm going to get out." And I'll be

1164
00:40:57,220 --> 00:41:04,820
like, "Yeah, sure." Click. Doors locked. Oh my God, that's scary. And then just boom, boom, boom,

1165
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:08,980
boom. Like he's in the passenger seat and I'm not even shooting him. I'm hitting him.

1166
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,420
- But then you would get sent,

1167
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,740
they would send you back to Kenya.

1168
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:15,020
- That would be all over TMZ.

1169
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,980
- No, 'cause my limo has a button

1170
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:20,080
where it compresses itself and disappears into a dot.

1171
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:24,620
- Yeah, TMZ wouldn't be able to find the story.

1172
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,940
Okay, so show us Tyler.

1173
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,060
- Yeah, so here's the welcome to his blog.

1174
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:33,500
Hello everybody, so yeah, this is my blog.

1175
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,200
Not too sure what to write for a first post,

1176
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,740
but well, you're in for a heck of a time.

1177
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:38,060
- Written with dictation software.

1178
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:41,940
This is a, it's really hard to explain with this blog.

1179
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,020
He makes up a bunch of video games and movies and TV shows

1180
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,540
and they're all super lore heavy and all intertwined

1181
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,940
and contain characters from all his favorite TV shows

1182
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:50,780
and stuff like that.

1183
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,600
I like it.

1184
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,440
So I don't really have a good introduction

1185
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,860
for what most of this stuff is,

1186
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,780
but we're gonna go through some of his characters

1187
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,180
and then some of his editorials that he also writes

1188
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,180
in between where he's coming up

1189
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,020
with all his world building and stuff.

1190
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,140
He also says, so here's an introduction of the blog.

1191
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,520
If you've been itching for a peek at my imagination,

1192
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,020
which I know you guys have,

1193
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,180
then you've come to the right place.

1194
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,500
We've got character profiles,

1195
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,980
weapon/equipment descriptions,

1196
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:16,460
outlines for multiple seasons of Tyler Fishfingers,

1197
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:17,460
the animated series,

1198
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,560
beat by beat breakdowns of individual episodes,

1199
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,700
lyrics from original songs,

1200
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,340
you'll have to make up your own tunes, sorry,

1201
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,880
multiple ideas for feature films,

1202
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,300
an unhealthy obsession with Vordak the incomprehensible,

1203
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,580
boss fight strategies, randomness,

1204
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,900
the occasional fan fiction, and so much more.

1205
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:34,060
Be sure to come back often as I post new content

1206
00:42:34,060 --> 00:42:36,380
So you can watch my ideas unfold and evolve in real time.

1207
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,220
- How did you find Tyler the Awesome?

1208
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,480
- Randomness.

1209
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,380
- I think I was looking up original characters.

1210
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,020
I was looking up, finding people's original characters.

1211
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,140
- My first thought was that you looked up

1212
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:48,420
the word randomness.

1213
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,260
- No.

1214
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,080
- And this showed up.

1215
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,420
- No, 'cause then I'd be finding basically random ass shit,

1216
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,320
which would not be very useful.

1217
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,740
If I typed in randomness through Google,

1218
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,380
it'd probably be like, "Geez, bicycle."

1219
00:42:58,380 --> 00:42:59,740
- "Cheese bicycle?"

1220
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,980
- Yeah, stuff like that.

1221
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,460
And that's not really all there is.

1222
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,380
- You just made a Wisconsinites dream.

1223
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:06,460
- But so this guy, he says, "Be sure to come back often

1224
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,500
"as you post new content."

1225
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,140
And I checked with the most recent thing,

1226
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,780
this website, he stopped putting his stuff up

1227
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:12,940
on his blog in like 2020.

1228
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:15,540
And I was reading the post where he said why he stopped.

1229
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:17,300
And he's like, "Yeah, I don't use this blog anymore

1230
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,300
"'cause I discovered Google Docs."

1231
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,860
- Oh, so he's just typing himself now.

1232
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:22,540
- He puts everything into Google Docs now.

1233
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:23,380
- Oh wow.

1234
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,200
- It's just so funny, he's like,

1235
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,540
"Yeah, I discovered Google Docs."

1236
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,420
(laughing)

1237
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,620
- And also just admitting that nobody ever needed

1238
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,220
to read any of it.

1239
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:33,460
So this is a healthy helping of my original character.

1240
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:35,580
So here's some of his characters that he's come up with.

1241
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:36,940
Most of the characters featured here

1242
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:38,660
were originally created for the video game

1243
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,800
Dramarama 2 in space.

1244
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,100
Recently, I decided to bring them back and reinvent them.

1245
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,860
They could be useful in an alternate version

1246
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,340
of the Tyler Fishfinger series

1247
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,440
that features only original characters.

1248
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,280
First up on the list we have--

1249
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,660
- Do we have like a photo of Tyler Fishfinger?

1250
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,460
- No, there's no photo.

1251
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,020
No, Tyler Fish, I literally,

1252
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:57,620
all I could find out about Tyler Fishfinger's,

1253
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,820
like this is such a web of complicated story stuff.

1254
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,700
He's a cyborg.

1255
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,540
Tyler Fishfingers. - And he's got

1256
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,380
fish for fingers? - Sounds amazing.

1257
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:06,660
- He's a cyborg, that's all I know about him, really.

1258
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,980
But I think he's the main character,

1259
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:10,020
but he also could just be the name of it.

1260
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,020
But anyway, and he's not even in the original characters.

1261
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:16,740
- 'Cause he's in, it's obvious.

1262
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,900
- Yeah, you should know who he is.

1263
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,900
- At least Tyler would be awesome.

1264
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,560
- Here's the first character that Tyler's created.

1265
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,500
Cooper Holdive.

1266
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:29,000
- Wow, Cooper has a different kind of style going on.

1267
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:29,840
- Yeah. - Yeah, you wanna

1268
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,840
describe his outfit?

1269
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:36,160
Yeah, so I would say that he has the kind of a Statue of Liberty style stance.

1270
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,160
Yeah.

1271
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
But then he has a...

1272
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,160
Marvin the Martian style hat.

1273
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,160
Maybe a Cory...

1274
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,960
Yeah, it looks like a colander almost on his head.

1275
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,720
And that is two big strings of spaghetti on the side.

1276
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,800
And his shoes actually look dope.

1277
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Yeah.

1278
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,480
He has a new style of shoe as well.

1279
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
That could be on like that Instagram page of skier sneakers.

1280
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,520
Oh, and he has a bowling shirt on.

1281
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,680
His shirt is a bowling ball going through two bowling pins.

1282
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,160
Oh my God, I thought that was a Bob-omb.

1283
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
No, no, no, no, no.

1284
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,000
- No, no, no, no.

1285
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,200
- And he's holding a baseball.

1286
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,040
- And he's holding a baseball.

1287
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,800
So this guy, a little bit of a sportsman some might say.

1288
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,200
- So let's, based on, that's a good game.

1289
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
We look at the drawing, see what you guys think,

1290
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,040
and then we'll see what he actually is.

1291
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,160
- Is he wearing glasses?

1292
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:12,520
- So that's my guess, that's my guess is that

1293
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,920
he has a sport ability.

1294
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,440
- You have any guess, Pat?

1295
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,440
- I think that he is also, yes, a sports guy.

1296
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,280
- Okay, so copier.

1297
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:25,120
What else is new?

1298
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:27,160
- Cooper is exceedingly confident at any sport

1299
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,160
That involves a perfectly round ball.

1300
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,800
(laughing)

1301
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,240
And has the skills to justify his confidence.

1302
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,640
Too bad he was born into a family of free divers.

1303
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,640
Yes, his mom is none other than Beth Holdive

1304
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,340
from this post, which I clicked on,

1305
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,000
and I couldn't even find information about Beth Holdive.

1306
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,120
Although Cooper is often at the bottom of the sea,

1307
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:48,200
when he'd rather be at the top of the ninth inning,

1308
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,040
- That's a pretty good line.

1309
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,040
- He secretly enjoys the sensation of being underwater.

1310
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,440
Just not a whole lot.

1311
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,460
- Okay, Cooper.

1312
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,300
I like the name, too.

1313
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:57,540
- I do like this guy.

1314
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:58,940
- Yeah, what do you guys think?

1315
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:01,380
- I like Cooper, I'm gonna give him a four.

1316
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:03,100
- Yeah, yeah, okay, what's the--

1317
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,380
- And I also wanna get-- - Four out of what?

1318
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,660
- When we get to the end of the characters,

1319
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,340
I need to hear which character you guys--

1320
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:09,180
- 'Cause it could've been four out of 10.

1321
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,000
- Tag yourself, type five.

1322
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,640
- So Cooper, I'm not Cooper,

1323
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,420
because I am more into different oblong balls.

1324
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,540
- Yeah, almonds.

1325
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,620
- Almond balls.

1326
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,860
- Almond shapes. - Pucks.

1327
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:18,820
- Pucks. - Yeah.

1328
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:19,640
- Do like pucks.

1329
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:20,480
- Is a puck a ball?

1330
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,820
- That's what I was just about to say.

1331
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,020
- It is, it is.

1332
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:24,700
- September Pleszewski.

1333
00:46:24,700 --> 00:46:25,860
- Polish. - Okay, so here's

1334
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:26,700
what I'd like to say.

1335
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:30,700
This is a trace of Franny, or Frankie--

1336
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:33,020
- Total Drama Island. - No!

1337
00:46:33,020 --> 00:46:36,380
From Foster's Home. - Yeah.

1338
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,220
- No, it's not. - For Imaginary Children.

1339
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:40,500
And she has her, but just in the way

1340
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,980
that she's holding her waist, right?

1341
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:45,260
I do like that he drew her knees.

1342
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,260
That was sweet of him. (laughing)

1343
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:48,360
To draw her knees.

1344
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:50,940
- Oh, and she's wearing shorts.

1345
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:53,700
- And honestly, she looks pretty busty.

1346
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:56,220
- And she also has some kind, she's wearing a square.

1347
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:57,740
- And an exposed belly button.

1348
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,580
- Yeah.

1349
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,100
- Okay, so as far as abilities,

1350
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,740
she has a bandaid on her right cheek,

1351
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:04,540
so I'm guessing that she is amazing

1352
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,940
at getting really badly hurt or something.

1353
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:08,780
Or she's invincible, or she's invisible.

1354
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:10,140
She's either invincible or invisible.

1355
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:14,020
- You know, when I see bandaid on the cheek,

1356
00:47:14,020 --> 00:47:19,020
my brain immediately goes to the singer Nelly.

1357
00:47:19,020 --> 00:47:21,500
- You think she's a rapper?

1358
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,580
- So I think, yes, I think she's a Saint Louis.

1359
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,420
- All right.

1360
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:25,240
- You think she's a saint?

1361
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:29,680
Okay, so she's either a invisible, invincible, or a lunatic.

1362
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,880
Those are the three guesses that we're gonna take.

1363
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,140
- Let me read this out to you.

1364
00:47:33,140 --> 00:47:34,240
- Or she's a Christian.

1365
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,320
- This tough, unruly anti-hero grew up

1366
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,240
on the streets of New Jersey, pronounced Joy-Z.

1367
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,200
While September may seem unfriendly at first,

1368
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,120
you just have to give her a little time of respect.

1369
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,200
Do that and you've got yourself a loyal companion.

1370
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,160
She's a bit of a prankster, that one,

1371
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,920
though her pranks used to be a lot meaner.

1372
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:50,680
She still punks her friends every now and then

1373
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,200
just to remind them that they're lucky she's on their side.

1374
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,680
a little behind the scenes.

1375
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,300
September was originally going to be from New York.

1376
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,320
That idea was scrapped after I realized

1377
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:03,160
the unfortunate connection between New York and September.

1378
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:04,000
- That's right.

1379
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,040
- Okay, so pretty far away from Saint Lunatic.

1380
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,880
- But when I saw Auntie here, I was like,

1381
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,220
okay, lunatic-esque.

1382
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:12,760
- Yeah, I guess, all right.

1383
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:13,680
- I'm gonna give her a three.

1384
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,520
- Yeah.

1385
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:18,200
- I really like that the unfortunate connection is a link.

1386
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,200
- Yeah.

1387
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,160
- Three and a half for the unfortunate connection.

1388
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,360
- Oh, we'll get there, okay, all right.

1389
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,560
So we'll just keep going then.

1390
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,240
Yeah.

1391
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:26,680
This guy's name is Jet Lag.

1392
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,180
OK.

1393
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:29,040
So describe this guy's style.

1394
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:32,880
OK, so Jet Lag is wearing a onesie.

1395
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:33,600
He has a--

1396
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,100
Onesie?

1397
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:36,040
This one is totally Patrick Vibes.

1398
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,400
This is Patrick Vibes.

1399
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:40,760
I was-- I'm glad you guys said it, not me.

1400
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:44,360
It's the college rule that I'm mistaking for--

1401
00:48:44,360 --> 00:48:46,520
or that I'm mixing up the lines.

1402
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,920
So he's wearing a cardigan.

1403
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:51,420
And he has a-- what looks to be either a saxophone

1404
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,380
or some kind of like clarinet thing?

1405
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,340
- Maybe that is a didgeridoo.

1406
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:57,460
- Or a didgeridoo.

1407
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,700
- And his name is Jetlag

1408
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,980
because it takes a long time to go to Australia.

1409
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:05,480
- Oh, so he also has a side swipe haircut

1410
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,740
that covers one of-- - Kind of emo style.

1411
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,760
- But, so you're thinking from the nose up,

1412
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,100
you're like, this guy's totally emo.

1413
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,720
But what should peek out right underneath that line

1414
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:14,740
but a smile?

1415
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,620
So how can he be emo if he's smiling?

1416
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,700
- Emo smile.

1417
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,220
- This drawing is so funny to me.

1418
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,580
- This is an amazing drawing.

1419
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:24,820
I'm gonna say that this guy's ability is--

1420
00:49:24,820 --> 00:49:26,420
- Is music.

1421
00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:28,420
- Shut up.

1422
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,060
His ability's not music.

1423
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:30,880
- Okay.

1424
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,060
- This guy's ability is so clear to me.

1425
00:49:33,060 --> 00:49:35,300
He's an empath.

1426
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,140
- Okay.

1427
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:40,260
- He has pure empathy ability.

1428
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,220
He can empathize with anything.

1429
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,060
- Well you can do that through music.

1430
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,300
- But the rule is, he can empathize with anything

1431
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,740
with blood, so he can't empathize with a rock

1432
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,540
or a stick or a tree.

1433
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,940
but he can empathize with a frog or a bird or a bee.

1434
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:53,780
- That's a beautiful ability.

1435
00:49:53,780 --> 00:49:54,600
- That is beautiful.

1436
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,440
- And it rhymed.

1437
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,020
- And I yield my guess because that one is so good.

1438
00:49:58,020 --> 00:49:58,860
- That is a good guess.

1439
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:00,500
- Yeah, bees have blood.

1440
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,300
- And you thought Tyler Fishfingers was a little eccentric.

1441
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,380
- I did.

1442
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:07,860
- Jet here is both an aspiring aviator and a jazz musician.

1443
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,700
- I really wish--

1444
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,180
- So I was right about the jazz, so one point for me.

1445
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,020
- What?

1446
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,100
How does one expect to balance

1447
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,580
two completely different professions at the same time?

1448
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,260
I guess Jet has his ways.

1449
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,060
People tend to comment on his neck,

1450
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:20,700
which you guys did not comment on at all.

1451
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,540
- No.

1452
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,500
- He has a big ass neck.

1453
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,740
- He does have a big, kind of Mike Tyson style neck.

1454
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:25,580
- Yeah.

1455
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:28,020
- Plus, Jett has written a mathematical formula

1456
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,420
to determine how nice someone is

1457
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,980
based on how their hair is styled.

1458
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:34,020
Tyler Fishfinger's initially registered as pure evil.

1459
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,100
- So that is scary.

1460
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,340
- Little lore tidbit.

1461
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:41,340
That's kind of like a FromSoft hidden in item description.

1462
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:42,780
- Yeah, that's kind of sweet.

1463
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,540
- That is kind of like a--

1464
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:45,580
- I'm gonna give him a four and a half.

1465
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:48,900
- Yeah, that is kind of like an empathy thing though.

1466
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:49,740
- That's true.

1467
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:51,980
- I guess he can sense somebody's emotion.

1468
00:50:51,980 --> 00:50:53,540
- So I'm so good.

1469
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,140
I've been pretty close on all of this.

1470
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,340
I would say that this guy--

1471
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:58,700
- I'm starting to think maybe Tyler the Awesome

1472
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,460
is a pen name for somebody in this room.

1473
00:51:01,460 --> 00:51:03,180
(laughing)

1474
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,020
- That would be so crazy.

1475
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:06,220
- I actually stumbled upon Caleb's old blog.

1476
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:07,620
(laughing)

1477
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,060
- Old, six months old.

1478
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:15,460
I think that this is definitely my favorite one so far.

1479
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,900
I really like the design of it.

1480
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:19,420
I think that he, like, the last two were just a little,

1481
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:21,780
like, kinda normal looking.

1482
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,960
He definitely, this is a unique shadow.

1483
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,500
This guy has a nice silhouette that you can recognize instantly.

1484
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,120
A new foe has appeared, I'm saying, oh, it's Jetlag.

1485
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:32,300
- I was gonna say, like, the last two were like,

1486
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:34,500
Amy from Sonic, you know?

1487
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:35,380
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1488
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,660
- But this one--

1489
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:38,100
- At least Amy has the hammer, though.

1490
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:39,620
- May be more of a Tails.

1491
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,780
- Mm. - Yeah.

1492
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:43,180
- Yeah, 'cause of the long tail shape of the saxophone.

1493
00:51:43,180 --> 00:51:44,260
- All right, show us the next guy.

1494
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,580
- Okay, next person is Estelle Knight.

1495
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:48,840
(whistles)

1496
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,860
- Wow. - Go ahead, Caleb.

1497
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,860
- Caleb, that is a child's eye.

1498
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:55,340
- Take it away. - Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

1499
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:56,540
Okay. - Talk about her.

1500
00:51:56,540 --> 00:52:01,040
- So she has a freckly face.

1501
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,900
- It looks like she's part animal.

1502
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:07,700
- And her legs go all the way up to her waist.

1503
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,100
And she has a mullet.

1504
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,700
That is so beautiful.

1505
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:15,260
She looks like she has glasses or eyebrows.

1506
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:16,540
I would take either one.

1507
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,580
Her hands are completely wide open.

1508
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:20,580
- And her thumbs are on the back of her wrist.

1509
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,500
- This is definitely, you're seeing now,

1510
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,380
this guy definitely takes his hand models

1511
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,540
from Total Drama Island.

1512
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:29,020
- Yeah, this guy's a big Total Drama Island fan.

1513
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,280
- That's clear, because those hands are stolen

1514
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:34,900
right from their design bible.

1515
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,060
And I would say also--

1516
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,140
- Which Caleb has read.

1517
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:37,980
- Which I have a copy of.

1518
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:41,220
- Which he reads it often.

1519
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:42,100
- I have a copy of it.

1520
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,760
- That show was so sexual.

1521
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,500
- That show, that was one show where I feel like,

1522
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:47,660
I don't even know what it was,

1523
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:49,700
but that show, I couldn't stand it.

1524
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:50,700
Like I feel like I was--

1525
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:51,540
- I hated that too.

1526
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,460
- It was like right after my time or something.

1527
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:56,900
- But yeah, people talk about wanting to fuck

1528
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:57,820
that goth girl all the time.

1529
00:52:57,820 --> 00:53:00,580
- I wanted to have sex with every single girl in the world.

1530
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:05,280
These, this girl is very, very buxom.

1531
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,660
Not as buxom as the other one.

1532
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:11,820
But she has lipstick, so she's a little more into

1533
00:53:11,820 --> 00:53:12,660
being presentable.

1534
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:13,500
- And a dog-like nose.

1535
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,320
- I would like to say--

1536
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,580
- And dog-like hair, too.

1537
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,820
- So I would say that Estelle Knight's ability

1538
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:23,820
is probably either lovemaking or style,

1539
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:26,300
because her dressing ability is really,

1540
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,380
she looks great, she looks really great.

1541
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:31,620
- And I'm gonna guess that she is maybe part dog.

1542
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:34,380
- Why are you, and I'll say there's no way

1543
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,420
that she's part animal because I'd be able to tell

1544
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,260
because she is very pretty.

1545
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,960
- And I will also say, I know we said about these,

1546
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,700
tag yourself in, hey guys.

1547
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:43,400
- This is you AF. - This is you?

1548
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,400
- And I'm gonna give her a five out of five.

1549
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:49,160
- Estelle is legendary for her athletic abilities.

1550
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,000
- I can tell, she is toned.

1551
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,980
- But isn't overly bright.

1552
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,860
She'll believe just about anything you tell her.

1553
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:54,920
- It's perfect. - Example,

1554
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,240
if you pretend to throw a ball,

1555
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:57,540
Estelle will rush out to catch it,

1556
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:58,660
and when she doesn't see it,

1557
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:00,680
she'll search the ground trying to find it.

1558
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,140
When she eventually learns of the ruse,

1559
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:04,540
she immediately forgets about it and moves on.

1560
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:06,860
Estelle is comparable to a golden retriever.

1561
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:07,900
- No way!

1562
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,740
Huh.

1563
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,380
- Despite her lack of intelligence,

1564
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,800
Estelle does have occasional moments of genius,

1565
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,420
catching crazy schemes using whatever's nearby.

1566
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:18,660
These schemes include rescuing a kitten from a tree

1567
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,580
by bouncing on a trampoline to reach it,

1568
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,220
and attempting to free dive with Cooper

1569
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,100
by tying her legs to a rock.

1570
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:27,220
Predictably, these schemes often end in near disaster.

1571
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,780
- Okay, so I would like to get ahead of this and say,

1572
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:32,220
I would like to get way, way ahead of this and say,

1573
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:34,660
she is comparable to a golden retriever.

1574
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:39,100
It says nowhere that she has retriever DNA.

1575
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:42,700
Oh, oh, well, look at the comparisons here.

1576
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:45,860
The hair, the dog-like nose.

1577
00:54:45,860 --> 00:54:47,660
Her personality.

1578
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,940
Her personality.

1579
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:51,540
They're all signs point to canine.

1580
00:54:51,540 --> 00:54:54,980
Why are you switching in like a British kind of accent?

1581
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:57,340
All signs point to canine.

1582
00:54:57,340 --> 00:54:58,380
'Cause you're like trying to make a point,

1583
00:54:58,380 --> 00:54:59,220
you go British?

1584
00:54:59,220 --> 00:55:00,060
Yeah.

1585
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:00,880
Okay, so here's the thing.

1586
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,380
This is a good way to make a point.

1587
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:03,620
She is beautiful.

1588
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:07,140
She, if she's part dog, then I'll drop it down to a four,

1589
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:07,980
but she's a five right now.

1590
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:09,580
You're gonna drop it down on all fours.

1591
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:10,420
She's part dog.

1592
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,780
(laughing)

1593
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:13,620
Is that what you said?

1594
00:55:13,620 --> 00:55:14,460
No.

1595
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:15,280
(laughing)

1596
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,120
No.

1597
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,320
She's part dog.

1598
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,160
I'm gonna drop her.

1599
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:18,980
I'll drop it off.

1600
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:19,820
Rating.

1601
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:21,440
I'm gonna drop her rating down to a four.

1602
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,420
I'm gonna drop her down on all fours.

1603
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:25,260
You're gonna drop yourself down on all fours.

1604
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,900
Keep the peanut butter away from this kid.

1605
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:27,740
Yeah, well.

1606
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,560
Oh, cool, yeah.

1607
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,400
Okay, white woman.

1608
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,220
Yeah, what do you listen to?

1609
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:31,660
Blink-182, you scumbag.

1610
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:32,500
I do.

1611
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:33,980
Oh.

1612
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,980
Okay.

1613
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,180
Crystal Cole Walker Pesquatch.

1614
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:39,260
This is more of a Patrick vibe woman,

1615
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:40,620
so this is not for me.

1616
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:44,460
- Describe, it's, she's, do you have to?

1617
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:45,540
- Okay, I guess I have to do everything.

1618
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:46,980
She has the same legs-- - You do an excellent job.

1619
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,540
- She has the same legs as Kermit the Frog.

1620
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:52,620
She has an investigating glass,

1621
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,460
whatever that's called.

1622
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,960
- Magnifying glass. - A magnifier.

1623
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,260
She has a crystal in the middle of her head.

1624
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,660
- She has a vest. - She's based off

1625
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:02,220
of the Star Fox crystal blue girl.

1626
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:05,140
She is definitely a scientist 'cause she has a lab coat on.

1627
00:56:05,140 --> 00:56:08,440
and she's some kind of geologist, scientist person,

1628
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,940
co-worker, pasquatch, she's also a Sasquatch.

1629
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,540
- Yep, she's part Sasquatch and her parents are divorced.

1630
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:16,380
- Yes, yeah.

1631
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:18,380
- And she might be Native American.

1632
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,140
- I think, no.

1633
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,020
- All right, let's see what happens.

1634
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:22,860
- I'm ready.

1635
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:26,900
- This budding geologist is part Indian, as in from India,

1636
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,780
and part Indian, as in Native American.

1637
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:33,620
- Oh my God, this guy can smell dogs

1638
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,620
Native Americans from a mile away.

1639
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:37,620
Being of this unusual mix of races,

1640
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,620
Crystal appears to be a lot wiser

1641
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:41,620
than her age would suggest.

1642
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,620
Unusual?

1643
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:45,620
Maybe it has something to do with that gem in her forehead.

1644
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:47,620
[Laughter]

1645
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:49,620
Okay.

1646
00:56:49,620 --> 00:56:51,620
Crystal fills the gentle and mysterious quota

1647
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:53,620
for my cast of original characters.

1648
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:55,620
Often, Crystal overdoes it with the whole geologist thing,

1649
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,620
being more interested in the sand

1650
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,620
on the beach than actually playing on the beach.

1651
00:56:59,620 --> 00:57:01,620
Her braid is also a lot longer

1652
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:05,620
longer than seen in the illustration. It reaches to just above her waist, actually.

1653
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:09,620
Okay, one last. I will say that is crazy that he guessed Native American.

1654
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:13,620
Yeah, that's pretty nuts. This guy is on a roll right now. Real quickly, a rating.

1655
00:57:13,620 --> 00:57:17,620
Three and a half. Probably like a four. I knew it. Just because I got

1656
00:57:17,620 --> 00:57:21,620
that thing. No, that's not what I thought. And not because I'm interested.

1657
00:57:21,620 --> 00:57:25,620
You're interested in her. Finally, here she is.

1658
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:29,620
The one I bet you've all been waiting for a visual representation of. It's Boobs McKean.

1659
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:32,340
- I'm gonna start drooling preemptively.

1660
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:33,460
- Eleanor Slater.

1661
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,680
- Oh!

1662
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:42,980
- Oh my God.

1663
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,680
She looks just like my childhood friend Nick's mom.

1664
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,420
Almost exactly.

1665
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,380
She has--

1666
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,780
- His pants just moved.

1667
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:55,140
- She has, number one.

1668
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:56,580
- Nick's mom's hair.

1669
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,660
- Nick's mom's hair.

1670
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:58,500
- Nick's mom's face.

1671
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,220
- Mixed moms dimensionality.

1672
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:02,340
She has exposed ankles.

1673
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,180
- Yeah.

1674
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,260
- That's a boom, boom plus for me.

1675
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:07,460
She has bent elbows.

1676
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:09,940
Again, he was going in on these drawings.

1677
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:10,780
- She has lumps on the elbows.

1678
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:12,540
- She has lumps on her elbows that need to go.

1679
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:13,380
- And she's got lumps in the front.

1680
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:15,500
- So she has low self-esteem.

1681
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,340
- She's got lumps in the front.

1682
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,780
- Because of her elbow lumps.

1683
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:22,020
She has beautiful hair that has a perfect right angle

1684
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,860
built into it.

1685
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,100
- She's wearing a collared shirt.

1686
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:27,620
- And the best part is guys, her eyes are upside down.

1687
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,020
(laughter)

1688
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,860
We love her upside down eyes.

1689
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:33,780
And this one does not, I won't let you guys guess

1690
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:35,540
'cause there's no information about her.

1691
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,500
No, no, we can guess.

1692
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,360
I mean you can guess but there's your--

1693
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:40,060
She's somebody's mom.

1694
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:40,900
Nick's mom.

1695
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,000
You're actually wrong.

1696
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,300
I apologize if the illustration doesn't quite

1697
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:46,620
live up to your expectations.

1698
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:49,780
Of course, Elena Sokolov can't be too far behind.

1699
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:50,620
Oh god, Sokolov.

1700
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:53,300
Okay, so Elena Sokolov is probably a--

1701
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,500
Elena Sokolov.

1702
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:55,340
This is her--

1703
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,460
We're in for trouble, aren't we?

1704
00:58:56,460 --> 00:58:57,700
- This is her alter ego.

1705
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:58,540
- Yes.

1706
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:00,100
- Oh God, so she's evil.

1707
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:01,940
So now she has eyebrows, which is bad.

1708
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:05,020
She has, wait, wait, those are exposed legs.

1709
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,820
She's wearing a bikini bottom.

1710
00:59:06,820 --> 00:59:07,660
And she looks like--

1711
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,140
- And she has some squares on her belt.

1712
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,620
- And she has squares on her belt, which is kind of scary.

1713
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:12,900
And she has a gun also.

1714
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:14,260
- In this article, I could not,

1715
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,300
there's no information at all about these characters,

1716
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,060
but I was able to go through the blog

1717
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:20,060
and find somewhere else.

1718
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:20,900
- About Elena Sokolov?

1719
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,980
- A bit of information about Elena Sokolov.

1720
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,420
- Okay.

1721
00:59:24,420 --> 00:59:27,180
So this is, and this is in the Rouge's gallery,

1722
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,660
the villains of Tyler Fishfinger's part one.

1723
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,640
Yeah, that's what he wrote.

1724
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,940
Darn near every villain in Tyler Fishfinger's history,

1725
00:59:32,940 --> 00:59:35,660
all in one convenient post for your convince.

1726
00:59:35,660 --> 00:59:37,500
Warning, major spoilers head.

1727
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,580
Proceed with caution.

1728
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:40,860
- I think we're like towards the end of the episode.

1729
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:44,680
Right now, I don't want any fucking spoilers.

1730
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,900
- There's gonna be major spoilers.

1731
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,740
- There's major spoilers.

1732
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:49,220
- You're gonna suffer through them.

1733
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,740
- I have to suffer through spoilers.

1734
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:51,800
- You have to suffer through them.

1735
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:52,800
And I don't even give a fuck.

1736
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:55,940
and i actually made one slide that's only spoilers for you mate

1737
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:58,840
that i'm gonna show that they were going to take my headphones off and close my

1738
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,680
eyes

1739
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,000
uh... so here's a land a cycle of

1740
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:06,860
occupation worker at a major company which that's a great job worker at a

1741
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,040
major apparently apparent

1742
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,940
evil spy working for a rogue nation known only as the syndicate

1743
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,600
false name elinor slater

1744
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,680
we go we'd knew about a little earlier on our slater

1745
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,280
to gather intelligence regarding the u_s_ government former to get revenge on

1746
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:22,540
in the cartooniverse.

1747
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:23,920
- Oh God.

1748
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,640
- And then there's one more part of this description

1749
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:27,140
that is the best part here.

1750
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,880
Ideal actor, Elizabeth Olsen.

1751
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,600
I was considering Priyanka Chopra

1752
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:34,300
before finding out she was Indian instead of Russian.

1753
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,960
- Chopra.

1754
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,560
Yeah, Elizabeth Olsen, she did strike me instantly.

1755
01:00:40,560 --> 01:00:43,140
- Okay, wait, wait, let's backtrack here

1756
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,520
and let's cast the perfect cast.

1757
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:47,560
Okay, so Elizabeth Olsen, obviously.

1758
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,400
- We have some more slides.

1759
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:49,480
- Who's here?

1760
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,320
All right, let's go forward.

1761
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:55,840
lightning round okay no no that's Timothee Chalamet okay yeah and then

1762
01:00:55,840 --> 01:01:00,800
that's Paul Rudd no that's Sharsha Ronan that's okay Sharsha Ronan that is Patrick

1763
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:09,520
look if you're gonna say it it's Del Knight we're gonna go Zoe Kravitz oh

1764
01:01:09,520 --> 01:01:16,840
yeah perfect perfect also Zoe Kravitz in a dual role yeah well no this is this is

1765
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:17,680
- Zoe Saldana?

1766
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,300
- Oh, the other Zoe, Zoe Saldana.

1767
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,640
And that's Zoe--

1768
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,480
- And then we already, this is Elizabeth Olsen.

1769
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:23,320
- Nick's mom.

1770
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:24,160
- Nick's mom.

1771
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:24,980
- Or no, Elizabeth Olsen.

1772
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:25,820
- Nick's mom, Zoe.

1773
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,920
- All right, now let's keep going through the villains here.

1774
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,560
Oh wait, that was the only villain.

1775
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,400
(laughing)

1776
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,440
I forgot to put in more villains.

1777
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,320
But here's, he also writes some editorials

1778
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:34,160
every once in a while.

1779
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,040
And we're gonna go through those real quick.

1780
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:37,880
Wednesday, November 11th, 2015.

1781
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,400
Veterans, we salute you.

1782
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,560
While you're at it, enjoy this early holiday treat.

1783
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:42,760
You guys wanna see the holiday treat?

1784
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:43,600
- Yeah.

1785
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,920
- Turn on your video real quick and then you can see it.

1786
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:45,760
- Yeah.

1787
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:47,460
- Turn on your video real quick and then you can turn it off,

1788
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:49,440
but check out this holiday treat, it's a comic.

1789
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:53,800
- It's a, wow, Santa meets broccoli alien overlord.

1790
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:56,380
And the broccoli and him at the same time say,

1791
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,440
gasp, he does exist.

1792
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:00,440
- And that's a present for the veterans.

1793
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,560
- That one is just for the veterans,

1794
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:07,560
that fulfills some kind of GI bill requirement.

1795
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:11,040
- Because the green, green--

1796
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,160
- Well it's also veteran colored,

1797
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,000
it's red, white, and green.

1798
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,640
- Green vegetable. - And brown.

1799
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,140
Yeah, green GI.

1800
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:20,340
Green a broccoli.

1801
01:02:20,340 --> 01:02:21,280
Green a broccoli.

1802
01:02:21,280 --> 01:02:22,280
All right, yeah, you're done.

1803
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,040
My thoughts on Gene Wilder's passing.

1804
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:27,000
He's off to a land of pure imagination, i.e. heaven.

1805
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:27,840
(laughing)

1806
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,320
That was also, this one, this looks like it's a,

1807
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,360
this was in the middle of a really long thing

1808
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,080
about like his like video game idea,

1809
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,720
and then there was just one heading in the middle.

1810
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,720
It was just that, and then it kept going after

1811
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:39,360
with more video game stuff.

1812
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,600
And then I think that this next thing is the last thing.

1813
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:43,440
Okay.

1814
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:48,440
I'd like to just read to you guys in its entirety.

1815
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,440
Friday, September 11th, 2015.

1816
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:54,440
Wow. Does this have to do with September Palooski?

1817
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:57,440
Never not remember. My two cents on 14 years ago.

1818
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,440
Okay. I'm ready.

1819
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,440
My two cents.

1820
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:01,440
Not never forget.

1821
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,440
Never not remember.

1822
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:03,440
Yeah.

1823
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:05,440
Now I'm just going to read this through for you guys.

1824
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:10,440
I started writing this post over a week in advance so I'd have plenty of time to finish it.

1825
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:15,440
This proved to be a little too much time in fact, meaning I had to wait for a week to publish it.

1826
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:25,440
This topic is somewhat out of the norm of this blog, for today I shall provide my insight onto what happened on this very day exactly 14 years ago.

1827
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:28,440
Let's start with the initial effects.

1828
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:33,440
First of all, what really grinds my gears about all this is that there were kids on those planes.

1829
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:38,440
Kids! Why? Why did those meanies have to take them away from us so soon?

1830
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:43,640
They had their whole lives ahead of them. They could have had class. They could have been contenders. They could have-

1831
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,140
Alright, that's enough.

1832
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:50,240
Other effects included several TV shows being pulled from the airwaves and rapidly rewritten,

1833
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:57,940
along with flights being diverted to Canada, leaving dozens, if not hundreds, of angry and confused travelers getting delayed for weeks.

1834
01:03:57,940 --> 01:04:05,140
As if that weren't enough, we also created a brand new stereotype, or took it to new extremes if it already existed.

1835
01:04:05,140 --> 01:04:10,740
"Practically the day before, most of the Middle Easterns who lived in our country were on friendly terms with their fellow citizens.

1836
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:15,740
But less than 24 hours later, their former pals suddenly screamed 'terrorist' and 'run away',

1837
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,440
leaving the poor fellows to scratch their scalps, wondering what the heck happened."

1838
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,140
That's true.

1839
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:23,140
"Okay, I think that settles the bad. Now the good."

1840
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,940
Good!

1841
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,740
"Countless heroes were made that day.

1842
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:31,440
Some were even unmade within an hour or so of their creation,

1843
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,640
giving their lives for the sake of strangers.

1844
01:04:33,640 --> 01:04:39,080
touching. Unmade. Furthermore, if it hadn't happened, we wouldn't have...

1845
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:39,880
That's what that means.

1846
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:42,760
Yeah, he's like, "The heroes died. It was cool."

1847
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,080
Great.

1848
01:04:43,080 --> 01:04:44,360
That's what heroes have to do.

1849
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,520
A lot of heroes died that day.

1850
01:04:46,520 --> 01:04:50,280
That's one of the good things. Furthermore, if it hadn't happened, we wouldn't have gone all out

1851
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:53,960
on airport security, which probably would have left the terrorists, only the real ones, not

1852
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,360
those affected by the stereotype, free to do something...

1853
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,320
Which he still calls terrorists.

1854
01:04:57,320 --> 01:05:00,360
Yeah. Free to do something even worse.

1855
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:00,600
Look, I'm not a stereotypical terrorist.

1856
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,160
I'd rather not think about what might have happened.

1857
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,200
- Yeah, I'm a...

1858
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:09,240
I don't do all that bombing and hijacking planes and stuff.

1859
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,600
- I make really bad food.

1860
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:12,680
- Yeah, I make poisoned food.

1861
01:05:12,680 --> 01:05:14,400
- I make really, really, not even poisoned.

1862
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:16,240
I just make really, really bad food.

1863
01:05:16,240 --> 01:05:18,000
- Look, I cook everything sous vide.

1864
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:18,840
- Yeah.

1865
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,840
- And I don't get a sear on it.

1866
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,600
- No, no, no.

1867
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:23,540
- By far, the best thing that came out of this

1868
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,800
is that the entire USA banded together

1869
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:27,560
in their desperate time of need.

1870
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:30,600
The Star Spangled Banner became a symbol of hope and freedom

1871
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,740
and patriotism surged through the country

1872
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:35,200
like an awesome simile would surge through my mind

1873
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,940
if I could only think of one.

1874
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:39,640
We regathered our strength, rebuilt,

1875
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:41,160
and honored those we lost.

1876
01:05:41,160 --> 01:05:43,320
- That is like some spanned out ballet shit.

1877
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:45,340
- If these attacks,

1878
01:05:45,340 --> 01:05:47,580
these attacks may have been designed to weaken us

1879
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,460
by crippling our economy and security,

1880
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:51,860
but they ultimately did nothing of the sort.

1881
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,660
If anything, they only made us stronger.

1882
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:56,740
Think about that the next time you have to take your shoes

1883
01:05:56,740 --> 01:05:57,580
off at the airport.

1884
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,060
- I don't have to take my shoes off at the airport.

1885
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:00,140
TSA pre-check.

1886
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,060
- Holla!

1887
01:06:01,060 --> 01:06:02,620
- And that's all, that's the whole thing.

1888
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:03,660
- Oh my God, dude.

1889
01:06:03,660 --> 01:06:06,580
Well, I mean, not only is he an amazing,

1890
01:06:06,580 --> 01:06:09,780
he's kind of like, I'm trying to think of any other figures

1891
01:06:09,780 --> 01:06:13,100
like that who kind of perfectly have one foot in fiction

1892
01:06:13,100 --> 01:06:14,340
and one foot in journalism.

1893
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:16,660
- For sure, for sure. - Walt Disney.

1894
01:06:16,660 --> 01:06:18,100
- Walt Disney was a journalist?

1895
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:20,060
- Oh wait, no, James Patterson.

1896
01:06:20,060 --> 01:06:21,220
- Oh, James Patterson.

1897
01:06:21,220 --> 01:06:22,140
- Or Tom Clancy.

1898
01:06:22,140 --> 01:06:24,300
- James Patterson, he does the non-fiction,

1899
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:26,060
but then he also does Maximum Ride.

1900
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:26,900
- Yeah.

1901
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:29,300
- Now that's an amazing book series about angels.

1902
01:06:29,300 --> 01:06:31,540
- What was that other guy?

1903
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,480
the base, he wrote all the sports--

1904
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:34,320
- Baseball?

1905
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,000
- Sports books. - Baseball.

1906
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:36,840
- That's gonna fuckin' bother me.

1907
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:37,660
- Babe Ruth.

1908
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,500
- Bill Simmons.

1909
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,780
- No, no, no, no, no.

1910
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,500
- Julio, can you pull up that picture?

1911
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,340
- Yeah, real quick, we gotta leave it with this.

1912
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,620
We have a picture to show you.

1913
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:46,660
- Oh, yeah.

1914
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:50,660
- So, this picture, actually, no commentary needed, I think.

1915
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:51,500
I think we'll just end on this, right?

1916
01:06:51,500 --> 01:06:52,860
- Yeah, just pull this picture up.

1917
01:06:52,860 --> 01:06:56,220
- Yeah, if we can, it's taking quite a long time, actually.

1918
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,180
- Yeah, to open the picture. - It's pretty embarrassing.

1919
01:06:58,180 --> 01:06:59,020
- Should've had it ready.

1920
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,180
- Yeah, you should've had it, okay.

1921
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,580
So here it comes.

1922
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:04,620
- All right, so it's still not working.

1923
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,820
- Mike Lupica.

1924
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:07,020
Mike Lupica. - Ah, there it is.

1925
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:07,860
- There it is.

1926
01:07:07,860 --> 01:07:09,020
(laughing)

1927
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:11,420
That's me when I see a Mike Lupica book in the library.

1928
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:12,260
- So that's for you guys.

1929
01:07:12,260 --> 01:07:13,580
You can keep that. - Me when I see the bird seed.

1930
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,380
- Yeah, that's right.

1931
01:07:15,380 --> 01:07:16,220
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1932
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:17,380
Screenshot this. - I'd like to see

1933
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:18,980
a bunch of these. - Wait, yeah, wait, wait.

1934
01:07:18,980 --> 01:07:20,420
Screenshot this.

1935
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:22,340
This is our new thing that we're doing.

1936
01:07:22,340 --> 01:07:23,660
This is the meme contest.

1937
01:07:23,660 --> 01:07:24,980
- Yeah. - Yeah.

1938
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:26,020
- Photoshop battle.

1939
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:27,460
- Photoshop battle.

1940
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:32,020
Whoever comes up with the best meme with this photo, if you send it in to us...

1941
01:07:32,020 --> 01:07:34,020
We'll send you 50 bucks.

1942
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,020
(laughter)

1943
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:38,020
Alright, bye.

1944
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:40,260
(laughing)

1945
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:42,500
(laughing)
