1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Uh, last time on Sullivan Quest...

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
The year is 2042.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:12,400
And so I've been blackmailing her and I think she can get you a good audio book deal.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,360
Give me a week, I have this manuscript that I'm working on.

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,680
Give me a week to punch it up, how's it sound?

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,680
That's great, yes, a week is perfect.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,680
Thank you so much.

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
This is going to change our lives, man.

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:24,680
I press record.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,680
How about I read you a bedtime story?

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,080
Once upon a time there were three friends.

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,480
Caleb, Cameron, and Peter.

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,480
I got this new game I wanted us to play.

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,280
It's an RPG called Sullivan Quest.

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,680
Reminds me of Patches who died, beloved, and was never betrayed.

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,480
Press start?

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,280
Don't mind if I do.

18
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:55,680
Wow! I can't believe I turned 15 just this morning!

19
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,880
It's Belinda Croaks, the prettiest frog in school!

20
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,880
Oh hey Sullivan, happy birthday!

21
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,880
Oh no, it's Bullyfrog the Toad!

22
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,880
Well look at what we have here!

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
Oh gosh, uh...

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,880
Bullyfrog, why don't you knock it off?

25
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,880
You're dead meat Sullivan! I'll see you after school, punk!

26
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,880
Today class, we'll be wrapping up a short documentary about Sullivan de Granouille,

27
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,880
the worst explorer in Gan City history.

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,880
The Grandoui documented all of it in his journal, which he called "Sullivan's Quest."

29
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,880
However, he misplaced it, so now we don't know what he saw.

30
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,880
When he died, he said, "In many years, a young frog just like me will have his own quest,

31
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,880
and he will discover the truth behind Gun City."

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
Well, time to get home.

33
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,880
Wow, it's my tough-as-nails cousin, John Carlo.

34
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Now, Sullivan, John Carlo's gonna be watching you this week while Mama heads to Cancun.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Sullivan, wake up! We gotta go!

36
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Guess I gotta follow Giancarlo!

37
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Uh-oh. It's the Nightmare Assassin.

38
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
That young frog is impressive.

39
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Could he be?

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
We'll have to find another way.

41
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Move out, operatives!

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Let's get moving. We have to get to the base.

43
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
This place is amazing!

44
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Welcome to the pond, Sullivan.

45
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Your quest begins here.

46
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
I think I'm gonna head home.

47
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Wanna play this again tomorrow?

48
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,880
If we have to.

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,880
I remember the last time a recording felt that good.

50
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,880
But what to call it?

51
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,880
Maybe just...

52
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
Maybe just Sullivan Quest?

53
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:33,880
So I come up with the name Sullivan Quest,

54
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:36,880
do a line of CCP approved nutritional supplement,

55
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,880
and start grinning like a Cheshire whore.

56
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,880
That first chapter felt real good.

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,880
But before I could even start working on part two,

58
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,880
I was gonna need another pick-me-up.

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
So I went outside for the first time in a while,

60
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,760
while. Stepped over that Amazon crackhead fellow that went down to the bodega. They don't scan

61
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,520
you with this one so you can go in and out real quick. I'll grab some beef jerky, got

62
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,800
a meal of high life, and I start flirting with the girl behind the counter. You many, really

63
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,960
nice. I think most of the mail service workers are in one of those plants in central Jersey.

64
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,400
You have a better pay, a couple days vacation, you can start at 14 too if you're not a party

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,120
member, or you can't afford high school or whatever. Now here you need to know just a

66
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,480
a little bit of python too and you're good. Not that I have anything to do with that shit.

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,480
You know, it's not my bag. I avoid that world, thank god.

68
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,560
But anyway, I'm flirting with the girl behind the counter. She hasn't said a word to me

69
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,320
for 20 minutes, but before I know it, it's night time. So I'm rushing back before a curfew.

70
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,320
I'm constantly looking over my shoulder, I forgot to bring my badge, I could have gotten

71
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,680
the fucking chip in my arm to avoid a lot of this crap. You know, the chip thing, but I

72
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,680
was too lazy. I've been too lazy. But I really couldn't afford to get caught, you know, hold

73
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,980
off to re-education, because that can take days, and I need to finish Sullivan Quest before

74
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,980
the week was up, or Price would have my fucking head.

75
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:57,980
This province got such a fucking raw deal, I swear to God.

76
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,080
But anyway, so, right when I think I'm home free, I'm rounding the block, right where

77
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,260
my brownstone is, I see a few of these stupid fucking Pinkertons patrolling.

78
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,620
They're hassling the Amazon crackhead now.

79
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,620
And I know that's gonna entertain them for a while, 'cause, you know, beats running goods for climate refugees, so...

80
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,620
I about face and I just end up going down Hanover for a couple blocks, you know, I'm just sort of beelining it, like I don't know what the fuck's going on.

81
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,620
And I turn into some lobby, I think it's a lobby of a yotel, but it was a theater.

82
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,620
You know, I'm still bugging out a little bit from the supplement and the other shit I've been doing.

83
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,940
So I don't even know what the fuck I am and then my eyes start to adjust and I realize

84
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,980
it's new Webster Hall.

85
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,660
Some nothing burger 16 year old staring at me like I'm half crazed which I am so I get

86
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,660
it.

87
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,180
And he's like "Oh can I help you sir?"

88
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:53,740
I can see security's starting to get a little antsy so I just tell the kid "Yo I'm fine,

89
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,220
I'm just getting out of the rain."

90
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,940
He can see there's no rain.

91
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,460
But he also can see I'm not going to cause any trouble.

92
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,620
So it's past curfew, obviously, you know, a little down and out, just, you know,

93
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,620
let me just duck in here for a little bit, yadda yadda. So he's like, "All right, okay."

94
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:13,420
You know, I watch the security, they sort of put the hazes to the side, he gives a sort of

95
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,300
curt nod to me, like, whatever. So I start to shuffle over to the theater's cocktail bar

96
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,580
in the lobby of these places. So I start to shuffle over there, I'm gonna order a drink,

97
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:27,180
and then I start hearing people laughing inside. I ask the kid, "Oh, who's playing tonight?" He

98
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,180
He says, "Oh, some pre-G American stand-up.

99
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,180
You know, some pre-G art."

100
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,180
Nobody gives a shit about pre-G art anymore.

101
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:38,180
It's all about whatever's going on now.

102
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,180
But, you know, that was my time, so it's important to me.

103
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:43,180
So I'm like, "Oh, can I pop in?"

104
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,180
I'm interested in that.

105
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,180
And the kid says, "Okay, sure, you know, just for a second."

106
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,180
And I'm like, "All right, well, fuck you."

107
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,180
So I start to walk up the stairs, and we get to see the show.

108
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,140
I start to hear the comedian now a little bit more clearly, you know, the words start to take shape

109
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:03,500
I start to get phrases intonation and slowly I start to piece together an act

110
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,580
And it's an act I begin to recognize

111
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,500
Because it's fucking Caleb

112
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,300
You got isn't it it's it

113
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:22,220
It's funny how you guys ever notice how people are afraid of Godzilla

114
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:46,700
That son of a bitch is Tory, and he's crushing it too, and he's alone.

115
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,700
I even kept up with those fuckers, but I thought they all stuck together after the Apatow deal.

116
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Did it fall through?

117
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,700
I was gonna shout at the audience, y'all tell 'em they're watching a traitor.

118
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,700
They're giving their money to a bastard who would sell their own mother down the river,

119
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,700
but soon it'd be broadcast about shit.

120
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:12,700
It's like, uh, if I was Godzilla, and I saw all these damn, all these fuckin' little guys everywhere,

121
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,700
Hell, I'd be scootin' my lizard ass back into that there ocean.

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:23,700
And I might even call a bigger Godzilla to take care of the problem.

123
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:33,700
I couldn't stand it anymore. I was fuming.

124
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,700
I needed to go home.

125
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,700
You know, let them take me to re-education.

126
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
As long as they don't have to hear this.

127
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,700
It's a dope, but they all live on without a care in the world.

128
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,700
For everything they did to me.

129
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,700
Everything.

130
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:52,700
So I thanked the kid.

131
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,700
And I gave him a tip or an old tissue or something in my pocket.

132
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,700
And I sprinted home and the Pinkertons were gone, thank God.

133
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,700
So was the crackhead.

134
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:03,700
I burst open my brownstone, rubbed one out, thinking about the bodega girl reaching for mace behind the counter.

135
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,700
I opened up my laptop and then...

136
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,700
*sigh*

137
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:14,100
I calmed down for a second, I was so possessed by this ravenous spite.

138
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,860
I missed a couple texts from my wife.

139
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,900
So I start panicking because she only talks to me when I'm really fucked up.

140
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:26,020
But it was just some pictures of her with the kids.

141
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,740
I don't think she meant to send it to me though because she also wrote "wish these kids were

142
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,460
ours" with a heart emoji.

143
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,700
I pressed record.

144
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Good evening, young Thomas.

145
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,700
Hello, Uncle Jake.

146
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:46,700
What are we going to do for fun this evening?

147
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:52,700
Well, Thomas, I thought we'd keep reading the "Podcasters Play Video Games" book,

148
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,700
since you seemed to so enjoy the first chapter last night.

149
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,700
Uncle Jake, I don't know.

150
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:04,700
You know I only have so much time left on this here earth...

151
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,700
With my disease.

152
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,200
Heh heh! I know, I know.

153
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
That's why it's good to read.

154
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,700
And enrich yourself.

155
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,200
To strengthen your resistance to...

156
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,700
The outside forces that try to corrupt your mind as they have your poor, sick little body.

157
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,700
*Groans*

158
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,700
Okay.

159
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:35,420
That sounds important.

160
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:43,060
Read the book then I guess.

161
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,220
And I might even call a bigger Godzilla to take care of the problem.

162
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,780
That's so funny dude.

163
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:50,780
So awesome.

164
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,300
Looks like I just walked into the laugh factory.

165
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,660
You just missed one of Caleb's classic bits.

166
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,820
Oh wow.

167
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,300
Was it one of the ones Patches wrote for you back in the day?

168
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,700
Of course! Patches wrote all my best bits.

169
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,000
The hip-hop doctor, the Malaysian conductor, the hip-hop tennis player...

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,500
He was even bald first.

171
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,500
No way!

172
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
I had no idea.

173
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,300
Well, you never asked him.

174
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,000
So true.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,800
Anyway, I brought Sullivan Quest again in case you guys want to play it.

176
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,500
What do they keep bringing up?

177
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,500
What's... what's his name?

178
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:37,900
*stuttering*

179
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
Patches?

180
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Uh, well, see the thing is here little tiny Tommy Tim-time, Patches was a podcaster too.

181
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,900
A friend of theirs.

182
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,900
What?

183
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,900
What?

184
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,900
I don't get it.

185
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:14,900
Why don't they just play the game?

186
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:21,900
Or, I don't know, talk about things?

187
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,900
What is that like?

188
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,900
They just keep talking about their dead friend.

189
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,900
That's not important.

190
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:33,900
What's not important?

191
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,900
Uh...

192
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,900
I don't know.

193
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Sullivan Quest?

194
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Yep.

195
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:57,900
[Music]

196
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:09,400
[Music]

197
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,800
Ahahahah! Ahahahah! Ahahahah!

198
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,300
I'm splashin' in the water! I'm splashin' around!

199
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,800
Ahahahah! Waaah!

200
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,300
Waa-WAAAHH!

201
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,300
Woah, take it easy, Sullivan. You're still gonna get used to your powers.

202
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,300
And, and, and... Don't use frog arts so casually.

203
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,000
Sorry! This place is just so great!

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
Well, it's sacred, too.

205
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,600
It was sealed off from the world for hundreds of years, and through frog arts, it kept out of sight of the city.

206
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,300
A lot of frogs from the city found their way out here when they learned they had...

207
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,040
These powers, I bet the knowledge of these powers was being suppressed.

208
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,540
Oh, wow.

209
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,880
Even more, I've lived here their whole life.

210
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,440
Never even seen the outside world.

211
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,440
Wh-why?

212
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,440
Well...

213
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,440
Giancarlo, you've returned!

214
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,040
Elba Ribbit, it's good to see you.

215
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,040
And you as well, my friend.

216
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
And I see you've brought a visitor.

217
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,040
Not just any visitor, that's a cousin.

218
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,040
Hi, my name's Solomon the Frog.

219
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
It's nice to meet you.

220
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,040
This is...

221
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,040
Thee Sullivan?

222
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
Yeah, it's him.

223
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Well then, the pleasure is all mine, Mr. Sullivan.

224
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,040
Mr. Sullivan?

225
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,040
I know he's young, but uh...

226
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,040
We've run out of time.

227
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,040
He's asking a lot of questions and uh...

228
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,040
It's not really...

229
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,040
It's not really my thing.

230
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
I see.

231
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Mr. Sullivan, are you enjoying the pond?

232
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,040
Why, yeah, it's... it's amazing.

233
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,040
I've never seen so many of my kind in one place.

234
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Particularly a place so lovely as this.

235
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,040
It's pretty nice.

236
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
How wonderful.

237
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:54,040
These old legs don't hop so well anymore, but if they could I'd be hopping for joy.

238
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,040
When you're ready, Mr. Sullivan, I'd be honored if you'd join me at the ephemeral pool.

239
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:08,560
Take a look at your map in the pause menu and press R for the local map view.

240
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,040
You'll be able to see where all of the landmarks in the pond are, including the ephemeral pool.

241
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Oh, neato!

242
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Thanks!

243
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,880
Please join me soon.

244
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,040
Until then, Mr. Sullivan.

245
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
Okay, bye!

246
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:31,040
Uh, do I have to join him?

247
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
Yeah you do.

248
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Okay.

249
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,040
Look kid, there are a lot of things about this world that have been hidden from us.

250
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
Not just from frogs, but from all of us.

251
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
I'll be by the pool as well.

252
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,040
Just join us when you're ready.

253
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
Yeah but ready for what?

254
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
That, that, that.

255
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,040
Oh come on!

256
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,480
Well, I guess I can explore the pond for a bit. It's pretty neat

257
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:01,900
But then I better head right over to the ephemeral pool. Who cares about this shit open the map. Okay, I did

258
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:08,660
There's like an item shop and a weapon shop and armor shop. Naturally. It's a bunch of towns folks or

259
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,080
There's that pool. Don't go there. It's gonna start the next scene. Let's just shop a bit

260
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:26,600
Hey, didn't we level up on the way over here got a new move to multi attack right? Yeah, sure

261
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:34,940
Also, didn't you get one game over on the way over here? That was yesterday. So the turns since when?

262
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:41,200
Hi, welcome to the pond weapons and armor shop, how can I help you?

263
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:47,240
Do we have money? Yes, we killed a ton of monsters that dropped a ton of tokens

264
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,240
A photon blade? Sullivan can't equip that. Is Giancarlo in our party still?

265
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:58,240
Nah, he's not in the menu. I'm guessing he's too overpowered to stay with us. Just like Patches.

266
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,240
Do you have any recommendations?

267
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:07,240
You should get the best weapon that fits in your budget, and get the best armor that fits in your budget, in that order.

268
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Oh, okay.

269
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:13,240
It's not rocket science, buddy. Just get the best equipment. We make it very clear here which is best.

270
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Oh, okay.

271
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,240
Hover over an option you can see if it raises your attack or defense.

272
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,740
No, no, I got it now, thanks.

273
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,240
It's really easy to do. Like, really easy.

274
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:26,740
Hmm, okay, I'll take the Buster Mop and the Gap Kids Ensemble.

275
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
500 tokens.

276
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:29,240
Thanks, come again.

277
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Thank you!

278
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Actually, I would like to sell also these 37 Monster Bones.

279
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,740
Whoa, dude, what the fuck? Why do you have so many bones?

280
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,740
Giancarlo told me these were 17 tokens apiece.

281
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:48,900
Maybe if you're Richard Ramirez. Oh my god the smell. Oh my god. I'm sorry are these

282
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,420
They for crafting

283
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:58,300
What the fuck about this weapons and armor shop made you think I was gonna buy three dozen pelvises. What the fuck are you doing?

284
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,300
I don't know. I'm sorry. I'm leaving

285
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,620
Thanks for the bop in the armor. Thanks come again

286
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:09,900
Okay

287
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:14,900
Alright, well, I guess I'll have to, uh, find a way to get rid of these bones.

288
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:15,900
Uh...

289
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,900
But first, let's meet some more of my fellow frogs!

290
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:27,900
The pond keeps us safe. I sure hope the city, or the board, never find us.

291
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Elder Ribbon and the pond guard will keep us safe. I'm sure of it.

292
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
By Anora, I hope so.

293
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,620
Hi! Would you like to hear the story of Onura?

294
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,420
The goddess of the frogs-

295
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:42,220
Absolutely not.

296
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,420
I hate this shit.

297
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,780
Pete, stop!

298
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,280
Fuck!

299
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,780
Yes!

300
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,780
Why did you hit yes?

301
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,780
I thought I had no selected, the UI is confusing.

302
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:54,780
I'm actually preparing for my initiation into the council of Senor Frogs, so it helps to talk about it.

303
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,980
This is fucking miserable.

304
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,180
I'm trying to skip it!

305
00:17:57,180 --> 00:18:00,380
All frogs had tails, and then there was Onura.

306
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,420
She gave the gift of without to the frogs.

307
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:08,420
Following the rebirth, when Onora fell, this was the second metamorphosis.

308
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
And that's the story of Onora.

309
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,420
Phew, think I did okay.

310
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:15,420
Do you want to hear it again?

311
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,420
I won't!

312
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
No thanks.

313
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,420
Okay, farewell.

314
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:29,420
I was just a tadpole, but look at me now!

315
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:36,420
That's my son. He was just a tadpole, but look at him now.

316
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,420
Alright, I'm good. Let's go talk to the old guy.

317
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:55,420
This must be the ephemeral pool.

318
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Um...

319
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Hey!

320
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,420
I'm here.

321
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,420
Good, good, good come Mr. Sullivan.

322
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,420
This pool sure is beautiful.

323
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:09,420
It's been in the pond for centuries.

324
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Really?

325
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,420
Yes.

326
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,420
Yes, definitely.

327
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Anyway, Mr. Sullivan, have you ever heard of Sullivan de Granwy?

328
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Yeah, we just learned about him in school actually.

329
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,420
When I was, I guess when I was going to school.

330
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Am I still going to be able to go to school?

331
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,420
Not the whole story I'm sure.

332
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Nor the true one.

333
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,420
His story is the same as Gan City's.

334
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,420
And the whole of Planet E-Bomb itself.

335
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:45,420
You see, De'Gronwi was an explorer employed by the board long before they were called that.

336
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:47,420
And long before they ruled Gan City.

337
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,420
He was sent on an expedition here, in Planet E-Bomb.

338
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Then, just an uninhabited planet of little repute.

339
00:19:55,420 --> 00:20:01,100
He discovered the planet was rich with resources, enough to sustain any civilization for millennia.

340
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,420
He spent years here, documenting the planet's brilliance and beauty.

341
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,900
He even developed the planet's first settlement right here in this very pond.

342
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,100
He began to bring more frog folk to the planet, to share with them the joy and potential he saw.

343
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,660
When the Gromwe returned to the board, he told them of his exploits.

344
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,100
He told them that Planet E-Bomb could provide for everyone.

345
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:31,100
And he showed them his journal where he documented his adventure, better known as "Sullivan's Quest".

346
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:39,500
This did not sit well with the greedy board. You see, resource scarcity helped them maintain control

347
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:46,620
and fund their planetary exploration and conquest. So they took de Grenouille's journal, blasted

348
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,860
Planet E-Bomb into a barren wasteland, slaughtered all the frogs de Grenouille brought with him,

349
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,980
And worst of all, they tarnished his name, called him a weird guy, and a sucker.

350
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,860
Oh my god, that's horrible!

351
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,100
But all hope was not lost.

352
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:08,380
They grown we and his allies before their defeat.

353
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:14,060
Used the last of their frog arts to seal the pond and the few frogs who remained underground,

354
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,740
away from their enemies.

355
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,460
But I thought-

356
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,620
That he died from the wound in his balls that spread to his penis.

357
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,900
Yes, that is true.

358
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:24,460
I wasn't...

359
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,460
Alright.

360
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:31,420
remains of the way Planet Yibaum was before the arrival of the Borg, before they blasted

361
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:33,940
this place to shit.

362
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:41,420
Our surviving ancestors kept the story of De'Gronwy alive, but they also kept us underground,

363
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,140
hidden and isolated from a world that tried to destroy us.

364
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,140
Most of the frogs who came to the planet, who settled above ground, long after De'Gronwy's

365
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,900
expedition, soon forgot his story.

366
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,780
They forgot the pond, the frog arts.

367
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:02,820
Even our goddess Anura, bless the one who gets no tail, believing the lies the board told

368
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
them.

369
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,240
But the frogs are always drawn to the pond.

370
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,580
This is so hard to follow.

371
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,900
So the old French Sullivan explored the planet a long time ago, saw that it was good.

372
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,720
The bad people didn't like that, so they made the planet bad, killed French Sullivan

373
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,260
and his frog friends.

374
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
It's pretty simple.

375
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,260
But why is he French?

376
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Hold on boys, I gotta take this. It's Juna.

377
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:28,260
Juna...

378
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Here, Sullivan! Look at this!

379
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,260
Wow! What is this?

380
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:41,260
It looks delicious!

381
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:48,260
When De'Gronwe sealed the pond, he also sealed one of the seven amber shards of Anura in here as well.

382
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:53,460
Within each shard is a fossilized fly that contains the power to restore the planet.

383
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:59,260
The shards however are unbreakable to everything except for the fly eater.

384
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,460
The fly eater?

385
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,660
Oh so you heard me.

386
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Uh uh uh.

387
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
No, that's good.

388
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:05,660
*clears throat*

389
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,660
De Garnouille said that someday the fly eater would come

390
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,660
and that he would collect the shards and restore the barren planet.

391
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,660
The key to finding the shards is in Sullivan's quest.

392
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,260
Which, as we know, was stolen by the board!

393
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:25,460
That is, until your cousin John Carlo stole it back a few years ago.

394
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:29,660
I'd been working for the board for a while, and eventually found out they had Sullivan's Quest.

395
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
We had enough since we were told it was lost.

396
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,660
Then I saw the board had files on you, kid.

397
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:36,660
What? What about me?

398
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:41,660
Well, they suspected that you were... that you're the Fly Eater.

399
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:44,660
The one destined to restore the planet?

400
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,660
Wh-what?

401
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,300
think they really knew what that meant but they were starting to piece something

402
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,540
together and I wanted to do it before they did so I went looking for answers

403
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,940
and I met Elder...

404
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,000
More like I met you! He was quite the sight! He was

405
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,080
passed out for a week! The whole pond worked together to nurse this one back

406
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,580
to health!

407
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:05,840
Yeah yeah old man, things got complicated with the board, let's put it that way.

408
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,220
But once your cousin finally awoke he showed me Sullivan's quest, thought lost

409
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:17,340
forever and told me about you. Myself and the Council of Signor Frogs had been

410
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:22,500
scrying the ephemeral pool searching for the fly eater. We saw it could be this

411
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Sullivan the Frog. That's my name. Yes and by Enora I knew that there was hope.

412
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,340
I don't know. The other six shards were hidden throughout the planet by De

413
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,700
Granouille during his travels all of which he documented in Sullivan's quest.

414
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,700
But Crafty DeGranouille used his frog arts to erase the journal's contents, meaning he erased the shard's locations as well.

415
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,700
But the journal, just like the planet, can be restored if...

416
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,700
Well...

417
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Mr. Sullivan...

418
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:02,700
If you truly are the fly eater, hold the shard in your hands and think of your happy place.

419
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,700
The one you think about when you use your frog arts.

420
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,200
Then, use your tongue to eat the fly.

421
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:15,200
But this shard is hard as rock or metal or stone or rock.

422
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,200
If the stories are true, it won't be in your hands or with your tongue.

423
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Okay, I'll try.

424
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,200
Wow!

425
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,200
My tongue, it phased right through the amber.

426
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,200
That tasted pretty good.

427
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Whoa!

428
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
Where am I?

429
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
This is like my dream again.

430
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
What's this?

431
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
I feel a power within me.

432
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
This is your power Sullivan.

433
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
Your quest.

434
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
The organism demands it.

435
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
New frog are unlocked.

436
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Lightbringer blast.

437
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
New frog are unlocked.

438
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Lightbringer blast.

439
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
New frog are unlocked.

440
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
Lightbringer blast.

441
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
New frog are unlocked.

442
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:16,800
How do you feel Mr. Sullivan?

443
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:22,040
I feel strange, but good.

444
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,600
I feel strong.

445
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,600
Where was I?

446
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,800
You were right here.

447
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,040
You just floated in the air and peed yourself a little.

448
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,040
Oh no.

449
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,360
Elder Ribbit, you must see.

450
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,360
Above ground.

451
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:35,360
Yes, yes.

452
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
Sullivan! Giancarlo, come!

453
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:47,360
Oh my god!

454
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,360
It's so green!

455
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,360
Beautiful! There's a river here!

456
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,360
Trees! This was not...

457
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,360
when we came here, Giancarlo!

458
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,360
I know, kid.

459
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
I know.

460
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
The land above where the pond is sealed,

461
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
it's been restored!

462
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,360
I wasn't sure if I believed it before, but...

463
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,360
Kid, this is a miracle.

464
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,360
Okay, now, now, look at Sullivan's quest!

465
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Hurry!

466
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,360
This is amazing!

467
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,360
It's like an illustration come to life!

468
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,360
What did the grown leave right?

469
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,360
A hero?

470
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
This farm is a miracle.

471
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,360
As is rhythm.

472
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,360
It may never grow dry.

473
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
These trees, the fruits they bear

474
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:40,040
incredible and delicious. If all the land is so plentiful, we could feed generations.

475
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:47,960
This planet is something special. It truly is. Tomorrow I shall head to the cave

476
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:54,040
north of here. At night it glows and shimmers, made of colors beyond the imagination.

477
00:27:54,040 --> 00:28:01,000
I can't wait to see the wonders contained therein. I shall mark it on my map here

478
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
And?

479
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Then there's nothing.

480
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,000
This is spectacular.

481
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
Okay, everyone, back into the pond.

482
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Hurry, hurry, we don't want the board to see.

483
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I told you, it's not...

484
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
No, well, who cares if it's just one...

485
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,000
This is big.

486
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
Hi, Juna.

487
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
She says hi.

488
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
Hi, Juna.

489
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
Hi, Juna.

490
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Hi, Juna.

491
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
Hi, Juna.

492
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Hi, Juna.

493
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
Hi, Juna.

494
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Hi, Juna.

495
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,000
Hi, Juna.

496
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Hi, Juna.

497
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Hi, Juna.

498
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Hi, Juna.

499
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Hi, Juna.

500
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Hi, Juna.

501
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
Hi, Juna.

502
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Hi, Juna.

503
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Hi, Juna.

504
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Hi, Juna.

505
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Hi, Juna.

506
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
Hi, Juna.

507
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
She says hi!

508
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
So...

509
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
There are frogs...

510
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
And there are humans...

511
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
But there are like...

512
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Like I think we saw goblins too?

513
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
Yeah, it's a fantasy world.

514
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
It just...

515
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The fly eater-

516
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Do I have to explain everything to you?

517
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
The French frog wrote a book, and in that book he reveals the location of amber shards that hold magic flies.

518
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
But he secretly erased the book to hide the shards from the bad guys

519
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,780
because when the fly eater comes he eats the fly which restores the planet which the bad

520
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:05,200
guys hate and it also restores the book which reveals the location of the next shard.

521
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,280
That way only the fly eater can truly know where the next shard is, restore the planet,

522
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,200
save the world, whatever.

523
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Pretty simple.

524
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:22,280
I don't know it seems kinda complicated.

525
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,040
Grumble grumble.

526
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,040
What's your deal?

527
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,800
Nothing.

528
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:38,200
By Enora do you see now Mr. Sullivan?

529
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:45,040
Once the fly eater, you, collects the shards, Sullivan's quest will reveal itself and the

530
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,960
barren planet shall be restored.

531
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,160
This is what Degon Wee told us.

532
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,160
This is your destiny.

533
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,160
But what if I can't do it?

534
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
But what if I can't do it?

535
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,560
I'm not strong or tough or even all that smart.

536
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,320
Yes, that is true.

537
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,960
But by Anora, you are the fly eater.

538
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
No!

539
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:08,080
I mean, yes, maybe, I don't know, but no!

540
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,280
I'm just a frog.

541
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:14,600
Like Mama used to say, "A frog's a frog and a frog he shall be.

542
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,960
No harm in that, no harm indeed."

543
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,720
That's who I am, just a frog.

544
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,920
My child, so was de gon' we.

545
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
I know, I just...

546
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,920
I just...

547
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,920
I don't know.

548
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:30,920
I don't... I don't know.

549
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,920
Elton, let me talk to the kid.

550
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,920
Go ahead, I'll be staring.

551
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,920
This is crazy, Giancarlo.

552
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,920
I was just a student, like a few hours ago.

553
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,920
How can this all be true?

554
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
You shot magic out of your mouth a few hours ago too.

555
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,920
Now I'm scared I'm gonna vomit magic on somebody by accident.

556
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,920
What if I hurt someone?

557
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:57,920
I don't know, I was just flashing around the pond and I could have hurt someone just by...

558
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,420
Oh God...

559
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:04,920
Listen Sullivan...

560
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,920
If you go on this journey or not...

561
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,920
The board's gonna keep coming after you.

562
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
But why?

563
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
I didn't do nothing.

564
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
Neither did the Gromwe.

565
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,860
He found a miraculous planet full of unlimited resources with no inhabitants and wanted to

566
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
share it with others.

567
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:24,620
And look what happened to him.

568
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:28,180
But you could change that story, Sullivan.

569
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,220
You could change the meaning of his quest.

570
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,220
You could do a lot of good.

571
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:39,380
Well, I want to do good.

572
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,260
I know you do.

573
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,820
You've always been like that.

574
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,500
It's fucking irritating.

575
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:52,020
I always thought the board seemed mean, but I guess I never thought about how bad off most

576
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,820
folks are in Gun City.

577
00:31:54,820 --> 00:32:00,500
I don't even know what people's lives are like throughout the rest of the planet.

578
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:05,980
There's enough stuff to go around, really, like the grown wee says.

579
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:08,460
I guess I should do something, shouldn't I?

580
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
If I can.

581
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:15,500
Sometimes you have to grow up kid. It's never on your own terms, trust me.

582
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Just how it is.

583
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,500
Okay.

584
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Seems like I got a big job to do.

585
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:31,500
People can't afford to wait for me to be ready.

586
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:37,500
You'll help me.

587
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,500
With all of this, right?

588
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,500
I'll do everything I can.

589
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,000
And you'll keep my mama safe?

590
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,500
Of course.

591
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Well...

592
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
Um...

593
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Alright, okay.

594
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,500
Alright.

595
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Alright, there we go.

596
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Okay.

597
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
That was, uh...

598
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Alright, now let's take a look at the map that the Grand We drew.

599
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:07,500
That's the Crave Cave.

600
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,700
The ore veins in there were supposed to be the richest in the world, until it dried up a few centuries ago.

601
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:17,200
It was a mining tycoon, Twiggy Hancock. He was the culprit.

602
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,980
He disappeared along with the ore and all of his goblin workers.

603
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,500
So you think the shard is in that cave?

604
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,000
I'd say there's a good chance.

605
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,500
Then it is decided!

606
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:32,500
Tomorrow morning, I shall see you all. Sorry, I was just standing right next to you guys.

607
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Yeah, it's whatever.

608
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,000
It's cool.

609
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,500
Sorry!

610
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,500
Don't worry about it.

611
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,380
You are the hope for all of us, Mr. Sullivan.

612
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,980
For both frog and man, and everyone in between.

613
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,220
I shall see you in the morning.

614
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,300
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.

615
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,580
And may Enora bless you and your quest.

616
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,380
Good night, Elder Ribbit.

617
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:53,380
Thanks.

618
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,380
Go mention it.

619
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,540
Why don't you get some rest tonight?

620
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:00,300
The Elder and the Signior Frogs got a bed for you in the citadel north of here.

621
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,980
I'll see you off in the morning too.

622
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,380
You're not coming with me?

623
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,880
There's a lot I have to do to make sure people don't find out what you're doing, Sullivan.

624
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,880
I'll be helping you in my own way.

625
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,380
You gotta do this quest on your own, or at least without me for now.

626
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,380
Okay. Alright.

627
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
Okay. Okay.

628
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:20,380
Giancarlo? You really think I can do this?

629
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,380
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

630
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,380
Th-thanks.

631
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
Dat dat dat.

632
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,380
Well, goodnight Giancarlo.

633
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,380
Wait, Sullivan!

634
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,380
What?

635
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:38,380
Nothing.

636
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,380
Okay...

637
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,380
Good night, Sullivan.

638
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,380
(music)

639
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:54,380
(music)

640
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:58,380
(music)

641
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,380
(music)

642
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,380
Now that we got all that dumb lore out of the way

643
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Caleb stopped his chit chatting. The boys can move on with

644
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,380
the story. Just not the way that they thought.

645
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,380
What, uh...

646
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,380
What, uh...

647
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,380
What...

648
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,380
What...

649
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:24,380
What do you mean?

650
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:29,380
Oh, young Thomas!

651
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
Heh, heh, heh!

652
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,380
Your curious mind will be your downfall.

653
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:39,380
Meanwhile, back in Gun City...

654
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:44,380
*sad music*

655
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,380
*yawn*

656
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:48,380
Wow, another normal dream.

657
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,380
I love the big house I live in, my girl boss mom and my male feminist stepdad.

658
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,380
Better get ready for school.

659
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:58,380
Someone can now move me around using the directional buttons.

660
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,380
Oh, it's one of these things.

661
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,380
Can I play now, pe-

662
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,380
I didn't die, it's just a new character.

663
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,380
Maybe Cam should play as Belinda, because she's a girl.

664
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,380
BOOM!

665
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:19,360
But no you're not playing. Fine. Speaking of girls, how's Juna?

666
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,360
She's uh...

667
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,160
She's good.

668
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,160
She's good. That's nice.

669
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:33,680
Sounded like a pretty serious conversation you guys are having. I guess. Who cares? Just game.

670
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:42,120
Hey, honey up bright and early as always hey stepdad sure am you want some of these notorious

671
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,840
RBG pancakes I made they're shaped like her head

672
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,660
Sounds delicious, but no thanks stepdad. I'm all right. Hey more for me

673
00:36:50,660 --> 00:37:02,360
Sullivan lives on Lane Street

674
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:09,880
He's also wanted for the murder of five Jollibee officers evading arrest and kidnapping more details on that as they arise

675
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,280
Something wrong, honey. You know you can tell me anything no stepdad. It's nothing you got it kiddo

676
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm gonna get a move on but I'll see you tonight

677
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:26,440
Okay, have a great day, honey. Oh and for dinner tonight. I'm making Louis CK burgers so save some room for that

678
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:38,560
Hey Belinda, it's me your friend Rachel.

679
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,600
Did you see what happened last night?

680
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,280
The explosion on Lane Street?

681
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,960
Yeah, pretty exciting, huh?

682
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
I guess.

683
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
Usually the precog division stops that kind of thing before it can happen.

684
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,760
Well, time for class.

685
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,600
See you later Belinda.

686
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,000
Bye.

687
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
[music]

688
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,000
Time for attendance, as always, going by first name, starting with B, then jumping to S,

689
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
then proceeding as normal. Belinda Croaks?

690
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,000
Here.

691
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Bullyfrog the Toad?

692
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,000
[toad sound]

693
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
[laughing]

694
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Duh!

695
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
Wonderful. Sabrina?

696
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Here.

697
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,000
Sasha?

698
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Present.

699
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Sally?

700
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Here.

701
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Other Sasha?

702
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Present.

703
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
Hmm, I don't see Sullivan in his seat.

704
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Saxophone?

705
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,000
You know how I roll, bitch.

706
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,000
[laughs] Saxophone.

707
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Sullivan?

708
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Sullivan the frog?

709
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
He probably got scared because yesterday I beat him up so bad.

710
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
Bully frog, everyone knows what actually happened.

711
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,000
No!

712
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,000
Well, no Sullivan. Hmm. That's his first ever absence.

713
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:42,000
That's right. Sullivan is never absent.

714
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Something seems fishy.

715
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,000
So, what'd you guys talk about?

716
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
Uh, who?

717
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
You and Juna?

718
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,500
Uh, not much, just about your mom, mostly.

719
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,500
YOOOOOOHOOOOOO!

720
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:02,000
Hm, that's funny. You guys never talk about my mom.

721
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,500
Yeah, I was joking, you fucking idiot.

722
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:08,000
So, what'd you talk about?

723
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I don't know, just, whatever. Can we focus on the game, please?

724
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Thank you.

725
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Well, class, today we're going to learn about Gunn City's geology.

726
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,000
There's all manner of substrate throughout E-Bomb,

727
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,280
But the Gun City landmass once had the richest deposit of ore on the whole planet.

728
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:28,960
Some say the ore would gleam in the night if you looked at it, have all manner of colours

729
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:33,940
(hot wash, my opinion) but nevertheless, impressive still.

730
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:39,620
That was until hundreds of years ago Twiggy Hancock, famed mining tycoon, nearly drained

731
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:43,440
the continent of all of its ore to the point that the board had to step in, which they

732
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,120
hate to do.

733
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,120
Perhaps an inevitability though, after all.

734
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,120
Ore can't last forever, can it?

735
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,120
Heh heh.

736
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,120
Well, that's it for today.

737
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
Don't forget to take your knowledge pill before you head home.

738
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,120
Now, all of you, get out.

739
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,120
GET OUT!

740
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:02,120
Bye, Belinda. See you tomorrow.

741
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,120
Bye.

742
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,120
I know I told Dad I'd head back for dinner,

743
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,120
but I have to check on Sullivan.

744
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:15,120
Fast Travel to Lame Street

745
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:20,120
Well, I'm on Lame Street.

746
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,440
Wonder what happened to Sullivan.

747
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,480
I hope he's alright.

748
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,480
My little hackers and Vestigoggles can see hidden clues that will help me here.

749
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,520
All I have to do is press Y and I can toggle on sleuth mode.

750
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,600
Great.

751
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,120
Now let's get looking.

752
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,760
Weird.

753
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,760
Weird, the officers here don't appear to be regular Jollibee officers.

754
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,760
What's this? Sullivan's homework? Why is it in the street?

755
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,760
Should I talk to these officers?

756
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
Maybe I should find another way.

757
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,760
Why don't we talk to them?

758
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:01,760
No, they're obviously setting this up so that we fight them if we do. There's probably another clue.

759
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,760
So we're afraid of a little honest conversation with some lovely officers of the law?

760
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:13,500
With people we'd maybe consider friends close friends even who wouldn't lie to us. What are you implying?

761
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,840
Okay, I'll just talk to them

762
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:23,920
Excuse me officers. I'm looking for my friend Sullivan. I think he lives on the street young lady

763
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,280
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave the premises, but sir you want to fight. I'm not a real cop

764
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,960
I will fucking ruin your life. You're not supposed to say that me. I don't give a fuck

765
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:37,560
I'm done being kept in the dark waiting on the boards every command. I'm gonna kill this kid right now

766
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,080
All right, you asked for it

767
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:53,760
Looks like a stun gun isn't going to cut it. How am I gonna take this guy down?

768
00:41:53,760 --> 00:42:00,820
I know I can identify his weak spot with my little hacker scanner, and then I can target for extra damage

769
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
It'll only take a turn.

770
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
Analyzing enemy.

771
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Enemy's weak spot is left leg.

772
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,960
Injured three days ago trying to close refrigerator with hip.

773
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,960
Slipping on Reader's Digest left on the ground.

774
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,960
Perfect.

775
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:17,960
Ooooooh, my left leg!

776
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,960
Don't mess with a Lil Hacker.

777
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,960
Level up!

778
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:31,960
Yeah!

779
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Now, tell me, does Sullivan the Frog live here?

780
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,960
We were told he was speeding away on the bike with the ex-board operative John Carlo the Frog!

781
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,960
Oh no! Sullivan! I gotta find him!

782
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:00,960
Sorry, Stepdad. Those Louis C.K. burgers will have to wait.

783
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:04,960
I have to find my friend, even if it means leaving the city.

784
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:11,960
Hey, should we do something about that creepy kid standing over there?

785
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,960
The one who's been following that girl?

786
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
I don't care!

787
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,540
So, Sullivan was kidnapped. Can't exact my revenge if he's dead.

788
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:27,760
I'll get you Belinda, and once you lead me to Sullivan, I'll get you both.

789
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:30,600
You'll never embarrass me again!

790
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Bullyfrog the Toad.

791
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,240
My name is the Nightmare Assassin.

792
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,400
God damn.

793
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,320
His name is dumb.

794
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,140
Like that's got to be like a translation thing from the original Japanese, right?

795
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
Wait...Cam?

796
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,140
Why don't you ask Caleb?

797
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:52,140
Uh...Caleb, what do you think?

798
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:54,140
I don't know, I don't know.

799
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:57,140
Maybe you should call Juna, maybe she knows.

800
00:43:57,140 --> 00:44:00,140
Okay man, seriously, what's got your goose?

801
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
You got my goose!

802
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:06,140
If you want to exact your revenge, you can be of some assistance.

803
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Come with me.

804
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:12,140
Rock and roll, Nightmare Assassin.

805
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:37,420
And now the boys will return to our protagonist at his pond, as their quarrel in real life

806
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
continues to heat up.

807
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,420
*yawns*

808
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,420
*yawns*

809
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,420
*yawns*

810
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,420
I'm starting to get

811
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:49,420
real uh...

812
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:51,420
what's the word?

813
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:53,420
*snaps fingers*

814
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,420
*snaps fingers*

815
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,420
sleepy again.

816
00:44:57,420 --> 00:44:59,420
Well, pry open your

817
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,420
peepers kid, I poured a

818
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,420
cup of mud just for this

819
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:05,420
*laughs*

820
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:11,660
Before I open your peepers kid, I poured a cup of hot scalded mud just for this occasion.

821
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:12,660
*Inhales*

822
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:18,380
*Groans*

823
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,380
Great.

824
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:28,740
*Music*

825
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,740
Well, I guess I'm off.

826
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,540
I'm sure I'm gonna miss this pond, Elder Ribbit.

827
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:38,140
It's been wonderful here, and I hope to be back soon.

828
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:41,240
I hope you are as well, Mr. Sullivan.

829
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,840
Farewell, and may it no longer guide you.

830
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,340
And you as well.

831
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:53,140
Thanks for saving me, Giancarlo, and helping me and all that.

832
00:45:53,140 --> 00:46:00,140
I know you can't come with, but it means a lot that you're looking out for me and my mom.

833
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,340
Don't mention it, kid. What are cousins for?

834
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:10,340
Right. Just go collect those shots. I will. I'm off to the Crave Cave. Goodbye everyone.

835
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:20,340
Goodbye to the pond. Hello to adventure. Bye Solo Man. See you later. Bye Solo Man. Do

836
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:29,340
it Solo Man. Bye Solo Man. Alright. Back in the world map. Whew. It got kind of heavy

837
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:36,340
in there. Been long. Guess I better equip my new gear. And check my map just to see where

838
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:45,100
to go. Great! Alright. Let's get going. Here we- oh. God damn it! Every three steps it's

839
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:56,980
a- alright. Well I guess this is a good opportunity to try my new Nightbringer Blast ability.

840
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:04,340
Wow, that's cool!

841
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:07,380
Can't wait to try it on even more enemies!

842
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:15,340
Dude, stop being a pussy.

843
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:16,340
Just say what you're thinking.

844
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,420
Why don't you just be honest with me and Pete?

845
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,420
I don't care.

846
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,420
Well you should!

847
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,860
Why should he when there's nothing to care about?

848
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:23,380
So you admit you care about nothing.

849
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,660
Okay, guys, that's enough.

850
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:25,660
We're in the cave now!

851
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:33,380
Oh man, this place is scary.

852
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:36,380
It doesn't look anything like it does in DeGroenweesburg.

853
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,860
I didn't know it would be this dark.

854
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,860
What happened to all the colors?

855
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:45,620
Reflecting light and gleaming from the ore.

856
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:48,620
I guess all the ore is gone.

857
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:55,620
I should have stocked up on more items before I left.

858
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:56,620
Hey!

859
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,620
Ah!

860
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,620
Why are you yelling?

861
00:47:58,620 --> 00:47:59,620
You scared me!

862
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,620
Yeah, well, that's because I'm always sneaking around.

863
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:04,620
You know, you could have really damaged my ears.

864
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,620
I'm sorry.

865
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,620
Ah, don't worry about it.

866
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:11,620
Actually, well, back in school, the recruiters, they were scouting me to join in the special

867
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,620
forces because there were these neighbor kids and they always threw firecrackers at me.

868
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:19,620
and they were really impressed at how good I was at hearing them

869
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,620
and so I could take damage from extreme sounds

870
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:26,620
A guy like you probably couldn't hurt me anyways, no offense

871
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,620
Wait, you're not a girl, right?

872
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:29,620
No

873
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,620
Okay, good, cause girls are actually way worse

874
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,620
because if there's crap like Justin Bieber or the Kardashians

875
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,620
they can screech so loud

876
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,620
Alright

877
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,620
Huh?

878
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,620
Oh, okay, I...

879
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:46,620
No, you go ahead.

880
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,620
I'm Johnny Tench.

881
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:49,620
I'm Sullivan.

882
00:48:49,620 --> 00:48:50,620
Okay.

883
00:48:50,620 --> 00:48:54,620
So, are you gonna buy anything?

884
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,620
What?

885
00:48:55,620 --> 00:49:01,620
Basically, I have to sell a bunch of crap all over the world in order to earn enough money to buy a sweet guitar

886
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:05,620
because my old one broke because I'm always getting beat up at school.

887
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:09,620
Or maybe I can get my mom to sell me something nice for her birthday.

888
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:10,620
Oh.

889
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:11,620
Yeah.

890
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:15,120
Look, if you're not interested, I don't really care.

891
00:49:15,120 --> 00:49:17,920
There's like a thousand goblins who come here and buy crap for me,

892
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,920
so you can just keep walking if you're too poor.

893
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,920
It doesn't really matter.

894
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,920
No, no, I do. I actually, I would love to buy some stuff from you.

895
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:23,920
Wait, really?

896
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,920
Okay, just be quick about it.

897
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,420
Sorry if I'm being rude.

898
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,920
Uh, it's okay.

899
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:34,920
I'd like to have three health potions.

900
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:38,920
Okay, yeah, that's uh, 150 tokens, please.

901
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,920
Great.

902
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Um, would you by any chance want to buy some monster bones?

903
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:51,920
Yeah, sure! I'll buy those for 17 tokens a piece.

904
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:53,920
Wow, great!

905
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,920
Yeah, they're not for me though, because there's a lot of goblins in here who always try and buy bones off me.

906
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,920
They do all kinds of weird crap with them.

907
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:03,920
Oh. Okay.

908
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:07,920
Yeah, basically they work for this weird guy who lives down here.

909
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,920
They call him Twiggy Hancock. He's like some kind of tycoon or something.

910
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,920
Twiggy Hancock still alive?

911
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:13,920
Hmm...

912
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:18,920
They wanted to make me a tycoon but I said no because I gotta sell my wares.

913
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,920
Anyways, are you done?

914
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:21,920
Uh, yes.

915
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,920
Thanks Johnny.

916
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:26,920
I hope to see you in other odd places so I can buy some stuff in a pinch.

917
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,920
Okay.

918
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:28,920
Bye Sullivan!

919
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:29,920
Bye.

920
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:31,920
Okay, I'm gonna sneak away now so don't whine.

921
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:32,920
I'm not looking.

922
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:37,920
Okay, good because I've actually been betrayed a lot of times,

923
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,920
Especially back at school when I was betrayed by my band because they thought that I was gonna be...

924
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:48,920
Well, they knew I was gonna be the front man and they hated me because I was now rocked on too hard so they betrayed me and...

925
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:53,920
Great. Now I got some potions.

926
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,920
This cave won't be so scary any longer.

927
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:59,920
Hopefully there are fewer random battles in here than in the overworld.

928
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:03,920
*sigh*

929
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,120
Well, this guy looks tough. Better use my frog arts.

930
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:14,320
Oh man, that didn't seem to go so well.

931
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,920
How do I beat this guy?

932
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,520
I said, how do I beat this guy?

933
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:27,320
This guy is clearly resistant to Sullivan's regular frog arts, yet he's the Lightbringer one we got earlier.

934
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,720
Okay, that's it.

935
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,920
Oh, come on, man, it's just a joke.

936
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:33,720
You know how much I love figuring out monsters' weaknesses, and you know that I'm sensitive

937
00:51:33,720 --> 00:51:37,480
Specifically to people making fun of me for knowing the weaknesses of monsters.

938
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,240
Especially in caves!

939
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:42,200
Uh, news to me, I thought you just hated phone calls.

940
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,400
I am going to attack.

941
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,560
I would love to see you try to attack me.

942
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:46,920
Which one should I pick?

943
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:49,240
Goddammit, Pat, there's only one other one!

944
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:52,520
It says "Lightfinger Blast, good against monsters who favor the dark."

945
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,720
We're in a cave!

946
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,120
Either start thinking or let me play!

947
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,320
I mean, Pete!

948
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:57,880
Come on!

949
00:51:57,880 --> 00:52:01,240
Jeez, man, take it easy.

950
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,760
Yeah, take it easy, Ken.

951
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:05,160
Never! Not when my friends betray me!

952
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,280
Oh my god!

953
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:11,080
And then the next battle was with 10 slime things and that took 10 minutes cause, well,

954
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,440
you don't kill one of the slime things after a certain number of turns, it becomes like

955
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:20,200
two slime things and it's like a whole thing, whole reveal and they didn't buy any antidotes either so

956
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,960
it's all of them was taken poison damage.

957
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,480
Yeah, why is uh, Cam so mad at Caleb?

958
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,160
Oh well I uh, I'm not sure young Tommy Bahama.

959
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,880
Seems there's some gentlemanly dispute going on.

960
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,840
Hard to tell, but perhaps if we read more of the story...

961
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:38,500
Well, I mean, yeah, but that stuff just, you know, it seems all so...

962
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,580
petty.

963
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,080
Especially compared to my...

964
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,040
you know...

965
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,520
my deadly...

966
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,320
terminal illness...

967
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:48,080
and the forces trying to turn me deviant.

968
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:48,580
Yeah.

969
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,820
He's right.

970
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:50,920
Can you guys make up already?

971
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,620
Well, I didn't do anything except to take a call from my wife, Juna.

972
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:57,000
I know that wasn't Juna, okay? That was Price.

973
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,280
I know something's going on.

974
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,720
Nothing is going on!

975
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,240
Here, look at my call history.

976
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,840
You can edit that, I'm not stupid.

977
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:03,840
Yes you are stupid!

978
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,640
Perhaps it is, my little baby Thomas.

979
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:09,240
But, maybe we don't know the full story yet.

980
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:12,040
Perhaps Caleb betrayed Cameron in some way.

981
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,840
One which we don't yet understand.

982
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:17,640
So you think I'd just start some solo career and not tell you guys

983
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,240
that I'd abandoned us at the height of our podcast?

984
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,440
I didn't before, but now I'm not really so sure, man.

985
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,040
You are fucking loco.

986
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,440
Yeah? Then pinky swear?

987
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,240
Absolutely not.

988
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:31,740
Pinky swear right now, pinky swear on Patch's grave

989
00:53:31,740 --> 00:53:32,240
What?

990
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,240
That you wouldn't betray us

991
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,740
How dare you

992
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:39,740
Why don't they, uh, just talk it out, you know

993
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:42,740
Just grab a... coffee or...

994
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,960
Lot lot lot a because people are

995
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,920
Cheap and steamy

996
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,800
So they need to be controlled

997
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:59,440
Because they will otherwise resort to their base instance. All right, that's enough Caleb

998
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,200
pinky swear right now

999
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,780
Do it. I don't want to do it now

1000
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:09,920
Fine cam

1001
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,440
Cam okay

1002
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,560
I'm sorry

1003
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:17,360
It's okay

1004
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,200
Sorry, too

1005
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,160
All right, are we good?

1006
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,880
Yep

1007
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,980
Yeah, that's more like it

1008
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:28,360
All right

1009
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,720
So is that

1010
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:38,040
Then what happened well, this is it the end of the cave

1011
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:45,080
Southerman's quest, it's glowing. Maybe the shard is near.

1012
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,840
The shard is near, frog.

1013
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,600
Twiggy, Hancock.

1014
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,600
The one and the same.

1015
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:57,400
Hand over the amber shard. You don't understand its power.

1016
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,800
That's rich, almost as rich as me. I know exactly where the shard is. It's been mine for hundreds

1017
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:10,240
of years. It keeps me alive, sustains my hunger for ore. It's my tool for conquest. My maze

1018
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,480
of achieving all this wealth and power in the world.

1019
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,480
And you?

1020
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:18,480
You're just a insignificant little frog who gets lost on his way to Lillipad.

1021
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:19,480
You hoppity scum.

1022
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:20,480
Hey!

1023
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:21,480
That's a frog slur!

1024
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:22,480
Yeah, so what?

1025
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:23,480
Goblins, attack!

1026
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:24,480
The shard is mine for all that!

1027
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,480
Ah!

1028
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,480
That hurt!

1029
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,480
Go my goblins!

1030
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:28,480
Attack!

1031
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:34,480
The shard is mine for all this!

1032
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:35,480
Ah!

1033
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:36,480
That hurt!

1034
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,480
Go my goblins!

1035
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:38,480
Attack!

1036
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,480
Here I go!

1037
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Hi-ya!

1038
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:41,480
Darn, he's tough!

1039
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:42,480
Oh-ra-gobby!

1040
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:43,480
Ah!

1041
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,480
He's folding me up!

1042
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,480
Oh no, my speed fell!

1043
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,480
Goblins, go!

1044
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,480
No, they get to attack again now!

1045
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:54,480
Ah! He's folding me up! Oh no, my speed fell!

1046
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,480
Goblins, go!

1047
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,480
No, they get to attack again now!

1048
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,480
Ah! Oh no, I'm in trouble!

1049
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,480
Man, how do I win? I fucking hate this guy!

1050
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:09,480
Pete, please let me play. Please!

1051
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:12,480
No dude, only when I die! Those are the rules!

1052
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:15,480
Hey, come on man, you're being a total blockhead!

1053
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,140
Just let cam play. All right fine

1054
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:23,840
Thanks, buddy. Don't mention it. Okay. So first Sullivan needs to take a potion

1055
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:28,620
Then we have to use the multi attack to take out both goblins at once

1056
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:32,920
They're not that strong. So it should take them down in one hit plus will chip away at Twiggy

1057
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:39,760
Easy now, he'll probably use a turn to summon more goblins rather than do his full attack

1058
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,760
It might bring a blast!

1059
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:48,760
Ah! Damn you!

1060
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,760
That's it! Here, Bashard! I command you!

1061
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
Uh oh!

1062
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,760
With the power of the shard, I shall continue to drain all the orm from this world.

1063
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:04,760
And with my goblin army, I'll be unstoppable!

1064
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,760
CRAAAAAA-

1065
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:07,760
He looks like shit.

1066
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,760
In the second phase, they always do.

1067
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,760
Now, try this!

1068
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:18,760
I am Twinkie Hancock, master of all, lord of the minds!

1069
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:19,760
I am God!

1070
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:29,760
No you're not, you're just a failed businessman who's in way over his head.

1071
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
Melinda, what are you doing here?

1072
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,760
What do you think?

1073
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,760
I'm saving your behind.

1074
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Thanks Melinda.

1075
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:35,760
Oh my god, shut up!

1076
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:36,760
Shut up!

1077
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:37,760
His armor's really tough.

1078
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,760
Shut up! Shut up!

1079
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:42,760
His armor's really tough. I'm having a lot of trouble breaking through it.

1080
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:46,760
You can't just fight hard, Sullivan. You gotta fight smart, too.

1081
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:49,760
That's what my dad always said. I'll scan this joker.

1082
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,760
Analyzing enemy.

1083
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,760
Weak spot can be found in his sternum from poor goblin craftsmanship.

1084
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:58,760
If hit hard enough, could make him disassemble.

1085
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,760
Now we're talking. Hi-ya!

1086
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,760
Oh! That hurt! Take this!

1087
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,760
Ow! Belinda!

1088
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,760
Tch, he is tough.

1089
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:11,760
Belinda, wait! Close your eyes.

1090
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,760
Imagine your happy place.

1091
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,760
We don't have time for that, Sullivan.

1092
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:20,760
No, trust me. Close your eyes and picture a pond or a big breakfast or a...

1093
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,760
Pushing someone out a window and watching them hit the pavement.

1094
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:25,760
What?

1095
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,760
[Growling]

1096
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:30,760
What was that? I just shot some kind of magic out of my eyes.

1097
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,760
That's your frog eye. You're an eye caster.

1098
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,760
Wow, so awesome!

1099
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,760
Now to finish him off.

1100
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,760
Buster mop, go!

1101
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,760
Ooh, hell yeah!

1102
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,760
Let's go!

1103
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,760
No, no!

1104
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,760
We did it!

1105
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,760
I just wanted to suck up all of you in the world.

1106
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,760
And become a huge guy made of metal.

1107
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:56,760
Or something. Or be super rich with the metal.

1108
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,760
Oh, come on man. I don't know.

1109
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,760
Oh no!

1110
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:24,720
Thanks for coming to my rescue again.

1111
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:31,560
It's no problem Sullivan, but what are you doing out here and what was that I just did?

1112
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:35,120
I promise I'll explain everything, but first I need to take that shard.

1113
00:59:35,120 --> 00:59:41,280
Woah, Sullivan, you're peeing your pants.

1114
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,520
I don't know why that keeps happening.

1115
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:45,880
Huh, the dream world again.

1116
00:59:45,880 --> 00:59:49,760
This is your power, Sullivan.

1117
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,400
Your quest.

1118
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,840
The organism demands it.

1119
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:57,520
New frog are unlocked.

1120
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:04,000
Sullivan, look!

1121
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,000
The cave!

1122
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,000
Wow!

1123
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:07,000
It's restored!

1124
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:10,000
The ore, it's returned!

1125
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:13,840
It's so beautiful, all the colors!

1126
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,320
Sullivan, what is going on?

1127
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:19,120
Yes, Sullivan's quest has more in it!

1128
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:25,520
In here, there is enough ore to sustain a small city alone.

1129
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:29,800
Once more as I chip away at it and then apply heat, they all grow again.

1130
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,360
Like a magical plant or something.

1131
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:34,600
Imagine what we could do with this.

1132
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:37,600
We could build galaxies for people to live in.

1133
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:40,680
Wow, I can't believe it.

1134
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,800
Sullivan, I did come all the way out here to save you.

1135
01:00:43,800 --> 01:00:44,960
Ok, ok, I'll explain.

1136
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,680
Sullivan explains it to her.

1137
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:47,680
Whoa.

1138
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:50,160
Yeah, I know.

1139
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:53,040
So do you have to do this alone?

1140
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,040
I don't think so.

1141
01:00:54,040 --> 01:01:02,040
I mean, the grown weed didn't. He had his companions, Belandella and the other guy, Rapard or whatever.

1142
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:05,040
Well then, why don't I join you?

1143
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:08,040
Really? You really mean that?

1144
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,040
Yeah, why not? Is there anything better than going on an adventure?

1145
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,040
No, you know what, there sure isn't.

1146
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:19,040
That's right. So where are we headed next?

1147
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:22,040
Well, according to Sullivan's quest, next we're headed to...

1148
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:24,760
Follow them, and be sure to move quietly.

1149
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,080
Obviously!

1150
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:28,520
Who the fuck do you think I am?

1151
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,880
I'm Bully Frog the Bad Guy!

1152
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:43,240
Now that was a doozy.

1153
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,820
Well,

1154
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:48,160
I'm glad we resolved the underlying issue between you two,

1155
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,120
and won't have to deal with anything like that again.

1156
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:55,120
Yeah. Same.

1157
01:01:55,120 --> 01:02:01,120
Anyway, I'm gonna go lie down and look at my hands.

1158
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:03,120
But, let's play again soon?

1159
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,120
Definitely.

1160
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,120
Of course.

1161
01:02:05,120 --> 01:02:07,120
Alright, see you guys.

1162
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:13,120
Later, Caleb. Sorry for not trusting you.

1163
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:17,120
It's okay, man. It happens. Take it easy.

1164
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:23,320
What would Patches do?

1165
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,320
Were he alive?

1166
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:28,200
Hey Caleb, I'm back in your apartment.

1167
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,360
I'm here to kill you.

1168
01:02:30,360 --> 01:02:31,360
Me too.

1169
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,360
GET OUT!

1170
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,360
Okay, bye.

1171
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,360
Alright, that was pretty good.

1172
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:43,600
I liked it when they killed the bad guy.

1173
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:46,040
Was pretty cool, huh?

1174
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:51,800
I hope those podcasters find a way to get along.

1175
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,880
Oh my sweet little Thomas.

1176
01:02:53,880 --> 01:03:01,400
The thing about Westerners is that they have no sense of community, no sense of family to

1177
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,400
one another.

1178
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:05,520
I wouldn't hold out too much hope for that.

1179
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:06,880
Oh, okay.

1180
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:09,640
Well, would you look at the time.

1181
01:03:09,640 --> 01:03:10,640
Quite late.

1182
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:13,440
You should get to bed my little, little Thomas Begg.

1183
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,120
You're gonna need it if you're gonna combat that illness you got.

1184
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,120
Sounds right.

1185
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:27,400
Will you read me, podcasters playing video games tomorrow too, Uncle Jake?

1186
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,840
I feel like my mind is growing stronger and...

1187
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:33,840
Cool...

1188
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:34,840
Kinder.

1189
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,840
Of course, man.

1190
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:42,840
Oh, God, keep kinder.

1191
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,840
Of course, my little sweet nephew.

1192
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,840
Get some sleep now, okay?

1193
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:49,840
Alright.

1194
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,840
Good night.

1195
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,840
Good night.

1196
01:03:53,840 --> 01:04:01,840
[laughing]

1197
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:05,840
Another chapter in the bag and I'm fucking hooting and hollering.

1198
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:08,840
And then I remember I gotta log my hours for the day in the Gijon Wii computer.

1199
01:04:08,840 --> 01:04:14,840
I tab over for "artist" and then "podcaster/novelist", put in 15 hours, and promptly fall asleep.

1200
01:04:14,840 --> 01:04:16,840
It doesn't matter how many hours I put in, really.

1201
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,840
I wake up 45 minutes later, though, because of that hard thing I've been ignoring, and I feel completely recharged.

1202
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:23,840
Ready to record another one.

1203
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:26,840
But before I could even do that, my phone started ringing again.

1204
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:33,840
I start freaking out, it's like, "It's my wife, it's my wife, it's my wife, it's finally, it's finally the day, it's finally the day she's gonna...

1205
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,840
He was gonna leave me, but...

1206
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:38,840
It was so much worse.

1207
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,840
It was Caleb.

1208
01:04:41,840 --> 01:05:10,840
[Music]

1209
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:24,840
Hey honey, it's your stepdad. Your mother and I were wondering where you were. Just give me an update when you can, cause I trust you. Girl power. Ha! Pussy grabs back.

1210
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:31,440
Oh, also, I read more about Louis C.K. I don't know if he's such a great male feminist.

1211
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:37,840
