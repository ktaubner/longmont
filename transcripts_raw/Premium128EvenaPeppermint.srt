we are back logging all this

26
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,120
we could say anything can happen in the next couple weeks

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:03,280
we could say like we know it's the other way around that we say something that

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,960
will have already have a that some things are going to happen

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,680
well no that would only be good if we were that we're doing it now that in the

30
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:13,440
opposite any episode we say something's going to have this is this is the only

31
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,480
episode we can't say that because it will already have happened by the time

32
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:19,240
d_c_

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,200

34
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,400
What? Yeah.

35
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:29,200
You look really confused.

36
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,900
So it's like okay imagine today. Imagine today is April. I'm going to eat a grape

37
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,600
on

38
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,000
August or no.

39
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,800
I mean you can still say that.

40
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,700
No. Trying to predict.

41
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,500
I'm going to eat a grape. No, wait. No.

42
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,600
You could make that come true. I mean we could say we're going to do anything

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,100
and then do it. On

44
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,760
- But that's the thing, April--

45
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,080
- It won't have been already happened,

46
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,920
it won't be your turn.

47
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,640
- On April 20th, I'm gonna smoke some weed.

48
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,880
That's my prediction.

49
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,720
- No you won't.

50
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,520
- Damn, that's coming up.

51
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,520

- April 26th?

54
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,020
- You're gonna smoke some weed?

55
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:10,860
- A week and a day.

56
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,680
- Holy fucking shit.

57
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,760
- On April 26th, I might have to pay a bill.

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,380
- Wait, when does this come out?

59
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:16,220
Hold on.

60
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,880
- Wait, so April 20th, what you're gonna say--

106
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:32,160
Mr. Mime. Smoke types. That's who you see. You see Mr. Mime if you smoke too much

107
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,040
weed. Yeah. You see that guy he's like you know that one guy who thinks he's

108
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,080
trapped in a box he smokes one joint. If you smoke if you smoke weed that was in

109
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,240
when your your your your high school dealers back pocket that he sat on all

110
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,600
day while he was feeling his mass,

111
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,040
has a on the you smoke it. That's when you see Mr. My yeah, I found weed on

112
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,560
the ground at a skate park one time and I brought it home and I smoked it and

113
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,600
my eye immediately got itchy. That was dirt and I learned later that if we

114
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,680
looks like it has crystals in it or something that means that it's like

115
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:13,180
moldy. So I smoked moldy weed. We used to smoke so much K2 and we never even, we

116
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:20,220
didn't even know. And the reason why was because it was all like pre-ground.

117
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,220
Like it was not real weed. It was like pieces of paper with K2 on them. And the

118
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,140
guy would just sell it to us in a giant Ziploc bag. And it'd be like $10 for like

119
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:34,260
a pound of it. It was awesome. It was great weed. I never like knew, I would

120
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,380
like to me it's just like oh this it's weed I didn't know there could be

121
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,700
different types of it or it could be bad or good yeah whatever I would just buy

122
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,940
I buy from my friend who got it from his friend who got it from his friend who

123
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:48,060
got it from his uncle or something yeah yeah I accidentally smoked K I have a

124
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,900
picture of me on it high on K2 because I got scared and I sent my brother a

125
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:58,940
picture of me I was like 15 I'm looking at the camera like we need to do we need

126
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,220
to smoke salvia that's what we need to do yeah 420 special okay I go

127
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:08,020
They have Delta 8 at the bodega.

128
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,620
Everything's the same.

129
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,620
Everything's completely normal.

130
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,180
Except everyone hears a fish.

131
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,340
What if you smoked salvia and now this is a bit of a high thought so bear with me.

132
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,900
Smoke salvia, nothing changes.

133
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,540
You live out your whole life.

134
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,460
You're on your deathbed, you're holding your wife's hand, you're holding all your children's

135
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,460
hands.

136
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,460
You have a hundred children.

137
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
You die.

138
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,460
The trip ends.

139
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:28,460
That's happened to me.

140
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,060
Then you're back to where you were starting.

141
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,380
That does happen in salvia.

142
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:36,520
Yeah, what I know, but it's like a high thought, so it's like crazy. Oh my God

143
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:39,740
isn't your only high for like five minutes. I mean, I think that for like

144
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,760
ninety seconds that happens in salvia, but in if you would also be like a

145
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:49,880
wooden barrel or something well, I remember re shafir smoke salvia on a on

146
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:54,340
a podcast one time and there's a video of it and he smokes like and then he

147
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,020
smokes it just falls asleep and he wakes up. He's like put me back put me

148
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:02,740
back and apparently he lived a lifetime as a fish. Wow that's what I'm saying you

149
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,780
live a lifetime, but you live a lifetime as like a g mod prop hunt

150
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:15,020
exactly just like like smoothly sliding along the ground as like like a tv

151
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:19,700
cabinet yeah yeah just try not to be caught by your friends. I feel like yeah

152
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,020
if you did this, I mean obviously I would probably change your brain forever

153
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,400
in a lot of ways, but if you do salvia and you become a tv cabinet or whatever

154
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,540
go home you look at your TV cabinet you feel like I feel like you just have an

155
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:32,300
understand you probably gonna make love to it did probably I would probably have

156
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:36,220
to get rid of it I probably would not want to look at that dude if I I don't

157
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,580
know I would hate to become my penis then I don't think I could smoke it's a

158
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:46,220
salvia I don't think that I could smoke poison I think I could smoke salvia

159
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:51,380
anthrax no I would come to like you know I would like come to like I would come

160
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,220
- You can't jump to it.

161
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,060
- Outside.

162
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,460
- You don't move, you can't, no you wouldn't.

163
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,300
- You can't move?

164
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,120
- I mean you can but you--

165
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,440
- Well you can jump out a window but you can't go outside.

166
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,980
- It seems like you have like one good burst of energy

167
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,420
in you when you are on Salvia.

168
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,900
'Cause you don't hear, nobody's like going crazy

169
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,700
and like killing people on Salvia.

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,540
- I would.

171
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,360
- Because you just have to--

172
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,200
- You know my ass.

173
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,620
- You're really confused and you get one big,

174
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:12,820
you can either do a jump, a leap, or a back flip.

175
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,020
And then otherwise I think you're pretty stationary.

176
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,080
- I could do a back flip.

177
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,060
- You could not do a back flip.

178
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:19,700
I think I could do a flag round back flip.

179
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:24,000
I think I could. I don't think either of you could. I think I could do one. I think for

180
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,780
me it's all just a mental thing. Pat's getting up, he's going to try and do it. He fell on

181
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:34,280
the ground. He didn't even fall. He couldn't even fall. He fake fell. I got scared halfway

182
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,380
through. That's what I think. I think anyone can do a backflip. I think it's all just fear.

183
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:44,660
If you only use 10% of your back. Imagine if you could use 100% of your back. I'd probably

184
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:48,260
be what I probably be like at least six feet tall. Probably be the hunchback of Notre

185
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,140
Dame. No. I thought with this guy this guy had a big back so we're supposed to be

186
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,140
terrified of this guy and he's a scary monster just because he's different from

187
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:00,220
us. Yeah. I don't think you're supposed to be scared of him. I think you're supposed

188
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,460
to want to fuck him. You see him and you're supposed to vomit and scream because of how disgusting he looks.

189
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,540
You're supposed to want to fuck that guy. And it's just because he's different slightly different.

190
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,820
It's just because he has a disgusting protruding spine. His grandma was the hunchback of Notre Dame.

191
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,900
My grandma did. Don't say that about Katherine. You were saying it. No, she had, I didn't say

192
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,220
she was the hunchback. I said she had a hunchback, okay? And I used to ask her if I could-- The

193
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,020
hunchback of Caleb's life. I used to ask her if I could hit it really hard and make her

194
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:29,620
tall. And she said no. Yeah. You should be able to do that. You should be, yeah. It's

195
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:35,300
like smoothing out a carpet. Say I watch videos of a chiropractor doing that shit to people.

196
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:39,860
He's just like breaking kids' necks and shit. So funny, dude. I went to a chiropractor when

197
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,860
I went to one too.

198
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,860
That was the best I've ever felt.

199
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:43,860
I was in chiropractic.

200
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,860
Immediately after that.

201
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,580
You know that like all the time they like rupture people's arteries?

202
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,580
Yeah.

203
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
It's like constant.

204
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
Yeah.

205
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,580
So funny.

206
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,580
Oh dude, chiropracting.

207
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,580
Chiropractic.

208
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,420
It's chiropracting is not an honest profession.

209
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,500
Anybody who does anything to your body who doesn't have, it doesn't have ologist in their

210
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,020
name you have to kill them.

211
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:03,020
Definitely.

212
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
Yeah.

213
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,020
You can't let them.

214
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,020
You can't have an opologist.

215
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,020
Zoologist.

216
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,020
What?

217
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:13,440
I want to hear what you're saying about a zoologist.

218
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,820
They could give me elephant ears.

219
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:17,820
They can't give you elephants.

220
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
Have you ever looked at an elephant's teeth?

221
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,820
No.

222
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,820
I didn't even know they had teeth.

223
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,860
So elephants have their incisors or their tusks, but then in the back of their mouth

224
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,860
they have all molars.

225
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,860
I want to be inside them.

226
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,860
And you put food in their mouth.

227
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:29,860
I saw Myrtle Beach Safari, they throw a peppermint in their mouth.

228
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,860
I want to be inside them.

229
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,860
And you put food in their mouth.

230
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,860
I saw Myrtle Beach Safari, they throw a peppermint in their mouth.

231
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:33,860
I want to be inside them.

232
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
And you put food in their mouth.

233
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,860
I saw Myrtle Beach Safari, they throw a peppermint in their mouth.

234
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,860
I want to be inside them.

235
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,740
they throw a peppermint in uh... the government

236
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,580
i think i forget his name is a normal size peppermint normal size peppermint

237
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:48,520
they throw it in this elephant's mouth and then he eats it you can hear like

238
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,100
even on a peppermint

239
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,900
you know i have a permit small

240
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,780
what

241
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:59,860
elephants have to go and other food

242
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,140
even on a peppermint

243
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:07,220
it's a little story is that the elephant to the issue

244
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,020
elephants have all molars

245
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,960
that is a gap most at most herbivores have all of molars that's the point

246
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,540
given that all molars

247
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,060
yet incisors are you know they have a like nineteen sets of teeth in their

248
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,460

Bubbles.

256
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,340
What idiot would ask if an, of course an elephant has teeth.

00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,340
He didn't even chew.

264
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,340
He just swallowed it whole.

265
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,340
He did not chew at all.

266
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,780
Even a peppermint.

267
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,780
He didn't chew the peppermint!

268
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,380
It's a she.

[laughter]

276
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:45,620
In your head you were like, "Even a peppermint."

277
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,620
Even a peppermint!

278
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,620
You said it out loud.

279
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,620
Even a peppermint.

280
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,380

285
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,540
honor there yeah they're not I can tell I can tell they're not with me even a

286
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:27,780
pepper even a peppermint has to be chewed by an elephant due to its large amount of

287
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,300
molars in the back of its mouth I learned that I learned that this weekend

288
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:39,060
you learned that in fucking elephant court yeah what is that that is so for

289
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:43,700
that I feel time what is it Oh uptime white peach lemonade has other natural

290
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,100
flavors it's basically a mental physical energy drink with natural caffeine and

291
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,740
L-theanine. Let me see what that is. You think you're about to touch this? I want to look at the can.

292
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,340
Why? There's a new energy drink I don't know about I need to see. You haven't had Uptime before? No.

293
00:14:55,340 --> 00:15:00,940
It's bomb. Yeah? They put it with the health drinks instead of the energy drinks. Oh,

294
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:05,180
that means, yeah. So it's like celsius. Yeah, it's definitely, it's like...

295
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:09,180
How they put celsius, oh 142 milligrams of caffeine.

296
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:16,380
It's not intended for children. Nothing. And those sensitive to caffeine. Not intended.

297
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:21,740
pregnant or nursing women. That's what it says on all those though. Hmm. I don't know. It does.

298
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,380
I don't know. I think it says it twice on all the other ones. It would suck to be pregnant.

299
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:30,380
We're talking about pregnant. I would hate to be pregnant. Can you smoke weed if you're pregnant?

300
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:35,340
Yeah. Yeah. Do you drink alcohol? Oh, this says Angelica root extract. Your baby will be born

But he says never listen to it?

556
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,640
He tells his wife to never listen to it, the Grizzly Mans.

557
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,080

559
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,280

560
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,520
My mom showed me Grizzly Man.

561
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,800

564
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,520

569
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:37,040
The grizzly man. He picked up his phone to look it up and then he put it back.

572
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,200
rumors about the guy. He just killed people and used gas. I thought he did that

573
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,880
because he's angry about being a pedophile. He's a scarecrow. Pedophiles

574
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:57,880
are not angry about being pedophiles. They like it. They love it. Yeah. That's why it's

575
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:03,180
pedophile it's a like why don't they just stop yeah what pedophiles like how

625
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:59,300
where's my kid and then Dory says oh yeah your kid is on PP Sherman yeah Wallaby

626
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:07,900
Way kidney stone kidney stone the ocean is full of pee she says that yeah she

627
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,980
interrupts herself and realizes the ocean is full of pee I'd be pissed off I

628
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:17,120
was a fish drinking my pee all day I think they like it mm-hmm I think I was

629
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:24,020
is Dory. I mean the thing is I mean fish if it didn't fish if it doesn't like

630
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:29,480
its life kill itself really easily, but how well first of all go out of the

631
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,680
water. That's pretty simple. How the hell you get out of the water. There's a

632
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,000
hundred other fish that want to eat you. You just go to one. I mean it's not like

633
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,600
a guy who wants to kill himself in the human world. It's like you go outside

634
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,760
and there's like a there's a giant flying shark. You can walk up to you have

635
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,640
to you there is guys. Maybe these people there is a guy that killed himself with

636
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:52,500
fish who the crocodile hunter it's not a fish. The manta ray yeah, it's a ray

637
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:55,260
fish. That's an elasmo brink

638
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:06,820
yeah, it's an elasmo brink. Okay, it's basically a shark, but that's what I'm

639
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:09,860
saying like a fish. I mean it doesn't have to be a shark. A fish could go

640
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,460
literally if it's like if you're if you're if you wanted to kill yourself

641
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,920
you could cross the street and your slightly bigger neighbor if you walked

642
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,400
up to me just eat you shark got it easy to if you want to kill yourself just

643
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,320
stop swimming yep fish to probably maybe hold I hold their breath you can't hold

644
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,160
your breath of your fish dude it's all just going up in them gills in them

645
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,560
gizmo the fish I could hold my breath you think some fish be like damn those

646
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,540
gills are fine yeah you know it's like do you do the fishes have a but have a

647
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:51,540
a

648
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:55,300
I assume they do because they probably have a slot because I've seen I've seen

649
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,500
some of those fish poop at the aquarium and that shit looks like a bird there.

650
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:05,100
There was a we had to dissect a shark in high school me to oh you guys are

651
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:05,300
right.

652
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:10,180
That would be my a p bio class did that and the whole science part of the

653
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,980
building smelled like fish for like the rest of the year.

654
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:17,540
I had to leave the room and the lady was like oh just put vicks vapor rub under

655
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,580
your nose so you won't smell it and then I did and I had to leave because it's

656
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:25,580
like it was menthol and dead shark smell in my mouth.

657
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,420
- I had to, I had to dissect it.

658
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,100
- And I felt like I wanted to puke.

659
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:28,940
- Really?

660
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:30,060
- Yeah, they had the eyeballs on it and stuff.

661
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,660
- I did a fetal pig.

662
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,500
- That's cool.

663
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,700
- It was disgusting, dude.

664
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:34,520
- Yeah.

665
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,520
- I wish they let me dissect the damn teacher.

666
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,620
Gave me so much homework.

667
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,460
- Yep, I would have dissected.

668
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,260
- Let's see what, let me see what makes you tick.

669
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,460
- I would have removed the homework part of the brain.

670
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,300
- Oh, wine, oh, there's lots of wine in here.

671
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,260
- I'm seeing a lot of wine.

672
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,900
- And alphabet cookies.

673
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:49,740
- I'm seeing some pills in here too.

674
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,740
in alphabet cookies to it and they're in the wrong order. So who's the teacher

675
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:58,060
now? Look, oh, it's lb it. I see. I see. Yep. I opened up my teacher's stomach

676
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:01,000
and there's alphabet soup and guess what it's spelled. That's right. Lgbt.

677
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,260
How do you explain that?

678
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:09,780
Poop my teacher's brain. I want to take alphabet brain. Yeah, so I can learn

679
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
how to do the alphabet.

- It's like supposed to be a Warhammer guy.

695
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,420
- Well there's a Warhammer guy named the God Emperor,

696
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,020
and I know people call Trump God Emperor.

697
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,760

00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:26,500
- Trump, dude, it's like 200 feet tall.

701
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:27,340
- That sounds sick.

703
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,300
- Naked Trump.

704
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,840
- Whoa, yeah, that's the God Emperor, dude.

705
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,040
- Look at that, bro.

706
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,880
- I can't see it.

707
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,380
- Is that not the coolest shit you, look how big it is.

708
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,620
- As a Warhammer warrior.

709
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,460
- That's the coolest shit I've ever seen.

710
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,660
- Dude, he has a claw hand.

711
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:45,820
- Dude, I want that in my house so badly, bro.

712
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,300
- Warhammer guys are so cool.

713
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,980
Not the guys who play Warhammer, the guys in Warhammer.

714
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,820
- True.

715
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,020
- (gasps) Which one's Warhammer?

716
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,660
- That's the one where you have the little figurines.

717
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,500
It's a war game.

718
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,320
- You paint it all?

719
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,020
- A Mormon kid I knew in high school

720
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,900
was super into Warhammer, pretty funny.

721
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,740
- Yeah.

722
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,620
- Yeah.

723
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,420
- Don't they have different kinds of Warhammer, though?

724
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,740
- There's fantasy and 40K.

725
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:06,580
- Yeah.

726
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,420
- Yeah, 40K is 40K.

727
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,260
40K in the future.

728
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:10,100
- 40K is the year 40,000.

729
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,940
- Whoa, okay.

730
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:11,760
- Yeah.

731
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,600
- It's pretty cool.

732
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,660
It's just like super edgy and dumb.

733
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,700
- We should do podcasts about less 40K.

734
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:17,540
- Yeah.

735
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,360
- Yeah.

736
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,200
- Yeah.

737
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,500
- Okay, we're here now.

738
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,900
What, what are you pointing at?

739
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,740
- Oh, nevermind.

740
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,660
I thought there was like four car alarms going off.

741
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,500
- That would just indicate--

742
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,320
- Those are birds.

743
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,540
- Probably a crazy attack.

744
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,540
It's not that big of a deal.

745
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,380
- Yeah.

746
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,200
- Yeah.

747
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:34,620
- Yeah, I think today is finally 9/11 too.

748
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,460
- We've been waiting on it.

749
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,940
It is a 10 year anniversary today. Yeah. Of Hitler's birthday, April 20th. Mm-hmm.

750
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:46,920
Hitler was born on a leap year, that's why he's only 20. If you ask me, he was born

751
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:54,260
on a creep year, cause that guy gave me the creeps. Yeah. Yeah. No good. No. No. No.

752
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:59,140
Why is there not a day for different kind of drugs that aren't weed, though?

753
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:06,100
Valentine's Day for a love drug. Yeah that's true. Yeah. Talk like a pirate day

754
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:13,940
for gunpowder. Man I'm hungry for grog now. Oh I could you put me in the mood for a

755
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:18,220
cup of grog so badly. The episode of Bar Rescue with the pirates tavern. Yeah and

756
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:22,300
they have grog and the grog is like what is it like orange juice and beer? Yeah it's

757
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,820
like the most terrible. Yes the grossest thing and then that was that little shit

758
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:28,840
Her husband is like this little Italian guy,

759
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,860
I think his name's like Luciano or some shit.

760
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,900
- That doesn't sound Italian.

761
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,740
- Nah, I don't know.

762
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,940
But he's like, he doesn't taste any of his own food

763
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,580
when he cooks it, and he's like,

764
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:41,080
I'm going to make you a burnt pizza.

765
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,780
And then he cooks it for the chef,

766
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,040
and it's literally just like he pours a whole thing

767
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,820
of habanero hot sauce on the chicken,

768
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,420
and he eats it and throws up.

769
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,140
- Why would you trust an Italian man

770
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,220
with traditional pirate cuisine?

771
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,060
- Yeah.

772
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:59,860
thing. You have to trust the Portuguese. How's that not appropriation?

773
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,860
Mm-hmm yeah. The Portuguese are the only people who make good pirate cuisine

774
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:07,980
because they were going around with they had the Nino, the Nino and the Pinto.

775
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:12,300
They went around there they did all this pirate bullcrap to all these Native

776
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,940
Americans. I don't think those were pirates. They were pirates. Christopher

777
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,020
Columbus was a pirate. I don't think so. And he wasn't Italian he was actually

778
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,860
Spanish. I don't think he was I don't think he had I don't think he was a pirate though.

779
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:29,980
he's a pirate was he look up a photo of him he's wearing a pirate I think you're

780
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,780
thinking of Captain Jack's yeah I'm gonna say you might be thinking black beard -

781
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:37,660

797
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:58,020
that could be a tagline for a movie called topless pirate beach

798
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,500
topless pirate beach that's so good remember that what's that I want to make one of those

799
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:07,140
movies where you have 15 different banners on it that say unrated director's cut yeah

800
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:11,620
not safe for the theater version. Have you seen Pirate Stagnetti's Revenge?

801
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:17,060
Have you seen? No. No, I haven't. I haven't either. Me neither.

802
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:21,060
Yeah, me neither. I don't even know what that is. I've never heard of it. It is cool that

803
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:27,220
there's a lot of movies that just have one shot of boobs in them just for like kids.

804
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:29,940
Dude, the fucking-- Just for like when you're in middle school to be like,

805
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:34,020
I'm gonna go watch that movie because it probably has boobs in it based on the cover.

806
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:39,020
what's that Clark Duke movie? Well I'm thinking of like... What's that Clark Duke

807
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:44,340
movie that's about like teenagers? I don't know. And it's inappropriate? I don't

808
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:51,540
know what you're talking about. It's not Road Trip. Sex Drive. Sex Drive. Sex Drive.

809
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:57,340
That's like why you... Sex Drive Unrated they literally shot like on a different

810
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:02,380
camera and everything they put like more nudity in it for that reason. Yeah.

811
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,080
there's like your brother to get it from blockbusters yeah there's literally a

812
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:10,840
scene where it's like Clark Duke is running nude through like a cornfield or

813
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:15,960
something and then they for no reason cut to just like a great dick running

814
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:20,680
through a cornfield on a green screen doesn't sound like it's got no reason I

815
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:25,080
mean he was running through cornfield yeah he's naked yeah what are you gonna

816
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,020
do have him look like a Ken doll down there I don't think so I would hope I

817
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,220
I mean nowadays it probably would.

818
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:31,420
- Yeah. - Yeah.

819
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,140
- But back in the good old days,

820
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,540
just cock and balls is normal to watch.

821
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,060
- Yeah, so nowadays sex drive has transformed

822
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,500
into something more like drive a smart car.

823
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,200
- Yeah, they don't have a sex car anymore,

824
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:43,560
they took those away.

825
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,460
- Now they have a movie.

826
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:45,460
- What killed the sex car?

827
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:47,320
- Nowadays it was called Jexy,

828
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:50,380
but if it was in 2008 it'd be called Sexy.

829
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,700
- It would've called Sexy Woman.

830
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:52,620
- Sexy Phone.

831
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:56,020
- And it'd be about a guy who's using a woman.

832
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,780
And it'd be awesome.

833
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:04,700
Oh, yeah, I never go to the Mets game. Why are you doing at home? I'm actually having sex

834
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,460
I mean nowadays we get

835
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:08,300
We get movies like the Avengers

836
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:14,780
But if it were if they were made way back in the in the heyday of awesome sex movies are probably called TNA Avengers

837
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:20,260
Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, the Avengers xxx. No, we called TNA Avengers. I just said that

I mean people, hardworking people used to know how to work with their hands.

931
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,500
They'd spend their free time listening to car talk.

one of these windows nowadays.

988
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:27,240
Probably a screen, it's probably a LED screen showing,

989
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,920
showing what, where do people go on vacation now?

990
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,080
Afghanistan?

991
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:30,920
- Yep.

992
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:31,880
- Where's that, is that where you go?

993
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:32,720

00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,000
- You think it's beautiful there?

995
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,200
- You go to Syria?

996
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,040
- Oh my God.

997
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:36,880
- You think that's what's cool now?

998
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:38,800
- You go to Syria, you used to stay at home, eat cereal.

999
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,760
- Hey pal, you go over there,

1000
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:41,000
you're not gonna see any palm trees,

1001
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,360
you're gonna see balm trees and mushroom cloud trees.

1002
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,520
Mm-hmm and a Goomba. Yeah

1003
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:55,640
You're gonna see Goomba and you're gonna see the spiky plants there's a literal Goomba in Afghanistan

1004
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,320
Hey

1005
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:01,000
I'm gonna say I can't tell you how to I can't tell you how to live your life

1006
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:05,820
But you step into Bowser's Palace. You'll feel Bowser's malice. Mm-hmm. It's true

1007
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:09,320
You want to go to have you really want to go to Afghanistan on vacation?

1008
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:13,120
Oh, no that they have they have Monty moles there. Yeah, I guess what I'm going

1009
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:15,800
(laughing)

1010
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:19,080
I just touched down in a dry, dry desert in Afghanistan.

1011
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,400
Yep, and there's a bunch of cactus

1012
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,720
with their heads are stacked on top of each other.

1013
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,560
- Stactus?

1014
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,400
- Mm-hmm, yep.

1015
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,440
- Is that what it's called?

1016
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:27,480
I think it's called just spiky.

1017
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,240
- And you know there's a big-ass bird

1018
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:31,040
flying around with a star on him?

1019
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:34,440
And I'm getting sucked up in tornadoes and shit.

1020
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,240
I'm flying around, god damn.

1021
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,080
- Dude, it's the worst when you go to Afghanistan.

1022
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:41,460
My cousin actually was deployed to Afghanistan.

1023
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:44,740
he said the first day he got there thwomp attack.

1024
00:53:44,740 --> 00:53:47,620
- Mm-hmm, yep, he saw his best friend get flattened

1025
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,780
and walk around flipping his feet up and down.

1026
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:52,740
- He turned around, he heard ooh, and turned around

1027
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:54,340
and his best friend was flattened by a thwomp.

1028
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:57,380
- The thwomps have such a long range in Afghanistan.

1029
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,900
I mean, they could be one of the sideways thwomps

1030
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:01,260
that goes to the side.

1031
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:02,100
You could walk--

1032
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,420
- Who the fuck is the Kandahar Giant?

1033
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,260
- You could hear one from like 20 miles away,

1034
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,140
just flying at you.

1035
00:54:07,140 --> 00:54:10,140
- The Kandahar Giant was just a thwomp.

1036
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:12,500
It was not a thwomp, it was a giant.

1037
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,940
What is the story on the Kandahar giant?

1038
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:22,780
Basically they found bones that proved that Marines fought and killed a giant in a cave

1039
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,780
in Kandahar that was about 10 to 12 feet tall.

1040
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:28,260
It had red hair if you're wondering.

1041
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:29,260
It was.

1042
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:30,260
Do you believe in-

1043
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:34,180
It killed six Marines with a spear.

1044
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,180
It impaled them.

1045
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,180
It killed them.

1046
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,180
Really?

1047
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,900
And the government's covered it up because they don't want people to know about the giants

1048
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,900
in Afghanistan.

1049
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:47,860
weeks drop that I think it was cool stuff on facts cool stuff on facts dot bad

1050
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:54,060

00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,580
They found his bones, his car bones.

1054
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,580
You know who found all of them was Pajama Sam.

1055
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,580
Yeah, Pajama Sam was on a mission.

1056
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:17,580
My mom is still texting me about the shooting and stuff.

1057
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,580
You should say you're battling him right now.

1058
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,580
Yeah, well she told me I need to hide my kids, hide my wife.

1059
00:55:22,580 --> 00:55:26,580
That's funny as hell. She said that?

1060
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:27,580
She said Pat needs to...

1061

Well why, what reason would you do that?

1062
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,580
Pat needs to hide his kids, hide his wife.

1063
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,580

00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,580

- He did it.

1165
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,940
Phil pooped on the floor in the house.

1166
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:37,780
It was Phil.

1167
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,220
- It's like a human poop.

1168
01:01:39,220 --> 01:01:40,260
- Yeah.

1169
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:41,100
Phil took a bite out of the TV.

1170
01:01:41,100 --> 01:01:43,740
- It looks exactly like a cigar.

1171
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,660
- Yeah.

1172
01:01:44,660 --> 01:01:45,700
- That's not a human poop.

1173
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,420
- Phil does take human-sized poops.

1174
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:48,780
It's frustrating.

01:01:48,780 --> 01:01:51,820
