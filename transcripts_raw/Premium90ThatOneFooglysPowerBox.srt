I'm fascinated by Zoom. I'm Caleb and I'm fascinated by Zoom settings.

5
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
Y'all are just...

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm fascinated by the settings on Zoom. I'm fascinated by the green screen.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,400
I love sliders.

8
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,000
I love all the volume knobs. I love buttons.

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You're just jealous that I'm orange now.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Yeah.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,400
Yeah, look at me.

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,040
What happened? I got orange. I look like the shock top guy.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:47,040
Look at me. Oh, you got sunburn? How did you get orange? I don't know. I haven't seen the sun in so long and then I got a bunch of sun and then I found out that I do not tan even a little bit. I just get, I just turn orange.

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,760
You get you fake tan automatically?

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,400
Yeah, like that's like my body, like can't, I have no melanin receptors for it to actually

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,160
do anything, it just turns me orange.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,020
I just look sick all the time.

18
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,680
I'm extremely red right now because I drank like a shit ton of energy drinks today.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:14,880
I went out with my parents last night and they just kept feeding me drinks and I had

20
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,120
to drink, I did, you know.

21
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,240
You don't do the show. You can't be fed drinks.

22
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,960
No, they fed me. It was in my bubba.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
They fed it to me from my bubba.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,480
You don't have a bubba.

25
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
They were feeding it to me from my bubba.

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:29,480
They were drinking you drinks.

27
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:33,320
They were drinking you the drinks and they were feeding you the feeding.

28
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:39,960
Well, I'm very red right now because I realized today that there's so much niacin in energy drinks.

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,160
What's niacin?

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,160
It's something that makes you red.

31
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,160
What?

32
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,820
Yeah, it's red. It's a red

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,600
Name

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:02:02,800
Is that why you eat vitamins just to make your skin certain different colors niacin that's why a chemical compound

35
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,120
It's a B vitamin that's made and used by your body to turn food into by the way

36
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,040
I know that you're starting the Wikipedia article. There's no way

37
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,680
Radical high is the way that a person here. I'm nice and flush which appears red skin that may itch or burn

38
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,900
Are you itching and burning? No makes it easier. It doesn't make you red

39
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,040
It makes you will what color is a rash bitch. You don't have

40
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:35,280
But maybe I don't know also you're always you always get you have a red face you get flush you're Irish

41
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,240
That's what happens to you. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, it's not fucking nice up blaming niacin, dude

42
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:44,240
I my mom told me that there's a shit ton of niacin in them.

43
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:47,040
And I listen to my mom like a good boy.

44
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,340
She just said and then you went oh nice and that must make you

45
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,240
red that that yeah, I was like that must be why I'm red.

46
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,540
Look.

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,140
I don't know.

48
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,440
I my brain doesn't work correctly.

49
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,540
I am I'm pale like a vampire because I'm evil.

50
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:03,140
Yeah, I have so many holes in my head and I have so many

51
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,340
can concussions from skateboarding that it's I just tell

52
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,040
you she wear a helmet make you red.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:22,480
the

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,000
You had a minor concussion because a pickaxe hit you right on the head.

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,040
Yeah, well I was going through my mining thing. I was going through my mining era.

56
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:35,680
Yeah, your phase. I remember that. It's so annoying. You're always walking around covered in soot.

57
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
Yeah. Me and the other guys would just get down and we would spelunk.

58
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
Oh my god, dude. Yeah, it was so annoying.

59
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,960
Not too many kids. I mean, my spelunking friends, I mean, they're my ride or die.

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,720
I love them to death. It's just, you know, I had to turn my back on the spelunking community.

61
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,960
It was so annoying, dude. That was like your worst error.

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,200
Yeah.

63
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,400
You walk around and you say, "Hey, check out this ore I found."

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,480
And then you'd hold it up and I'd be really excited to see an ore.

65
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:58,800
Yeah.

66
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,320
And then you'd show me a rock.

67
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,520
I'd try to look at it, too.

68
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,320
What's what an ore is?

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,680
You're shot in your headlamp right in my eyes. I couldn't see anything.

70
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,560
And I'd say, "Turn that off." And you say, "I need to see in the caves."

71
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
And I'd say, "We're not even in the caves."

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
And you'd say, "Well, isn't Earth the biggest cave of all?"

73
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,080
I said, "That doesn't even make any sense."

74
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,400
It is.

75
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,280
It's not. It's not an Audi cave.

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,360
Okay.

77
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:37,180
of

78
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,180
didn't believe you I still don't so I don't care if you believe me or not how

79
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,700
much you take your big how much you take your big box that has a handle that

80
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,300
comes up about you know three feet I would say that big handle box with one

81
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,220
wire that goes somewhere I don't know towards some rubble perhaps yeah how

82
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:00,380
much you just take that and just just push down on it so hard okay yeah why

83
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,820
don't you push down on your handle box with the wire and the rocks yeah all

84
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,860
I'll do that. Yeah, the handle box with the wire in the rocks. Yeah, you're a miner liar.

85
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:17,740
Miner liar. Miner liar, major laser. How about that? Not major laser. No, not major laser.

86
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:23,100
Mining would be so much easier if it would just have a robot. It would be so much easier if I

87
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:30,460
had a giant drill on my hand. Yeah. Oh, God, I wish. I wish. God, I gotta get back into mining.

88
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:35,900
Dude, I've been I've been really into online mining lately. It's kind of like therapy for me in a way, you know

89
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,780
I just love he's like therapy for me. Yeah

That was like, um, it was like called like the depression machine and it looks like a remote control and it's like you press this button and it cures your depression.

101
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,260
What?

102
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,460
Have you guys ever seen that ad?

103
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,160
No, that's sick.

104
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,660
I'm going to get that though.

105
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,460
Is it like a staples button?

106
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:41,760
It looks like, I remember it looking like a remote control.

107
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,760
Let me see if I can find this ad.

108
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,960
But I want to get one of those apps so bad.

109
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
I haven't worked up the will to download them yet.

110
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,000
did you guys know one of the symptoms of depression is persistent feelings of sadness?

111
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Really?

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
No.

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I had no idea.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I thought I had it until you said that.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,480
Yeah, I thought depression just meant you get kind of bored.

116
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,040
Yeah, I thought depression is like you know that feeling when there's nothing on TV?

117
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Yeah.

118
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,440
I thought that was what depression was.

119
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,120
Or when you open the fridge and there's nothing good in there.

120
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Or you like played this game for too long and it's just kind of like you're just kind

121
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,280
of like going through the game and you're trying to like complete it 100%?

122
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,480
I found the ad here. Check this out. Oh.

123
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,720
Oh, wow. This link.

00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,280
Cam, you can't even click this link.

125
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,680
This is just a, this is a hash code for Bitcoin, dude.

126
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,320
It's a J-5th. I can't even, oh my God. If you search depression machine ad, it's the

127
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,800
second picture.

128
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Okay.

129
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,320
Somebody added a little caption that says capitalism was a mistake.

130
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,200
Oh, that's so sick.

131
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,320
I think depression can be solved with satisfying videos.

132
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,320
Absolutely.

133
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,080
A video of a guy scraping all the poppy seeds off an Everything Bagel, that's going to satisfy

134
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,600
your depression in a way.

135
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:03,240
Do you watch the toy truck restoration ones?

136
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,240
I don't watch anything.

137
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,240
I watch photography.

138
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,680
I don't watch those.

139
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,120
Like the Tonka trucks that are all rusted out and then they put some kind of magnet thing

140
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,920
on it and it like gets rid of the rust and they put it in this big like chemical bath.

141
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:20,240
They can fucking suck rust off a truck now? Yeah. Oh my fucking god dude. Oh dude you gotta

142
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:28,320
see these videos they're so good. They're oddly satisfying too. Yeah. I don't like those videos

143
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,760
man. Anytime somebody starts fucking taking a razor blade to a piece of soap I'm out bro. No.

144
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,320
That ain't me. No way. You know what I like? Oh yeah so I'm on vacation with my family

145
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:46,800
And I've accidentally gotten my entire family from ages 14 to 50 completely addicted to

146
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,160
online gambling.

147
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Yeah?

148
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Yeah, dude.

149
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,160
Wow.

150
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,520
I showed them the online Bitcoin slots the first night I was here.

151
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
Oh no.

152
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:03,240
With my entire family behind me on this laptop.

153
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,360
And it's all anybody's talked about for six days now.

154
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:11,320

00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080

161
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,920
- Yeah.

162
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
- All the fruits tumbling.

163
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,480
- You know what's oddly satisfying to me

164
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,680
is when I have like, when I look at my bank account

165
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,400
and I see like $50,000,

166
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,120
that's just like oddly satisfying in a way

167
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,240
I can't really explain.

168
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,600
There's something about it just feels right, you know?

169
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,440
- Yeah, dude.

170
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,200
- It fits exactly in there, you know?

171
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,040
The money fits perfectly.

172
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,000
- It fits perfectly into my bank account.

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,200
- That's a good point.

174
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,040
- Yeah.

175
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,840
- I keep spending too much money on coins.

176
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,680
- Not me.

177
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,360
I haven't spent a single dollar in 20 years.

178
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Just kidding. I'm not spending it on coins.

179
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,360
I bought a new skateboard for my birthday.

180
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,860
Really?

181
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,360
Yeah.

182
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,460
Oh, that's nice.

183
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,960
How was your birthday, by the way?

184
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,460
My birthday is, um, was a lot of fun.

185
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,260
We hung out on my roof.

186
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,360
It was nice.

187
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,660
Did everyone jump off?

188
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,560
No, there was one point.

189
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,360
So Joe decided to buy like a like a bouncy ball.

190
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,360
Like when you remember his infamous bouncy ball.

191
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,060
Yes.

192
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,860
Yeah, you're don't even get me started on that.

193
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,260
Yeah, it's ball.

194
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Yeah, so he bought one from the bodega.

195
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,940
Yeah, bought one from the bodega and then like I guess he threw it towards Neil and Neil

196
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:46,320
just chucked it off the roof just immediately.

197
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,320
It was really funny.

198
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Someone probably did.

199
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,760
Yeah, at the top of the Burj Khalifa.

200
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,760
Yeah.

201
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,760
Yeah.

202
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,760
In New York, New York City, Brooklyn.

203
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,760
Yeah, the Brooklyn.

204
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,760
Yeah.

205
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,760
Yeah.

206
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,800
So it reached terminal velocity pretty fast and it killed someone.

207
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,160
Stop wrinkling your head, man.

208
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,160
is that?

209
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,760
Uh, yeah, no, I, I, it's funny meeting, it's funny that I have a couple, me too, it's funny

210
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,960
that I have a couple friends like Joe in my life who are like grown men that like dog

211
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,960
toys.

212
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Yeah, it's fun.

213
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Yeah, I mean, I guess it's fun.

214
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,960
I mean, you're looking at two of the other ones.

215
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,960
Yeah, I guess.

216
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,960
Two of your other friends do that.

217
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I like.

218
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,080
Fuck, Cam, do you remember the Master of Million Ball?

219
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,080
What are you talking about?

220
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,080
Why are you so excited about a ball?

221
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Shut up.

222
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,040
ball shut up just do it you're just mad you're just mad we have fun without you with our master

223
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,760
a million balls i'm not that mad about it but does it bounce super high no no it was a ball it was a

224
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,280
ball that had like a a sensor in it and then once you like you're supposed to get to a million bounces

225
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:58,080
oh i do remember you having yeah yeah and they didn't wait did you guys also get like a like an

226
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,080
Airplane or something?

227
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:08,360
Yeah, and but the master a million ball our location

228
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:13,080
Just bought toys

229
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:17,560
Realize that I was just talking about you guys when I said that

230
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:26,020
Million ball it has Bluetooth in it. So it connects to your phone. How many bounces do we get to can you see?

231
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
Let me see

232
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,040
685

233
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,040
That's so weak, okay, so there's a bunch of other people who have a million

234
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:42,720
But going by country don't say other people like you got a million it read that read who got a million

235
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:49,160
What the hell it just it just reset it. What did you do? I don't know read every what's our user?

236
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,480
Oh fuck. Are you her username was Bernie Mac?

237
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:01,880
So it would say so everybody get the master a million app and and I send a friend request to Bernie Mac

238
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,120
Bernie Mac is a

239
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,520
Korea is the

240
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:13,060
It was we've said North Korea because you can set like the location and I think the leaderboards are different in every region

241
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,060
So we're like

242
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:18,120
Yeah, we're gonna be really get it really easy if we're in North Korea

243
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,680
We're in the government doesn't let him have master a million balls in North Korea. That's what it'll do. Do you know cities?

244
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:35,240
is

245
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,320
I mean, I mean the longer you wait the

246
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,760
Time you miss out on bouncing. They have one that has spikes on it. How about a master a hundred ball, you know?

247
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,840
Be pretty easy

248
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
Master a hundred. Yeah

249
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,960
Times put it up on the show. Oh man

250
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:57,920
We had like a strategy to like we were gonna like we had a we had a drill that we attached it to we're spinning it

251
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,360
Around and it never ever like got it never if we spin it around on this drill

252
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,640
it will shake it enough to make it no need to impact dude that's what we found

253
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:13,600
out well you have to do is you have to put it on like a I think we almost

254
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:18,400
microwaved it - yeah that Patrick got scared you have to put it on like a

255
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,640
hydraulic press it like slowly pushes it down so just keeps bouncing very small

256
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,320
bounces over and over again I think that's the only way yeah to him million

257
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
It had to be infinite bounces. That's the thing.

258
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,660
What?

259
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,660
It has to be infinite bounces.

260
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,160
It has to be a-

261
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:36,660
What has to be-

262
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,160
The only way-

263
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,160
What has to be infinite bounces? We need a million.

264
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,160
We need a machine that can make it bounce infinity.

265
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,160
[Laughter]

266
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,160
That's-

267
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
Okay.

268
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
[Laughter]

269
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
So you need- here's what you need.

270
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,160
You need a ta- you need an elevator in a tower

271
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,480
That every bounce it goes down one floor so that it doesn't ever stop bouncing

272
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:07,800
It needs to be at the top of the burj khalifa and it needs to go down like maybe like six inches every every floor basically

273
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,600
So that it just always is like, you know

274
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,120
Fucking one foot above the ground or whatever. That's what you think. We need the mario steps

275
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,440
Listen, can I read 64 the ones that somebody had a here's a review on it from uh amazon

276
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,880
don't buy this it doesn't work at all even bought a new battery and installed it only time number

277
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:33,320
goes up is when you use a screwdriver to drive to send the number to the app so this person also used

278
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,120
the same did the same thing that we did oh shit also it won't connect properly to the app nothing

279
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,480
on this worked it was a dead battery when i got it so not only did i waste the money buying it

280
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,160
but also money for an extra battery it's been nothing but a headache and a huge disappointment

281
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:50,600
to my son as this was his birthday present he was really looking forward to dude we're gonna

282
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:55,000
That's the worst birthday present of all time. I feel like, just get him a normal ball.

283
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,240
Yeah, here's the only ball that has like a chore attached to it.

284
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,000
Yeah, the only ball that also doesn't bounce because it has too much electronics inside

285
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,480
it to make the Bluetooth work. If a kid hits a million, they should earn their freedom though.

286
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,760
Absolutely.

287
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,600
They should be able to be emancipated.

288
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,000
That's true.

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,800
No matter what age, if they hit a million bounces. Because you know that that's a

290
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,000
self-sufficient person. They can do whatever they need to. They'll make anything happen.

291
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,680
The different colors of Master of Million Balls are different prices.

292
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,160
Really?

293
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,560
Really?

294
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,360
We had the green one.

295
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:27,240
Well, yeah. So, no, we had a blue one, I think.

296
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,040
No, it was green.

297
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,280
Okay.

298
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,160
Where did you buy this?

299
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,120
The green one's $9.99, the blue one's $14.09, and the red one's $10.18.

300
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,680
Damn.

301
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,360
We bought this at Walgreens.

302
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,680
I might have to go pick one up, actually. This is starting to sound really good.

303
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:46,840
Yeah. We bought this, I remember Cam had money left over on a Walgreens gift card.

304
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,600
Yeah, that's what it was. That's why we got the...

305
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,920
Well, that's why we got the Thanos copters. Yeah

306
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:57,880
You should we need a new Walgreens gift card. This should be a like a

307
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,620
social credit score type thing

308
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:07,800
Where the amount of bounces you have is like directly is a reflection of what kind of person once once I do once I get to

309
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,640
New York me and Pat are gonna do toy review vlogs together. Oh, it's gonna be great. Can I be involved?

310
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:32,360

00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,920
What are you talking about?

336
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:28,920
I was so tired and I was just like...

337
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,920
I don't know. No, we were talking about

338
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,920
the pregnant man emoji.

339
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,920
Oh, that's what we were talking about.

340
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,920
So there was a reason that I brought it up. I'm just saying that like...

341
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,920
I was just trying to say like,

342
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
oh, like, didn't Walt Disney say that

343
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,920
like the first biologically pregnant man gets all of the money in his estate?

344
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:51,560
Which was I lifted up on Snopes immediately because I felt like a fucking idiot.

345
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,060
Yeah.

346
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,160
And it's not true.

347
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:55,660
It's just-

348
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,160
Really?

349
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:56,660
Yeah.

350
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:05,300
[Laughter]

351
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:05,800
Yeah.

352
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,880
Yeah, that's not true, man.

353
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,520
I mean, if I was a millionaire, I'd say that shit.

354
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
You had one million dollars, you'd say.

355
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:16,440
If you had a million bucks, you would say, "You know what?

356
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:21,160
I got a million just so you guys know if any man gets pregnant they just have all this money

357
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,160
I

358
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:27,700
Wouldn't say that I'd say like oh like like

359
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:35,520
Right would say that got pregnant she could have I would say son

360
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,680
I'm you're only getting your inheritance if you become pregnant if my wife is pregnant

361
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,960
She gets a hundred million dollars for me. She gets a hundred cents

362
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,360
Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. I think that's kind of a kind of a fun urban legend, you know

363
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,520
It's like he was probably just making a joke. No, you know what a fun urban legend is

364
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:59,480
Mothman the fucking Walt Disney pregnant man who gives a shit

365
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:08,000
What do you mean? Mothman is not an urban legend. Yeah, it's not that's a cryptid. He's a he's a rural legend. No, it's Seattle

366
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:14,400
No, it's not. I'm sick. I'm you know, what's for Seattle bitch just like Seattle. What are you talking about?

367
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:26,840
the

368
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:32,280

00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:07,460

00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,120
people yeah that's the thing he didn't say like he just said he said just like

374
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:15,500
something that like like your stupid cousin would tell you mm-hmm like he

it's public health. It's public health. Yeah, right? Yeah. And now he has to go on Twitter

380
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:03,980
and just constantly be like, I'm sorry. I didn't, the first apology he did was like,

381
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:11,020
I didn't mean people with AIDS. I meant gay guys. Oh fuck. I meant not gay. Ah fuck. And

382
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:16,620
so he's just been fucking slipping on his. Yeah. Dude, Dua Lipa apologized for some reason.

383
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,220
Yeah. I don't even know who that is. I thought that was a lipstick brand. Yeah.

384
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:39,100
the

385
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,840
Doug a aids man as a show a show of support

386
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:51,120
Doug a his rapper ever is rapper ever. Yeah

387
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,740
It's like an Xbox live songs. All the songs are just like it's just the name

388
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,860
Just the name, but I'm not gay

389
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:07,140
Yeah, I had my way out of a PR nightmare a

390
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:15,540
His his his beats always sound really funny. Yeah. Yeah, they're always doing clown music is yeah

391
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:21,800
It's like it's like we have weird out songs playing behind his lyrics very funny beats

392
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,220
he has like trap remixes of like

393
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:28,400
Mario Kart music as is like like all of his beats sound like that

394
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:35,380
you are you're thinking of the video where somebody put his face into Mario Kart and then and then played a

395
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,720
Remix of his song with the Mario Kart music that is literally what is in your head right now? Yeah

396
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:47,180
He made oh my god, dude this

397
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:53,880
He's always he's always just rapping over the Thomas the tank engine theme song. I don't know what his deal is

398
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:59,800
Yeah, that's I mean I did like notorious BIG, but when he did that Thomas the tank engine song

399
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:05,600
I thought he got soft. Yeah, he did the party in the USA song that didn't make any sense cuz he was dead by then

400
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
Yeah, very confusing.

401
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:15,100
I don't want to, you know, I say I don't want to, but I do to bring it back to master a

402
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:19,300
million, but I'm still on the master million Amazon page.

403
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,140
They have like the info about the master million ball and it has like, you know, like a little

404
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:29,780
table and it's like, like color blue brand master a million sport type bounce.

405
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:42,220
the

406
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:45,380
I saw part of the opening ceremony, but yeah, me too.

407
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,180
I saw Ireland come out.

408
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,180
What happens with the opening ceremony?

409
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:52,620
They just what is the part where they they mourned the Israelis

410
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,820
who died at the Olympics?

411
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,140
That was the part that I saw.

412
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,420
Oh, yeah, that's how I just turned it on for that and then turned it off

413
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,260
just to show your respect.

414
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,100
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,580
That is pretty much the only part of it.

416
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:08,780
I saw, though, I I watched just the highlights

417
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,780
of the the skateboarding stuff because I want to like, you know,

418
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,280
That's the only thing I've ever paid attention to.

419
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,780
And I didn't know

420
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:18,840
what was the fucking thing?

421
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,780
Oh, there is.

422
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:23,280
I forget what skater it was, but he like fell in, like, hit his nuts

423
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,140
into the rail.

424
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,420
That's pretty funny.

425
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,480
You did that on purpose.

426
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,540
There is sound of skaters are notoriously pranksters.

427
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,620
It's not like not the way you're thinking.

428
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,080
It wasn't like he fell like on his board and like, you know,

429
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,720
like went nuts down.

430
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:41,720
He like fell down and then the him sliding on the ground.

431
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,440
he hit his nuts on a standing pole.

432
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:49,040
Sounds like he shouldn't be at the fucking Olympics.

433
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,040
Sounds terrible.

434
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,040
I think that Olympic skateboarding should be like X-game skateboarding,

435
00:26:56,040 --> 00:27:01,040
but instead of a receiving ramp where they can land,

436
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:04,040
there should just be a fire hydrant they have to hit their nuts on.

437
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:09,040
Because that's the only reason I find skateboarding entertaining at all,

438
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
is when they get really hurt.

439
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,040
It should be about ragdolling.

440
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:17,040
Yeah, it should literally be the skate to thrasher ragdoll thing.

441
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:18,040
Yeah.

442
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:23,040
Angel Caro Navarez suffers brutal groin injury in Olympic skateboarding.

443
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:25,040
Brutal groin injury.

444
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,040
That would be a good album name, dude.

445
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,040
That would be good.

446
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,040
Olympics is very...

447
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,040
Hush hush?

448
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,040
Yeah, it's very hush hush a bit.

449
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Yeah.

450
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:40,920
Yeah, no, they don't. If you post anything like even like you watching it on the TV,

451
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:45,560
um, like a clip of you watching it, the Olympics will try to take it down. It's yeah, I don't know

452
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,280
how you even watch them. I don't I don't. So I think Neil turned on the Olympics. I don't I

453
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,280
wouldn't have been able to find out how to watch it. I feel like I mean, not that I would care

454
00:27:54,280 --> 00:28:00,120
enough to try and find out with any like urgency, but I don't know what you're supposed to do.

455
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:05,800
Is it on cable? It's somewhere. It's just fucking awesome, dude. They like every time

456
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,720
We're getting destroyed in skateboarding in the USA.

457
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
That makes sense.

458
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,280
We suck at every- Japan and Brazil.

459
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:14,280
Really?

460
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Yeah.

461
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,360
Well that's okay.

462
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,280
Yuto Horigome and Kelvin Hoffler.

463
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,400
You might as well be telling me that we're getting destroyed in like rock, paper, scissors

464
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,400
in the Olympics.

465
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:27,000
Like I don't have pride for the Olympic skateboarding team.

466
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
Why not?

467
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
Because I don't give a fuck.

468
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,600
I like, I have pride for the swimming team because they, when they put the caps on they

469
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,800
look bald.

470
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,040
you seen the uh...

471
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,360
uh... what are they called

472
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,360
the the skateboarding uniforms they look sick

473
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,120
now let me look at the the they were jinkos

474
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,680
now they were let me guess big pants a shirt in a beanie

475
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:52,440
is that uh... fucking uniform a come on and i miss you

476
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:56,100
is he fucking easy from the fucking skateboarders

477
00:28:56,100 --> 00:29:01,080
but uh... they yet they look sick i wanna i saw somebody wearing it is

478
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,840
so they can't assure the b_n_a_ yet

479
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,960
That makes perfect sense.

480
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,640
But I saw somebody wearing the Team USA shirt yesterday and I was like,

481
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,040
damn, it does look really tight. It looks so cool.

482
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:17,720
It looks like a, it looks like a, like a, a loading screen for like an app,

483
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,520
like a Google app. It looks like, it looks like corporate art.

484
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,200
It looks like when you see like, that's para, that's the artist para. Para.

485
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,920
Yeah. P A R R A.

486
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,600
They should get para on it.

487
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,040
And just working on the the chromecast app because I think they could do some serious work there. Yeah, looking at this these shirts

488
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,200
You think that would be flames?

489
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,800
I think I think I would change the game yet. Yeah para

490
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,440
Yeah, I think P I e t para

491
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,640
Pipe yeah, yeah, his name's in names. I cup Pete's Pete's parpa

492
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:02,660
Each I don't give a fuck about the skate, but I do like the Olympics. Uh, I think the Olympics is cool

493
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,440
yeah, I just like that like every four years they like

494
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:09,660
They like tear down a favela or like part of the Amazon. Yeah

495
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:14,520
They build like a hockey stadium in Africa. Yeah, and then they leave

496
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:22,040
Yeah, I remember like learning that they bunch of money into this pretty cool that they like like they look like build it all new

497
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Every time yeah, like what?

google

508
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,200
and a friend named Jewel and a friend named Linda.

509
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,740
- You don't know a single parrot's name.

510
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,360
You'd have to Google every single one.

511
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,340
- And a friend named Tulio.

512
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,000
- Really?

513
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:25,840
- And Raphael.

514
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,660
- How do you know that?

515
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,500
- Raphael?

516
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,120
- And Louise.

517
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,580
- Doesn't TJ Miller play someone in one of those?

518
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,560
- Let me see.

519
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,400
- I think that's from that, that's like that.

520
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,860
That's like that two year span

521
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:41,320
where every animated movie had TJ Miller.

522
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:44,540
- No, you're thinking of how to train your dragon.

523
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:50,060
I'm thinking of a lot of movies, man. I think he's in Big Hero 6 too.

524
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:53,820
Yeah. Yeah. He just, it's funny that he was going

525
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,900
so family friendly for like two years. Yeah.

526
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,340
And then he was like... What's he in now?

527
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,700
Jail? He was in Underwater. He was in that alien

528
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,980
ripoff. It was like very recent. And it was like,

529
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:09,180
huh, like weird that he's in this. Yeah.

530
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,380
Yeah. Remember he was in Deadpool?

531
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,140
He was in Deadpool. He played Deadpool's brother or something?

532
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:20,300

534
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:31,420
that hair all about student kingdom you call a bomb you call a bomb thread in on your own

535
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:37,020
hair yeah come on fucking loser i think he had a stroke or some shit at one point that's

536
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:41,780
pretty bad which i think you know you have if you have a that's a fun thing about having

537
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,820
a stroke is like or a brain injury.

538
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:48,220
So you have some level of excusable behavior, I think.

539
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,220
You know?

540
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:53,540
Like you can start like, I think if you have a stroke, you can just never flush the toilet

541
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,340
again and like if someone gets mad at you, they're mean.

542
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,020
Pretty good position to be in.

543
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:06,140
I think what I would do if I had a stroke is I would say that I have to eat a bunch of

544
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,460
candy every day.

545
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,460
Yeah, or it will get worse.

546
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:10,460
Exactly.

547
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:31,460
also

548
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:35,140
for something that your wife did. I just had to go to a fucking doctor patient

549
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:42,180
conference again it's so annoying. He was telling my parents about all my issues.

550
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:48,620
Yeah and then he touched my butt. He touched my what? That always sucked.

551
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,100
When the doctor put his whole hand into your thingy. Yeah I only had it

552
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:57,020
like squeeze your nuts. I only had it happen like three times in my life and

553
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,500
in the most recent time, I was like 14 and it was right before I did football or some

554
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:09,700
shit and it was like the nurse from Anima of the state.

555
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,900
It was like the hottest girl ever.

556
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:15,060
And then I never went back to the doctor.

557
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,460
I think that's actually the last time I went to the doctor.

558
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,460
That scared you off?

559
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,820
Yeah, yeah, it scared me off.

560
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,460
I was like, "I don't want this, dude."

561
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:24,100
Dude, I'm too young to be fucking all these random nurses, you know?

562
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,060
I just can't do that.

563
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:45,780
the

564
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:59,660
is

565
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
airport after that because I had to leave like two hours later.

566
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,660
Oh my god, do I have a werewolf paw?

567
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Wait, hold on.

568
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,660
*laughter*

569
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
Wait, hold on. I think I'm growing horns.

570
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,660
No, I'm not. That's just my head.

571
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,660
Is there a demon's mark?

572
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,660
On my collarbone?

573
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,660
I thought tennis elbow was something different too.

574
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
I thought like a...

575
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Oh my god, I think I have elbow grease, guys.

576
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,660
Also, specifically

577
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,660
like a thing that you get from

578
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,660
like doing a specific thing that you do not do.

579
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,660
do not do.

580
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
I thought-

581
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,780
Do I have cauliflower ear from fighting in the UFC?

582
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,260
What the fuck is wrong with me?

583
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,460
I fall on my elbow a lot when I skate, so I thought that like I thought tennis elbow is

584
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:40,920
when it blows up like a tennis ball.

585
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,020
Tennis elbow is you thought it was when you have a bruise on your elbow.

586
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,100
It looks like a tennis ball?

587
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,100
Yeah.

588
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:55,060
So if a bruise on your elbow gets as big as a tennis ball, that's tennis elbow.

589
00:35:55,060 --> 00:36:04,820
That's pretty okay. Alright. Just making sure. That that's what we're doing. I'm so fucking

590
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,820
stupid.

591
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:25,020
No, you smart. You smart. Oh boy. Shit. I think I have hound's teeth. Oh my god.

592
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,020
I think I have Eye of Newt, guys.

593
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:29,020
[Laughter]

594
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,020
[Laughter]

595
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:33,020
I think I have Pole Vulture's leg. Oh my god.

596
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,020
Oh, fuck.

597
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:37,020
Oh, fuck you guys. I just contracted Hitchhiker's Thumb.

598
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,020
[Laughter]

599
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:41,020
[Laughter]

600
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
Guys, I think I have... I think I caught a Widow's Peak.

601
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,020
[Laughter]

602
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,020
I think I have a Brazilian butt lift.

603
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,020
Oh, fuck.

604
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Oh, no! I knew it was gonna happen at some point in my life.

605
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,940
But yeah, I've been thinking I'm having a heart attack. I was in the airport having all of the

606
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:01,420
symptoms of a heart attack. And then I was like, "I'm just going to get on this plane."

607
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:05,260
And I had a heart attack thing phase last year too.

608
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:05,820
Yeah.

609
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:10,460
The worst thing is when you tell somebody, "I think I might be having a heart attack." And

610
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:14,620
they say as a joke, "Yeah, you probably are because you clearly are not." And then it makes it worse.

611
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:21,900
100%. Yeah. And then I just keep having... I keep feeling like somebody's karate chopping me in my

612
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:26,780
artery and my neck and I just seem like but I'm still not going to go to the doctor.

613
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,780
Of course not.

614
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,780
I hate it so much.

615
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,780
It should work itself out.

616
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,980
Yeah, it's fine.

617
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:35,780
If I just like if I don't smoke cigarettes for enough days in a row then I'll be back

618
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:36,780
to normal.

619
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:40,140
Dude, I've been smoking so many cigarettes since Thomas got here.

620
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,020
Thomas just kept feeding me cigarettes.

621
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,780
Thomas is a demon, dude.

622
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,780
Yeah.

623
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,780
Absolute demon.

624
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,540
This is your fault, man.

625
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,540
I'm calling you in.

626
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,540
No, we're calling you out.

627
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:54,360
Yeah, you got me hooked on cigarettes again.

628
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
You fucker dude.

629
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,940
Yeah, and I'm doing it in tandem with the Juul.

630
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,940
So I'm just like, yeah that's bad.

631
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,300
No, no, you're gonna end up like him dude.

632
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:05,300
This fucking boy talks like a cartoon turtle.

633
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:07,300
Yeah, man, I gotta.

634
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:11,140
Hey dude, you want 20 cigarettes for free?

635
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,700
They're 4 cents in Texas.

636
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,420
Yeah, these are real cheap where I'm from.

637
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:18,180
Yeah, my dad hand rolls these actually.

638
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:21,180
Yeah, I'm actually gonna get you addicted to cigarettes again.

639
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:23,700
They're actually signing tobacco. It's yard mulch

640
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,660
every single cigarette

641
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:35,060
He sounds like Bobby Hill he sounds like Bobby Mountain like you didn't sound like Bobby Hill

You can burn it up, Seth.

661
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,660
Do they have one of those in Texas? I just assume they did.

662
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:52,900
A Klan? Why? Okay, why would they have a Klan museum? Who would pay for that?

663
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,820
A racist guy?

664
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,820
You think that the, that, well maybe in Texas, I don't know.

665
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,500
But I don't think that any-

666
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,900
I don't think that there is a Klan museum.

667
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,620
That you knew about that you were, like I didn't-

668
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:06,100
They even researched it?

669
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:09,860
I didn't assume that the joke would be both that you're making up a Klan museum and that

670
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,180
you wanted to go there. I thought that-

671
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:19,180
that

672
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:23,340
I want to go to the gas station in the house from Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Yeah, me too.

673
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:27,180
It's gonna take us five hours to get there from anywhere that we could.

674
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:30,940
That place is too big. We'd have to go like a two-day trip.

675
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,180
But we will do it. If we go to Texas and we don't go there, I will kill both of you.

676
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,860
I want to get Texas barbecue.

677
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:43,020
And I say that only to hold you guys accountable for making what I...

678
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:43,740
We should go to Texas Roadhouse.

679
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,500
We should go to Texas Roadhouse.

680
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:51,340
I already made it happen so that cam saw the corn sign. So this one's on you pat. Oh, I can't drive

681
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:57,660
That's again on you. Neither can cam on you. So you're yeah caleb you're gonna

682
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,780
It's on i'm gonna be enjoying myself

683
00:41:00,780 --> 00:41:05,340

684
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:10,720

685
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:16,620
on the beach and it's gonna be and then I come up behind you I got I got a chainsaw that they

686
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,820
they still have the chainsaw at the house that you really used to kill everybody.

687
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,700
That's not true.

688
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,420
You and it's true you would know if you went there with us.

689
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,020
Man I wanna.

690
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,380
Now I wanna go actually.

00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,860
I wanna go to I wanna go to Texas I wanna.

692
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:34,620
I wanna get caught in a tumbleweed like a hamster ball you know and I'll roll around the whole state

693
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:37,260
and I wanna attack people in it.

694
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,620
Yeah I wanna get a big cat.

695
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:41,420
Here's the thing, I just want to be let on the loose.

696
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,620
Uh-huh, absolutely.

697
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:49,260
I want to be, I want nothing more than a spinning newspaper article to appear on screen that says

698
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,380
Caleb on the loose.

699
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,340
I want to go psycho in the desert and see something that shouldn't be there.

700
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:53,740
Me too.

701
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,820
I want to see a cactus for the first time.

702
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,820
Do you guys want to do ayahuasca in Texas?

703
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,580
We should do ayahuasca.

704
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,380
But like not in, but like in the middle of Dallas.

705
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:02,940
Yeah.

706
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:03,580
In Austin.

707
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,220
In the streets.

708
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:04,620
Yeah.

709
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:06,380
In like a comedy club in Austin.

710
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,660
Yeah, yeah.

711
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:12,620
some comedy club that like doesn't want us there the worst trip of all time yeah

712
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,260
mm-hmm in the middle of the show do I I don't I'm not sure what ayahuasca even

713
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,780
is I believe it might be a cactus I think yeah I think no you're thinking of peyote

714
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:23,500
I think it's a cactus actually I think they're both cacti I think they're both

715
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:30,420
cacti I thought ayahuasca was like like similar to ayahuasca is a spell from

716
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:36,060
Harry Potter yeah yeah it was cuz it's spell that if you go to Peru and pay

717
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:48,420
a

718
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
It comes in a can.

719
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:53,420
It's a drink from a can that you find in the woods.

720
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
Okay.

721
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Just making sure.

722
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:58,020
It's like it's made of a vine and a shrub.

723
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,020
Yeah.

724
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:04,980
Speaking of cans in the woods, you guys ever seen Power Rangers Turbo the movie?

725
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,980
No.

726
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,100
Is that the one where they jump out of the plane in the beginning?

727
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,100
No, that's Mighty Morphin.

728
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,100
That's the only one I've seen.

729
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:14,060
Power Rangers Turbo is the one where they're driving cars and they have to save this little

730
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:15,340
like dwarf guy.

731
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,500
Yeah, it was you.

732
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:37,220
a

733
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:51,100
is

734
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:55,500
like salt and pepper shakers that look like the Green Bay Packers and it'll be $500,

735
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:59,580
but you can get them. But it's the only place in the world you can shop and have things

736
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,860
delivered to your house.

737
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,860
True.

738
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:02,860
No, it's worth it.

739
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,860
It's the only place that you can get something delivered.

740
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:13,500
Yeah. It's like, "Fuck, dude. I want to go get a new microwave, but I really don't want

741
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:17,940
to have to go to Walmart. So I guess I have to book a flight and order it on SkyMall and

742
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:18,940
have it sent to my house."

743
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:24,760
you know this would I just think about the about mining again you know they

744
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,460
should do they shouldn't minecraft should do a thing where they send you any ores

745
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:35,340
that you mine in real life I think that would revitalize it I think like if you

746
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,700
like you could have like a special chest that if you get diamonds they have to

747
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:42,940
send you diamonds or if you get coal they have to send you coal I'd be like

748
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:47,220
an augmented reality yeah exactly and you could also scan in minerals that you

749
00:44:47,220 --> 00:45:08,220
find

750
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:36,420
like

751
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,740
other than that it's all gold bars and diamonds for me.

752
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:40,660
- But you already made a billion dollars,

753
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,620
why are you still working to do a contract work?

754
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:47,040
- I wanna use my money to help spread freedom

755
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,940
across the world and shut down people

756
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:54,580
who are doing things in countries that we don't, you know?

757
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,540
- Yeah, I guess I would be so good

758
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:58,660
at being a stupid billionaire,

759
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,220
I would buy the coolest shit.

760
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,420
- What would you buy?

761
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,980
- Dude, I'd have like a pinball machine.

762
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,060
that's a- *laughs*

763
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,060
*laughs*

764
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,060
dude, that- you're trying to-

765
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,060
this is like a- a fucking like vanity fair

766
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,060
article that's like

767
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,060
"this billionaire's going crazy

768
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,060

769
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:22,060
yeah, yeah the front- front

770
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,060
page of like national inquirer

771
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:26,060
"billionaire playboy

772
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:28,060

"stays up all night"

776
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:36,060
*laughter*

777
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:38,060
Way past the bedtime.

778
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,060
Stays up on school night, playing Pumbaa Machine.

779
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,060
Dude, I would straight up,

780
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:44,060
I would have like a, if I had like a blank

781
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,060
check type of scenario,

782
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:48,060
I would just buy everything from blank check.

783
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,060
Yeah, just buy like

784
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:52,060
Sock 'Em Boppers or whatever.

785
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,060
Yeah. And a best friend that's an

786
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:56,060
adult, like he has in that. Yeah.

787
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,060
And like, doesn't he have a wife too?

788
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,060
I don't remember if he has a wife.

789
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:02,060
I do think that he's 11 years old, so

790
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:08,060
hope that that's a movie that I thought I never saw then saw a scene from it and was like oh I've

791
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:14,620
seen this like a hundred times. Yeah it's dictated every part of like how you live I feel like is

792
00:47:14,620 --> 00:47:20,140
blank check. Yeah that's a very influential movie on your brain whether you want to admit it or not.

793
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:25,020
Yeah I would I would agree I don't yeah I honestly I'm thinking about I honestly can't think of like

794
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:30,300
a single giant thing that I would buy if I was like I would buy a bunch of stuff that I would

795
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:35,740
just buy like a lot of stuff but I can't think of like what would be like a big like million

796
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:40,140
dollar like I can't think of anything. I think I would just I think you probably just buy

797
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:45,100
houses like everywhere right? Yeah that's the move right? If I had billions of dollars

798
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,060
I would probably I would just buy a lot of cool shirts. Yeah I would just buy like all

799
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:55,180
the movies I wanted or something. Movies that I wanted or like cool shirts or like cool

800
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,660
pants or or cool shoes.

801
00:47:57,660 --> 00:47:58,660
What about the socks?

802
00:47:58,660 --> 00:47:59,660
Cool hats.

803
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,660
Yeah, what about cool socks?

804
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:01,660
Cool socks or cool car.

805
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:02,660
Cool hot socks or something?

806
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,660
You know what?

807
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,660
I would get another chain.

808
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:05,660
Nice.

809
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,660
We already have one.

810
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,660
Why do you need two chains?

811
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,660
Well, I can switch them out.

812
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:09,660
I can wear one chain with certain outfits and then, you know.

813
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,660
So you need like a different color chain?

814
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:11,660
Yeah.

815
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:12,660
Okay.

816
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,660
Maybe like a red chain.

817
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:14,660
Oh, that'd be so badass.

818
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:15,660
You'd look like the devil so hard.

819
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:16,660
Yeah.

820
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:17,660
Oh, that'd be so badass.

821
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:18,660
You'd look like the devil so hard.

822
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,660
Yeah.

823
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:20,660
Oh, that'd be so badass.

824
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,660
You'd look like the devil so hard.

825
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:22,660
Yeah.

826
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,660
Oh, that'd be so badass.

827
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:42,140
so

828
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,140
I don't know. A tattoo?

829
00:48:44,140 --> 00:48:48,140
I'd probably get the best haircut ever.

830
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,140
I'd get some good food.

831
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:52,140
Oh my god.

832
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,140
You would probably get some good food.

833
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,140
I would, yeah.

834
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:58,140
Personal shift.

835
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:02,140
If I was a billionaire, Uber eats every night.

836
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:06,140
Saying everything that's just like within, I could already do that pretty much.

837
00:49:06,140 --> 00:49:11,140
You will not believe how many times I would go to Sweetgreen a week, dude.

838
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:12,140
dude if I was a billionaire.

839
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,140
Well this is the conversation.

840
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:15,520
Dude if I was a millionaire I would get a new skateboard.

841
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,820
This is the conversation of like people who think they're going to get rich from like

842
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,980
playing Monopoly on McDonald's cups.

843
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:25,580
Like this is exactly that type of rich that I want to be.

844
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:31,120
I want to be like the dumbest person ever who lucks into having 20 million dollars and

845
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:37,340
then just buys like, yeah, like has like 10 shoes and I think that's a lot of shoes.

846
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,340
Yeah.

847
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,340
Be so awesome dude.

848
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:45,660
like a washer and dryer and just putting it in my apartment being like, "I don't know,

849
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:50,540
I don't have to spend money downstairs anymore. It's just in the middle of my living room. It's

850
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:56,940
not hooked up to anything." One of those rich people who renovates their house but has no idea

851
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:01,180
what they're doing. So it's like an extra room that's on the second floor that's just being held

852
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:03,100
up by poles. Yeah.

853
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,140
Oh, dude.

854
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:04,700
Yeah.

855
00:50:04,700 --> 00:50:08,380
So many of those in New Hampshire, just rich people just expanding their houses.

856
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,340
It's so awesome. It's the coolest kind of rich person has to have. Stuff where they're like,

857
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:20,940
they like look into a house and there's like an ornate, beautiful, priceless fireplace and they

858
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,540
just paint over it because they don't like it. And stuff like that.

859
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,020
Cool.

860
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:31,820
There's a building I saw, like a house that had just like, what's it called? One of those stone,

861
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:35,100
it's not like a, not called a crow's nest. Is it like a-

862
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,700
Like a-

863
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:37,660
A widow's walk?

864
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:44,860
not a widow's walk but like it looked like part of a castle was like a turret

865
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:57,180
no it's like a moat a drawbridge to their house that's something if I did have a

866
00:50:57,180 --> 00:51:00,820
billion dollars I would draw bridge yeah have a drawbridge I would I get it

867
00:51:00,820 --> 00:51:04,220
Aubrey is it the thing that's like it comes up out of the top of the house

868
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:05,820
there's like a fence around it.

869
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:07,460
It's like and you can like walk around

870
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,520
kind of like a steeple.

871
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,600
That's a widow's walk.

872
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,460
I'm pretty sure it looked like

873
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:13,960
they had a steeple attached to their house.

874
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:16,100
That's pretty fucking cool.

875
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:16,560
Yeah.

876
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,600
And the rest of the house

877
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,140
just looked like shitty, like,

878
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:19,900
you know, McMansion.

879
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,700
Yeah, but like just fucking steeple

880
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,500
in like the corner.

881
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,000
It is so funny to see like

882
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,880
like houses in like situate and stuff.

883
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,880
They'll have like they have like a widow.

884
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:30,380
They have like a widow's walk up there.

885
00:51:30,380 --> 00:51:31,540
But it's like you guys also

886
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,980
like have a balcony and you're like

887
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:35,380
like five minute walk from the beach.

888
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:36,680
Like why would you ever want to go?

889
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,780
Yeah, that's like like five by five feet.

890
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:40,480
You can't do anything up there.

891
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,780
I think it's like those are just your yard.

892
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:45,680
Those are just there for your like wife to kill herself on.

893
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:46,080
Exactly.

894
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:49,080
That's why it's called a widow's on a rainy day.

895
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,680
It's literally so after you die, your wife can stand up there

896
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:51,980
and go.

897
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,880
Yeah.

898
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,080
Oh, I'm so hungry.

899
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,380
But what was the fucking thing?

900
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,880
I was like, oh, oh, it's like a the make like they'll have

901
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,220
like windows like for like circular

902
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,440
windows and then just one like big yeah

903
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,540
that like you could see everything in the

904
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,100
house oh god I fucking I love looking at

905
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:13,820
McMansions just cuz it like they have

906
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:15,660
the worst rich people have the worst taste

907
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:18,140
yeah rich people have no taste at all

908
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:20,260
except for the rich people who get

909
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:21,780
mansions like that and then build like

910
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,580
stores in their basement like fake

911
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,060
stores that's the oh cool shit ever like

912
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,380
the yeah that's rental place exactly and

913
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:30,500
there's one where there's ones where

914
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:31,980
like they have their basement looks like

915
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:38,300
a street and they have storefronts on either side. That rocks so much, dude.

916
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:40,780
That's actually what I would do.

917
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:46,220
Yeah. That's my childhood dream is to live in a house that has small houses inside it.

918
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,540
That's your childhood dream?

919
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:51,420
Is to walk downstairs and go to an Applebee's?

920
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:55,420
If I was 10 years old and I got billions of dollars and they were like, "You can build

921
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:58,620
whatever house you want," that's what I would do. I would have something that's supposed to be

922
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:05,340
outside in my house. I put like a roller coaster in like the living room or something. I'd get it.

923
00:53:05,340 --> 00:53:12,140
I'd build like a house with like traps all over the place. Yeah. That's like a piranha tank under

924
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:17,660
like a single tile in the kitchen or something. Yeah. And if somebody steps on it, that'd be

925
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:23,660
pretty funny. I would. Yeah. I'd have paintings you could look through the eye holes in. I would

926
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:28,060
just make a haunted house, I guess. Absolutely. Yeah. I think that's probably the best move. I

927
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:34,140
I would just make like a shot like a spot for spot remake of the Remington mansion where

928
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:39,380
there's just like oh yeah that shit's sick dude yeah I found the I found the

929
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:43,300
backpack from Power Rangers yeah it doesn't look cool at all what are you

930
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:47,180

00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:01,300

934
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:05,540
is just in there and he just takes it out so that yes you got to see it maybe

935
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:10,420
you gotta see it to believe it so it's a backpack that you can store something in

936
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:18,740
and then get it out of no I think it is Cameron this is where you power box

942
00:54:43,620 --> 00:54:47,780

946
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:55,780
no fucking way!

947
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:57,780
and watch this

948
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:59,780
well it can't be real water then

949
00:54:59,780 --> 00:55:01,780
oh my god

950
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:03,780
yeah that's not a powerbox

951
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,780
but then Cameron

952
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,780

953
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,780
oh my god it tastes exactly like my nalgene plastic

954
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,780
oh that's so good

955
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:13,780
yeah

956
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:15,780
that's not a powerbox

957
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:17,780
You have a power box.

958
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,780
That's so fucking stupid.

959
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,780
Um...

960
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:24,780
The only device like that that I ever really wanted was the microwave from Spy Kids that invents food.

961
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:27,780
Oh, dude, that thing was so fucking sick.

962
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:31,780
See, that's where we differ, 'cause I wanted the alien hybrids.

963
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,780
The mutant animals.

964
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:34,780
What?

965
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,780
Whatever they were. The snake lizard.

966
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,780
The spider monkey.

967
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:39,780
That is pretty cool, too. I did want the tiny one.

968
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:40,780
Oh, for Spy Kids 2.

969
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,780
Yeah.

970
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:42,780
Oh, okay.

971
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,780
Well, we can talk about the whole series, is one thing.

972
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,580
talking about well because sir I got confused because I thought you're

973
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:51,020
talking about Spy Kids 1 and I thought you're talking about Floops Fuglies.

974
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:56,140
No, those I would not I want those. I mean yeah they're saying it there I mean listen

975
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,260
to what they say backwards they're saying he's a madman help us save us you

976
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:04,460
know I mean yeah I don't want to hear that all the time. Nah dude that's a you

977
00:56:04,460 --> 00:56:07,940
wouldn't hear that until you reversed it so it's okay. It's true but you know

978
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,620
sometimes yeah it happens. Sometimes it happens that you hear stuff backwards.

979
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,620
I guess I want the mom from Spy Kids too.

980
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,620
Yeah, you know you're walking backwards into a room?

981
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:18,620
Yeah.

982
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,620
What did you say?

983
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,620
The mom from Spy Kids would be a pretty good invention to have as well.

984
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,620
What was the mom from Spy Kids name?

985
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,620

00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,620
oh man shes old now

1006
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:08,620
put that away

1007
00:57:08,620 --> 00:57:12,940
No, no, no, but you're we know away put your google, you know away. No, it's not a good

1008
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:15,740
We know it is a good we know but it is not a good we know

1009
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:18,220
What's your?

1010
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:23,780
Little way. Yeah, I love that. I actually I want that grandpa from Spy Kids way more. Yeah

1011
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:30,660
Yeah, he's funny as hell Ricardo. Yeah from Fantasy Island. No, it's for Spy Kids

1012
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:34,460
See, I'll did you know here's my here's my fan theory dude

1013
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:37,460
Spike's three was actually all that was an episode of fantasy.

1014
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,340
And that was his fantasy all along.

1015
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:41,660
You know, he was like, it's three people's fantasies.

1016
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:44,540
His fantasy is that he can't walk in any walks.

1017
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:47,240
Yeah. Wouldn't that be awesome?

1018
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:49,160
That would be cool, actually.

1019
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,200
Yeah. I think we've talked about it before, but it's just so funny.

1020
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:55,800
And we talk about like a hundred times and he just runs away.

1021
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,340
It's like one of the best moments in movie history, I would say.

1022
00:57:59,340 --> 00:58:01,960
Yeah. Is being able to walk and then just running.

1023
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:05,960
I wish that there was videos of people, you know when they, when they, it's like somebody's

1024
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,920
first time walking, they hook them up to some like robot legs, and they just jump out of

1025
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,600
the window and they just sit there gone forever.

1026
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:19,320
It's like all they've ever wanted to do is run away from their fucking family and the

1027
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,320
doctor.

1028
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:25,200
So they just keep running.

1029
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,200
It's pretty cool.

1030
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,040
I would love to watch Spy Kids 3 with you guys when I get to the city.

1031
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,680
Oh me too, that'd be great.

1032
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:37,160
remember soon yeah do you remember I was just looking at the Spy Kids Wikipedia

1033
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:42,640
and Tony Tony Shalhoub is in that movie and his character's named is Alexander

1034
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:49,580
minion yeah and he kills it by the way yeah oh dude the lube he's doesn't he

1035
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:57,260
become a flugel he becomes a flugel a flugel a flupes flugel yeah he becomes

1036
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,260
one he isn't at the start but then he gets all these fingers in his damn head.

1037
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:05,980
His head turns to hands. I know I've definitely mentioned it before but Elijah Wood in Spy Kids

1038
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:10,940
3 like if you look at his character's name the guy and you look at the guy on the Spy Kids wiki

1039
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:16,140
there's like a quote section and there's the first quote is "I'm the guy" and it says the guy when he

1040
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:21,420
introduces himself and then the last quote is "cake" the guy right before his death.

1041
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:28,140
Dude, if I was a flugli, I feel like you'd pull a lot of strange.

1042
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,640
I feel like you would know.

1043
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:30,640
Yeah.

1044
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:32,780
If I was a flugli, I think you'd know.

1045
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:36,860
Dude, I think you would be cleaning up at the bars with a flugli.

1046
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,940
You walk up to a woman, you say, "Listen, take a look at me.

1047
00:59:39,940 --> 00:59:42,060
Tell me you don't want to go meet me in the bathroom right now."

1048
00:59:42,060 --> 00:59:43,060
Yeah.

1049
00:59:43,060 --> 00:59:44,060
"Look at all these fucking...

1050
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,060
Hey, bring 50 of your friends.

1051
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:46,060
I don't give a fuck.

1052
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,060
Let's go."

1053
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,700
I got two other heads you can kiss.

1054
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,700
That's right.

1055
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,100
You can kiss two heads at once.

1056
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,980
You ever been with a guy with two heads before?

1057
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:53,980
Bitch, I'm built like a fucking...

1058
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:57,760

1059
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,660
Jump on any part of my body you're gonna have a good time

1060
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:10,540
That's nasty. It's right, but it's nasty - no flu Glee would ever say that shit. Come on

the internet.
